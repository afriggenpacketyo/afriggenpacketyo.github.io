          <p>Nvidia announced quarterly earnings and revenue that surpassed Wall Street expectations, forecasting sales growth to remain above 50% for the upcoming quarter. Despite the strong performance driven by high demand for its AI infrastructure, the company's stock fell in extended trading. This was primarily because its data center revenue, while up 56% year-over-year to $41.1 billion, fell slightly short of analyst estimates for the second consecutive period. The company also approved an additional $60 billion in share repurchases. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>Los Angeles Mayor Karen Bass has appointed Board of Public Works president Steve Kang to serve as the city's chief film liaison, fulfilling a long-standing promise to the entertainment industry. The appointment comes over two and a half years into her term, a delay that had frustrated industry advocates concerned about production jobs leaving the city. The liaison role is designed to help film and television productions navigate city bureaucracy and streamline the process of shooting in Los Angeles. The move is part of a broader effort to support the local industry amid a production slump.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>The UK government is expanding its funded childcare program, offering working parents in England 30 hours a week for children as young as nine months old starting in September. While the move aims to alleviate high childcare costs, which average over £12,000 annually, concerns remain about the sector's capacity to meet demand. Nurseries and childminders face financial pressures, as government funding rates often don't cover their full costs, leading some to charge extra for essentials. There are also warnings of a need for tens of thousands of new staff and places to sustain the expansion.</p>

          <h2>Charity Provides Direct Cash Payments to Prevent Homelessness</h2>

          <p>A UK charity named Greater Change is providing direct cash payments to people at risk of homelessness, an approach it says is highly effective. The organization has given out nearly £700,000 this year, with recipients using the funds for essentials like rent deposits and clearing debts to secure housing. The charity reports that 86% of the people it has supported have moved into stable housing, saving taxpayer money on more intensive support later. This model aligns with international studies showing that direct cash grants to homeless individuals are typically spent responsibly and lead to positive outcomes.</p>

          <p>Author Jacqueline Wilson is releasing "Picture Imperfect," an adult sequel to her acclaimed 1999 children's book, "The Illustrated Mum." The new novel revisits the character Dolphin, now 33, who is still caring for her mother Marigold, who has bipolar disorder. Wilson describes writing the book as both the easiest and hardest of her career, as she felt a deep connection to the characters but also faced fan expectations. She emphasizes her commitment to portraying the uncomfortable truths of life, including the realities of being the child of a parent with mental illness.</p>

          <p>China's electric vehicle industry has rapidly become a dominant force, overtaking Tesla as the world's largest EV manufacturer and surpassing Japan as the top auto exporter in 2023. This growth, fueled by government subsidies and a strong battery supply chain, has been led by companies like BYD. The success of Chinese brands is now putting pressure on established automakers in Europe and the U.S., leading to new tariffs and regulatory scrutiny. Analysts predict China will produce four out of every ten cars globally by 2030, cementing its position in the market.</p>

          <p>Following Nvidia's strong earnings report, CNBC's Jim Cramer argued against the idea that the market is in an artificial intelligence bubble. He asserted that the massive AI spending by major tech companies like Amazon, Microsoft, and Google is a worthwhile investment, not a repeat of the dot-com bust. Cramer noted that today's major AI investors have competent leadership and strong balance sheets, unlike many companies from the dot-com era. He suggested that even if there is a downturn, a handful of clear winners will emerge and ultimately thrive. (not investment advice)</p>

While he did not rule out a future gubernatorial campaign, Padilla emphasized the importance of the redistricting effort, which he framed as a necessary counter to Republican attempts to "rig the system." His name has recently emerged as a possible candidate in a wide-open field to succeed Governor Gavin Newsom, who is term-limited.</p>

          <p>Google and Fox have reached a short-term contract extension, preventing Fox channels from being removed from the YouTube TV streaming service. The previous agreement was set to expire just days before a highly anticipated college football game between Texas and Ohio State, which will air on Fox. The dispute centers on the fees Fox is charging for its content, which Google claims are "far higher" than what comparable partners receive. While the extension averts an immediate blackout for YouTube TV's 9.4 million subscribers, the duration of the new deal was not specified.</p>
