        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Germany may face tax hikes and increased debt as NATO allies consider a higher defense spending target. The country currently spends around 2% of its GDP on defense, but a potential increase to 5% would require additional billions of euros annually. Experts suggest that financing these expenses would likely involve loans, budget cuts, and tax increases. While Germany has implemented fiscal measures to accommodate defense expenditures, concerns remain regarding the long-term impact on the federal budget and potential conflicts with EU fiscal rules.

          <p>Chinese researchers have developed the 'Meteor-1,' a highly parallel optical computing integrated chip, achieving a theoretical peak computing power comparable to advanced Nvidia GPUs. This development marks a significant milestone in using light for simultaneous operations, promising hardware acceleration for AI and data centers. The chip's creation comes as traditional electronic chips face physical limitations, and US export controls restrict China's access to advanced semiconductors. The advance highlights the growing importance of optical computing as a critical future direction due to its advantages in speed, bandwidth, and power consumption.</p>

          <p>Oil prices fell nearly 3% after Iran's missile strike on a U.S. airbase in Qatar resulted in no reported casualties, easing fears of escalating conflict in the Middle East. The market sell-off indicates investor confidence that the situation will de-escalate following U.S. strikes on Iran. Some analysts suggest President Trump has successfully escalated to de-escalate the conflict, adopting a "peace through strength" strategy. Trump thanked Iran for providing early notice about the strike, enabling the prevention of any loss of life, and called for peace negotiations.</p>

          <p>President Trump's decision to involve the U.S. in the conflict between Israel and Iran may have resulted in a ceasefire, which he claims could lead to lasting peace. The ceasefire follows U.S. airstrikes on Iranian nuclear facilities and a retaliatory missile strike by Iran on a U.S. base in Qatar. While the situation remains volatile, Trump's intervention could be seen as a successful step back from a wider regional conflict. Iranian officials indicated a willingness to halt attacks if Israel ceased its aggression, suggesting a potential de-escalation.</p>
