          <p>Daniel Levy, the Premier League's longest-serving chairman, has stepped down from his role at Tottenham Hotspur after nearly 25 years. His tenure was marked by significant off-pitch achievements, including the construction of a new billion-pound stadium and consistent European competition qualification. However, he also faced persistent criticism from fans over a lack of on-field success, with the club securing only two major trophies during his leadership. The decision for his departure was reportedly driven by the club's ownership, who believe new leadership is needed to achieve greater sporting success, signaling a new era for the organization.</p>

          <p>This opinion article argues that Chinese President Xi Jinping's call for a new global order centered on the Global South represents a significant challenge to U.S. dominance in international politics. Speaking at the Shanghai Cooperation Organisation summit, Xi advocated for "true multilateralism" to counter what he termed "hegemonism," a message that resonates with developing nations frustrated with existing Western-led institutions. Many countries in the Muslim world and the Middle East are recalibrating their foreign policies, strengthening ties with Beijing for economic relief and political leverage. This shift signals a potential paradigm change in global governance, moving toward a more multipolar world.</p>

          <p>Alphabet's autonomous driving unit, Waymo, announced it will begin testing its driverless robotaxis at San Jose Mineta International Airport this fall. This marks the first California airport where the company will operate, with plans to offer paid rides to the public later in the year. The expansion is part of Waymo's broader strategy to integrate its services into major transportation hubs, following a successful launch at Phoenix Sky Harbor International Airport. San Jose's mayor expressed support for the initiative, highlighting its potential to improve transportation for visitors, especially with major sporting events scheduled in the area.</p>

          <div class="timestamp">2025-09-04 17:27:03 EDT</div>
        </div>
        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Mortgage interest rates have shown a gradual but steady decline throughout 2025, providing some optimism for prospective homebuyers and those looking to refinance. The average rate for a 30-year fixed mortgage has dropped by more than half a percentage point since January, resulting in lower monthly payments and significant potential savings over the loan's lifetime. While rates remain higher than the historic lows seen a few years ago, their downward trajectory is an encouraging sign. Further decreases could be influenced by future Federal Reserve policy decisions and cooling Treasury yields, though any additional drops are expected to be incremental. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>The United States has officially designated Los Lobos and Los Choneros, two of Ecuador's most powerful criminal gangs, as foreign terrorist organizations. The announcement was made by Secretary of State Marco Rubio during a visit to Quito, where he pledged security assistance and drone technology to support Ecuador's fight against organized crime. This designation allows Washington to freeze the gangs' assets, target their associates, and share intelligence for operations. The move comes as Ecuadorean President Daniel Noboa continues his declared "war" on the cartels, which are linked to a surge in violence and cocaine trafficking through the country.</p>

          <p>The departure of Daniel Levy as Tottenham Hotspur's executive chairman prompts an analysis of his complex legacy. While praised for transforming the club's financial standing and infrastructure, including a new state-of-the-art stadium, his nearly 25-year tenure is also defined by a lack of major trophies. Many fans grew frustrated with what they perceived as a focus on profit over on-field glory, leading to frequent protests. Levy's reputation as a shrewd negotiator often overshadowed the club's inability to secure consistent success, creating a contentious relationship with the fanbase that ultimately defined his time in charge.</p>

          <p>Argentine prosecutors have charged the daughter and son-in-law of a fugitive Nazi officer with obstruction of justice for attempting to hide a valuable painting stolen during World War II.

After police raids failed to locate the painting, the couple surrendered it to authorities.

          <p>The '$1,000 a month rule' is a financial guideline designed to help individuals calculate the savings needed to generate a steady retirement income. Based on the 4% withdrawal rule, it suggests that a person needs approximately $240,000 to $300,000 saved to safely withdraw $1,000 per month for 30 years without depleting the principal. This formula helps transform abstract savings goals into concrete targets based on desired monthly income. While not a perfect measure, it serves as a practical tool for retirement planning, highlighting the importance of early saving and the power of compound interest. (not investment advice)</p>
