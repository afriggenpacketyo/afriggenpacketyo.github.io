        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>German Chancellor Friedrich Merz has urged Europe to increase its defense spending and reduce its reliance on the United States, citing the need for strategic independence and resilience against hybrid threats. Germany aims to allocate 2.4% of its GDP to defense this year, with plans to increase it to 3.5% by 2029. A recent poll indicates that nearly two-thirds of Germans support the idea of a European nuclear deterrent independent of the US, reflecting a shift in public opinion. The call for increased defense spending comes amid growing concerns about the reliability of American support for European security.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Compass has filed a lawsuit against Zillow, claiming that Zillow's new rule, which bans home listings from its platform if they appear on other services for more than 24 hours, violates antitrust laws. Compass argues that this "Zillow ban" leverages Zillow's market dominance to stifle competition by preventing agents from posting homes on other platforms first. Compass's CEO stated that no company should have the power to ban listings simply because they don't follow its business model, emphasizing the importance of consumer choice. Zillow maintains that the claims are unfounded and that its policy ensures fair access to listings for all buyers. </p>

The NTC will feature multiple pitches, indoor facilities, and other amenities designed to inspire youth players and foster connections within the sport. The location in Atlanta was chosen for its climate, proximity to Europe, and strong corporate support, with the opening timed to coincide with the upcoming World Cup.</p>

          <p>The video game Death Stranding 2 casts players as couriers in a post-apocalyptic world, delivering essential goods to isolated communities, highlighting anxieties about technology's impact on human intimacy and obsolescence. The game explores themes of digital connectivity, remote work, and the potential for technology to alienate individuals from both each other and their physical selves. The game underscores the importance of physical bonds and tangible experiences in a world increasingly dominated by virtual interactions. The game ultimately suggests that while technology can unite, it also risks stripping interactions of humanity.</p>

          <p>The proportion of children growing up in large families (three or more children) in Germany has increased in recent years, primarily due to immigration since 2015. Families with a migration background are nearly twice as likely to have three or more children compared to families without foreign roots. While larger families are slightly more common in western Germany, the overall trend reflects a demographic shift influenced by immigration patterns. The data comes from the annual microcensus, which surveys a small percentage of the German population.</p>
