          <p>Prince Harry is scheduled to return to the UK, sparking speculation about a potential meeting with his father, King Charles III, amid signs of a potential thaw in their strained relationship. Recent meetings between their communication teams and the conclusion of Harry's security-related legal case suggest a shift in mood. While a reconciliation with his brother, Prince William, appears distant, this visit is seen as the most significant opportunity in years for the father and son to mend their public and private rift.</p>

          <p>Researchers have discovered that a combination of a compound found in green tea and a form of vitamin B3 may help protect the brain against Alzheimer's disease. In lab tests on mouse neurons, the substances boosted an energy molecule that is crucial for clearing out damaging protein clumps associated with the neurodegenerative condition. While the findings are preliminary and have not yet been tested in humans, they suggest a potential new dietary approach to treating age-related cognitive decline.</p>

          <p>Singer Sabrina Carpenter has responded to the controversy surrounding the original cover art for her album "Man's Best Friend," which depicted her kneeling at a man's feet. In a recent interview, she expressed surprise at the backlash, stating the image was intended to explore themes of control and submission from a woman's perspective. Amid divided fan reactions, Carpenter released an alternative cover, but she maintains that her artistic choices are meant to provoke thought and are not made to please everyone.</p>

          <h2>Review: 'Caught Stealing' Presents a Gritty New York Thriller That Lacks Substance</h2>
          <div class="timestamp">2025-08-29 17:35:20 EDT</div>
        </div>
        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>The new crime film "Caught Stealing," directed by Darren Aronofsky, attempts to capture the gritty atmosphere of late 1990s New York City. The movie stars Austin Butler as a bartender who becomes entangled in the criminal underworld, but the review suggests his performance is too charming to be convincing as a down-on-his-luck character. While the film successfully evokes a nostalgic aesthetic, it ultimately falls short by prioritizing style over a compelling plot and well-developed characters, resembling a disposable thriller from the era it depicts.</p>

          <p>Following her third-round loss at the US Open to Elena Rybakina, British tennis player Emma Raducanu commented on the challenge of competing against the world's best. She believes that top-ranked players are especially motivated and "have a point to prove" when they face her, often raising their game to another level. Raducanu acknowledged that while she is improving, her recent Grand Slam defeats to elite players highlight the gap she still needs to close to consistently compete at the highest echelon of the sport.</p>

          <p>Malcolm Kenyatta, a Democratic state representative from Pennsylvania, is undertaking a 105-mile solo march from Philadelphia to the state capitol in Harrisburg. The five-day journey is a protest against severe budget cuts to the Southeastern Pennsylvania Transportation Authority (Septa), which he blames on Republican inaction in the legislature. Kenyatta aims to draw attention to the impact of the funding crisis on students, workers, and elderly residents, framing his protest as a "time-honored American tradition" of marching for critical public services.</p>

          <p>A federal appeals court has blocked the Trump administration's attempt to terminate Temporary Protected Status (TPS) for approximately 600,000 people from Venezuela. The Ninth Circuit panel unanimously ruled that the plaintiffs are likely to succeed in their claim that the administration acted unlawfully, as the governing statute does not permit the Homeland Security secretary to unilaterally vacate a prior TPS extension. This decision upholds a lower court's injunction, allowing Venezuelans covered by the program to continue living and working in the U.S. while the legal challenge proceeds.</p>

          <p>The U.S. stock market finished August with strong monthly gains, though the final week ended on a slightly negative note, breaking a four-week winning streak for the S&P 500. The market's performance was influenced by major earnings reports, notably from Nvidia, whose stock dipped despite a positive outlook, pulling the broader market down. Additionally, the Federal Reserve's preferred inflation gauge showed persistent price pressures, though markets still anticipate an interest rate cut at the Fed's September meeting.

          <p>A woman unexpectedly gave birth to a baby girl at the Burning Man festival in Nevada after experiencing a "cryptic pregnancy," with no symptoms or awareness that she was expecting. The parents, who were unprepared for the birth, were assisted by fellow festivalgoers who happened to be medical professionals, including an obstetrician and a NICU nurse. The baby, named Aurora, was born premature and was airlifted to a hospital in Reno for neonatal intensive care, creating a miraculous but challenging start for the new family.</p>

          <p>The U.S. Food and Drug Administration has approved the next generation of COVID-19 vaccines but has significantly changed its guidance on who should receive them. Previously available to nearly everyone over 6 months old, the updated shots are now limited to individuals at higher risk for serious complications. This includes people aged 65 and older and those with other underlying health problems. This shift in strategy marks a new phase in the public health approach to the virus, moving toward targeted protection for the most vulnerable populations.</p>
