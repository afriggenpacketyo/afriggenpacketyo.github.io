          <p>Dan Wang describes China as an "engineering state," highlighting its focus on STEM fields and infrastructure development. China's rapid construction of subways, high-speed rail, and other public works contrasts with the slower pace of similar projects in the United States. The country's emphasis on electrical, nano-, computer, solar, and space engineering reflects its national security priorities. Wang contrasts China's engineering-focused approach with the United States' focus on law. </p>
