          <p>The Powerball jackpot has escalated to an estimated $1.7 billion for the upcoming Saturday drawing, after no ticket successfully matched all numbers in Wednesday's $1.4 billion grand prize. This colossal sum represents the third-largest jackpot in U.S. lottery history, boasting an estimated cash value of $770.3 million before taxes. The current streak of 41 drawings without a winner ties a game record, underscoring the formidable odds of 1 in 292.2 million. This ongoing excitement around such a massive prize continues to captivate the nation, with the jackpot potentially growing even larger.</p>

          <p>Asia-Pacific markets generally experienced an uptick on Thursday, influenced by a tech-led rally on Wall Street that propelled the S&P 500 and Nasdaq Composite, even as broader economic concerns persisted. Major indices like Japan's Nikkei 225 and Australia's S&P/ASX 200 recorded gains, driven by strong tech performance and favorable domestic economic data, respectively. However, Hong Kong's Hang Seng and mainland China's CSI 300 saw declines. Global bond markets remained a focal point, with U.S. 30-year Treasury yields exceeding 5% after a federal court decision on Trump-era tariffs introduced uncertainty regarding future government revenues.

          <p>A new survey by the Chicago Council on Global Affairs and The Carter Centre indicates that ordinary Chinese citizens hold nuanced and flexible views on U.S. rivalry and their nation's alliances with Russia and North Korea. Contrary to American perceptions that China seeks to displace the U.S. from global leadership, nearly half of Chinese respondents favor a "shared leadership role," implying a desire for peaceful coexistence. This article highlights that while Chinese public opinion is optimistic about their country's future, economy, and military, there's also skepticism about U.S. interest in collaboration.
