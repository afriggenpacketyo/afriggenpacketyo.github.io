        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>China's industrial profits experienced a notable recovery in July, with year-on-year declines narrowing significantly to 1.5%, following months of steeper drops. This improvement signals the positive impact of Beijing's intensified campaign against intense price wars, which had previously eroded corporate profitability. Government policies, focused on restoring consumer price levels, have particularly benefited the raw-material manufacturing sector, despite ongoing challenges for consumer goods producers. This article highlights how these early effects of the "anti-involution" strategy are beginning to emerge, easing financial strain on firms and contributing to a more stable economic outlook, though concerns about overall demand and deflation persist.

Guo prioritizes appreciating assets and strategic negotiations, even when making high-value purchases.

          <p>Clayton Kershaw continued his remarkable season, pitching five innings of one-run ball to secure his fifth consecutive victory as the Dodgers defeated the Cincinnati Reds 6-3. Despite acknowledging a lack of "life on the fastball" and a diminished velocity, the 37-year-old left-hander showcased veteran craftiness, relying heavily on his slider and strategic pitch mixing to retire 14 consecutive batters. The Dodgers' offense provided ample support, highlighted by a four-run rally in the sixth inning, further solidifying their position in a tight division race. This article celebrates Kershaw's ability to adapt and dominate, maintaining his status as a pivotal player.</p>

          <p>In the first half of 2025, business travel to the United States experienced a slight increase, establishing it as the top global destination for corporate travelers, according to an SAP Concur report. This trend contrasts with a concurrent decline in leisure travel to the U.S. during the same period, reflecting shifting travel patterns. The report indicates that 15% of all business air travel bookings were directed to the U.S., significantly surpassing other leading destinations. This article suggests that despite broader negative travel sentiment and ongoing global economic uncertainties, corporate interests continue to robustly drive travel to the U.S., affirming its role as a crucial business hub.
