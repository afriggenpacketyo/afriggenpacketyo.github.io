          <p>British band Wolf Alice has achieved an unprecedented feat with their fourth consecutive Mercury Prize nomination for their latest album, "The Clearing," a record unmatched by any other artist. Singer Ellie Rowsell expressed a mix of anxiety and gratitude for the prestigious recognition, while guitarist Joff Oddie emphasized the band's profound belief in a well-crafted album as one of the highest forms of art. The band, known for its evolving sound from folk to alt-rock and now embracing 70s FM pop, is also serving as ambassadors for National Album Day. Despite some initial critical reception to their recent stylistic shift, the band views "The Clearing" as their boldest evolution yet, showcasing newfound confidence and playfulness in their creative output.</p>

          <p>Maiwand Banayee, a 45-year-old former Taliban fighter now residing in the UK, shares his compelling journey from being radicalized as a vulnerable teenager in a Pakistani refugee camp to becoming an NHS diabetes coach. His book, "Delusions of Paradise," vividly details how he was lured by promises of martyrdom and the vision of a "pure Islamic society." Banayee, who actively promoted Taliban propaganda and enforced their strict laws in 1990s Kabul, eventually began questioning the movement's inherent cruelty after witnessing public executions. He now passionately warns young people to "question everything," expressing deep concern about a potential rise in extremism in Afghanistan since the Taliban's 2021 return to power.</p>

        </div>
        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Many individuals experience "autumn blues," characterized by feelings of tiredness, lethargy, and isolation, often linked to reduced sunlight affecting serotonin and melatonin levels. Counsellors recommend proactive strategies such as maintaining a balanced diet, engaging in regular exercise, and spending time outdoors, even in colder weather. Light therapy and sunrise alarm clocks are also suggested to help regulate circadian rhythms. Some individuals, like Lotts Dlandu, actively plan social calendars and avoid working from home to combat isolation, while others embrace the season by romanticizing coziness with warm drinks and blankets. For those experiencing significant mood drops, which could indicate Seasonal Affective Disorder (SAD), the NHS advises consulting a GP for professional guidance.</p>

          <p>President Donald Trump completed a "routine yearly checkup" at Walter Reed National Military Medical Center, a follow-up visit occurring just six months after his annual physical. His physician, Captain Sean Barbabella, issued a memo stating that Trump underwent advanced imaging, laboratory testing, and preventive health assessments, yielding "exceptional" results. Notably, his cardiac age was determined to be approximately 14 years younger than his chronological age of 79. The president also received his annual flu shot and an updated COVID-19 booster vaccination, with the White House aiming to dispel recent rumors about his health that arose after public appearances showing swollen ankles and a bruised hand.</p>

          <p>A detailed timeline outlines the monthslong, intensive efforts by senior U.S. officials, including special envoy Steve Witkoff and Jared Kushner, to broker the complex Israel-Hamas ceasefire and hostage release deal. President Trump's 20-point peace plan involved extensive negotiations with key regional players like Qatar, Egypt, and Turkey, culminating in Hamas accepting a new ceasefire proposal in August. Significant diplomatic breakthroughs included an apology from Israeli Prime Prime Minister Netanyahu to Qatar for a previous airstrike and the strategic decision to separate the deal into two phases, with the initial phase focusing on hostage and Palestinian prisoner exchanges. This intricate diplomatic process aims to establish an "almost permanent ceasefire" and address broader governance issues in Gaza, representing a critical, albeit fragile, step towards de-escalation and regional stability.</p>

          <p>Maria Corina Machado, a prominent leader of Venezuela's pro-democracy movement, expressed that being awarded the Nobel Peace Prize sends a powerful message to her fellow Venezuelans: "we are not alone" in their "huge, epic fight" against an authoritarian regime. The Norwegian Nobel Committee recognized Machado for her unwavering commitment to "keeping the flame of democracy burning amidst a growing darkness" for over two decades. This prestigious award is expected to provide a measure of protection for Machado, who has been living in hiding due to threats from President Nicolas Maduro's government. She thanked President Trump for his administration's pressure on Maduro's regime, highlighting the growing international support for Venezuela's struggle for freedom.</p>

          <p>An Oklahoma high school girls basketball team voluntarily returned its division championship trophy after their coach, Brendan King, discovered a critical scoring error upon reviewing game tape. Despite seemingly winning the game 44-43 on a buzzer-beater, King realized the true score should have been 43-42 in favor of the opposing team, Apache High. Although league rules dictated the score was final once the game concluded, the Academy of Classical Christian Studies team unanimously decided to appeal their own victory, prioritizing integrity and sportsmanship over a contested title. The league agreed, and the championship was rightfully awarded to Apache High, whose coach lauded the Academy's exceptional display of moral character.</p>

          <p>Quaker, a 15-year-old military horse from the Household Cavalry Mounted Regiment, has officially retired to a sanctuary after sustaining injuries during a dramatic runaway incident in central London. Quaker was one of five horses spooked by unexpected construction noise, bolting through the city and colliding with several vehicles. While four other horses from the incident have successfully returned to active duty, Quaker suffered bleeding and a small break, necessitating surgery and a permanent change of pace. His rider, who broke his back, has also made a full recovery and is back to riding, allowing Quaker to enjoy a peaceful retirement at The Horse Trust.</p>

It marks the largest single maritime drug seizure in the Asia-Pacific region in recent years, highlighting effective international law enforcement collaboration. Representatives from the anti-drug agencies of the three nations have since met to further strengthen cooperation and intensify efforts to dismantle sophisticated international drug trafficking syndicates operating in the region.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>AstraZeneca has struck a deal with the Trump administration to offer discounted prescription drugs to Medicaid patients at "most-favored-nation" prices, matching the lowest rates found in other developed countries. This agreement, similar to one with Pfizer, aims to make medicines more affordable and helps AstraZeneca avoid threatened 100% tariffs on pharmaceuticals. While President Trump claimed the deal could drastically cut prices, experts caution that Medicaid already receives the lowest prices in the U.S., suggesting modest additional savings. The initiative also involves listing drugs on a new government website, "TrumpRx," though its broad impact on consumers with insurance remains uncertain and is viewed by some as a branding opportunity.

While passports have been issued in the King's name since 2023, this change formally incorporates his chosen royal cypher on the cover, replacing Queen Elizabeth II's.

          <p>The BBC's immensely popular show "The Traitors," now featuring a celebrity edition, captivates viewers by exploring the darker aspects of human nature through lying and deception. Psychologists suggest the show mirrors everyday life, where individuals constantly try to discern truth from falsehood, and highlights how deception is an inherent part of human interaction. The game effectively exposes the "illusion of co-operation" within groups and how self-interest can quickly surface under pressure, making it a compelling social experiment. The celebrity version adds an intriguing layer as viewers project pre-existing beliefs onto the stars, who must maintain consistent personas under intense scrutiny, testing their acting skills and ability to deceive.</p>
