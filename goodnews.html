          <p>Everton has officially signed 19-year-old midfielder Tyler Dibling from Southampton in a substantial deal worth an initial £35 million, with an additional £5 million in add-ons. Dibling, an England Under-21 international, has agreed to a four-year contract running until June 2029, marking him as manager David Moyes' eighth summer acquisition. He expressed his belief that Everton is the "perfect match" given the club's current direction, its new stadium, and the passionate fan base, calling the decision a "no-brainer." This strategic signing reflects Everton's commitment to strengthening its team with promising young talent.</p>

          <p>Warren Buffett informed CNBC that Berkshire Hathaway is not looking to acquire another railroad, despite a recent meeting with CSX CEO Joseph Hinrichs. Instead, discussions focused on enhancing freight rail efficiency through cooperation between Berkshire's BNSF Railway and CSX, building on a recently announced coast-to-coast partnership. This clarification caused CSX shares to fall over 4%, with Union Pacific and Norfolk Southern also experiencing declines, while Berkshire Hathaway dropped about 1%. The news dispelled earlier speculation that Berkshire might join the takeover fray after Union Pacific's $85 billion bid for Norfolk Southern, highlighting the market's sensitivity to Buffett's strategic pronouncements.

          <p>The Los Angeles Police Department announced the arrest of several alleged South L.A. gang members, identified as the "Rich Rollin’ Burglary Crew," who are accused of nearly 100 home and business break-ins, primarily on the city’s Westside since 2022. The crew reportedly targeted high-end jewelry, purses, and guns, selling the stolen goods for cash. Authorities emphasized these were "crimes of greed," not necessity. Mayor Karen Bass lauded the operation as a "major win" for the city. This crackdown follows concerns about a surge in home invasions, with police warning residents against displaying wealth on social media, which could make them targets.</p>

          <p>Major League Baseball's Baseball Writers’ Association of America (BBWAA) announced the creation of a new Relief Pitcher of the Year award for each league, starting in 2026. This decision acknowledges the significant transformation of the relief pitcher role, which has evolved into a vital position dominated by elite throwers. Historically, relievers have been underrecognized in major awards, with only a few winning Cy Young or MVP honors since saves became an official statistic in 1969. The new awards aim to provide proper recognition for these specialists, potentially honoring more than just ninth-inning closers given the increasing value of setup relievers in modern baseball.</p>

          <p>British tennis player Cameron Norrie advanced to the second round of the US Open after his opponent, Sebastian Korda, retired due to injury. Norrie was leading 7-5, 6-4 when Korda, who had recently returned from a three-month shin stress fracture lay-off, decided to end the match early after experiencing an abdominal issue. Norrie expressed sympathy for Korda, acknowledging his talent and previous wins against him. Despite feeling "nervous" about the early start time, Norrie secured his spot to face either Francisco Comesana or Alex Michelsen in the next round, marking his debut at Flushing Meadows in 2017.</p>

          <p>Ismael “El Mayo” Zambada, a co-founder of the notorious Sinaloa cartel, pleaded guilty in a New York court to federal racketeering and criminal enterprise charges, acknowledging the immense harm illegal drugs have caused. Zambada, 77, who once oversaw a vast drug trafficking network of heroin, methamphetamine, and fentanyl into the U.S., was arrested in July 2024 under disputed circumstances, claiming he was kidnapped rather than surrendered. His plea deal follows the U.S. decision not to seek the death penalty and comes amidst the Trump administration's increased pressure on Mexico to combat cartels. This marks a significant development in the ongoing efforts against organized crime.</p>

          <p>SpaceX is preparing for the tenth test flight of its massive Super Heavy-Starship rocket, following three catastrophic failures earlier this year and a scrubbed launch attempt on Sunday. The mission aims to rigorously test the Super Heavy first stage and send the Starship upper stage on a sub-orbital trajectory to the Indian Ocean, deploying Starlink simulator satellites and performing an in-space engine restart. This flight is crucial for restoring confidence in the program, especially given concerns about the moon lander variant's readiness for NASA's planned 2027 lunar mission. While challenges remain, many observers remain optimistic about SpaceX's ability to overcome these hurdles.</p>

          <p>The U.S. has confirmed its first human case of New World screwworm, a flesh-eating parasite, in a Maryland resident who recently traveled from El Salvador. While the risk to public health is considered very low, this detection raises significant concerns for the U.S. livestock industry, which successfully eradicated the pest in 1966. The article explains screwworms are fly larvae that feed on warm-blooded animals, causing painful infestations and potentially high mortality if untreated. The USDA is implementing a comprehensive plan, including building a sterile fly production facility in Texas, to combat the northward spread of the parasite from Mexico.</p>

          <p>This article provides guidance on when and how to request a temporary pause on credit card payments, a crucial option for Americans facing record-high credit card debt and interest rates. Lenders typically offer relief for temporary financial hardships like job loss, medical emergencies, or natural disasters, often approving requests when a borrower's situation is expected to improve within three to twelve months. Early communication with the credit card company and providing documentation are key to approval. If a request is denied, alternative debt relief options include debt management programs, balance transfer cards, debt forgiveness, or personal loans. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>New data indicates that great white sharks are spending more time in the cooler waters off New England and Canada's Atlantic coast, leading to increased sightings in areas like Maine, where they were once rare. Scientists attribute this shift to a greater availability of seals, the sharks' primary prey. While the presence of these predators, popularized by "Jaws," is growing, experts emphasize that fatal shark bites remain exceedingly rare. Maine's Department of Marine Resources is actively monitoring activity to understand distribution, and despite a fatal attack in 2020, most shark species in these waters pose minimal threat to humans.</p>
