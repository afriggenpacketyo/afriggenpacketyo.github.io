          <p>Despite missing current earnings and revenue estimates, Oracle's stock surged after the company released exceptionally strong forward-looking financial projections. Analysts expressed shock at the massive growth trajectory, which is primarily driven by the company's booming cloud infrastructure business and new artificial intelligence contracts. Oracle forecasts its cloud infrastructure revenue will jump 77% this fiscal year to $18 billion and continue to grow exponentially in subsequent years. The company's remaining performance obligations, a measure of contracted future revenue, soared to $455 billion, signaling a seismic shift in its market position. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>Swedish online lender Klarna priced its initial public offering at $40 per share, surpassing its initial target range and valuing the company at approximately $15 billion. The company, known for its "buy now, pay later" services, successfully raised $1.37 billion, with the majority of the funds going to existing shareholders. This strong market debut on the New York Stock Exchange reflects a growing investor appetite for technology IPOs. The offering serves as a significant test for Klarna as it attempts to rebrand as a broader digital retail bank amid recently widening net losses.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>A new blood test capable of detecting key biomarkers for Alzheimer's disease is being trialed across the UK, offering hope for a revolution in how the condition is diagnosed. The test, which identifies the rogue protein p-tau217, is expected to increase diagnostic accuracy from around 70% to over 90%, providing a significant improvement over current cognitive tests. Led by University College London, the study will involve over 1,000 patients at NHS memory clinics to assess its effectiveness in a real-world clinical setting. If successful, this relatively inexpensive test could become a standard diagnostic tool, improving early detection and access to emerging treatments.</p>

          <p>New Mexico has announced it will become the first state in the nation to offer free, universal childcare to all residents, regardless of income. This groundbreaking initiative expands an existing program that already provided no-cost care to families earning up to 400% of the federal poverty level and has been credited with reducing poverty rates. The governor's office stated that the program supports family stability, workforce participation, and the state's economic prosperity. Public health experts have praised New Mexico's community-driven approach, calling it a potential model for the rest of the country.</p>

          <p>Democrat James Walkinshaw has won the special election for a congressional seat in Northern Virginia, a victory that further narrows the Republican majority in the U.S. House of Representatives to 219-213. Walkinshaw, a Fairfax County supervisor and former chief of staff to the late Rep. Gerry Connolly, defeated Republican Stewart Whitson. The district is considered reliably Democratic, and the race was heavily influenced by local concerns over federal job cuts initiated by the Trump administration. This win continues a trend of Democrats overperforming in special elections this year, adding pressure ahead of a looming government shutdown deadline.</p>

          <p>Markets in the Asia-Pacific region opened mostly higher on Wednesday, with investor attention focused on the upcoming release of August inflation data from China. Economists anticipate a slight year-over-year decline in the consumer price index, which could provide insight into the health of the Chinese economy. Key indices in Japan and South Korea saw early gains, following a positive session in the United States where all three major benchmarks closed at all-time highs. The upcoming U.S. inflation reports are also being closely watched for their potential influence on the Federal Reserve's interest rate decisions. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>The public bus system in Akron, Ohio, received the national mass transit system of the year award following a major overhaul that led to a 24% increase in ridership. Led by a CEO who regularly rides the buses to gather passenger feedback, the Metro system redesigned its routes, improved frequency to every 15 minutes on key lines, and expanded service to seven days a week. This transformation was achieved without a budget increase and has been praised as a model for public transit. The changes have been critical for local residents who rely on the service for daily commutes and essential errands.</p>

The IPO plan comes as Beijing actively supports domestic champions in artificial intelligence and robotics, aiming for mass production of such machines by 2025.

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>President Donald Trump has signed a memorandum aimed at increasing the enforcement of transparency laws for pharmaceutical advertising, particularly on social media platforms. The administration plans to send approximately 100 cease-and-desist letters and thousands of warnings to companies to ensure they provide accurate information and clearly disclose potential risks and side effects. The initiative targets promotions by social media influencers who may not identify as paid spokespeople or follow regulatory guidelines. This action, while described as the strongest possible, stops short of the blanket ban on TV drug ads that HHS Secretary Robert F. Kennedy Jr. had previously advocated.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>The UK's Financial Conduct Authority (FCA) has proposed a plan that would remove the current £100 cap on contactless card payments, potentially making them unlimited. The change would allow individual banks and card providers to set their own limits, bringing card payments in line with digital wallets on smartphones, which already have no cap. While the move reflects the evolving nature of consumer payments, it has raised concerns about fraud and theft. The FCA stated that providers would be responsible for fraud losses and would only permit higher-value transactions deemed to be low-risk.</p>

This move is notable given China's strict 2021 ban on the trading and mining of decentralized cryptocurrencies like Bitcoin.

        </div>
        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>CNBC's Jim Cramer highlighted analysis from Goldman Sachs suggesting that investors are continuing to reward companies that aggressively repurchase their own shares, even as the overall pace of buybacks has slowed. According to the analysis, a group of "buyback aristocrats"—companies that have consistently reduced their share counts over the past decade—are outperforming the broader market. Cramer noted that these generous buyback programs, such as those from Apple and Wells Fargo, can signal management's confidence in the company's future. This strategy of draining excess share supply from the system can provide an edge for investors. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>England delivered a commanding 5-0 victory against Serbia in their World Cup qualifier, providing manager Thomas Tuchel with his most impressive night since taking charge. The team's masterclass performance, achieved without key starters like Jude Bellingham and Bukayo Saka, silenced the hostile Belgrade crowd from the outset. Players such as Noni Madueke and Morgan Rogers excelled in their absence, staking strong claims for more regular inclusion. The decisive win not only puts England in a strong position for World Cup qualification but also presents Tuchel with a welcome headache of increased competition for starting positions.</p>
