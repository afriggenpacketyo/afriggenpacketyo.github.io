          <p>Following devastating floods in early July, officials in Kerr County, Texas, have significantly lowered the number of unaccounted-for individuals from nearly 100 to just three. This reduction is attributed to extensive follow-up work by local, state, and federal agencies who verified that most people initially reported as missing were safe. The update brings a measure of relief to a community that saw over 100 fatalities from the flooding, which affected the entire state.</p>

          <p>The animated sitcom "Family Guy" has targeted Prince Harry and Meghan Markle for a second time in a recent episode, two years after its initial jab at the couple. The new joke compares their marriage to historical disasters, prompting a cutaway gag where an animated Prince Harry reacts with annoyance. This follows a 2023 episode that satirized their multi-million dollar deals and departure from royal duties, continuing a trend of animated shows parodying the couple's public life.</p>

          <h2>UK Government to Introduce New Law Targeting Mass Attack Preparation</h2>

          <p>UK Home Secretary Yvette Cooper has announced plans for a new law to "close the gap" in prosecuting individuals who plan mass attacks without a specific ideological motive. The proposed legislation, prompted by last year's Southport attack, would allow police to intervene and charge suspects for preparatory acts, similar to existing counter-terrorism laws. This measure aims to address the growing threat from lone, violence-obsessed individuals who may not fit the legal definition of a terrorist.</p>

          <p>Los Angeles Dodgers manager Dave Roberts gave superstar shortstop Mookie Betts a day off to help him mentally reset from a persistent season-long slump. Betts's batting average has fallen to a career-low .241, and his performance has not improved since the All-Star break, prompting the manager to intervene. The move is intended to help Betts, who is unaccustomed to such struggles, to clear his mind and work on his mechanics without the pressure of a game.</p>

          <p>Rising "kiss-and-fly" charges at major UK airports, some as high as £6 for a ten-minute stop, are causing drivers to park in nearby lay-bys to wait for arriving passengers. This practice is an attempt to circumvent fees that have increased at more than half of the country's busiest airports in the last year. Critics, including drivers and taxi operators, call the charges "extortionate" and "greedy," though airports maintain that free drop-off zones are available further from the terminals.</p>

          <p>A debate is underway in the UK over proposals to shorten the traditional six-week school summer holiday and redistribute the break time throughout the year. Proponents argue it could reduce learning loss for students, ease childcare burdens for working parents, and potentially lower holiday costs. However, opponents, including many teachers, express concern about losing essential recharge time and the potential for a compressed, more expensive holiday season.</p>
