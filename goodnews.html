          <p>Former New York Jets linebacker Mo Lewis is defending the 2001 tackle that injured Patriots quarterback Drew Bledsoe and inadvertently launched Tom Brady's career. Lewis argues that Bledsoe, who had just signed a massive contract as a pocket passer, was responsible for the situation by choosing to scramble with the ball. The hit, which was legal, is often cited as a pivotal moment in NFL history, leading to Brady's two-decade dynasty. Lewis, who has largely avoided the spotlight since retiring, states the play is irrelevant to him personally, despite its historical significance and the frustration of being primarily remembered for that single event.</p>

          <p>Conservation scientists are analyzing the DNA of the 800-year-old Druids Oak in Buckinghamshire to uncover the genetic secrets of its remarkable longevity and resilience. The project, a collaboration between The Woodland Trust and the Arboricultural Association, aims to understand how ancient oaks survive for centuries through climate change, disease, and other threats. By studying the genomes of around 50 of the UK's most notable ancient oaks, researchers hope to identify key genetic traits. This knowledge could be vital for selecting the most robust trees for future planting, helping to restore Britain's woodlands and the diverse ecosystems they support.</p>

          <p>For 42 years, radio host Bev Johnson has been a cornerstone of WDIA in Memphis, the first radio station in the United States programmed entirely by and for the Black community. Since its format change in 1948, WDIA has served as a vital source of music, news, and information, covering civil rights issues and promoting Black-owned businesses when mainstream outlets would not. Johnson, known as 'your girlfriend' to her listeners, continues this legacy by providing a platform for local experts to offer free advice on legal and medical issues. The station also played a crucial role in fundraising to preserve the Lorraine Motel, which is now the National Civil Rights Museum.</p>

The vaccine will be administered in two doses at 12 and 18 months, combined with the existing MMR jab, and a catch-up program will be available for older children. Previously, parents had to pay for the vaccine privately. Officials hope the program will protect children from the rare but severe complications of the virus, such as encephalitis and stroke, while also reducing the economic impact caused by parents taking time off work to care for sick children.</p>

          <p>Zhao Changpeng, the founder of cryptocurrency exchange Binance, believes Hong Kong has the potential to become a major global hub for virtual assets, but its success depends on the speed of its regulatory actions. In an interview, Zhao, also known as CZ, noted the Hong Kong government's clear intent to embrace Web3 technologies and its capacity for rapid change. He suggested that one immediate improvement would be to expand the limited number of cryptocurrencies currently permitted for trading on licensed exchanges. He argued that allowing a wider range of tokens, similar to the model in Japan, would be a crucial step toward competing with established markets like the U.S. and UAE.</p>
