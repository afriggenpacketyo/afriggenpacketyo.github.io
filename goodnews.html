          <p>The U.S. Senate is proceeding with a crucial vote on a comprehensive tax and spending package championed by President Trump, despite uncertainty over whether it has enough support to pass. The legislation, which includes tax cuts and funding for immigration and defense, has been a top priority for the administration. However, disputes over provisions like Medicaid spending cuts and a debt ceiling increase have created divisions within the Republican party. The White House has intensified pressure, stating that a failure to pass the bill by the July 4th holiday would be the "ultimate betrayal" of promises made to the American people.

          <p>An estimated 180,000 to 200,000 people participated in the Budapest Pride march, defying a government ban in a powerful display of support for LGBTQ+ rights. The event, which has come to symbolize resistance against Prime Minister Viktor Orban's repressive policies, proceeded after Budapest's mayor declared it a municipal event, bypassing the police ban. The march drew significant international support, with European officials and diplomats in attendance. The massive turnout is seen as a rebuke to Orban's government, which has increasingly restricted civil liberties and targeted the LGBTQ+ community under the guise of protecting children.</p>

The decision also follows increased federal scrutiny of synthetic dyes, including the recent ban of Red 3 from the food supply.

Head coach Andy Farrell praised the team's attacking ambition but noted a high penalty count in the first half, which he attributed to over-eagerness.

After exiting his car, the man found himself just feet from the bear and, upon trying to re-enter his vehicle, discovered the door was locked. With the bear approaching, he quickly improvised by diving headfirst through the open driver-side window, pulling his feet in just as the animal rounded the car.

          <p>An ocean research team may have achieved a major scientific breakthrough by capturing what is believed to be the first-ever footage of a colossal squid in its natural Antarctic habitat. The elusive creature, the world's largest invertebrate, has never been observed alive in the deep ocean before. The footage was captured by a deep-sea camera attached to a polar tourism vessel, a novel approach to expanding marine research. While experts are still working to confirm if the animal is a juvenile colossal squid or another rare species, the video provides invaluable data for scientists studying the mysterious ecosystems of the Southern Ocean.</p>
