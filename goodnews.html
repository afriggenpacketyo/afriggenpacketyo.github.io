          <p>The UK's communications regulator, Ofcom, has initiated formal investigations into four companies operating 34 pornography websites for potentially failing to implement new mandatory age-verification measures. These rules, part of the Online Safety Act, are designed to prevent children from accessing adult content. This action is part of a broader enforcement effort by Ofcom, which has already opened probes into other platforms for similar violations. The move has been welcomed by the government as a key step in child protection, despite some public backlash and criticism regarding the measures' effectiveness and potential for circumvention.</p>

          <p>Billionaire hotel tycoon Surinder Arora has submitted a rival proposal for the expansion of London's Heathrow Airport, challenging the plan put forth by the airport's owners. The Arora Group's "Heathrow West" plan features a shorter third runway, which it claims would avoid the costly and disruptive need to reroute the M25 motorway. The company estimates its project would cost under £25 billion and could be operational by 2035, arguing it presents a more efficient and less risky alternative. This marks the first time competing bids have been invited for the airport's expansion, introducing a new dynamic to the long-debated project.</p>

          <p>A late-stage trial by Eli Lilly showed its diabetes drug Mounjaro was not inferior to its older treatment, Trulicity, in reducing major cardiovascular events for patients with Type 2 diabetes and heart disease. While meeting this primary goal, Mounjaro also demonstrated superior benefits in other areas, including a 16% lower rate of death from any cause and greater kidney protection. These results strengthen the case for Mounjaro as a first-choice treatment, especially as Trulicity's patent expiration approaches in 2027. The company plans to submit this new data to global regulators to potentially expand the drug's approved uses. (not investment advice)</p>

His remarks come as an August 12 deadline approaches for the two nations to resolve their ongoing tariff dispute. Bessent characterized recent negotiations in Stockholm as tough but productive, though he noted that some technical details still need to be resolved and that President Trump must personally approve any final pact. The U.S. has been leveraging tariffs to address concerns over China's trade practices and its relationships with Iran and Russia. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>In the wake of deadly flash floods along the Guadalupe River in Texas, one resident has started a remarkable recovery effort for lost personal items. Dondi Persyn created a Facebook page, "Found on the Guadalupe River," to collect, restore, and reunite sentimental belongings with their owners, many of whom lost everything in the disaster. The initiative has successfully returned thousands of items, from jewelry to family mementos, providing a small measure of comfort to a community grappling with immense loss and trauma. The effort highlights a powerful grassroots response to a tragedy that claimed at least 135 lives.</p>

          <p>The World Meteorological Organization has officially confirmed a new world record for the longest single lightning flash, which stretched an astonishing 515 miles (829 km) across the U.S. Great Plains. The event, recorded in 2017, extended from east Texas to near Kansas City, Missouri. This and other recent records have been made possible by advanced space-based mapping technology from orbital satellites, which can measure lightning events over much larger areas than previous ground-based sensors. Scientists say these findings underscore the fact that lightning can travel vast distances from its parent thunderstorm, reinforcing safety warnings for people outdoors during storms.</p>

          <p>An unprecedented recall vote targeting 24 opposition Kuomintang (KMT) lawmakers in Taiwan has failed, with none of the legislators losing their seats. The campaign, initiated by the ruling Democratic Progressive Party (DPP) and its allies, accused the KMT members of obstructing key legislation and harming national security. Analysts suggest the outcome has averted a potential escalation in cross-strait tensions, as a successful recall could have been interpreted by Beijing as a sign of rising anti-China sentiment in Taiwan. This could have prompted a more confrontational stance from mainland China, but for now, that crisis has been avoided.</p>

It explores the toy's "cute-ugly" aesthetic, which elicits strong, polarizing reactions from consumers, a factor that experts say fuels the craze. The analysis also examines the company's marketing strategy, which uses limited drops and "blind box" packaging to create scarcity and a gambling-like thrill for collectors. This approach taps into powerful psychological motivators, turning the act of acquiring the dolls into an experience that is as desirable as the product itself.</p>

          <p>This article contrasts the post-pandemic business strategies of COVID-19 vaccine makers Moderna and BioNTech, whose fortunes have diverged. Moderna has doubled down on its mRNA technology, investing its windfall in a broad pipeline of new vaccines. In contrast, BioNTech has used its profits to diversify through acquisitions, expanding into promising new cancer therapies beyond mRNA. This strategic split is reflected in their stock performance, with BioNTech's shares gaining while Moderna's have slid, as Wall Street assesses their different approaches to long-term growth and risk.

          <p>A scientific expedition led by China has discovered the deepest known chemosynthesis-based ecosystem on Earth, located at depths of up to 9,500 meters in the northwest Pacific Ocean. Researchers found thriving colonies of tubeworms and molluscs that survive in total darkness by deriving energy from chemical reactions involving hydrogen sulphide and methane seeping from tectonic plate faults. This remarkable finding challenges current understanding of the limits of life and carbon cycling in the planet's deepest regions. Scientists suggest that similar hidden oases of life might be more widespread in other hadal trenches than previously thought.</p>

In her statement, Harris acknowledged that traditional politics have often failed Americans and called for new methods and fresh thinking, suggesting a desire to play a central role in reshaping the Democratic party's national strategy. Her decision opens up the competitive race for California's governorship, a key post in resisting the Trump administration's agenda.
