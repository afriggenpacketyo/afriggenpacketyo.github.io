          <p>President Trump falsely claimed gasoline prices had fallen below $2 per gallon to pressure the Federal Reserve to lower interest rates, despite the national average being over $3. According to AAA, the national average was $3.165 per gallon on Monday, substantially higher than Trump's claim. While RBOB gasoline futures did briefly touch $1.98 per gallon, this contract represents wholesale, unfinished gasoline prices, excluding taxes, transportation, and other costs, making it irrelevant to consumers. Experts emphasize that the RBOB price is not indicative of what drivers pay at the pump. (not investment advice)</p>

Despite the transition, analysts suggest that shareholders should view this as a transparent and well-managed process, as Buffett's continued role as chairman will allow him to mentor Abel and provide strategic guidance.</p>

          <p>Debt management programs can help ease the burden of high-rate debt by consolidating unsecured debts into one manageable monthly payment. To qualify, you'll need to have eligible types of debt (credit cards, medical bills, personal loans), sufficient income to make the monthly payment, a meaningful level of debt, and willingness to close your credit cards. If you don't qualify, other options include debt settlement, debt consolidation loans, or bankruptcy. A credit counselor can assess your financial situation and help determine the best approach for your needs.</p>

          <p>Investing in gold bars and coins can be a smart move this May, given the rising price of gold. A pro is the potential for quick profits, but a con is that the rising price could make it more expensive to get started. Easy access is another pro, with options available online and in person, but storage costs could be a drawback.

This initiative, led by GM President Mark Reuss, aims to restore Cadillac's prominence and compete with luxury brands from Germany, Japan, and electric vehicle competitors like Tesla and Lucid. The strategy involves isolating Cadillac's products from GM's other brands, prioritizing value over volume, and focusing on high-end vehicles like the bespoke Celestiq.
