          <h2>UK Government to Ban Use of Non-Disclosure Agreements in Workplace Misconduct Cases</h2>

          <p>The UK government is set to ban employers from using non-disclosure agreements (NDAs) to silence victims of workplace sexual misconduct, harassment, or discrimination. An amendment to the Employment Rights Bill will void confidentiality clauses that seek to prevent workers from speaking out about such allegations. This legal change, championed by campaigners like former Harvey Weinstein assistant Zelda Perkins, aims to address the misuse of NDAs to cover up criminal behavior. The move brings the UK in line with countries like Ireland and the US, seeking to protect victims rather than powerful individuals.</p>

          <p>Germany's Defense Minister, Boris Pistorius, has put forward a draft bill that would allow for the call-up of conscripts in specific security situations requiring a rapid military expansion. The plan is a compromise, developed in response to Russia's aggression in Europe, aiming to bolster the Bundeswehr to meet new NATO guidelines of 460,000 troops. The bill also seeks to make voluntary service more attractive with increased pay, hoping to double the number of reservists to 200,000. This move comes as Germany works to have a new military service scheme in place by 2026.</p>

          <p>Newcastle United has agreed to a £55 million fee with Nottingham Forest for the transfer of Swedish winger Anthony Elanga. The deal is expected to be finalized this week as Newcastle looks to strengthen its attacking lineup for its upcoming Champions League campaign. The 23-year-old had a successful season with Forest, contributing six goals and eleven assists. Elanga, who joined Forest from Manchester United for £15 million in 2023, has seen his value rise significantly due to his strong performance and impressive attacking statistics.</p>

          <p>The Reserve Bank of Australia has unexpectedly decided to maintain its policy rate at 3.85%, contrary to economists' expectations of a 25-basis-point cut. The central bank stated it needs more time and information to confirm that inflation is sustainably on track to its 2.5% target, noting that recent monthly data was slightly stronger than anticipated. This decision comes as Australia navigates a growth slowdown, with weakening consumer demand and exports. The Australian dollar strengthened following the announcement, while the S&P/ASX 200 index saw a slight decline. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>At the Saint George the Victorious monastery in North Macedonia, a small community of nuns is renowned for crafting unique and ornate mitres, the sacred headwear for Orthodox bishops. The workshop, which reopened in 2001, is the only one in the world producing this specific style of mitre, with some production techniques remaining a closely guarded secret. Each headdress is a meticulous, handmade creation decorated with gold embroidery and jewels, taking weeks or even months to complete. Despite their opulence, the mitres symbolize the crown of thorns, intended to bring humility to the wearer.</p>

          <p>The UK is anticipating its third and potentially most widespread heatwave of the summer, with temperatures expected to reach up to 33°C (91°F) over the weekend. High pressure is forecast to bring sustained sunshine and hot air from continental Europe across the entire country, including England, Wales, Scotland, and Northern Ireland. This event follows two previous heatwaves in June and July and could see some areas exceed their heatwave temperature criteria for seven consecutive days. High UV and pollen levels are also predicted alongside the hot weather.</p>

          <p>Brazilian club Fluminense, considered an underdog, has surprisingly reached the Club World Cup final where they will face Chelsea. The team's success is credited to their charismatic coach, Renato Gaúcho, and the formidable defensive leadership of 40-year-old veteran Thiago Silva. The final will be a special occasion for Silva, who previously won the Champions League and Club World Cup with Chelsea. Despite being outmatched financially, Fluminense's solid defense and key attacking players have given them a fighting chance to win the prestigious international tournament.</p>

          <p>The Los Angeles Angels defeated the Texas Rangers 6-5 after Nolan Schanuel drew a bases-loaded, walk-off walk in the bottom of the ninth inning. A key moment earlier in the game came from catcher Travis d’Arnaud, who hit a two-run home run against his former battery mate, Jacob deGrom. D'Arnaud also hit a crucial game-tying double in the sixth inning, contributing significantly to the team's offense. The victory provided a much-needed boost for the Angels, who had previously suffered a series of close, one-run losses against the Toronto Blue Jays.</p>

          <p>The first malaria treatment specifically designed for babies and young children weighing less than 4.5kg (10lbs) has been approved for use and is expected to be rolled out soon. Until now, infants were treated with modified doses of drugs for older children, which carried a risk of overdose due to their developing bodies. The new medicine, Coartem Baby, was developed by Novartis in a non-profit partnership to address this critical treatment gap. This breakthrough is expected to save many lives in Africa, where children under five account for roughly 75% of all malaria deaths.</p>

The announcement followed calls between Trump and the leaders of both Ukraine and Russia. The Pentagon confirmed it is sending additional weapons at the president's direction to ensure Ukraine can defend itself while the U.S. works to secure a lasting peace.</p>

          <p>Singapore is emerging as an increasingly popular choice for Chinese students seeking overseas education, as interest in studying in the United States wanes. Factors such as cultural differences, safety concerns, and a challenging environment for international students are prompting many to reconsider the U.S. Students are drawn to Singapore for its high-quality universities, economic openness, and cultural similarities, including a familiar climate and cuisine. While the U.S. has historically been the top destination, industry insiders predict a rise in applications to Singaporean institutions from Chinese nationals.</p>

          <p>The Transportation Security Administration (TSA) has reportedly begun phasing out the requirement for passengers to remove their shoes during standard security screenings at some U.S. airports. While travelers with TSA PreCheck were already exempt, this change now applies to regular screening lines at select locations, including airports in Baltimore, Fort Lauderdale, and Philadelphia. The mandatory shoe-removal rule was implemented nationwide in 2006, several years after the failed "shoe bomber" attempt in 2001. The TSA stated it is always exploring ways to enhance the passenger experience while maintaining strong security.</p>

          <p>The Los Angeles City Council has moved to permanently curb "renovictions," where landlords evict tenants under the pretext of a substantial remodel to then charge higher rents. The council voted to amend a rule, now requiring landlords to obtain a Government Agency Order to vacate a unit for renovations, which is typically issued to address housing code violations. This makes it much harder to use a remodel as a "just cause" for eviction. The city is also developing rules for tenant relocation assistance and penalties for landlords who violate the new ordinance, aiming to protect renters.</p>
