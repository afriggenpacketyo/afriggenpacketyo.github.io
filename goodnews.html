          <p>A former Latin teacher from Connecticut, Carol Ross, sold her collection of over 130 ancient Roman coins at auction for over $1 million. The collection included a rare coin with a portrait of Marcus Junius Brutus, one of Julius Caesar's assassins, which sold for over $314,000. Another coin featuring Emperor Augustus sold for over $180,000, with other coins ranging in price from $120 to $30,000. Ross's interest in ancient Roman currency and history led to her amassing the impressive collection, which was auctioned off by Doyle, a New York auction house.</p>

          <p>Marine experts believe they may have found the remains of the Recovery, a British ship that sank off the coast of Wexford, Ireland, in 1787. The ship was carrying a treasure of marble, bronze, art, and natural curiosities collected by James Caulfeild and John La Touche. Underwater archaeologists found a copper sheath, a 20-foot-long rudder, timber, an anchor, and artifacts including a teapot and inkwells. The true value of the cargo is unknown, but La Touche's possessions have previously sold for significant sums, suggesting the shipwreck could contain valuable items.</p>

          <p>Consumer sentiment in early June rebounded significantly, exceeding expectations, as concerns about inflation and the impact of tariffs softened. The University of Michigan's Surveys of Consumers reported across-the-board gains, with the headline index rising to 60.5, a 15.9% increase from the previous month. This improvement coincided with a decrease in heated rhetoric surrounding President Trump's tariffs and progress in global trade negotiations, especially with China. Consumers still perceive downside risks to the economy, but fears about the potential impact of tariffs on future inflation have lessened.</p>

The luxury furniture retailer expects full-year revenue to grow by 10% to 13%. To mitigate the impact of tariffs, RH is shifting more production out of China, with receipts from the country expected to drop significantly. The company is also delaying the launch of a new concept until 2026 to gain more certainty about tariffs, while proceeding with plans to open stores in other countries, including Paris.</p>
