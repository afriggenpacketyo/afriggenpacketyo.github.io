          <p>Microsoft's CEO, Satya Nadella, predicts that the company's new $30 billion investment in the UK's AI sector, its largest outside the US, could boost Britain's economy by 10% within five years. This investment is part of a larger £31 billion "Tech Prosperity Deal" signed during Donald Trump's state visit, involving other tech giants like Google and Nvidia. Nadella compared AI's potential economic impact to that of personal computers, acknowledging high energy consumption but emphasizing benefits in healthcare, public services, and business productivity. The deal aims to create highly skilled jobs and modernize infrastructure, despite some concerns about foreign tech reliance. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>Germany's basketball is experiencing a golden era, with recent Eurobasket and World Championship wins, but the sport faces new challenges from the Name, Image, Likeness (NIL) provision in US colleges. NIL allows US student athletes to profit, and with recent changes allowing direct payments, US college offers are now comparable to top European club salaries. This shift threatens to draw young German talent like Hannes Steinbach to the US, impacting the Basketball Bundesliga's player development. While some see opportunities for individual players, the BBL seeks compensation for training these athletes, emphasizing the need for a new agreement with the NCAA.</p>

          <div class="timestamp">2025-09-17 02:57:47 EDT</div>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Jose Mourinho is reportedly considering a return to Benfica as manager, 21 years after his initial departure from the club. This comes as Benfica seeks a replacement for Bruno Lage, who was sacked following a Champions League defeat. Club president Rui Costa emphasized the need for a "winner" to lead the team, though he refrained from confirming Mourinho as the preferred option. Mourinho, recently sacked by Fenerbahce, began his managerial career at Benfica in 2000 and achieved significant success with Porto, including a Champions League title. The article suggests his potential return would see him face Chelsea in the Champions League, adding an intriguing dynamic to the football season.</p>

          <p>British pharmaceutical giant GSK announced a commitment to invest at least $30 billion in US research, development, and manufacturing over the next five years. This significant investment, which includes $1.2 billion for advanced manufacturing and AI technologies to build "next-generation biopharma factories," coincides with President Donald Trump's state visit to the UK. GSK's CEO Emma Walmsley highlighted the strong science and healthcare innovation ties between the two nations. This move follows similar pledges from other global pharma firms like AstraZeneca, Novartis, and Sanofi, driven by pressure from the Trump administration to boost US manufacturing and lower domestic drug prices.

          <p>Chinese tech giant Baidu saw its Hong Kong shares surge nearly 16%, reaching two-year highs, driven by a positive outlook for its artificial intelligence business. An equity research firm upgraded Baidu's rating due to its promising AI chip and cloud-computing revenue, which are crucial for its large language model and AI chatbot, Ernie Bot. The company's strategy includes using internally designed chips to reduce reliance on Nvidia and securing an AI-related deal with state-owned China Merchants Group, focusing on industrial intelligence. This "all-in AI pivot" aims to offset struggles in its online advertising business and secure an edge in China's competitive AI landscape. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>Archaeologists have discovered a "forgotten" royal castle on the Hebridean isle of Islay, believed to have been home to kings who ruled much of western Scotland over 700 years ago. The fortress, built across two small islands in a loch at Finlaggan, predates the Lords of the Isles, who later made Finlaggan their power base, controlling the Hebrides and parts of the Highlands. The remains include a rectangular stone tower, similar to keeps found in English castles, with living quarters, a great hall, and a chapel. This significant find offers new insights into early Scottish royalty and the historical importance of the Finlaggan site, enriching understanding of the region's past.</p>

          <p>China's offshore yuan has strengthened past 7.1 per US dollar, reaching its strongest level in nearly a year, driven by anticipation of interest rate cuts from the US Federal Reserve. The Fed's expected easing during its Federal Open Market Committee meeting is seen as a key factor in the US dollar's depreciation trend, which in turn boosts the yuan's stability and strength. This marks another milestone in China's gradual monetary policy shift, reflecting a broader economic dynamic where global interest rate differentials play a significant role in currency valuations. This strengthening indicates a positive trend for China's currency in the international market. (not investment advice)</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Japan's exports contracted by a modest 0.1% year-on-year in August, a smaller decline than expected, primarily due to a rebound in shipments to Asia. While overall growth remained negative for the fourth consecutive month, exports to Asia climbed 1.7%, and Western Europe saw a sharp 7.7% jump. This partially offset a steeper 13.8% fall in exports to the US, particularly in autos, following new tariffs. The article notes that despite the softer contraction, future export volumes could shrink in 2026 due to slower external demand and capital spending in key markets, according to economists. The Bank of Japan's rate decision is also anticipated soon. (not investment advice)</p>

While the visit highlights economic wins like Microsoft's investment, it also underscores the unpredictability of the US president, especially regarding issues like steel tariffs and potential disagreements on international policy.
