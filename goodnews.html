          <p>During a diplomatic tour in Europe, Chinese Foreign Minister Wang Yi addressed concerns over Beijing's export controls on dual-use goods, including rare earths. Speaking in Berlin, Wang asserted that these materials have never been and should not become an issue between China and the European Union, assuring that the normal needs of European companies will be met if regulations are followed. He framed China's policies as being in line with international norms and contributing to world peace, suggesting that those who are 'deliberately hyping the issue' have ulterior motives. The visit aims to set the stage for an upcoming China-EU summit.</p>

          <h2>Cities Across the US increasingly Replace Traditional Fireworks with Drone Shows for July 4th</h2>

        </div>
        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Dozens of American cities are opting for synchronized drone displays instead of traditional fireworks for their Independence Day celebrations this year. Citing safety concerns like drought conditions and fire risks, cities such as Salt Lake City are embracing the high-tech alternative. Proponents also highlight that drone shows are quieter, making them more inclusive for individuals with PTSD and pets, and are a more environmentally friendly option. While the drone show industry is experiencing a surge in demand, the shift is not without resistance, as some communities, like those in Lake Tahoe, are reverting to pyrotechnics after public pushback.</p>

          <h2>American Citizens Reflect on the Meaning of Freedom for Independence Day</h2>
          <div class="timestamp">2025-07-04 05:00:00 EDT</div>
        </div>
        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>In observance of the Fourth of July, NPR gathered perspectives on freedom from a diverse group of everyday Americans. The responses reveal a complex and multifaceted understanding of the concept, moving beyond its traditional definition. For many, freedom is intrinsically linked to safety from poverty and violence, the right to self-determination without systemic barriers, and the ability to live without fear. Several contributors emphasized that true liberty involves a collective responsibility to others, arguing that individual freedom cannot exist at the expense of another's rights. The collection of voices highlights a national dialogue grappling with both the ideals and the current realities of freedom in the United States.</p>

          <p>As the lowest-ranked team and a debutant at Euro 2025, the Welsh women's national football team is relying on unity and a strong sense of identity to compete against formidable opponents. Coach Rhian Wilkinson emphasizes the 'Welsh red vein' of pride that runs through the squad, which includes players with Welsh heritage from abroad. Despite lacking the depth of larger nations, the team's cohesion and family-like bond have led to surprising success. The tournament is seen as a pivotal moment for increasing visibility and inspiring young girls in Wales, building on a recent surge in participation in the sport.</p>

          <p>A Chinese model, identified by his surname Zhong, has been successfully rescued after being lured into a job scam that took him to Myanmar. The 25-year-old had traveled to Bangkok for what he believed was a magazine cover shoot, an offer made by a former employer. After arriving, he went missing and later made a video call to his sister revealing he had been tricked and taken to Myanmar. The Chinese embassy in Thailand confirmed his rescue, which was a collaborative effort, and issued a warning to its citizens about overseas 'high-paying job' scams.</p>

          <p>A new short film, 'Final Finishers,' shifts the focus of marathon coverage from elite athletes to the everyday runners who complete the New York City Marathon long after sunset. The documentary celebrates the perseverance of those at the back of the pack, showcasing their often-extraordinary personal stories, such as a man who ran after recovering from paralysis. Organizers and filmmakers believe these relatable stories of overcoming personal challenges can inspire a broader audience to see themselves as runners. The film challenges the conventional sports documentary genre by arguing that the most compelling narratives are not always found at the front of the race.</p>

          <p>On the first anniversary of his government, UK Prime Minister Keir Starmer described his relationship with US President Donald Trump as good, stating it is in the 'national interest' for them to connect. Starmer explained that despite their political differences, they find common ground in their shared value of family, which serves as a point of connection. He revealed their first conversation occurred after the assassination attempt on Trump last year, and Trump later reciprocated with a personal call after the death of Starmer's brother. The comments highlight the prime minister's pragmatic approach to international diplomacy.</p>

          <p>The U.S. Space Force is a potential major beneficiary of President Trump's recently passed tax and spending package, which could deliver a 30% year-on-year funding increase to nearly $40 billion in 2026. A significant portion of this budget, around $25 billion, is slated for the 'Golden Dome' multi-layered missile defense system, representing an initial investment in interceptors and advanced sensors. This financial boost provides a beacon of hope for defense and space contractors amid budget cuts at NASA and signals a strategic pivot from space exploration to achieving 'space superiority.'

          <p>Recent criticism from Chinese state media regarding the addictive nature of 'blind box' toys is unlikely to hinder the growth of Pop Mart, the company behind the popular Labubu dolls. While the commentary caused a temporary dip in its stock, analysts believe the company is insulated from significant regulatory impact because its primary demographic is young adults, not the minors targeted by the critique. Furthermore, Pop Mart's rapidly expanding overseas sales, particularly in Southeast Asia and North America, provide a substantial cushion, with international revenue projected to soon account for over half of its total sales.</p>

Dozens of residents in the west Highlands reported seeing an orange glow and hearing a 'bang,' with one person feeling their house shake.
