          <p>Citing personal fatigue and the negative mental health impacts of dating apps, 30-year-old founder Lucy Rout has created Haystack Dating, a company that organizes in-real-life events. The model aims to foster more meaningful connections by matching attendees into small groups based on interests and personality traits before they engage in a shared activity. This venture taps into a growing trend of people seeking alternatives to online dating, as major apps like Tinder and Bumble have seen a decline in users. Rout's initiative reflects a broader market shift towards authentic, face-to-face social interactions.</p>

          <p>Actor Chris Hemsworth has described learning he has a significantly higher genetic predisposition for Alzheimer's disease as a "gear shift" in his life's motivations. The discovery, made during filming for his show "Limitless," revealed he carries two copies of the APOE4 gene, increasing his likelihood of developing the disorder by eight to ten times. Hemsworth stated the finding prompted him to re-evaluate his purpose, focusing more on what he contributes rather than collects. This change in perspective has influenced the second season of his show, where he takes a more personal and educated role in exploring health and longevity.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>A consumer trend dubbed "treatonomics" is gaining momentum as people seek morale boosts amid persistent economic uncertainty, high interest rates, and inflation. This behavior involves spending on small, affordable luxuries like makeup or home goods, an evolution of the "lipstick effect," as well as splurging on larger, memorable experiences like concerts. Analysts note that with traditional milestones like home ownership feeling less attainable, consumers are instead celebrating smaller "inch-stones" with guilt-free purchases. This shift in spending habits is expected to persist as it provides a sense of joy and control during unsettling financial times.</p>

          <p>Jim Lovell, the renowned astronaut who commanded the perilous Apollo 13 mission, has passed away at the age of 97. Lovell is celebrated for his calm leadership that safely guided his crew back to Earth after an oxygen tank explosion, turning a potential catastrophe into what's known as a "successful failure." He was also a crew member on Apollo 8, the first mission to orbit the Moon, where he famously described Earth as a "grand oasis in the vastness of space." NASA and his family remembered him as a hero whose courage and optimism inspired millions and advanced human spaceflight.</p>

          <p>A fire that broke out inside the historic Mosque-Cathedral of Cordoba in southern Spain has been successfully extinguished by firefighters. The mayor of Cordoba praised the "rapid and magnificent intervention" of emergency services, stating that their work averted a potential catastrophe at the UNESCO World Heritage site. The blaze reportedly started in a chapel, possibly due to a short circuit in an electric sweeper, and was brought under control quickly. The incident evoked memories of the 2019 Notre Dame fire, but fortunately, this event concluded with no major structural damage to the architectural jewel.</p>

          <p>Walmart has agreed to a $5.6 million settlement to resolve a lawsuit alleging the company overcharged customers in its California stores. The lawsuit, brought by several county district attorneys, claimed that Walmart sold products, particularly weighted items like produce and baked goods, for higher prices than advertised or for more than their actual weight. As part of the settlement, the retail giant will pay $5.5 million in civil penalties and implement measures to ensure accurate pricing and weighing in its stores. The case underscores regulatory efforts to enforce consumer protection laws and ensure price accuracy at the register.</p>

          <p>A Bay Area man has been arrested and charged with stealing rare Chinese manuscripts, valued at over $200,000, from the UCLA library in a sophisticated scheme. Federal investigators allege that Jeffrey Ying used fake aliases and a flawed library checkout system to rent the valuable books, some dating back to the 13th century. He would then allegedly replace the originals with "dummy books"—often blank manuscripts with forged labels—before leaving with the authentic items. Ying was apprehended before an alleged attempt to flee to China, and now faces a federal charge for theft of major artwork.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>This opinion article analyzes the settlement between Disney and actress Gina Carano, who was fired from "The Mandalorian" over controversial social media posts. The author argues that while corporate capitulation to political pressure is a real concern, this settlement was "the right thing to do," correcting an initial overreaction by the company. The piece suggests that Disney's 2021 firing of Carano was an extreme response to posts that were more ignorant than malicious. The settlement, which includes a statement from Lucasfilm hoping for future collaboration, is framed as a sensible resolution rather than a sign of corporate weakness.</p>

          <p>The leaders of Azerbaijan and Armenia have signed a landmark peace agreement at the White House, aimed at ending decades of conflict over the Nagorno-Karabakh region. Hosted by President Donald Trump, who called the event "historic," Azerbaijani President Ilham Aliyev and Armenian Prime Minister Nikol Pashinyan agreed to cease all fighting and establish diplomatic and business relations. As part of the deal, the U.S. will help develop a key transit corridor connecting Azerbaijan with its Nakhchivan exclave through Armenian territory. The agreement marks a significant diplomatic development for the Caucasus region, brokered with substantial U.S. involvement.</p>

This mission marks a significant operational change, as it is the first NASA-sponsored crew to land in the Pacific Ocean, a move SpaceX made to ensure debris from the capsule's trunk section falls in a remote area.

          <p>A surprising political friendship has developed between U.S. Vice President JD Vance and UK Foreign Secretary David Lammy, despite their starkly different political ideologies. Vance is currently vacationing in the UK, beginning his trip with a family stay at Lammy's official country residence. The two men, who have bonded over shared experiences of difficult childhoods and their Christian faith, have met regularly since Lammy was in opposition. This personal relationship is seen as potentially valuable for UK-U.S. relations, particularly given the personalized nature of diplomacy under the current Trump administration.</p>

          <p>A viral social media claim stating that Donald Trump's plane flew to Jeffrey Epstein's private island 37 times has been found to be without evidence. The fact-checking article points out several key inconsistencies, most notably that the island, Little St. James, does not have an airstrip capable of landing a plane like Trump's; guests typically arrived by helicopter or boat. The user who originated the claim also used a profile picture with a pin from a commercial pilot costume and was an administrator for anti-Trump online groups, casting significant doubt on his credibility and motives.</p>
