        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>China's economy expanded by 5.2% in the second quarter, exceeding economists' predictions and easing pressure on the government for immediate large-scale stimulus. Despite the strong GDP figure, other indicators point to underlying fragility, including a slowdown in retail sales growth and a deepening slump in real estate investment. Industrial output, however, showed robust expansion. While the government's 5% annual growth target appears achievable, economists remain cautious, citing insufficient domestic demand and external uncertainties from trade tensions with the U.S. as significant headwinds.

          <p>Nvidia has announced it expects to resume selling its H20 AI chips to China, stating that the U.S. government has provided assurances that the necessary licenses will be granted. The sales of these chips, specifically designed to comply with U.S. export controls, had been halted in April. This development follows a preliminary trade agreement between Washington and Beijing and increased lobbying by Nvidia's CEO, Jensen Huang, who argued that restrictions were harming American tech leadership. Huang also recently met with President Trump to discuss the administration's goals for job creation and AI leadership.</p>

          <h2>BBC Salary Report Lacks Transparency on Top Star Earnings Due to Loopholes</h2>

          <p>The BBC's annual salary report fails to provide a complete picture of its top talent's earnings, as many high-profile stars are not included on the public list. This is because the disclosure requirement only applies to individuals directly employed by the BBC, not those paid through its commercial arm, BBC Studios, or other independent production companies. Consequently, the earnings of stars from popular shows like 'The Traitors,' 'Strictly Come Dancing,' and 'The Apprentice' remain private. This system allows BBC Studios to compete commercially without revealing its talent costs, but it obscures the full extent of spending on top personalities.</p>

          <p>A U.S. appeals court has issued a temporary stay, preventing the Trump administration from terminating the Temporary Protected Status (TPS) for thousands of Afghans residing in the United States. The administrative stay was granted following an emergency motion by the immigration advocacy group Casa, which is challenging the administration's decision to end protections for both Afghans and Cameroonians. The Department of Homeland Security had argued in April that conditions in these countries no longer warranted the special status. The court's order will remain in effect until at least July 21, pending a response from the administration.</p>

          <p>A man has been arrested in Victorville, California, on suspicion of filing a false police report after a teddy bear appearing to be made of human skin was found at a gas station. The San Bernardino County Sheriff's Department responded to the scene, but the coroner quickly determined the object was not made of human remains. The incident was revealed to be a prank, and authorities arrested Hector Corona Villanueva for the hoax. An artist from South Carolina later confirmed on social media that she had created the macabre bear and shipped it to a customer in the area.</p>

          <p>Scientists at China's Dalian University of Technology have developed a new manufacturing technique that could significantly improve the performance of aircraft engines, a critical area where China has historically lagged. The method involves rapidly cooling forged superalloy turbine discs, which are essential components that must endure extreme heat and pressure. This technological advancement is particularly vital as China works on developing at least two next-generation fighter jets. The quality and durability of these discs directly determine an engine's power, efficiency, and overall lifespan, making this a key breakthrough for the nation's aerospace and military industries.</p>

          <p>Bob Becker, an 80-year-old runner from Florida, has made history by becoming the oldest person to finish the Badwater 135, widely considered the world's toughest foot race. The ultramarathon covers 135 miles through California's Death Valley, where temperatures can exceed 120°F, and involves significant elevation gain. Becker completed the race with three hours to spare, successfully settling a score after he narrowly missed the 48-hour cutoff time in 2022. His achievement is a testament to his determination and has been hailed as an inspiring feat of human endurance and spirit.</p>

The stocks had fallen sharply on Friday following the news, but market experts from Evercore ISI and Morgan Stanley suggested the proposed fees would be a negligible cost for large fintech platforms. They noted that major players rely more on debit, credit, or stored balances than direct bank data pulls, and many have long-term pricing contracts already in place, insulating them from immediate pressure.
