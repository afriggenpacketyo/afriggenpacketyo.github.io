        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>A New York judge dismissed Justin Baldoni's $400 million defamation lawsuit against Blake Lively, stemming from Lively's allegations of sexual harassment on set and subsequent retaliation. Baldoni's lawsuit claimed Lively and others aimed to ruin his career by promoting a false narrative of sexual assault and a smear campaign. The judge ruled that Baldoni had not adequately proven extortion or defamation, as Lively's statements were privileged as part of her lawsuit. Lively's lawyers hailed the decision as a complete vindication, while Baldoni has been given the opportunity to amend and refile allegations related to interference with contracts.</p>

          <p>A recent Gallup poll reveals a growing divergence between men and women on their support for abortion rights, three years after the overturning of Roe v Wade. The poll found that 61% of women identify as "pro-choice," compared to only 41% of men, marking the widest gender gap in decades. The changes are attributed more to increased support among women post-Roe than to shifts in men's attitudes. The findings suggest that the political upheaval surrounding abortion rights has energized women's support for access to the procedure.</p>
