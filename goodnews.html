          <p>Four rare Barbary lion cubs have been born at a Czech safari park, a significant step in a conservation program aimed at their survival. The subspecies, which went extinct in the wild in the 1960s, is being carefully bred in captivity to maintain genetic diversity. While plans to reintroduce them to their native habitat in North Africa's Atlas Mountains are in early stages, this birth represents a hopeful development for the majestic species. The zoo is coordinating with international partners and Moroccan authorities to explore the long-term possibility of returning the lions to the wild.</p>

          <p>In the wake of a destructive fire that ravaged Altadena, resident Laurie Scott has created a "Regrow Altadena" stand to distribute free plants, seeds, and soil to her neighbors. The initiative aims to restore a sense of hope and bring life back to a community that lost much of its lush greenery and personal gardens. Scott, who found personal solace in a houseplant after the fire, has since given away over a thousand plants, with community members and local experts contributing to the effort. The project provides a tangible way for residents to reconnect with nature and begin the long process of rebuilding.</p>

        </div>
        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Scientists in South Korea have developed a temporary tattoo-like sticker that can detect the presence of GHB, a substance commonly used in drink spiking, within one second. The discreet sensor changes from yellow to red when it comes into contact with a beverage containing the drug. This innovation offers a fast and subtle safety tool for individuals in social settings, improving upon existing test strips that can be slower and more conspicuous. The sticker proved effective in various drinks, and the color-change result remains visible for up to 30 days, potentially serving as evidence if needed.</p>

          <p>A couple has found a strong sense of community and created a personalized, art-filled home in their Beachwood Canyon rental apartment. Five years ago, Natalie Babcock and Samuel Gibson secured the charming 1928 Spanish-style unit, which features practical amenities like in-unit laundry and a garage. They have since transformed the space with bold paint choices, thrifted Midcentury furniture, and an extensive art collection, making it a reflection of their vibrant tastes. More than the apartment itself, they cherish the neighborhood connections they've built, highlighting the importance of community in a bustling city like Los Angeles.</p>

The new 10-track album, produced by Jay Joyce, features a rawer, more guitar-driven sound designed for live performance.

          <p>Apple CEO Tim Cook is set to join President Donald Trump to announce a new $100 billion investment commitment in the United States. This pledge, which includes a new "American Manufacturing Program," brings Apple's total planned U.S. investment to $600 billion over the next four years. The announcement comes as the Trump administration continues to pressure the tech giant to move more of its manufacturing operations from China to America. This move is seen by some analysts as a strategic effort by Apple to maintain a favorable relationship with the White House amid ongoing trade tensions and tariff threats. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>When planning for retirement, both certificates of deposit (CDs) and annuities offer safe, predictable options, but they serve distinct purposes. CDs are simple, government-insured products ideal for short-term savings and principal protection, though their returns may not outpace inflation. Annuities are insurance contracts designed to provide a guaranteed income stream for life, addressing the risk of outliving one's savings, but they are more complex and less liquid. The best choice depends on an individual's specific needs, such as their desire for lifetime income versus liquidity and their overall portfolio composition. (not investment advice)</p>
