          <p>The Italian government has approved the revival of a long-stalled project to build the Strait of Messina Bridge, which would connect Sicily to the mainland. The proposed 2-mile suspension bridge, estimated to cost €13.5 billion, faces significant challenges, including its location in a seismically active zone and potential corrosion from salty air. While proponents tout economic benefits and job creation, the project has faced decades of cancellations and local opposition from groups who argue the funds are better spent on existing infrastructure. Construction is slated to begin in 2026, with a target completion date of 2032.</p>

Key recommendations include giving ample notice, keeping visits to a reasonable length like four days, and communicating plans to avoid awkwardness. Experts advise against assuming hosts will provide transportation and suggest being self-sufficient. Guests should also be mindful of their footprint, keep their belongings tidy, and show gratitude with a thoughtful gift or by helping with chores, ensuring a positive experience for everyone involved.</p>

          <p>European destinations are witnessing a substantial surge in tourism from China, with a 13% year-on-year increase recorded in the first half of 2025. According to the European Travel Commission (ETC), Chinese tourists show a much higher willingness to travel long-haul to the continent compared to the global average. This trend is providing a welcome boost to the European travel industry. The article suggests a potential, though unstated, link to shifting global travel patterns, possibly influenced by geopolitical factors such as U.S. policies, making Europe a more attractive destination for Chinese travelers.</p>

His calm message, "Houston, we've had a problem," became iconic. Lovell was also part of the Apollo 8 mission, the first to orbit the Moon, making him the first person to travel to the Moon twice, though he never landed on its surface.</p>

          <p>Welsh rugby star Louis Rees-Zammit has unexpectedly ended his attempt to switch to the NFL, leaving the Jacksonville Jaguars to return to rugby. While an injury and coaching changes at the Jaguars played a role, his decision was also influenced by increasing opportunities back in rugby, including a potential spot on the Welsh national team and a rumored offer from a new rebel league. Experts note that despite his athleticism, the transition was challenging, as he was still developing the specific technical skills required for the NFL. He is expected to return to rugby as a more mature player.</p>

          <p>The England women's rugby team, known as the Red Roses, is preparing for a crucial match against France as a key step in their journey toward the World Cup final. Wing Abby Dow describes the team's mindset as climbing "Everest," using imagery from a mountaineer who spoke with the squad. The upcoming game is seen as a vital test, as France is a top-ranked opponent that narrowly lost to England in their last encounter. Head coach John Mitchell is prioritizing a strong performance over simply extending their winning streak, viewing the challenge as essential preparation for the tougher games ahead.</p>

        </div>
        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>The dynamic of EU-India trade relations is being tested by new geopolitical pressures, including EU sanctions targeting India's refinement of Russian oil and the threat of high U.S. tariffs on Indian goods. Experts suggest that the U.S. actions may paradoxically push India to finalize a long-delayed free trade agreement with the EU to diversify its economic partnerships. While the EU's specific sanction on an Indian refinery is seen as largely symbolic, the broader instability in global trade could increase the mutual desire for a stable EU-India pact, potentially benefiting both economies and aligning with Western efforts to pressure Russia.</p>

          <p>The UK government has reformed its competitive civil service summer internship program to restrict applications to students from lower socio-economic backgrounds, a move intended to improve social mobility and representation. The change has been met with a divided response from students. Some, who were previously discouraged, now feel they have a fair chance and plan to apply. However, others who consider themselves working-class but do not meet the strict parental occupation criteria, feel unfairly excluded and worry the new rules are divisive and counterproductive.</p>

          <p>A team of Chinese scientists has successfully created a pure, macroscopic hexagonal diamond in a laboratory, a breakthrough that has been pursued by researchers for decades. This rare form of diamond, first discovered in a meteorite in 1967, has a different atomic structure than common cubic diamonds and was believed to form under intense heat and pressure. Previous attempts by other teams had only produced mixed-phase samples. The Chinese team's success in synthesizing high-purity hexagonal crystals, detailed in the journal Nature, provides definitive proof of the material's existence.</p>

Sanders, a fifth-round draft pick, completed 14 of 23 passes for 138 yards and threw two touchdown passes, leading the team on three scoring drives against the Carolina Panthers. Despite starting the game fourth on the depth chart, his poise and effectiveness could improve his standing in the team's open quarterback competition.
