          <p>Actress Dame Helen Mirren has asserted that the iconic character of James Bond should continue to be portrayed by a male actor. In a recent interview, she stated that while she considers herself a feminist, changing the character to a woman would fundamentally alter the role into something else entirely. Her sentiment was echoed by former Bond actor Pierce Brosnan, who also expressed his belief that a man should play the part. Both actors are currently co-starring in a film adaptation of "The Thursday Murder Club," where Mirren plays a retired spy.</p>

          <p>Markets in the Asia-Pacific region traded with mixed results on Monday as investors processed the outcome of the recent U.S.-Russia summit, which concluded without a ceasefire agreement. Japan's Nikkei 225 experienced a modest gain, while South Korea's Kospi index saw a decline. Economic data from Singapore revealed a 4.6% contraction in non-oil domestic exports for July, which was worse than analysts had anticipated. In contrast, U.S. equity futures saw a slight increase, driven by hopes for potential interest rate cuts from the Federal Reserve. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>A renewed wave of interest in African heritage, often termed pan-Africanism, is growing across the Caribbean, driven by cultural exchange and strengthening economic ties. This movement is visible through the rising popularity of African food, music like Afrobeats, and increased travel from the Caribbean to the African continent. Unlike previous waves, this resurgence is amplified by social media and involves governmental efforts to forge stronger trade links, with institutions like Afreximbank projecting significant growth in commerce. Leaders are also discussing practical measures like direct air routes and even a shared currency to deepen the connection between the two regions.</p>

          <p>Actress Halle Berry recently celebrated her 59th birthday with a tropical vacation, sharing a series of photos with her social media followers. The images depict her enjoying the seaside setting, including one where she is seen in red lingerie with a large inflatable duck. The trip comes after recent public comments from her ex-husband, David Justice, regarding their past marriage in the 1990s. Berry has been in a relationship with musician Van Hunt for five years, and the couple has indicated they do not feel pressure to get married, with Berry having been married three times previously.</p>

        </div>
        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>According to U.S. special envoy Steve Witkoff, Russian President Vladimir Putin has agreed to allow the U.S. and European allies to offer Ukraine a security guarantee similar to NATO's Article 5 collective defense clause. This potential concession, described as "game-changing," emerged from the recent summit between President Trump and Putin in Alaska. The arrangement could serve as an alternative to Ukraine's formal NATO membership, a long-standing point of contention for Russia. While details remain unclear, the development is seen as significant enough to warrant a follow-up meeting between Trump, Ukrainian President Zelensky, and European leaders to explore a path toward a peace deal.</p>

          <p>World number one Scottie Scheffler claimed victory at the BMW Championship after Scotland's Robert MacIntyre, who held a four-shot overnight lead, struggled in the final round. MacIntyre's hopes faded after a difficult start with consecutive bogeys, ultimately finishing with a three-over-par 73. Scheffler capitalized on the opportunity, shooting a three-under 67, highlighted by a remarkable chip-in on the 17th hole that secured his two-shot victory. A visibly frustrated MacIntyre expressed his disappointment after the round, stating he felt an urge to "smash up my golf clubs" following the unexpected collapse.</p>

          <p>Two of China's largest drug manufacturers, Jiangsu Hengrui Pharmaceuticals and Hansoh Pharmaceutical Group, are projected to report substantial profit increases for the first half of the year. This growth is attributed to the successful rollout of new drugs and increased revenue from technology licensing deals. Analysts predict Hengrui's net profit could rise by 40 percent, reaching 4.1 billion yuan, with revenue climbing 9 percent. The companies' strategic shift from generic drugs to innovative pharmaceuticals is improving their revenue structure and driving financial performance, a trend expected to continue in the coming years.

          <p>The UK's Green Party is at a strategic crossroads as it holds a leadership election, with candidates debating whether to adopt a more aggressive, populist approach or continue a moderate, community-focused strategy. Deputy leader Zack Polanski is advocating for "eco-populism" to connect with voter anger, contrasting with the current co-leader Adrian Ramsay and MP Ellie Chowns, who favor a broader appeal that builds on recent electoral successes. The contest comes after the party achieved a record four seats in Parliament, forcing members to decide on the most effective path to expand their influence and potentially capitalize on left-wing discontent with the Labour Party.</p>

          <p>The New York City Office of the Chief Medical Examiner continues its solemn promise to identify victims of the September 11th attacks, using advanced DNA technology to put names to remains nearly a quarter-century later. This ongoing effort recently led to the first-time identification of three more victims, bringing a measure of closure to their families. The process is incredibly difficult due to the degradation of DNA from heat, chemicals, and other factors at Ground Zero. Despite these challenges, forensic scientists re-test bone fragments, some as small as a Tic Tac, with new methods, successfully identifying over 60% of the 2,753 victims.</p>

Rahm's performance was strong enough to hold off his closest season-long competitor, Joaquin Niemann of Chile. The result also had positive implications for Rahm's former Ryder Cup teammates Lee Westwood and Ian Poulter, as their finishes ensured they would not be relegated from the league for the 2026 season.</p>
