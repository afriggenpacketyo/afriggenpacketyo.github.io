          <h2>Blood Test for Alzheimer's Diagnosis Set to Launch in US</h2>
          <div class="timestamp">2025-05-21 00:51:29 EDT</div>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>A new blood test developed by Fujirebio Holdings is poised to revolutionize Alzheimer's diagnosis in the United States, becoming available in late June at approximately 50 research institutions and hospitals. The FDA-cleared test detects amyloid, a key protein associated with Alzheimer's, in individuals aged 55 and older exhibiting symptoms. This method offers a significantly less expensive and invasive alternative to PET scans and cerebrospinal fluid tests, potentially reducing the diagnostic process from weeks to roughly 30 minutes. The advent of this blood test is expected to facilitate wider access to novel Alzheimer's treatments like Leqembi and Kisunla, which have previously been hampered by the cumbersome diagnostic procedures.</p>

        </div>
        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>The U.S. Senate has unanimously passed a bill proposing a tax deduction of up to $25,000 on tips for eligible tipped workers. Spearheaded by Sen. Ted Cruz, the bill extends business tax credits for payroll taxes on tips in beauty and spa services. This initiative aims to provide financial relief to approximately 4 million workers in tipped occupations, such as waiters, waitresses, barbers, and cosmetologists, where tips are a customary part of their income. The bill stipulates that employees with compensation exceeding $160,000 in the prior tax year would not be eligible for the tax deduction, and the measure is estimated to cost $110 billion in federal revenues over 10 years.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Japan's farm minister, Taku Eto, resigned following public outcry over his statement about never having to buy rice due to receiving it as gifts, a remark that angered citizens facing rising rice prices. This resignation comes amid Prime Minister Shigeru Ishiba's government grappling with low approval ratings and ahead of critical Upper House elections, with former Environment Minister Koizumi Shinjiro succeeding Eto. Soaring rice prices, driven by weather and protectionist policies, have fueled discontent, pushing Ishiba's cabinet approval rating to a low of 27.4%. The agriculture ministry's attempts to curb prices by releasing government stockpiles have proven ineffective, while demand has increased due to high tourist footfall.</p>

          <p>President Donald Trump announced plans for the "Golden Dome" missile defense shield, aiming to expand the country's air defense system, similar to Israel‚Äôs Iron Dome.

Trump claims the Golden Dome will intercept missiles from any location, including space, and be operational before the end of his term. Defense Secretary Pete Hegseth hailed the project as a "game changer," while Gen. Michael Guetlein will oversee its development.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>The media's focus on young men allegedly driving the rise of the far right is empirically flawed and misses a more significant shift in public opinion among young people, according to a recent article. While surveys show a gender gap in support of far-right parties, young women stand out as the more politically interesting demographic, turning in ever greater numbers towards the left. This trend presents a political opportunity for center-left parties to focus on the priorities and values of female voters, such as climate change and strengthening the welfare state, rather than pandering to the reactionary politics of the far right.</p>

Chengdu's appeal reflects a growing disillusionment among young people who see an economy that no longer guarantees the opportunities it once did.

          <p>Veterinary students are in high demand as California and the rest of the nation experience a shortage of veterinary professionals, driven by high turnover rates, rising student debt, and increased pet ownership. The lack of animal medical care has led to overcrowded shelters and a rise in pet illnesses. However, the profession faces challenges, including tuition costs of roughly $67,000 per year, leading to large student debt, and a high suicide rate among veterinarians. The increasing willingness of owners to spend on pet care has made investments in veterinary medicine popular among corporations and private-equity firms, causing prices for visits to increase.</p>

O'Connor, the Allegheny County controller, will face Republican Tony Moreno in the general election, but Pittsburgh has not had a Republican mayor since 1932.
