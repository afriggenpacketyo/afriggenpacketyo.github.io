          <h2>Japan Shifts Towards Arms Exports Amid Security Concerns</h2>
          <div class="timestamp">2025-06-16 22:01:02 EDT</div>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Japan, known for its pacifist constitution, is increasingly focused on arms exports to strengthen ties with allies and bolster its defense industry. Defense Minister Gen Nakatani aims to promote Japan's defense exports, and Prime Minister Shigeru Ishiba attended a defense exhibition, signaling a policy shift. This move is driven by the need to enhance interoperability with allies and develop Japan's defense industrial base, which has suffered due to reliance on U.S. weapon imports. By exporting arms, Japan seeks to standardize maintenance processes, create joint training opportunities, and achieve economies of scale in domestic production. </p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>The Society of Radiographers (SoR) is cautioning against patients filming their medical treatments for platforms like TikTok and Instagram, citing risks to themselves and NHS staff. Such filming, often done without permission, can distract staff and compromise patient privacy by revealing medical data of others in the vicinity. NHS staff members have reported feeling uncomfortable and anxious when patients or their relatives film procedures, raising concerns about potential breaches of confidentiality and professional standards. The SoR emphasizes the need for clear NHS policies to address this issue.</p>

          <p>California lawmakers have introduced a bill to prohibit law enforcement officers from concealing their faces while on duty, with certain exceptions. The proposed law aims to increase transparency and accountability in response to immigration raids by masked federal officers. The bill would make it a misdemeanor for officers to cover their faces, with exceptions for SWAT teams and medical reasons. The U.S. Department of Homeland Security criticized the proposal, citing safety concerns for officers, while supporters argue it promotes public trust and discourages impersonation.</p>

The project involves exhuming unidentified crime victims from paupers' graves and using DNA analysis to find matches. The effort has provided closure for families and restored the victims' identities, with other cities expressing interest in launching similar projects. </p>

          <p>Singer Nezza sang a Spanish version of ‚ÄúThe Star-Spangled Banner‚Äù at Dodger Stadium, despite initial resistance, to show solidarity with the Latino community amid immigration sweeps. Her performance has sparked discussions about Clotilde Arias, the Latina composer who created the official Spanish translation of the anthem, ‚ÄúEl Pend√≥n Estrellado,‚Äù in 1945. Arias' work was commissioned by the U.S. State Department during World War II to strengthen ties with Latin American countries. Nezza‚Äôs performance serves as a reminder of the contributions of Latinos to American history and culture.</p>
