          <h2>Photographer Explores Stargazing as a Reflection of Inner Contemplation</h2>

        </div>
        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Bieke Depoorter's new book, "Blinked Myself Awake," explores the act of stargazing and its connection to introspection. Depoorter captures images of people observing the cosmos, emphasizing the relationship between looking outward and looking inward. The book combines memoir and image in a series of eclectic riffs on the history of astronomy, the practice of stargazing and the relationship between photography and objectivity. The subjects in her photographs, with their dedication to the celestial, serve as a reminder of the wonder that precedes knowledge, especially in a world increasingly fixated on self-reflection through screens.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>This article addresses and debunks several false claims made about wind energy, particularly those amplified by social media and former US President Donald Trump. It clarifies that there is no scientific evidence linking offshore wind activities to whale deaths, that wind turbines account for a relatively small fraction of bird deaths compared to other causes, and that while some wind turbine blades end up in landfills, efforts are underway to improve recycling and repurposing. The article also explains that wind turbines not turning does not equate to inefficiency, as downtime is often necessary for maintenance or due to unsuitable wind conditions.</p>

        </div>
        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>The article examines the concept of time limits on federal rental aid, focusing on a program in Delaware that requires recipients to work and offers savings incentives. While some argue that time limits encourage self-sufficiency and turnover, others worry about the potential for increased homelessness. The Delaware program's success is attributed to its combination of work requirements, financial support, and savings accounts, but experts caution that time limits may not be effective without adequate resources and affordable housing options. The experiences in Washington state, where time limits were ultimately abandoned, underscore the complexities and challenges of implementing such policies.</p>

          <p>China's younger generation is reshaping the country's liquor market as they increasingly favor low-alcohol, fruit-flavored beverages over traditional grain-based baijiu. This shift is prompting liquor brands to innovate and diversify their product offerings to appeal to younger consumers, particularly urban women.
