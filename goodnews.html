While his exact role remains unclear, he will appear throughout the season, adding a blend of 90's nostalgia to the broadcasts. NBC is also bringing back John Tesh's "Roundball Rock" and player introductions to enhance the viewing experience.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>The article explores the costs associated with credit counseling, a service that provides expert financial guidance, budget assistance, and debt management strategies. While initial consultations with nonprofit credit counseling agencies are typically free, enrolling in a debt management plan incurs setup and monthly maintenance fees, generally ranging from $25 to $50, capped at $79 per month nationwide. Credit counseling is presented as a cost-effective debt relief option compared to debt forgiveness, debt consolidation, and bankruptcy, as it can improve credit scores over time and offers professional guidance and reduced interest rates.</p>

          <p>President Trump is urging pharmaceutical companies to reduce their drug prices to align with those in other high-income countries, threatening strict caps on Medicare earnings if they fail to comply. Trump stated that the U.S. will no longer subsidize healthcare for foreign nations and aims for immediate price reductions of 50% to 90% for some drugs. The plan, an expansion of the "most favored nation" concept, seeks to allow Americans to buy drugs directly from manufacturers at the lowest global prices, though the industry opposes this approach, arguing it could stifle innovation. </p>

Only three non-Brazilians have previously managed the team, coaching a combined seven games. Ancelotti, a decorated coach with five Champions League titles and domestic success in multiple European countries, is the first true European titan to take the helm. This decision reflects a growing acceptance of foreign coaching in Brazil's domestic league, influenced by Jorge Jesus's successful tenure at Flamengo, and could be controversial as Ancelotti may want to manage the team from Europe.</p>

He claims the draft outcome triggered previous conditions and caused emotional disturbance, leading to therapy sessions.

Rising costs of housing, healthcare, and insurance, combined with increased responsibility for retirement funding, contribute to this challenge. Experts argue that structural issues, rather than lifestyle choices, make it harder for young people to save for traditional markers of success, such as homeownership. In response, young adults are adapting by living with parents longer, sharing childcare, and seeking new ways to build community.</p>

Key measures include tightening work visa requirements by generally requiring a degree-level qualification, extending the residency wait for indefinite leave to remain to 10 years, and scrapping the dedicated care visa for social care workers. The government also intends to increase language requirements for work visas and review family rights in immigration cases, though there is no overall cap on net migration.

The conflict escalated rapidly, leading to heavy civilian casualties and displacement, and raised concerns about the potential use of nuclear weapons.

The agreement, struck in Switzerland, involves both countries lowering tariffs by 115%, reducing the U.S. tariff on Chinese imports to 30% and China's rate on American goods to 10%. Investors cheered the news, but cautioned that volatility could return as the 90-day tariff pause approaches its end, with tech, retail, and travel companies seeing widespread gains.</p>

          <p>The United States and China have agreed to temporarily reduce tariffs significantly for 90 days, signaling progress in trade negotiations. Both sides will lower tariffs by 115 percentage points, with the U.S. reducing its tariffs on Chinese goods to about 30% and China reducing its levies on American imports to 10%. This agreement aims to address concerns in their economic and trade relationship and includes easing some non-tariff barriers, but some analysts remain skeptical about the long-term commitment to a permanent agreement.</p>

          <p>A power failure caused major disruptions across the London Underground network, London Overground, and the Elizabeth line, leading to suspensions and severe delays. The issues stemmed from a power outage in south-west London, which has since been restored, but delays and line suspensions are ongoing. Several stations were affected, including Waterloo and Embankment, with commuters facing significant challenges in their travel plans. Transport for London attributed the outage to a National Grid issue and is working to restore normal services.</p>

          <p>The Indian Premier League (IPL) is expected to resume in the coming days after a ceasefire was announced following recent military clashes between India and Pakistan. The league had been suspended, but with the easing of tensions, plans are being made to complete the remaining 16 games, potentially involving fewer venues or more doubleheaders. Despite some player departures, many overseas players and coaches remained in India, and the league's value as a lucrative sports tournament underscores the strong desire to see it completed.</p>

          <p>President Trump announced that China "agreed to open up" following an agreement to temporarily slash tariffs on each other's goods, but offered few details about the specific commitments. Trump indicated that these commitments have not been finalized, emphasizing the need to "get it papered." The U.S. agreed to reduce tariffs on China to 30%, while Beijing will lower tariffs on U.S. goods to 10%, with Trump suggesting that tariffs would not revert to previous levels even if a longer-term deal is not reached. He also said that he talked to Apple CEO Tim Cook, who said he's going to be building a lot of plants in the United States for Apple.</p>

          <p>Sir Keir Starmer has promised the government's new immigration measures will mean net migration falls "significantly" over the next four years. The prime minister unveiled plans to ban recruitment of care workers from overseas, tighten access to skilled worker visas and raise the costs to employers in an effort to curb near record net migration. He did not set a precise target, but the Home Office estimated the policies could lead to a 100,000 drop in immigration per year by 2029 - based on analysis of just eight of the core policies where "a quantitative assessment" could be made. Conservative Leader Kemi Badenoch said: "This is nowhere near the scale of the change we need to see."</p>
