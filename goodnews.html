          <p>This opinion piece recounts the seven-year journey of a Fox News production team investigating the 1975 disappearance of Teamsters boss Jimmy Hoffa for the "Riddle" documentary series. The producer details the process of chasing leads from Detroit to New Jersey, debunking long-held theories, and collaborating with experts and the Hoffa family. The article highlights the journalistic persistence of correspondent Eric Shawn, culminating in a recent interview with James P. Hoffa, Jimmy's son, fifty years after the infamous event.</p>

Elliott, known for its tech-focused activism and experience owning data centers, sees long-term value in Equinix's expansion to meet AI-driven demand. The article suggests Elliott could push for improved market communication, cost optimization, and financial restructuring to boost shareholder returns, potentially seeking a board seat to influence strategy.

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Following football coach Deion Sanders' recent surgery for bladder cancer, this article explains the neobladder reconstruction procedure. Surgeons use a segment of the patient's own small intestine to create a new bladder, which is then connected to the kidneys and urethra. The technique avoids organ rejection and allows patients to urinate voluntarily, although it requires retraining and can lead to incontinence. Sanders' public discussion of his experience is being praised for reducing the stigma associated with the surgery's side effects.</p>

Jim Irish's health had declined significantly after complications from a procedure, placing him in urgent need of a transplant. His wife, Mirna, immediately volunteered and was found to be a rare genetic match. After overcoming additional health hurdles, the couple is scheduled for the transplant surgery, a profound test of their wedding vows and a testament to their bond.</p>

          <p>This opinion column pushes back against recent comments by a Philadelphia 76ers executive and others who have questioned the legitimacy of the Los Angeles Lakers' 2020 NBA championship. The author argues that winning inside the COVID-19 "bubble" required immense courage, mental fortitude, and resilience from players who were isolated from family during a global pandemic. The piece contends that instead of an asterisk, the title deserves an exclamation point for overcoming unprecedented challenges, and that dismissing it is a product of "Lakers jealousy."</p>

          <p>The animated Netflix film "K-pop Demon Hunters" has become a massive success in South Korea, celebrated for its detailed and accurate portrayal of Korean culture, folklore, and daily life. Despite being an American production, local audiences have praised its verisimilitude, from depictions of K-pop history to everyday mannerisms like how utensils are placed at a restaurant. The film's popularity highlights the increasingly fluid, global nature of the "K-wave," where cultural products are resonating deeply both at home and abroad, regardless of their origin.</p>

          <p>Workers at four Blue Bottle coffee shops in the San Francisco Bay Area have voted to unionize, joining a growing movement of barista-led organizing across the United States. The employees will join the Blue Bottle Independent Union, which first formed in Boston. The baristas are seeking higher wages to cope with the high cost of living, improved benefits, and the return of perks lost after Nestlé acquired the specialty coffee chain. The company has stated it respects the workers' right to union representation.</p>

          <p>In a landmark ruling, former Colombian President Álvaro Uribe has been convicted of witness tampering and bribery and sentenced to 12 years of house arrest. This is the first time a former head of state in Colombia has been found guilty in a criminal trial. The court found that Uribe paid jailed paramilitaries to retract testimony linking him to right-wing militia groups responsible for atrocities during the country's civil war. Human rights groups have hailed the verdict as a major step for accountability in a nation with a long history of impunity.</p>

          <p>A growing number of young professionals are choosing to live in the mainland Chinese city of Shenzhen while commuting daily to their jobs in Hong Kong. The trend is driven by the significant cost savings on rent, allowing individuals to afford living alone, which would be prohibitively expensive in Hong Kong. Despite long and crowded daily journeys involving multiple modes of transport and a border crossing, these commuters are trading time for more affordable and spacious living arrangements, a phenomenon widely discussed on Chinese social media.</p>

          <p>A federal appeals court has upheld a temporary order that blocks the Trump administration from conducting indiscriminate immigration arrests in Southern California. The ruling affirms a lower court's decision, which found a "mountain of evidence" that enforcement tactics were unconstitutionally targeting people based on factors like race, language, or location. The lawsuit was filed by advocacy groups after federal agents were seen rounding up immigrants from workplaces and public spaces, with judges questioning the government's claim that its agents were not already prohibited from such conduct.</p>
