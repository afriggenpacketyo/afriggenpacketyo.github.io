          <p>The British government will underwrite a £1.5 billion loan to support Jaguar Land Rover (JLR) and its suppliers following a prolonged production halt caused by a cyberattack. The attack, which occurred at the end of August, has cost the automaker an estimated £50 million per week and threatened the viability of smaller businesses in its supply chain. This financial support aims to protect thousands of jobs across the UK while JLR works to recover its systems and resume operations. The loan is intended to help JLR manage payments to its 700 suppliers as it navigates the unprecedented industrial disruption. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>A new memoir by King Charles III’s former butler, Grant Harrold, recounts Prince Philip's well-known reputation for unfiltered and often profane commentary. The book describes an incident at Prince Harry and Meghan Markle’s wedding where the late Duke of Edinburgh was overheard expressing relief that the ceremony was over. Harrold and other royal experts note that Philip's bluntness was a defining characteristic, often making palace staff nervous but also endearing him to others who appreciated his candid nature. The article compiles several of his most famous and controversial remarks, painting a picture of a royal who consistently spoke his mind.</p>

          <p>Faced with home prices that have risen 56% since 2020, a growing number of Americans are co-buying homes with friends or relatives to overcome affordability challenges. This trend is particularly prevalent among younger generations and single individuals who lack the financial advantage of a dual-income household. While pooling resources unlocks more housing options, it also introduces legal and financial complexities not typically covered by marital property laws, prompting experts to advise detailed written agreements. The motivation extends beyond finances, as many co-buyers also seek the companionship and community that shared living arrangements can provide.</p>

          <p>Nvidia CEO Jensen Huang has asserted that China is only "nanoseconds behind" the United States in semiconductor technology, emphasizing the need for American companies to compete vigorously in the global market, including in China. Speaking on a podcast, Huang highlighted China's deep talent pool, strong work ethic, and vibrant internal competition as key factors in its rapid technological progress. He argued that allowing U.S. tech firms to compete and invest in China is crucial for maximizing America's economic success and geopolitical influence. Huang expressed his hope that Beijing will maintain an open market, which he believes is in China's best interest.</p>

          <h2>Swiss Citizens Vote on Introduction of Government-Run Electronic ID System</h2>

          <p>Switzerland is holding a second national referendum on the introduction of an electronic identity card system, after a similar proposal was rejected in 2021 over data privacy concerns. The revised plan addresses previous criticisms by ensuring the system is optional, managed entirely by public entities, and stores data on users' smartphones rather than a central server. Supporters argue the e-ID will streamline bureaucratic processes online, from signing contracts to age verification. However, opponents remain wary of potential privacy infringements and data misuse, forcing another public vote on an issue that balances modern convenience with Switzerland's strong tradition of citizen privacy.</p>

          <p>The rarely used "envelope rule" could be implemented on the final day of the Ryder Cup due to a neck injury sustained by European player Viktor Hovland. This rule is a contingency for when a player must withdraw from the final day's singles matches due to illness or injury. At the start of the day, each team captain secretly selects one player and places their name in a sealed envelope. If an opponent withdraws, the player in the envelope is also withdrawn, and the match is declared a tie, with each team receiving half a point, ensuring the competition's balance is maintained.</p>

          <p>Citizens in Zurich, Switzerland's most populous city, are voting in a referendum on a proposal to severely restrict the use of leaf blowers and vacuums to curb noise and air pollution. If passed, the measure would completely ban gas-powered models and only permit the use of electric devices for three months of the year, from October to December. Supporters of the ban argue that the machines are disruptive, spread fine dust, and harm microorganisms, recommending rakes as an alternative. Opponents, however, view the proposal as an unnecessary and overly restrictive prohibition that would complicate property maintenance.</p>

          <p>The UK's Labour Party has committed to starting construction on three new towns in England before the next general election as part of its plan to build 1.5 million new homes by 2029. A taskforce has identified Tempsford in Bedfordshire, Leeds South Bank, and Crews Hill in north London as the most promising initial sites. The plan involves creating development corporations with special powers to acquire land and grant planning permission, modeling the regeneration of Stratford for the 2012 Olympics. The initiative aims to address the national housing crisis, with a requirement that at least 40% of the new homes be classified as affordable.</p>

          <p>Despite assembling a physically imposing squad and hiring a specialist set-piece coach, Newcastle United has struggled to convert dead-ball opportunities into goals this season. The team, featuring several players over 6-foot-6, has a low goal tally from corners and free-kicks compared to top rivals like Arsenal, who excel in this area. Manager Eddie Howe has acknowledged the issue, stating that "something is not quite clicking" and taking responsibility for improving performance. The article analyzes the team's tactical shifts, including an increased use of long throws, as they seek to capitalize on their height advantage and make set-pieces a more reliable source of goals.</p>

          <p>As the regular season concludes, the Los Angeles Dodgers are finalizing their roster for the upcoming wild-card series, with key questions surrounding the health of players like Max Muncy and Will Smith. Beyond injuries, the most significant decisions involve the pitching staff, particularly the composition of the bullpen. The team must balance its abundance of left-handed relievers with a need for more right-handed options, potentially using starter Tyler Glasnow in a relief role. The order of the starting rotation, including whether to start Shohei Ohtani in Game 1, also remains a strategic decision the team is keeping private ahead of the postseason.</p>
