          <p>Chinese Defence Minister Dong Jun expressed China's support for South Africa in opposing global ‚Äúhegemony and bullying,‚Äù amid rising tensions between Pretoria and Washington. Dong met with General Rudzani Maphwanya, chief of the South African National Defence Force, in Beijing, emphasizing historical ties rooted in China's support for the African National Congress during apartheid. China is promoting its Global Security Initiative as an alternative approach to global security, prioritizing dialogue and partnerships over confrontation. The statement comes as South Africa faces scrutiny from the US regarding its relationship with Russia and US asylum policies.</p>

Umaga, who won his sole England cap in 2021, was born in Halifax, England, but his father Mike played for Samoa.

          <p>Chinese Premier Li Qiang has called for accelerating the application of new technologies, as China aims to reduce its dependence on US tech and develop a leading industrial base. Li's comments come as China faces new US export restrictions on critical technologies, including jet engines and chip design software. The US has indicated a willingness to ease these restrictions if China allows more rare earth mineral exports, with trade talks ongoing in London. Li urged for stronger links between supply and demand to translate research into practical applications.</p>

          <p>The F1 2026 calendar will feature the Madrid Grand Prix, replacing Imola due to pressure on the number of events. Imola's return to the schedule in 2020 was facilitated by the pandemic and Domenicali's support, but demand for new locations is changing priorities. Spa will host only four races from 2026 under a new six-year contract, and Thailand is pushing for a race in Bangkok. Spain having two races in 2026 is a temporary situation due to existing contracts, but Barcelona may rotate into the calendar in future years.</p>

The announcement comes after the UK government changed its rules about the driverless cars once again. It was originally aiming for the tech to come to British roads in 2026, then the date was changed to the second half of 2027. But it now says it is introducing an accelerated framework for small autonomous "bus and taxi like" commercial services to get them underway earlier. It is not yet clear whether the vehicles in Uber's trial will be available for customers to use - the firm says it is still working out the details. It has previously said it intends to add them as a regular option via its UK app as soon as legislation allows.</p>
