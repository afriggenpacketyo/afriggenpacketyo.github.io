        </div>
        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>A group of eight OPEC+ nations, including Russia and Saudi Arabia, has agreed to increase their collective oil production by 548,000 barrels per day in August. This figure surpasses the initially anticipated hike and accelerates the reversal of previous voluntary supply cuts. The OPEC Secretariat justified the decision by citing a stable global economic outlook and healthy market fundamentals, including low oil inventories. This move indicates growing confidence among major producers regarding global energy demand and economic stability for the remainder of the year. (not investment advice)</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Doctors are addressing the popular belief that drinking soda, particularly Coke, can alleviate migraines, a condition affecting millions of Americans. Experts suggest that the caffeine in these beverages can act as a nerve disruptor and constrict blood vessels in the brain, which may provide temporary relief for some individuals. However, they caution that caffeine can also be a migraine trigger and that relying on sugary drinks is not a recommended or healthy long-term solution. Healthier alternatives like watermelon with salt for electrolytes or organic coffee are suggested for managing headache symptoms.</p>

        </div>
        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Credit scoring company FICO has announced it will begin incorporating buy now, pay later (BNPL) loan data into its credit score calculations, a move that will affect millions of consumers. For users who make timely payments, this change could help build a positive credit history, especially for younger individuals or those with limited credit. However, it also introduces a risk, as late payments or accumulating too much BNPL debt could negatively impact scores, similar to traditional credit products. While the new scoring model will be available this fall, widespread adoption by lenders is expected to be gradual.</p>

          <p>A new study by researchers from several prominent Chinese universities suggests that sildenafil, the active ingredient in drugs like Viagra, could have potential as a cancer-fighting agent. The research indicates that the drug may combat tumors by strengthening dendritic cells, a crucial component of the body's anti-tumor immune response. As a tumor progresses, these 'intelligence agents' of the immune system can become depleted or impaired. According to the findings, published in the journal Nature, sildenafil appears capable of reversing this process, potentially offering a new form of tumor immunotherapy strategy.</p>

          <p>A Pasadena community demonstrated strong support for a 14-year-old boy, Christopher Luna Garcia, who took over his mother's tamale street vending business after she became fearful following a local immigration raid. An actor and activist organized a social media campaign that drew a large crowd, resulting in the sale of over 500 tamales and raising more than $1,500 for the family. The event highlights a trend of American-born children stepping up for their immigrant parents amid heightened federal immigration enforcement. Supporters gathered not only to buy food but also to stand in solidarity against what they described as fear-inducing tactics in their community.</p>

          <p>Hamas has reportedly delivered a 'positive response' to the latest US-backed proposal for a Gaza ceasefire and hostage release deal, stating it is ready to enter negotiations. However, a senior Palestinian official indicated that Hamas has requested several changes to the plan. These include a halt to a US-supported aid system, a full Israeli troop withdrawal to pre-offensive positions, and a US guarantee that the war will not resume if talks fail. The 60-day proposal is believed to involve a staggered release of Israeli hostages in exchange for Palestinian prisoners and an immediate increase in humanitarian aid.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>The topic of crying at work has entered public discussion, prompting a debate on whether it is a sign of weakness or simply a human response to pressure and personal events. Executive coaches and career experts argue that modern workplaces should embrace emotional intelligence, viewing authentic emotional expression as a strength rather than a liability. They suggest that compassionate employers who support staff through difficult moments are more likely to foster loyalty and motivation. While some still view crying, particularly by leaders, as unprofessional, others see it as a powerful display of humanity and deep care for one's work.</p>

          <p>The recent Ethereum Community Conference (EthCC) in Cannes highlighted the blockchain's growing integration into institutional finance, with major players building on its infrastructure. Robinhood announced the launch of tokenized U.S. stocks on an Ethereum-based network, while firms like Deutsche Bank and BlackRock are developing their own tokenization platforms. Despite price volatility, institutions are reportedly drawn to Ethereum for its stability, security, and decade-long track record of continuous operation. This shift from speculative hype to utility marks a significant maturation for Ethereum as it becomes the new plumbing for global finance. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>State-owned energy giant Sinopec has launched a significant floating solar power station in the coastal waters of Qingdao, a breakthrough for the industry. The project, which spans approximately 60,000 square meters, is part of a larger initiative that will collectively generate 16.7 million kilowatt-hours of electricity annually. This output is expected to reduce carbon dioxide emissions by 14,000 tonnes each year. The offshore location enhances efficiency by 5 to 8 percent due to the cooling effect of the water, marking a key milestone in China's efforts to harness renewable energy from its surrounding oceans.</p>

          <p>Following recent US and Israeli strikes on Iran, China's Foreign Minister Wang Yi has called for the negotiation of a 'new international agreement' to resolve the Iranian nuclear issue. Speaking in Paris, Wang expressed deep concern over escalating regional tensions and advocated for placing Iran's nuclear activities under strict IAEA supervision. This diplomatic push positions China as a key mediator and responsible power while intensifying its criticism of the US and Israeli military actions. The call for a new deal underscores Beijing's effort to find a diplomatic path forward and prevent further conflict in the Middle East.</p>

England enters as the defending champion, while the Netherlands won the tournament in 2017, and France is on an eight-game winning streak.

          <p>Two recent studies offer conflicting views on whether people from different cultures perceive the world differently, reigniting a long-standing scientific debate. One study found that people from 'carpentered' Western environments tend to see rectangles in an optical illusion, while those from rural Namibia see circles. However, another study convincingly argues against this 'carpentered world' hypothesis for the well-known Müller-Lyer illusion. The author suggests that while perceptual diversity between cultures is plausible, we must also study differences within groups and resist simple stereotypes, recognizing that all perception is an active, brain-based construction of reality.</p>

          <p>For the first time in over 100 years, Paris has officially reopened sections of the Seine River for public swimming. The ban, in place since 1923 due to pollution, was lifted after a massive €1.4 billion cleanup effort spurred by the Paris 2024 Olympics. Three designated and supervised swimming zones have been established with amenities like changing rooms and showers. This move is part of a broader city initiative to enhance quality of life and adapt to climate change, fulfilling a long-held promise to make the iconic river accessible to residents and tourists once again.</p>
