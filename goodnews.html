          <p>World champions New Zealand secured their spot in the Women's Rugby World Cup semi-finals by defeating a spirited South Africa side 46-17 in Exeter. Despite a remarkable first-half performance where South Africa, appearing in their first World Cup quarter-final, evened the score, the Black Ferns clicked into gear after the break. They dominated the second half, scoring five tries, with full-back Renee Holmes and number eight Kaipo Olsen-Baker each grabbing two scores. This decisive victory propels New Zealand into a semi-final match against either Canada or Australia, marking the end of South Africa's memorable World Cup campaign on a high note with a late try.</p>

          <p>A couple chose to defy traditional life paths by selling 90% of their belongings and living in 10 different cities over two years, a decision initially prompted by a desire to avoid a "boring" routine. This nomadic adventure, documented in the article, unexpectedly fostered significant financial savings and profound personal growth. By shedding possessions and constantly navigating new environments, they learned to live with less, strategically invested in mutual funds, and discovered deeper facets of their relationship and individual identities. Now married with a daughter, they continue to embrace minimalist principles and plan to embark on a similar journey with their child, underscoring the transformative power of intentional lifestyle changes.</p>

          <p>This article strongly debunks the "Make America Healthy Again" (MAHA) movement's assertion that the current generation is the "sickest in American history," presenting evidence of substantial health progress over decades. It highlights a dramatic increase in US life expectancy, nearly doubling since the late 19th century, primarily driven by victories against infectious diseases, advancements in cardiovascular care, and declining cancer mortality. The piece also credits a cleaner environment, safer workplaces, and evolving diagnostic criteria for improved health outcomes. While acknowledging real contemporary health issues like obesity and mental health, the author warns against catastrophizing, urging a focus on building upon existing public health achievements rather than dismantling them.</p>

          <p>Renowned British TV presenter Davina McCall has announced her engagement to celebrity hairdresser Michael Douglas, seven years after their relationship began. This joyful news follows months after McCall revealed her benign brain tumor was "not coming back" following complex surgery last year, a period during which Douglas provided unwavering care and support. McCall, a prominent figure on British television and current host of "Stranded on Honeymoon Island," has been married twice previously and is a mother of three children. The couple's connection dates back to the early 2000s when they met on the set of "Big Brother," with their romantic relationship developing after her 2018 divorce.</p>

          <p>Activist investor Sachem Head Capital Management, led by Scott Ferguson, is advocating for a business combination between Performance Food Group (PFG) and US Foods, threatening a proxy fight to achieve this. Sachem Head has nominated four experienced candidates to PFG's board, including former Sysco CFO R. Chris Kreidler, to drive operational improvements and explore the merger. The article highlights significant potential synergies, estimated between $800 million and $1 billion, from such a merger, which would create substantial value for shareholders. Despite a previous Sysco/US Foods merger being blocked, Sachem Head believes a PFG/US Foods deal could succeed under the current regulatory environment. (not investment advice)</p>

          <h2>UnitedHealth Shares Soar Post-Berkshire Hathaway Disclosure, But Profitability Remains Uncertain</h2>

          <p>UnitedHealth Group shares have surged nearly 30% since Berkshire Hathaway disclosed its purchase of over 5 million shares between April and June. While Berkshire's endorsement likely fueled a significant portion of these gains, it remains unclear if the investment is currently profitable, as the stock is up only 13% since June 30. Analysts are incrementally positive after meeting with UnitedHealth's management, with one raising her price target, suggesting a potential turnaround for the stock, which is still down 30% year-to-date. Meanwhile, Kraft Heinz shares slipped further after Berkshire's Warren Buffett expressed disappointment over its plans to split, an action he opposed. (not investment advice)</p>

          <h2>Convenience Stores Gain Market Share in Morning Meal Traffic, Outpacing Fast-Food Chains</h2>
          <div class="timestamp">2025-09-13 08:00:01 EDT</div>
        </div>
        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Convenience stores are increasingly winning over breakfast customers, with their morning meal traffic rising 9% in the three months ended July, compared to a 1% increase for fast-food chains. This trend, driven by "food-forward convenience stores" investing in prepared food options, signals a shift in consumer habits. Fast-food giants like McDonald's are seeing their breakfast traffic decline, as consumers, mindful of rising menu prices, either eat at home or opt for the perceived value and wider variety offered by c-stores. This dynamic has led fast-food chains to study convenience store strategies to regain market share. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>Tokyo is currently hosting the World Athletics Championships, drawing tens of thousands of spectators to its National Stadium, four years after the fan-restricted 2020 Olympics. The event is notably marked by the controversial re-imposition of gender testing for female athletes, requiring an SRY gene test to detect a "Y" chromosome. World Athletics defends this policy as crucial for protecting the integrity of women's sport, despite criticism that the test is unreliable and reflects broader "culture wars" against transgender inclusion. Although France banned such screening for non-medical reasons, 95% of female athletes complied with the September 1 deadline. The championships feature a variety of track and field events, including Evan Dunfee's win in the men's race walk.</p>

        </div>
        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>New FDA guidelines have narrowed COVID-19 vaccine approval for this year to individuals 65 and older, and those at high risk for severe illness, a significant shift from previous universal recommendations. This change has created confusion and made vaccine access more challenging for many, who may need to "self-attest" to risk factors or obtain a doctor's prescription. The article details eligible conditions, including various chronic diseases and pregnancy, and notes that only Moderna's vaccine is approved for children as young as six months with risk factors. Supply is expected to be sufficient, but insurance coverage may be uncertain until CDC recommendations are finalized.</p>
