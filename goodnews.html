          <p>During a meeting with the Canadian Prime Minister, President Trump digressed to criticize the construction of former President Obama's Presidential Center in Chicago, calling it a 'disaster' and blaming 'woke' construction practices and DEI initiatives for significant cost overruns and delays. Trump claimed that Obama wanted to be politically correct instead of hiring tough construction workers. The Obama Foundation refuted Trump's claims, stating that the project is on track and will be an economic engine for Chicago. The foundation also emphasized the use of union labor and expects the center to open in 2026.</p>
