          <p>The FAA is investigating a 90-second communication outage at the Denver Air Route Traffic Control Center, during which controllers had to use backup frequencies to relay instructions to pilots. According to the agency, the outage did not impact operations or aircraft separation. This incident follows similar disruptions at a Philadelphia facility affecting Newark Airport, raising concerns about the aging infrastructure of the air traffic control system. Transportation Secretary Sean Duffy has acknowledged the need for system upgrades, noting reliance on eBay and 3D printing for replacement parts, and the Trump administration is pushing for a multi-billion dollar overhaul to address these issues. The article emphasizes that while these incidents raise concerns, the FAA maintains that air travel remains safe due to multiple redundancies. </p>

          <p>Seniors may find it beneficial to explore certain insurance policies this spring to enhance their financial protection. Medicare supplemental insurance can help cover costs not fully covered by traditional Medicare, while long-term care insurance can provide financial assistance for nursing homes, assisted living, or in-home care. Whole life insurance offers a cash component that can be borrowed from during their lifetime and provides a payout to beneficiaries after death. The article advises seniors to research their options and obtain quotes sooner rather than later, as coverage costs generally increase with age. </p>

Miami-Dade County had already voted to remove fluoride from its water supply.

          <p>A new genetics study has traced the migration of the first people to colonize the Americas from modern-day Russia approximately 20,000-30,000 years ago. The study suggests that the languages and traditions of Indigenous groups living in the Americas today can be traced back to these early settlers, and their cultures exist in the genes of modern Indigenous groups. The early settlers split into groups that became isolated in different environmental settings, providing a new genetic and cultural understanding of present-day South American communities.

          <p>The Food and Drug Administration will revisit its approval of azodicarbonamide (ADA), a food additive used to whiten cereal flour and improve bread dough, following safety concerns. Also called azodicarbonamide, the FDA previously approved ADA's use to whiten cereal flour and improve baking bread dough. It is banned in Europe, given the possibility it could result in a possible carcinogen called semicarbazide. The agency will also review the safety of other additives, including BHT and BHA. The review is part of a broader effort to step up scrutiny of previously approved food chemicals.</p>
