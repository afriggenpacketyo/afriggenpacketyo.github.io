          <p>Taiwanese President Lai Ching-te has canceled a planned stopover in the United States on his way to South America, a decision that could ease tensions with Beijing. Reports indicated Washington had informed Lai he could not stop in New York, a move that would have angered China, which views such transits as a violation of its sovereignty. Taiwan's Presidential Office officially attributed the cancellation to domestic priorities, including typhoon recovery efforts. The decision is seen as a potential diplomatic concession that may help create a more favorable environment for a potential meeting between Chinese President Xi Jinping and U.S. President Donald Trump later this year.</p>

          <h2>Political Analyst Views Trump's Scotland Trip as Invaluable Access for UK Prime Minister</h2>

          <p>U.S. President Donald Trump's recent visit to his Scottish golf courses provided UK Prime Minister Keir Starmer with significant, albeit unconventional, diplomatic access. The trip, though notionally private, involved extensive, free-wheeling press interactions where the two leaders discussed a wide range of topics from Gaza to trade. For Starmer, this face time helps solidify a key international relationship, even if it carries the risk of being associated with the president's unpredictable style. Downing Street reportedly views the access as invaluable, hoping it will help align U.S. and European positions on critical issues like the humanitarian crisis in Gaza.</p>

          <p>Alphabet's autonomous driving unit, Waymo, plans to expand its robotaxi service to Dallas, Texas, in 2026, with rental car company Avis Budget Group set to manage the vehicle fleet. This marks another step in Waymo's U.S. expansion, which also targets Miami and Washington, D.C., for future launches. The company is already testing its driverless Jaguar I-PACE vehicles in downtown Dallas and currently operates paid services in five other major cities, including Los Angeles and San Francisco. Waymo has established a lead in the U.S. robotaxi market, conducting over 250,000 paid trips weekly across its operational areas.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>California's state parks department is implementing a new lottery-style drawing system to improve access to campsites at three of its most popular campgrounds: Malibu Creek, Morro Bay, and McArthur-Burney Falls. The system, which has already begun at Malibu Creek, allows campers to enter a free drawing for reservations seven months in advance. This change aims to level the playing field and reduce the frustration of sites being booked within minutes of becoming available. The move is part of a broader effort to streamline the reservation process and give more people a fair chance at securing a spot.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>CNBC's Jim Cramer suggests that recent major trade deals, including the one with the European Union, failed to spark a market rally because investors are preoccupied with more pressing matters this week. He argues that Wall Street is currently focused on upcoming Big Tech earnings reports, the Federal Reserve's meeting on interest rates, and forthcoming employment data. Cramer believes investors have developed "tariff ennui," as trade negotiations have become a prolonged process with predictable patterns. He contends that until the market weathers this week's key economic events, trade policy news will likely have a muted impact on stock performance. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>Amid an offensive slump and defensive struggles, the Los Angeles Dodgers are reportedly looking to acquire an outfielder before the trade deadline, with Minnesota Twins' Harrison Bader emerging as a key target. While the Dodgers' superstar-laden lineup has underperformed, a primary concern is upgrading the team's outfield defense, where both Michael Conforto and Teoscar Hernández have graded poorly. Bader, a premium defender with a solid offensive season, could provide a significant boost in center field. Such a move would support the team's strong starting rotation and better position them for a deep playoff run focused on run prevention.</p>

          <p>Following the death of wrestler Terry Bollea, known as Hulk Hogan, legal experts are re-examining the impact of his landmark lawsuit against Gawker Media. The 2016 case, which resulted in a $140 million verdict for Hogan over the publication of a secret sex tape, is seen as a cultural turning point for media law. While it didn't set new legal precedent, it highlighted the limits of First Amendment protections concerning privacy in the digital age, particularly for newsworthy but graphic content. The verdict reinforced that even public figures have a right to privacy and has influenced how media outlets handle deeply personal information.</p>
