          <p>A federal judge has granted preliminary approval to a $1.5 billion settlement between AI company Anthropic and authors who alleged the firm used nearly half a million pirated books to train its chatbots. The settlement, which pays authors and publishers approximately $3,000 per book, addresses concerns about how materials were obtained. This article highlights the Authors Guild's view that this marks a significant milestone, signaling to AI companies that copyright infringement carries a steep price and will push them towards legal licensing for content.</p>

          <p>A California Senate bill, sparked by an 8-month-old baby being woken by loud commercials, aims to regulate streaming ad volumes, potentially impacting services nationwide. Federal law already restricts loud ads on traditional TV, but streaming platforms are currently exempt. This article explains that the bill, if signed by Governor Gavin Newsom, could set a precedent for the entire country due to California's market influence. The Motion Picture Association opposes the measure, citing challenges in controlling diverse ad sources, but proponents emphasize consumer frustration.</p>
