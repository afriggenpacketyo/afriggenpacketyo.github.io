          <p>The U.S. Department of Defense is set to become the largest shareholder in MP Materials, America's only operational rare earth mining company, through a $400 million investment. This strategic move aims to bolster the domestic supply chain for critical minerals and reduce reliance on China. The funding will support the expansion of MP Materials' processing capabilities and the construction of a new magnet manufacturing facility, with the Pentagon guaranteeing purchases for a decade. The news caused the company's stock to surge significantly in premarket trading. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>At its recent seminar, OPEC ministers and industry leaders focused on three key energy topics: the green transition, the future oil outlook, and production capacity. Officials advocated for continued investment in hydrocarbons to ensure energy security during the gradual shift to renewables, a stance critics label as greenwashing. The group released its 2050 World Oil Outlook, projecting sustained demand growth driven by developing economies. Ministers also reiterated calls for massive long-term investment in the oil and gas sector to boost dwindling spare capacity and meet future energy needs.</p>

          <p>North Carolina has been ranked as the best U.S. state for business for 2025, praised for its robust economy, strong workforce, and business-friendly policies. The state has successfully attracted major investments, including from aviation startup JetZero and Amazon, which is building new data centers. Despite its economic success and bipartisan support for business growth, the state faces challenges, including a lower ranking in quality of life and a lack of certain worker protections. Potential headwinds also include the economic impact of Hurricane Helene and vulnerability to federal budget cuts and trade tariffs. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>Italian confectionary giant Ferrero has announced its intention to purchase cereal maker WK Kellogg in a deal valued at $3.1 billion. WK Kellogg, which produces iconic brands like Froot Loops and Frosted Flakes, became a standalone company in 2023 after splitting from the snack-focused business Kellanova. This acquisition marks further consolidation in the packaged foods industry, which has faced shifting consumer preferences away from sugary cereals and toward healthier or private-label breakfast options. The news of a potential deal caused WK Kellogg's shares to rise by 30 percent. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>Delta Air Lines has reinstated its 2025 profit forecast, signaling a stronger-than-expected outlook for summer travel and causing its shares to jump 12% in premarket trading. CEO Ed Bastian noted that while booking patterns have shifted to be closer to travel dates, demand has stabilized, particularly for premium seats and corporate travel. The airline now expects full-year adjusted earnings between $5.25 and $6.25 per share, a downward revision from its initial, more optimistic forecast at the start of the year. The positive update provided a boost to the stocks of other U.S. carriers as well. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>Ukrainian drone companies, having gained extensive battlefield experience, are considering exporting their technology as Kyiv prepares to loosen export regulations. This move could transform Ukraine from a customer into a key partner or even a competitor in Europe's defense market. While Ukrainian drones are often built with commercially available parts, their real-world testing provides a significant advantage. The ability to export would attract foreign investment and allow for joint ventures, potentially moving production outside of Ukraine to protect it from attacks and help rearm European allies.</p>

          <p>All 31 construction workers trapped in a collapsed tunnel in the Wilmington area of Los Angeles have been safely rescued without any visible injuries. The incident occurred in the Los Angeles Effluent Outfall Tunnel, a major new wastewater project, when a section collapsed miles from the access point. Twenty-seven workers were initially trapped, and four more went in to assist before rescue teams arrived. A massive response involving over 100 firefighters, including Urban Search and Rescue teams, was mobilized to the scene, with the workers ultimately climbing over a large pile of dirt to escape.</p>

          <h2>Global Birth Rate Decline Prompts Debate on Depopulation Beyond Politics</h2>

        </div>
        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Economist Dean Spears argues that the global decline in birth rates, now below the replacement level of 2.1 in many countries, should be a concern for everyone, not just a political issue. In his book "After the Spike," he posits that a future with fewer people could slow human progress, innovation, and the development of solutions to global challenges like poverty and disease. He challenges the idea that depopulation is an environmental solution, pointing to examples where environmental progress occurred alongside population growth. Spears advocates for a thoughtful conversation about creating a society that better supports families.</p>

          <p>European Commission President Ursula von der Leyen has comfortably survived a no-confidence motion brought by the far-right in the European Parliament. The motion, which criticized her handling of COVID-19 vaccine negotiations, was defeated with 360 votes against it. While the outcome was expected, centrist and left-leaning groups used the debate to express grievances over her perceived cooperation with right-wing parties and to secure policy commitments. Von der Leyen defended her record and called the motion a crude attempt by extremists to polarize society and undermine democratic institutions.</p>

          <p>China has offered a rare glimpse into the production facilities for its fifth-generation stealth fighters, providing a subtle hint about their future deployment on aircraft carriers. During a state television segment focused on the upgraded J-15T carrier-based fighter, the unmentioned J-35 stealth aircraft was visible in the background. A test pilot discussed the technical challenges of designing aircraft for catapult-assisted launches, a feature of China's newest aircraft carrier. The appearance suggests that China is advancing its naval aviation capabilities with next-generation technology.</p>

          <p>Temperatures are set to soar across the UK, peaking this weekend with highs of 34C (93.2F) possible on Friday and Saturday. This marks the third official heatwave of the year for some regions, prompting the UK Health Security Agency to extend yellow heat-health alerts for all of England. The Met Office defines a heatwave by a region-specific temperature threshold being met for at least three consecutive days. The sweltering conditions have also led to an "extreme wildfire warning" in Scotland, as the heat is expected to continue into early next week before cooler weather arrives.</p>

The suspects, a woman and three men aged 17 to 20, were apprehended on suspicion of computer misuse, blackmail, and organized crime offenses. The hacks involved stealing vast amounts of customer and staff data and deploying ransomware, costing M&S an estimated £300m in lost profits.

          <p>Armed police in Romania have conducted raids targeting an organized crime group suspected of stealing millions from the UK's tax authority, HM Revenue & Customs (HMRC). The gang allegedly used a sophisticated phishing operation to steal personal data from UK taxpayers and then made fraudulent claims for tax refunds. Thirteen people were detained in Romania, and another man was arrested in the UK as part of a joint investigation. The scammers are believed to have accessed over 1,000 Government Gateway accounts, laundering the stolen funds through a complex network.</p>
