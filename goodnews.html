          <p>This New York Times article reflects on Desi Arnaz's pivotal role in challenging racial barriers in early television and his broader impact on Hollywood.

His success led to innovations in television production and syndication, and he became a leading Latino executive, paving the way for greater diversity in the entertainment industry. The article argues that Arnaz's story offers valuable lessons for contemporary efforts to promote inclusion.</p>
