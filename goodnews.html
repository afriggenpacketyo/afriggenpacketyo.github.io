          <h2>UK Chancellor Urges Financial Industry to Promote a More Positive View of Share Investing</h2>
          <div class="timestamp">2025-07-15 17:02:23 EDT</div>
        </div>
        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>UK Chancellor Rachel Reeves has called on the financial sector to shift away from a negative narrative surrounding stock and share investments for savers. In a speech, she argued that the focus has been too heavily on risks rather than the potential benefits for growing the economy. The government is collaborating with the Financial Conduct Authority to develop new targeted support for would-be investors. This initiative is part of a broader effort to encourage the investment of savings currently held in cash accounts to bolster UK companies and stimulate economic growth.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Sotheby's is auctioning NWA 16788, the largest known piece of Mars on Earth, with an expected price between $2 million and $4 million. The meteorite, weighing over 54 pounds, represents about 6.5% of all known Martian material on our planet. It is believed to have been dislodged from Mars by an asteroid strike and was discovered in Niger's Agadez Region in 2023. Martian meteorites are exceedingly rare, comprising only about 0.6% of all meteorites found on Earth, making this a significant event for collectors and scientists.</p>

          <p>General Motors has announced it will expand its production of gasoline-powered vehicles by adding the Cadillac Escalade SUV and more Chevrolet Silverado and GMC Sierra trucks to its Orion Assembly plant in Michigan. Production is scheduled to begin in early 2027 to meet sustained high customer demand for these models. The Escalade is currently built in Texas, while the trucks are also produced in Indiana. This decision builds on GM's recent $4 billion investment in U.S. facilities and expands gas vehicle manufacturing at the Orion plant, which was previously slated to be an EV-exclusive facility.</p>

          <p>In an unusual alliance, Amazon is set to use a SpaceX Falcon 9 rocket to launch its next group of 24 Kuiper internet satellites. This move highlights Amazon's urgent need for launch capacity as it races to build its satellite constellation to compete with SpaceX's dominant Starlink service. The Federal Communications Commission has mandated that Amazon must have approximately 1,600 satellites in orbit by mid-2026. This launch marks the first of three booked by Amazon with SpaceX, demonstrating a pragmatic partnership between the rival companies led by Jeff Bezos and Elon Musk.</p>

This pact is the latest development following a series of tariff threats issued by the White House to numerous trading partners earlier this year.</p>
