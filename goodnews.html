          <p>Shares of Contemporary Amperex Technology, the world's largest battery manufacturer, jumped over 16% in their Hong Kong debut, driven by investor optimism in the electronic vehicle sector. The IPO raised HK$35.7 billion ($4.6 billion), marking the largest offering this year, with funds allocated to a new factory in Hungary to supply European automotive clients. CATL faces increased scrutiny from the U.S. and EU, which have placed tariffs on EVs made in China, and the Pentagon has put it on a watchlist over suspected links to China's military. The article notes that CATL's focus remains on markets such as Europe and emerging regions.</p>

          <p>Yuri Grigorovich, a titan of Russian ballet and one of the greatest choreographers of the 20th century, has died at the age of 98. He served as artistic director of the Bolshoi Ballet from 1964 to 1995, leading the company with an iron fist and redefining Soviet ballet through productions like "Ivan the Terrible" and "Romeo and Juliet." Grigorovich was praised for revitalizing male dance, creating demanding roles for men, and his departure from the Bolshoi in 1995 led to a historic dancers' strike. His work was steeped in the traditions of classical ballet, following in the footsteps of his uncle, Georgy Rozai, who studied under Vaslav Nijinsky.</p>

          <p>Former President Joe Biden's diagnosis of prostate cancer has emerged amidst ongoing debates about his mental acuity and allegations of cognitive decline during his presidency. The article notes that some Democrats have avoided discussing Biden's mental state, while others suggest his diagnosis may provide a reason to disengage from such conversations. Republicans, however, continue to raise questions about his capacity to perform his duties.

Davis argues that openness about his health could restore trust with voters and transcend partisan politics. The article notes that unlike Alzheimer's, prostate cancer does not necessarily signal the end of Biden's public life, and his candor could be a way to soothe the fears of many.</p>

          <p>William Goodge, a British ultra-endurance athlete, claims to have broken the world record for running across Australia in 35 days. The article details how he ran approximately 3,800km, the equivalent of two-and-a-half marathons, every day. Goodge ran to raise money for cancer charities, following the death of his mother from cancer in 2018. The record is yet to be verified by Guinness World Records and some have questioned the accuracy of data tracking his speed and heart rate over the course of the run.</p>

          <p>Japanese Prime Minister Shigeru Ishiba is standing by his farm minister, Taku Eto, despite criticism over Eto's comments about receiving plenty of rice from supporters and not needing to buy any. The article reports that opposition parties have called for Eto's resignation, deeming his remarks out of touch with the public's struggle over high rice prices. Ishiba apologized for Eto's insensitive comments but stated that Eto should focus on addressing challenges in agriculture. The article mentions that the ruling coalition is considering ways to mitigate the impact of inflation and higher U.S. tariffs.</p>
