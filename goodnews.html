          <p>With the price of package holidays increasing, many UK travelers are finding innovative ways to save money. The article highlights several personal stories, including booking last-minute deals, traveling off-peak, and finding "kids go free" packages to significantly cut expenses. Other methods discussed include home-swapping for accommodation, using credit card loyalty points for flights, and opting for house-sitting to eliminate lodging costs entirely. These strategies demonstrate a shift towards more resourceful travel planning to combat rising costs.</p>

          <p>The third fight between Katie Taylor and Amanda Serrano at Madison Square Garden showcased the evolution of women's boxing, moving beyond the need for chaotic brawls to prove its worth. The article argues that the tactical, controlled nature of the fight signifies progress, granting female fighters the right to be strategic and win "ugly," just as their male counterparts do. It contrasts the spectacle of high-level professional fighting with the economic realities many female boxers face, exploring the complex choices women make in a sport that is both empowering and contradictory.</p>

          <p>The largest piece of Mars ever found on Earth, a 54-pound meteorite known as NWA 16788, is set to be auctioned by Sotheby's in New York with an estimated price of $2 million to $4 million. The rock is believed to have been ejected from the Martian surface by an asteroid impact before landing in the Sahara desert, where it was discovered in 2023. Scientific analysis confirmed its Martian origin by comparing its chemical composition to data from the 1976 Viking space probe. This rare artifact represents nearly 7% of all known Martian material on our planet.</p>

          <p>Cambodia is celebrating the UNESCO World Heritage recognition of three former Khmer Rouge sites, including the Tuol Sleng prison and Choeung Ek killing fields. These locations, once centers of extreme repression and atrocity during the 1975-1979 regime, have been officially designated as places of peace and reflection. The listing honors Cambodia's efforts in reconciliation, justice for victims, and peace-building, transforming symbols of a tragic past into memorials for education and remembrance. This marks one of the first global listings tied to a recent conflict.</p>

          <p>The Kurdistan Workers' Party (PKK) has declared an end to its four-decade armed conflict with Turkey and initiated a disarmament process, creating a potential turning point for regional stability. The move follows a call for peace from imprisoned PKK leader Abdullah Ocalan, though the group's full disarmament is contingent on concessions from Ankara, including prisoner releases and legal reforms. While Turkey's government remains cautious, it has called the development an opportunity for a peaceful future. A successful peace process could resolve a long-standing domestic conflict and improve Turkey's regional relations.</p>

          <p>On its 40th anniversary, the 1985 Live Aid concert is remembered as a landmark event in global broadcasting and fundraising, but its legacy is also being critically reassessed. While the event, organized by Bob Geldof and Midge Ure, successfully raised millions for famine relief in Ethiopia, it has since faced criticism. The article points out the lack of African performers and female artists in the lineup, as well as the reinforcement of a "white savior" narrative. Despite these flaws, Live Aid set a template for benefit concerts and demonstrated music's power to mobilize global attention.</p>

          <p>A new study analyzing data from two existing Chinese dams upstream on the Brahmaputra River suggests that China's new mega dam in Tibet might not cause the droughts in India that many fear. The research, based on hydrological measurements since 2014, found that the existing dams have actually increased water flow during the dry season. Low flows in February were up by more than 50%, significantly raising water levels throughout the typically dry period. This evidence counters widespread concerns in India that Beijing's dam-building activities would lead to a water crisis downstream.</p>
