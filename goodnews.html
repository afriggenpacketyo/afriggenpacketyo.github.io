        </div>
        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Lawmakers in the UK are debating and voting on proposed legislation that would legalize assisted dying for terminally ill adults in England, Wales, the Isle of Man, and Jersey. The Terminally Ill Adults (End of Life) Bill, introduced by Labour MP Kim Leadbeater, outlines specific criteria for eligibility, including a six-month life expectancy and mental capacity to make the decision. The bill has undergone revisions, such as replacing High Court judge approval with a three-person panel and clarifying palliative care options and healthcare workers' rights to opt out. Assisted dying is defined as a terminally ill person receiving lethal drugs from a medical practitioner, which they administer themselves, while assisted suicide involves intentionally helping another person end their life, and euthanasia involves a physician administering a lethal drug to relieve suffering.</p>

A commentary in Qiushi, the party's theoretical journal, clarified that the recent regulations are intended to limit extravagant practices, not ordinary dining. Some local governments have been scrutinizing every meal gathering, canceling official receptions, and avoiding normal working meals, which is derailing the regulations' original intention and causing unnecessary shocks to the catering industry.</p>
