          <p>A Cartier turquoise and diamond tiara, once owned by Nancy Astor, the first woman to hold a seat in the House of Commons, fetched ¬£700,000 at a London auction. Astor, an American-born politician, represented Plymouth Sutton in Parliament from 1919 to 1945. Bonhams auction house noted this was the first time the tiara had been available since Lord Waldorf Astor, her husband, purchased it in 1930. Lady Astor famously wore the tiara to the premiere of Charlie Chaplin's film 'City Lights' in 1931, adding to its historical and cultural significance. The tiara's sale highlights the enduring appeal and value of rare jewelry with connections to notable figures. </p>

The U.S. Court of Appeals for the Fourth Circuit has argued that if the MSPB is unable to fulfill its role, federal courts should step in and hear cases brought by illegally fired civil servants.</p>

          <p>The Supreme Court ruled in favor of a Catholic charity that was denied a tax exemption. The Wisconsin Supreme Court had previously determined that the charity's activities in serving the state's poor were not sufficiently religious to qualify for the exemption. The Supreme Court's decision reverses this ruling, affirming the charity's right to the tax exemption. The case highlights the ongoing legal debates surrounding the intersection of religious freedom and tax law.</p>
