        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>The ongoing debate over the origins of COVID-19, whether from natural origins or a lab leak, reflects a deep-seated public distrust of science rather than a simple political divide. While some attribute the popularity of the lab leak theory to right-wing misinformation, many credible scientists hold that the question of the virus's origins remains unsettled due to limited data and lack of transparency. The controversy is fueled by longstanding anxieties over virus research, transparency, and scientists' handling of public concerns. Scientists must cultivate trust through transparency, accountability, and humility.</p>

          <p>The European Parliament, known for its clashes with China, is undergoing a reset in relations led by President Roberta Metsola. Metsola has sought to normalize relations with Beijing after years of estrangement, as revealed in correspondence and insider conversations. The detente includes efforts to re-establish constructive parliamentary relations and revitalize legislative dialogue. Not everyone is pleased with this shift, given the parliament's history of criticizing China on issues like human rights and trade.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>California's governor and Democratic lawmakers reached a tentative $321-billion budget deal contingent on passing housing reform. The agreement hinges on a proposal to streamline the California Environmental Quality Act (CEQA) to expedite housing construction. The budget reflects resistance to proposed cuts, opting for borrowing and reserves to address a $12-billion deficit. Lawmakers agreed to reinstate asset limit tests for Medi-Cal enrollees and reduce the expansion of state-sponsored healthcare to undocumented immigrants.</p>

          <p>Michael Conforto had a strong performance in the Dodgers' 9-7 win against the Rockies, going two for five with a double and a three-run home run. This marked his first multi-hit game since May 27 and his first with multiple extra-base hits since May 13. Manager Dave Roberts acknowledged the upcoming month is "critical" for Conforto, whose overall numbers this season have been underwhelming. The Dodgers are evaluating their roster construction ahead of the trade deadline, and Conforto's performance could influence their decisions.</p>

          <p>China is devising ways for foreign institutions to use the yuan, as international confidence in the U.S. dollar falters. These moves aim to challenge the greenback, even as the U.S. dollar remains the world's predominant currency. The timing is favorable as the U.S. dollar index has tumbled more than 9% this year. Beijing has rolled out a digital version of its currency to replace some cash and coins in circulation. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>Zohran Mamdani, a Democratic Socialist, defeated former Governor Andrew Cuomo in the New York City mayoral Democratic primary, marking a significant upset. Cuomo conceded the race, despite the likelihood of continued counting under the ranked-choice system. Mamdani, a millennial outsider, gained support for his progressive platform, including free public buses and universal childcare. His win is viewed as a reflection of New York Democrats' desire for enthusiastic and courageous leadership during the Trump presidency.</p>
