          <p>Professor Mohd Rizal Arshad, a leading Malaysian deep-sea robotics scientist, has relocated to China to further his work on developing underwater prototypes. He cited China's robust ecosystem, which efficiently translates research into industrial applications, facilitates direct engagement with businesses to tackle real-world challenges, and provides easy access to necessary components for building prototypes. Rizal, who joined Xian Jiaotong-Liverpool University's Entrepreneur College as dean of robotics, envisions the ocean as a crucial future source for drinking water, food, minerals, and power. His move highlights China's growing leadership in deep-sea science and its appeal for advanced technological research and development.</p>

          <p>Tesla's car sales in Europe experienced a significant 40% decline in July, marking its seventh consecutive month of reduced registrations, according to data from the European Automobile Manufacturers Association. This downturn occurred even as the overall market for battery electric vehicles in Europe grew. In contrast, Chinese rival BYD saw a remarkable 225% increase in new registrations, aggressively expanding its presence across the continent with competitively priced models. Analysts attribute Tesla's struggles to intense competition, an aging product line-up, and potential reputational damage, while Chinese brands collectively achieved a record market share.

          <p>Asia-Pacific markets concluded Thursday with mixed results, influenced by the Bank of Korea's decision to maintain its policy rate at 2.5% as anticipated. South Korea's Kospi index saw gains, while the Kosdaq dipped; Japan's Nikkei 225 and Topix indices rose. Australia's market also climbed, with Lynas Rare Earths announcing a share sale and Qantas reporting record earnings. Conversely, Hong Kong's Hang Seng index declined, and India's Nifty 50 slipped amid new US tariffs. The region also reacted to strong overnight US market performance, tempered by Nvidia's earnings beat but subsequent stock dip due to data center revenue and China sales concerns.

          <p>A unique and whimsical photograph of tennis player Jasmine Paolini at the US Open, captured by veteran photographer Ray Giubilo, has been widely acclaimed as potentially one of the best tennis pictures ever taken. The "one-in-a-million" shot, which is both humorous and sublime, was a fortunate fluke, occurring due to Paolini's momentary imbalance during a forehand stroke. Giubilo, who instantly recognized the image's exceptional quality, was later personally praised by Paolini for his work. The article highlights the blend of patience, creative flair, and impeccable technical skill essential for capturing such iconic moments in sports photography.</p>

          <p>European markets opened with gains, though individual company performances varied significantly. Nvidia reported strong sales growth forecasts for its AI sector, despite missing data center revenue estimates and facing concerns over China sales. French spirits giant Pernod Ricard saw a 3% sales decline due to weak Chinese consumer sentiment and US tariff uncertainty, yet its shares rose. Conversely, British renewable energy firm Drax plunged 11% following a regulatory investigation into its biomass sourcing statements. Meanwhile, European new car registrations increased, with BYD experiencing a substantial surge in EV sales while Tesla's registrations declined. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>Sales of British-made cars to the United States increased by 6.8% in July, a direct result of a new UK-US tariff deal that lowered import taxes from 25% to 10% on the first 100,000 vehicles. This positive shift follows three consecutive months of declining sales, highlighting the critical importance of the US market for British automotive exports, particularly for premium brands. Despite this improvement, overall UK car manufacturing output remains down by 11.7% year-to-date, reaching its lowest level since 1953 due to factors including higher labor costs, increased international competition, and the lingering effects of Brexit.

          <p>Computer-chip designer Nvidia announced a substantial 56% surge in second-quarter revenue, reaching $46.7 billion, largely propelled by the booming demand for AI capabilities from major tech firms like Meta and OpenAI. Despite this impressive growth, the company's shares experienced a dip in after-hours trading due to ongoing geopolitical issues, particularly US-China tensions affecting its China sales. Nvidia, which became the world's first $4 trillion company in July, continues to navigate the Trump administration's policies and is lobbying for approval to sell its advanced Blackwell chips to the Chinese market. Analysts suggest that US export restrictions are inadvertently fostering domestic chipmaking in China. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>The widespread emotional reaction to Taylor Swift's engagement news has brought attention to the concept of "parasocial relationships," where fans develop strong, one-sided emotional investments in celebrities they don't know personally. Psychologist Sonia Jaeger characterizes these as feeling like "my friend who doesn't know me," a phenomenon amplified by the constant exposure to celebrities' private lives through social media and reality television. While these connections can offer distraction and a sense of community, experts caution that they are not a substitute for genuine, reciprocal friendships. Harvard sociologist Arthur C. Brooks likens such relationships to "fast food," providing temporary satisfaction without fulfilling deeper human needs for connection.</p>

          <p>Darren Aronofsky's new film, "Caught Stealing," adapted from Charlie Huston's novel, is a "bruising bacchanal" set in the gritty, pre-millennial New York City of 1998. Austin Butler stars as Hank Thompson, a former baseball player whose life spirals into a violent crime caper after a series of unfortunate events, including a car accident that ended his career and a seemingly simple cat-sitting favor. The article praises Aronofsky's affectionate portrayal of a chaotic New York, populated by a diverse cast of characters, from various criminal factions to a determined NYPD detective. The film delves into themes of squandered potential and the challenges of a protagonist grappling with past glories.</p>

          <p>Florida is implementing an innovative strategy in the Everglades, deploying robot rabbits to lure and help eliminate invasive Burmese pythons, which are severely impacting native wildlife populations. These solar-powered, retrofitted toy rabbits are designed to mimic real marsh rabbits by emitting heat, scent, and natural movements, serving as decoys in monitored pens. When a python is detected by an attached camera, contractors are dispatched for removal. This initiative, costing $4,000 per robot, aims to overcome the challenge of detecting the well-camouflaged snakes. Although the project is in its early stages, officials express optimism that this technological approach will significantly improve python detection and removal efforts.</p>

He employed a new, unpredictable strategy, utilizing a broader repertoire of pitches, including a career-high number of curveballs and splitters, rather than primarily relying on his fastball and sweeper.

          <p>USC has extended a multi-year offer to Notre Dame, aiming to preserve their historic football rivalry series, which faced an uncertain future. USC athletic director Jennifer Cohen expressed optimism for a swift agreement, acknowledging Notre Dame's preference for a long-term commitment. Initially, USC had hesitated due to complexities arising from the College Football Playoff format and the demands of its Big Ten travel schedule. The primary remaining sticking point in negotiations is the game's date, with USC advocating for an earlier season slot to better balance its schedule, while Notre Dame has less incentive to alter the traditional timing. The rivalry, spanning 95 games, holds significant importance for both institutions.</p>
