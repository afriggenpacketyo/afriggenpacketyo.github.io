          <p>Traditional acoustic piano sales have significantly declined since 1925, impacted by modern entertainment and economic pressures on younger generations. However, the instrument is finding new life through digital and hybrid pianos, which offer more affordable and space-saving options. Experts note that digital pianos provide accurate sounds and functional keys, making them accessible for beginners. This shift is seen optimistically, with hopes for a resurgence in piano playing as people seek alternatives to screen-based activities.</p>

          <p>US Ambassador to the United Nations, Mike Waltz, views President Trump's Gaza peace plan as a unique chance for Middle East peace, despite the UN's criticized role in aid distribution. Waltz emphasized the need for UN reforms, particularly regarding aid interception by groups like Hamas, which he says resells it on the black market. He also highlighted the US goal of burden-sharing in international interventions, citing the Haiti gang-suppression force as an example. The ambassador underscored the importance of US engagement globally to protect its interests and values.</p>

          <p>Formula 1 drivers are split on using cooling vests for the Singapore Grand Prix, which has been declared a 'heat hazard' due to high temperatures and humidity. Max Verstappen opposes mandatory use, citing discomfort and system flaws, including the risk of fluid becoming hot. George Russell, however, plans to use it, acknowledging it's not perfect but has seen team improvements in car cooling. The debate highlights challenges in driver safety and comfort in extreme race conditions, with teams also grappling with car performance issues.</p>

          <p>The US Treasury is considering minting a special $1 coin for America's 250th anniversary, featuring Donald Trump and the phrase "Fight, Fight, Fight." The design references Trump's rallying cry after an assassination attempt during his 2024 campaign. While the draft design is not final, a Treasury spokesperson indicated it reflects the nation's enduring spirit. This initiative follows bipartisan legislation signed by Trump in his first term, allowing for commemorative coins, though legal provisions often restrict living persons on currency.</p>

          <p>The Evangelical Lutheran Church in America (ELCA), a predominantly white denomination, has installed the Rev. Yehiel Curry as its first Black presiding bishop. Curry's six-year term, which began October 1, is a landmark moment, succeeding the first woman to lead the ELCA. His appointment is seen as an opportunity to foster greater diversity and representation within the church, which has historically been stereotyped by its Scandinavian and German roots. Curry aims to explore ways for the ELCA to be a more connected and welcoming church.</p>
