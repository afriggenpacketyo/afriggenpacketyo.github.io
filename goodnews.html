          <p>The UK jobs market is showing signs of cooling, with the number of workers on payrolls decreasing and job vacancies declining. The unemployment rate has risen to 4.5% in the January to March period, though the ONS advises caution due to low survey response rates. Wage growth has slowed but remains higher than inflation, leading analysts to believe the Bank of England will remain cautious about future interest rate cuts despite a recent rate cut. Some firms attribute the changes to tax and the minimum wage that came into effect in April as affecting recruitment.</p>

While Piker described the exchanges as "cordial," he believes the interrogation was an attempt to create fear and silence dissenting voices.

          <p>India struggles to produce football talents comparable to its cricketers due to a lack of role models, a weak talent development structure, and insufficient investment in grassroots programs.
