        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Amazon's subsidiary, Zoox, has officially launched its robotaxi service in Las Vegas, marking its entry into a market largely dominated by Alphabet's Waymo. The service initially offers free rides from select locations on the Strip, with plans for paid service pending regulatory approval. Zoox's custom-built, toaster-shaped electric vehicles, which lack a steering wheel or pedals, are designed to be fundamentally different from retrofitted cars used by competitors like Waymo and Tesla. Following the Las Vegas launch, Zoox plans to expand to Austin, Miami, and San Francisco, aiming to scale production and eventually achieve profitability in the competitive autonomous vehicle industry.</p>

          <p>Prince Harry was observed entering Clarence House, fueling speculation about a potential meeting with his father, King Charles, who was also at the royal residence. This would mark their first face-to-face interaction since February 2024, shortly after the King's cancer diagnosis was made public. While neither Buckingham Palace nor the Duke of Sussex's representatives have confirmed a meeting, Harry has been in the UK for charity events and has previously expressed a desire for reconciliation. The visit comes after a period of strained relations within the royal family, with no meetings planned between Harry and his brother, Prince William.</p>

The show, debuting September 21, aims to cover all aspects of the White House and the administration's domestic and international activities. Howie Kurtz, the host of "MediaBuzz," will remain with the network as a political media analyst, while other programming changes include a new weekend show for Kayleigh McEnany.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>A federal judge has issued a ruling that allows Federal Reserve Governor Lisa Cook to temporarily remain in her position while her lawsuit challenging her dismissal proceeds. President Trump had moved to fire Cook for cause, citing allegations that she made false representations on mortgage documents years before her appointment. However, Judge Jia Cobb ruled that the president had not stated a legally permissible cause, as the alleged conduct predated her government service, and that Cook's due process rights were violated. The decision is seen as a defense of the Federal Reserve's independence from political interference, a principle Cook's lawyers argued was under attack.</p>

          <h2>Uber to Integrate Helicopter Booking Service into its App</h2>
          <div class="timestamp">2025-09-10 12:29:44 EDT</div>
        </div>
        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Uber is partnering with Joby Aviation, a manufacturer of electric air taxis, to allow customers to book helicopter rides directly through its app, with the service expected to launch as early as next year. The move follows Joby's recent acquisition of Blade Air Mobility, which already operates helicopter and seaplane services in locations like the New York metropolitan area. While specific routes and pricing have not been detailed, airport connections are considered a high-value offering for consumers. The partnership builds on a previous deal where Joby acquired Uber's aerial ride-sharing division, Uber Elevate, as both companies move towards electric vertical takeoff and landing (eVTOL) aircraft.</p>

          <p>A South Korean court has acquitted Choi Mal-ja, now 79, sixty years after she was convicted of grievous bodily harm for biting off part of her attacker's tongue during a sexual assault in 1964. At the time, she was given a suspended prison sentence, while her attacker received a lighter suspended sentence for trespassing. Inspired by the #MeToo movement, Choi sought a retrial, and the Busan District Court has now ruled that her actions constituted justifiable self-defense against an infringement on her bodily integrity. The landmark decision was celebrated by women's rights activists as a source of hope for other victims of sexual violence.</p>

          <p>The producer price index (PPI), a measure of wholesale inflation, unexpectedly fell by 0.1% in August, contrary to economists' expectations of a 0.3% increase. This marks the third time this year the gauge has shown deflation, providing more evidence of tame inflation pressures in the U.S. economy. The decline was broad-based, with the services sector seeing a 0.2% drop and goods prices rising only slightly. The soft reading has intensified market expectations that the Federal Reserve will implement an interest rate cut at its upcoming meeting, with traders now awaiting Thursday's consumer price index (CPI) report for further confirmation.

Phillipson's campaign is confident of clearing the nomination threshold, while her closest rivals, Lucy Powell and Bell Ribeiro-Addy, continue to gather support. The race has highlighted discussions within the party about regional representation, with many calling for a deputy leader from northern England to balance the London-centric leadership of Keir Starmer.</p>

          <p>NASA's Perseverance rover has collected rock samples from a dry river channel on Mars that contain the strongest indications yet of potential ancient microbial life. While scientists emphasize that the findings are not definitive proof of life, the samples contain organic carbon along with iron phosphate and iron sulfide compounds. On Earth, these chemicals are often byproducts of microorganisms consuming organic matter. The rover is drilling and storing these samples for a future, though currently delayed, mission to return them to Earth for in-depth analysis. This discovery marks a significant step in the ongoing quest to determine if life ever existed on Mars.</p>

Cramer also advised that the recent dip in Apple's stock price ahead of its new iPhone launch presents a good buying opportunity for long-term investors. Additionally, he recommended purchasing shares in life sciences company Danaher, citing its new, aggressive share repurchase program and a more positive outlook on its business in China.

          <p>Oracle's stock experienced a historic surge of over 40% after the company reported an astounding backlog of $455 billion in future cloud contracts, driven by the artificial intelligence boom. This performance, on track to be the stock's best day since 1992, pushed the company's market capitalization close to the $1 trillion mark. The massive demand for Oracle's cloud infrastructure, which is essential for running large AI workloads, overshadowed a quarterly earnings report that slightly missed analyst expectations. The unprecedented growth in its order book has solidified Oracle's position as a key player in the competitive AI infrastructure market alongside giants like Microsoft and Amazon.

          <p>Philanthropist Melinda French Gates has highlighted the chronic underfunding of women's health as she committed $50 million to new research in the field. This funding is part of a larger $1 billion pledge and will target areas where women are disproportionately affected, such as autoimmune diseases, mental health, and cardiovascular disease. Historically, medical research has treated male bodies as the default, often excluding women from clinical trials, which has led to significant knowledge gaps. This investment aims to accelerate breakthroughs in understanding and treating women's health issues, which advocates argue is not only a moral imperative but also an economic one.</p>
