          <p>Tadej Pogacar is poised to win his fourth Tour de France, having maintained his overall lead through the penultimate stage of the race. Australian sprinter Kaden Groves secured his first-ever Tour stage victory after a bold solo attack with 16 kilometers remaining, completing his personal trilogy of stage wins across all three Grand Tour cycling races. Pogacar finished safely within the main group of riders, known as the peloton, and is not expected to be challenged during the final processional stage into Paris. The victory was an emotional one for Groves, who triumphed despite challenging rainy conditions that caused crashes for other riders.</p>

          <p>A significant security operation is underway as U.S. President Donald Trump begins a private visit to his Turnberry golf resort in Scotland. While Trump played a round of golf, hundreds of demonstrators gathered in Edinburgh and Aberdeen to protest his visit, citing his political stances and the high cost of security to taxpayers. The visit precedes official meetings with UK Prime Minister Keir Starmer and Scottish First Minister John Swinney. Amid the visit, the Scottish government announced public funding for a golf tournament at Trump's other Scottish course, a decision that drew criticism from political opponents.</p>

          <p>McLaren's Lando Norris captured pole position for the Belgian Grand Prix, narrowly beating his teammate and championship leader, Oscar Piastri, by just 0.085 seconds. Red Bull's Max Verstappen finished fourth after errors on his final lap, while Ferrari's Charles Leclerc will start third. The qualifying session saw a major upset as Lewis Hamilton was eliminated in the first round after his lap time was deleted for exceeding track limits, relegating him to a 16th-place start. Norris's performance sets up a potentially chaotic race, with rain forecasted for Sunday, which could significantly impact strategy and visibility on the track.</p>

          <p>Christopher Kennedy, a 68-year-old dog trainer, unexpectedly discovered he had a terminal lung disease called Idiopathic Pulmonary Fibrosis (IPF) during a routine pre-surgery X-ray. Despite having no prior symptoms, the progressive scarring in his lungs gave him less than a year to live. Initially resistant, Kennedy eventually agreed to a double-lung transplant, which he successfully received after a month-long hospital wait. Now 75, he has recovered remarkably with 98% lung capacity, allowing him to return to training hospital therapy dogs with a renewed sense of purpose and a profound appreciation for every breath.</p>

          <p>U.S. President Donald Trump is reportedly interested in visiting China this autumn, though a potential September visit has been ruled out, according to sources familiar with the discussions. Officials from both Washington and Beijing are said to be working towards arranging a trip for October or November. One possibility is that Trump could visit China either before or after attending the Asia-Pacific Economic Cooperation (Apec) summit in South Korea. The diplomatic groundwork for such a high-level meeting was reportedly laid during a recent 'better than expected' meeting between the two countries' top diplomats.</p>

        </div>
        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>As the Trump administration alters federal student loan forgiveness and repayment options, workplace benefits are emerging as a key source of relief for indebted workers. A provision in the One Big Beautiful Bill Act made the tax-free status of employer contributions to student loans permanent, encouraging more companies to offer these programs. This benefit allows employers to contribute up to $5,250 annually towards an employee's student loans without tax implications. With federal policies becoming less generous for some borrowers, employer-sponsored repayment assistance is increasingly seen as a vital tool for attracting and retaining talent.

          <p>Justin Bieber's surprise new album, 'Swag,' and its hit single, 'Daisies,' are being hailed as the potential song of the summer, offering a departure from his previous pop sound. The album embraces a more subtle, R&B-influenced style with aqueous, muffled production that creates a gentle and melancholic yet intriguing atmosphere. The song 'Daisies' has quickly climbed the charts, filling a void in a music landscape that seemed to be lacking a definitive warm-weather anthem. This article suggests the album's downtempo but detailed sound resonates with a collective mood that is less about high-energy partying and more in need of soothing, reflective music.</p>

          <p>Brazil is undertaking a massive public health initiative by releasing millions of specially engineered mosquitoes to combat the spread of dengue, Zika, and other viruses. These 'Wolbitos' are bred by the nonprofit World Mosquito Program to carry Wolbachia, a naturally occurring bacteria that prevents the dengue virus from replicating inside the insect, thus stopping its transmission to humans. A pilot program in the city of Niterói resulted in a roughly 90% drop in dengue cases. The Brazilian government is now scaling up the project, building a massive new factory to produce billions of these 'good mosquitoes' for release across the country.</p>

          <p>In a significant recall election, Taiwanese voters have rejected an attempt to oust two dozen lawmakers from the opposition Nationalist Party (KMT). The result is a setback for the ruling Democratic Progressive Party (DPP), which had hoped to shift the balance of power in the legislature where an opposition coalition currently holds a majority. The failure of the recall effort means President Lai Ching-te's administration will likely continue to face strong legislative resistance to its agenda. The KMT framed the recall as political retaliation, while supporters of the recall were angered by the opposition's blocking of key legislation.</p>
