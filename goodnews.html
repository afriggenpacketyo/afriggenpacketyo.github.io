          <h2>Trump Seeks Support for Spending Bill Amid Republican Concerns</h2>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>President Trump is meeting with Senate Finance Committee Republicans to garner support for his "One Big Beautiful Bill Act," which faces opposition due to concerns about its impact on the deficit. The bill includes extensions of the 2017 tax cuts and increased spending on military and border security, but could add $2.4 trillion to the deficit over the next decade. Some Republican senators, like Ron Johnson, are pushing for deeper spending cuts, while others express frustration with Elon Musk's criticism of the bill. The goal is to pass the bill by the Fourth of July, but disagreements within the Republican party pose a significant challenge.</p>

          <p>Three large wildfires in northeastern Minnesota are nearing full containment after burning for several weeks, with evacuations lifted on Memorial Day. The fires have covered approximately 30,000 acres, and investigations are ongoing to determine the cause of some of the blazes. Interactive maps provide a visual representation of the affected areas, including the Jenkins Creek Fire, Camp House Road Fire, Munger Shaw Fire, and Horse River Fire. While Minnesota is experiencing hazardous smoke conditions, efforts are underway to repair ecologically significant wild rice lakes affected by the fires, and donations are being accepted to support community members impacted by the wildfires.</p>

          <p>A federal judge has ordered the unsealing of several documents in the case of Kilmar Abrego Garcia, a Salvadoran immigrant who was mistakenly deported to El Salvador. The order comes in response to a request from a media coalition, including CBS News, citing the public's right to access court records. The Justice Department had opposed the release, arguing that the filings were discovery materials and that sealing them was necessary for national security. The Trump administration has acknowledged that Abrego Garcia's deportation was a mistake, as he had been granted legal status in the U.S.</p>

          <p>A nearly 200-year-old condom is on display at the Rijksmuseum in Amsterdam as part of an exhibition on 19th-century prostitution and sexuality. The condom, dating back to 1830, is believed to be made of a sheep's appendix and features an explicit print. The museum purchased the item at auction and determined it had not been used. The condom is considered a "luxury souvenir" from a French brothel and embodies the lighter and darker sides of sexual health in an era marked by fears of pregnancy and sexually transmitted diseases.</p>

          <p>Recent weak jobs data has led to speculation about a potential Federal Reserve rate cut, with the ADP reporting a significant drop in private-sector job additions. Jim Cramer suggested that a similarly weak nonfarm payrolls report could prompt the Fed to act to boost the jobs side of its mandate. Amazon announced plans to invest $10 billion in new AI data centers in North Carolina, benefiting companies like Nvidia, Eaton, and GE Vernova. OpenAI reported reaching 3 million paying business users, indicating growing AI monetization. (not investment advice)</p>
