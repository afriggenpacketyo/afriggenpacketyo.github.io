          <h2>Doordash Announces SevenRooms Acquisition Amidst Revenue Shortfall</h2>
          <div class="timestamp">2025-05-06 07:55:06 EDT</div>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Doordash recently revealed its acquisition of SevenRooms, a restaurant booking platform, for $1.2 billion in cash, signaling an expansion into restaurant management services. Despite this strategic move, the company's first-quarter revenue fell short of expectations, leading to a slight dip in share value. Total orders saw an 18% increase year-over-year, aligning with analyst predictions, while net income significantly improved compared to the previous year. Doordash also highlighted growth in grocery delivery, especially in perishables, but acknowledged potential risks associated with its increasing international presence, such as geopolitical and currency fluctuations.</p>

          <p>King Charles III unveiled his official coronation portrait, painted by Peter Kuhfeld, depicting the monarch in his coronation regalia. The portrait was much more positively received than his previous official portrait, which drew criticism for its predominantly red hues. Alongside the King's portrait, a second official portrait of Queen Camilla, painted by Paul Benney, was also revealed, showcasing the Queen in her coronation dress. Coronation portraits have been a traditional part of the crowning of a monarch for centuries, and these new portraits continue that tradition.</p>

          <p>Luxury carmaker Ferrari reported a 17% increase in first-quarter profit, driven by high demand for personalized vehicles. CEO Benedetto Vigna hailed it as a great start to the year, noting strong profitability due to product mix and personalization requests. However, Ferrari cautioned that potential U.S. tariffs on EU car imports could negatively impact profitability this year, potentially reducing margins by 50 basis points. The company had previously announced a 10% price increase on certain models in anticipation of the tariffs, adding up to $50,000 to the price of a typical Ferrari.</p>

          <p>Former Governor Andrew Cuomo, in his mayoral bid, is proposing a plan to remove more mentally ill people from the streets to address public safety concerns. The plan includes expanding involuntary hospitalizations, requiring screening for mandatory outpatient treatment upon discharge from hospitals and jails, and adding supportive housing units and psychiatric beds. Cuomo's proposals align with some of Mayor Eric Adams's initiatives but have drawn criticism regarding his past reduction of psychiatric beds as governor. The plan would spend about $2.6 billion in capital funding over five years to build at least 600 additional units of supportive housing each year.</p>

          <p>Wales' First Minister Eluned Morgan has pledged to "call out" the Labour government in Westminster when it "gets it wrong for Wales", prioritizing the nation's interests over party loyalty.

Morgan attacked Reform UK and Plaid Cymru, urging voters not to take Labour's policies for granted. She argued that decisions suitable for England may not be right for Wales, using the analogy of the BBC sitcom Gavin and Stacey.</p>
