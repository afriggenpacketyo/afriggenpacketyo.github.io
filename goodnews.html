          <p>Nigel Farage is celebrating Reform UK's success in recent local elections, highlighting their gains at the expense of Labour and Conservative parties and calling it the end of two-party politics. The party secured control of 10 local councils, won two mayoral races, and added a fifth MP. Prime Minister Starmer acknowledged that people aren't yet feeling the benefits of a Labour government, while Conservative leader Badenoch apologized for the losses. Maskell urged the government to reconsider the cuts to winter fuel payments to pensioners, advocating for wealth redistribution.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Several German states are contemplating banning smartphones in classrooms, with one high school in North Rhine-Westphalia already piloting the initiative. Students are required to leave their phones off in their bags throughout the school day, which has reportedly led to increased student interaction. The school enforces the ban strictly, with punishments for violations. Education researcher Klaus Zierer advocates for total bans in primary schools and strict rules in older grades, citing increased social wellbeing and reduced cyberbullying as potential benefits. Other countries like France, Italy, and the Netherlands have already implemented similar bans.</p>

          <p>China is reportedly considering offering increased cooperation with the United States in combating the flow of fentanyl as a means to de-escalate the ongoing trade war. This potential plan involves sending a high-ranking security official to Washington to facilitate trade talks. China hopes that a pledge to address fentanyl concerns will encourage both governments to simultaneously reduce tariffs, providing a diplomatic resolution. However, China has previously resisted pressure to cooperate on fentanyl issues while facing tariffs, maintaining that the fentanyl crisis reflects failures within the United States.</p>

          <p>Australian Prime Minister Anthony Albanese has won a second term, a turnaround for his center-left Labor Party, despite trailing in polls due to cost-of-living issues. The election was a defeat for the conservative opposition led by Peter Dutton, whose campaign was impacted by associations with Trump's policies. Albanese emphasized facing global challenges in an Australian way, independent of foreign inspiration. Voters expressed concerns about the rising cost of living and a lack of bold solutions from either party. The victory came after the failure of a 2023 referendum on Indigenous representation, a prior campaign pledge.</p>

          <p>Child therapists have identified the top six things kids worry about most, which include social dynamics, social media, big life changes, packed schedules, inconsistency, and trauma. These worries can lead to anxiety and stress, especially as anxiety levels rise among younger children. The therapists suggest practical coping strategies such as naming emotions, practicing deep breathing, teaching affirming phrases, and scheduling a 'worry window' to manage intense emotions. Parents are encouraged to introduce these skills during calm moments, well before stressful situations arise, to help children better cope with their worries.</p>

          <p>Anthony Albanese has claimed victory in the Australian general election, becoming the first Australian prime minister in 21 years to lead a political party to two consecutive election victories. Surveys showed that high prices were the top voter concern, with Australians enduring one of the sharpest rises in the cost of living in recent years.

          <h2>Australia's Prime Minister Anthony Albanese wins a second three-year term</h2>

          <p>Anthony Albanese has become the first Australian prime minister to win a second consecutive three-year term in 21 years. Albanese's ruling center-left Labor Party secured a majority in the House of Representatives. Energy policy and inflation have been major issues in the campaign, with both sides agreeing the country faces a cost of living crisis. While both say the country should reach net-zero greenhouse gas emissions by 2050, Dutton argues that relying on more nuclear power instead of renewable energy sources such as solar and wind turbines would deliver less expensive electricity.</p>
