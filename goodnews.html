          <h2>Experts Assess Damage to Iran's Nuclear Program After Strikes</h2>
          <div class="timestamp">2025-06-22 18:07:04 EDT</div>
        </div>
        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Following U.S. military strikes on key Iranian nuclear sites, independent experts analyzing satellite imagery suggest that while the Iranian nuclear program has been damaged, it has not been entirely destroyed. Jeffrey Lewis from the Middlebury Institute of International Studies notes that critical elements, including Iran's stocks of highly enriched uranium, appear to have been untouched by the strikes. David Albright of the Institute for Science and International Security echoes this concern, emphasizing that significant amounts of enriched uranium still exist and could be moved to covert facilities for further enrichment. The experts' assessments contrast with claims from the Trump Administration that the strikes obliterated Iran's nuclear ambitions, pointing to potential efforts by Iran to conceal or relocate enriched uranium before the attacks. Optimism is tempered by the recognition that diplomacy and international cooperation are essential for a lasting resolution. </p>

Over the past 10 years, AIIB has financed over US$60 billion in infrastructure projects, including support for healthcare systems during the Covid-19 pandemic. Jin emphasizes the massive funding gap for infrastructure needs in Asian countries, estimated at trillions of US dollars per year, and underscores the necessity for collaborative efforts among multiple development banks to bridge this gap.

          <p>Following U.S. military strikes on Iranian nuclear sites, U.S. leaders, including President Trump and Defense Secretary Hegseth, urged Iran to pursue a diplomatic resolution rather than retaliation. Trump stated that Iran must now make peace, while Vance clarified that the U.S. is at war with Iran's nuclear program, not Iran itself. Hegseth emphasized that the U.S. action was intentionally limited and not aimed at regime change, signaling that the U.S. is open to negotiations and has communicated steps Iran can take to allow for peace, while also threatening further military action if Iran retaliates.</p>

          <p>The UK government is set to unveil a 10-year industrial strategy that includes measures to lower energy costs for thousands of businesses by scrapping green levies. The plan, aimed at boosting growth, will potentially cut energy bills by up to 25% for over 7,000 UK businesses. A new British Industrial Competitiveness Scheme will reduce costs by up to ¬£40 per megawatt-hour from 2027 for manufacturing firms, while the most energy-intensive firms will receive increased discounts on network charges. The strategy also includes measures to expedite the connection of new factories to the energy grid and support the creation of over one million new jobs over the next decade.

          <p>U.S. Secretary of State Marco Rubio called on China to prevent Iran from closing the Strait of Hormuz, a crucial trade route for crude oil. Rubio emphasized China's dependence on the strait for its oil imports and warned that closing it would be "economic suicide" for Iran, as it would halt the country's crude exports to China. The U.S. retains options to address any Iranian attempt to close the strait, with the U.S. Fifth Fleet stationed in Bahrain to protect maritime trade in the Persian Gulf. However, some analysts caution that the market may be underestimating the potential for prolonged disruption. </p>

          <p>Following U.S. military strikes on Iranian nuclear facilities, concerns have risen about potential Iranian retaliation, including the possibility of blocking oil exports through the Strait of Hormuz. The Strait of Hormuz, located between Oman and Iran, is a crucial global trade route that facilitates the transit of millions of barrels of oil and petroleum products per day. While Iran has long threatened to close the strait to ward off Western pressure, U.S. Secretary of State Marco Rubio stated that any effort to block the strait would be a "suicidal move" for Iran, potentially triggering a backlash from powerful countries. The U.S. Navy, with its 5th Fleet stationed in Bahrain, has pledged to uphold freedom of navigation in the strait. </p>

This wasn't a regime change move." President Trump continues to prefer the path of diplomacy, Rubio said, noting that the U.S. pushed Iran to make a deal to give up its nuclear weapons ambitions before the strikes. </p>
