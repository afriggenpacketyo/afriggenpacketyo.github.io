          <p>FanDuel Sports Network, formerly Bally Sports, has announced a doubling of paid subscribers to nearly 650,000 in eight weeks and anticipates reaching one million direct-to-consumer customers by year-end. This growth follows Main Street Sports Group's emergence from bankruptcy and strategic partnerships with Amazon's Prime Video, SB Nation, and Yahoo Sports. The streaming platform averages 250,000 unique daily users and one million unique monthly users since the start of the 2025 MLB season. The network is testing lower price points, though current pricing starts at $19.99 a month, to attract more subscribers amidst the challenges of pay-TV subscriber losses in the regional sports network business model.</p>

          <p>A new salmonella outbreak linked to backyard poultry has sickened at least seven people across six states, according to the CDC.

          <p>The Trump administration has dismantled some of the tents erected at Guant√°namo Bay to house migrants, just three months after the operation began. The camp, intended to house up to 30,000 migrants, never expanded beyond 32 detainees, and no migrant surge ever occurred. The operation, criticized as a waste of taxpayer funds, has cost $40 million, including $3 million for unused tents. The military says it can expand migrant operations at Guant√°namo if needed, but the decision to dismantle tents indicates a shift away from housing tens of thousands of migrants on the base.</p>
