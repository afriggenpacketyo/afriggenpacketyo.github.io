          <p>Cisco reported better-than-expected earnings and revenue, alongside positive guidance for the next fiscal year. Revenue increased by 11% compared to the previous year, driven by strong performance in networking and security products, with over $1.25 billion in AI infrastructure orders from web companies. CEO Chuck Robbins announced that CFO Scott Herren will retire in July and be succeeded by Mark Patterson. The company's guidance factors in the expected impact of President Donald Trump's sweeping tariffs on goods imported into the U.S.</p>

          <p>Republicans in the House Ways and Means Committee have advanced a bill that includes a provision to eliminate federal income tax on tips. The proposed law would create an above-the-line deduction for tips received by individuals in traditionally tipped occupations, phasing out for those earning over $160,000 a year. This tax break would expire after 2028 and its impact on workers will depend on the final version passed by Congress. Lawrence Pon, a CPA, expects provisions of the bill to change as it makes its way through the House and Senate.</p>

HELOCs also have variable interest rates, which are expected to decrease in the coming months, making them a more attractive option for borrowers. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>Nvidia's stock has climbed into positive territory for the year, joining Meta Platforms and Microsoft as the latest "Magnificent 7" member to recover amid the broader market's rebound. The surge follows CEO Jensen Huang's announcement that the company would sell over 18,000 AI chips to Saudi Arabia. Analysts believe this deal could help mitigate potential revenue losses from shipping constraints to China. This recovery has pushed Nvidia's market capitalization back above $3 trillion.</p>
