          <p>Hong Kong is intensifying its efforts to establish itself as an international data-trading hub by strengthening connections with mainland China and Southeast Asia.

          <p>China's industrial profits experienced accelerated growth in April, marking the second consecutive month of increase despite U.S. tariffs and deflationary pressures. Cumulative profits at major industrial firms climbed 3% year-on-year, driven by stronger earnings in the equipment and high-tech manufacturing sectors. Beijing's targeted efforts to support the private sector played a significant role in offsetting the negative impacts from U.S. tariffs. However, challenges such as insufficient demand and declining prices persist, along with uncertainty in the external environment. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>Gold prices have surged this year due to investors seeking safe investments amid economic uncertainty, but central banks' purchases are also a significant factor. Central banks' demand for gold has increased fivefold since Russia's invasion of Ukraine, marking a turning point in how they view the asset. Countries are experimenting with gold-backed digital assets to bypass the dollar-denominated financial system, potentially evading sanctions. This shift in central bank behavior is expected to provide an ongoing boost to gold prices. (not investment advice)</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>The Japanese government has allocated 388.1 billion yen from reserve funds to subsidize household and business energy bills during the summer in response to inflation. The subsidies are part of broader relief measures designed to counter the economic impact of U.S. tariffs imposed by President Trump. The measures aim to ease rising living costs and support small and medium-sized companies affected by the tariffs. Critics suggest the move is intended to garner support ahead of the upcoming House of Councillors election. (not investment advice)</p>
