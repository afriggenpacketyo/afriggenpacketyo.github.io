          <p>Online fast-fashion giant Shein announced a significant increase in its UK operations, with sales reaching £2.05 billion in 2024, a 32.3% rise from the previous year. The company's pre-tax profits also grew to £38.25 million, reflecting strong performance amid its expansion efforts in the region, including new office openings. Despite this growth, Shein identified several risks, such as supply chain disruptions and shifting UK regulations that could impact future performance. The positive financial results come as the company pursues a long-delayed initial public offering, having recently shifted its focus from London to Hong Kong. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>Japan's economy expanded by 0.3% in the second quarter of 2025, surpassing economists' forecasts and showing resilience in the face of trade headwinds from the United States. The growth was primarily driven by strong exports, which counteracted the negative impact of a 15% blanket tariff on all U.S.-bound goods, including the crucial automobile sector. Despite the positive quarterly performance, analysts caution that a slowdown may be imminent as investment spending is expected to soften and corporate profits decline. The Bank of Japan has slightly upgraded its annual growth forecast but warned about the risks posed by global trade policies. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>A 46-year-old man from Long Beach was rescued after being trapped behind a powerful waterfall in Sequoia National Forest for two days. The man, Ryan Wardwell, was rappelling the Seven Teacups Trail when he came off his lines and was pinned by the intense river flow. The Tulare County Sheriff’s Office located him using aircraft with infrared technology and deployed a helicopter to hoist him to safety. Wardwell was treated for minor injuries and dehydration before being reunited with his family, highlighting the dangers of the challenging trail which requires technical equipment and canyoneering skills.</p>

The company's leadership highlighted the substantial unmet clinical demand for metabolic drugs as a key driver of its future commercial opportunities. (not investment advice)</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Chinese researchers have unveiled a new high-speed drone capable of vertical takeoff and landing (VTOL), a technological breakthrough that could significantly enhance naval capabilities. The uncrewed aircraft can launch from the decks of standard warships, even in rough seas, and then transition to fast, long-range flight without needing a runway. This innovation could effectively transform vessels like destroyers and frigates into miniature aircraft carriers, expanding their operational range and versatility. According to the project team, the new jet-powered VTOL drone is far superior in speed compared to other mainstream models currently in use, representing a major advance in military hardware.</p>

          <p>Youngstown, Ohio, a city once devastated by the collapse of the American steel industry, is experiencing a quiet revival driven by local entrepreneurs and community initiatives. Decades after facing one of the nation's highest unemployment rates, the city is seeing new life as historic industrial buildings are repurposed into businesses like breweries and flea markets. While the comeback is not dramatic, key indicators show positive trends: the population has stabilized, the unemployment rate is closer to the national average, and the number of working residents has returned to pre-pandemic levels. The city's progress demonstrates a slow but steady effort to build a new economic identity.</p>

          <p>The British government is collaborating with medical influencers on TikTok to raise awareness about the dangers of traveling abroad for cosmetic surgery. The campaign addresses growing concerns over UK citizens seeking cheaper procedures like hair implants and dental work overseas, which can lead to life-altering injuries and costly corrective care for the NHS. Influencers will create content advising viewers to consult with a UK doctor, purchase proper travel insurance, and avoid package deals that include surgery. This initiative is part of a larger effort to regulate the domestic cosmetic industry and protect patients from the risks of so-called medical tourism.</p>

          <p>U.S. Secretary of State Marco Rubio commented on the rapidly organized summit between President Trump and Russian President Vladimir Putin, stating that the meeting in Alaska will be an opportunity to quickly assess the possibility of peace. Rubio emphasized that the president's primary hope is to achieve a ceasefire to allow for broader conversations about security guarantees and territorial disputes to take place. He reiterated that while the U.S. will do everything it can to facilitate an agreement, any lasting peace will ultimately depend on Ukraine and Russia. The summit's location in Alaska is noted by historians for its significance in the U.S.-Russia relationship.</p>

          <p>Three aluminum audition records made by Dame Vera Lynn at the beginning of her career will be released for the first time, nine decades after they were recorded. The discs were discovered by her daughter after she donated the late singer's record collection to the British Library's Sound Archive. One of the tracks, "What A Difference A Day Makes," will be released as a single to coincide with the 80th anniversary of VJ Day. Dame Vera, known as the "Forces' Sweetheart" for her morale-boosting songs during World War II, died in 2020 at the age of 103.</p>
