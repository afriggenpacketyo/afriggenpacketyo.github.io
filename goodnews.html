          <p>Researchers in Andalusia, Spain, have discovered remarkably preserved historical artifacts within the nests of bearded vultures, which have been absent from the region for over 70 years. Among the findings was a complete esparto grass sandal dating back to the late 13th century, along with a crossbow arrow, painted leather, and thousands of bone fragments. The unique, stable conditions of the mountain caves where the nests are located allowed for the excellent preservation of these items. These discoveries provide valuable insights into regional ecology and the ethnographic history of the Iberian Mediterranean.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Plaid Cymru, a political party in Wales, has announced a major policy proposal to offer universal childcare for all children from nine months to four years old if it wins the next Senedd election. Party leader Rhun ap Iorwerth described the plan as a "transformative" policy that would provide families at least 20 hours of care for 48 weeks a year by 2031. This would expand the current system, which is largely limited to working parents, and aims to address high childcare costs that contribute to family poverty. The party estimates the policy will cost an additional £500 million annually once fully implemented.</p>

As the U.S. furniture market faces a new 30% tariff on upholstered imports, the company sees an opportunity to emphasize its domestic manufacturing, where each piece is touched by over 100 employees. The company's CEO, Dixon Mitchell, notes that while tariffs on imported textiles have an impact, Fairfield's commitment to quality and its strong supply chain allow it to remain a reliable choice for consumers.

          <p>A recent HSBC survey of high-net-worth entrepreneurs reveals that 57% are considering moving to a new country, with Singapore being the most popular choice. The primary motivations for relocating are business expansion and new investment opportunities, followed by a desire for a better quality of life and improved safety. Contrary to common belief, tax efficiency was a less significant factor, ranking eighth among the reasons cited. The United Kingdom, Japan, and Switzerland also ranked as desirable destinations, while the United States came in fifth, with American entrepreneurs who considered moving being most interested in experiencing a new culture.</p>

This marks the first phase of a deal that includes the release of all hostages held by Hamas within 72 hours, in exchange for over 1,000 Palestinian prisoners. As part of the agreement, the IDF will remain in control of more than half of Gaza, and more humanitarian aid is expected to enter the strip. The U.S. Central Command is establishing a coordination center in Israel to monitor the ceasefire and facilitate the flow of aid.</p>

          <p>Early investors in Nvidia are celebrating significant financial gains following the company's meteoric rise, driven by the AI boom.

          <p>Singer Robbie Williams has revealed that he delayed the release of his upcoming album, "Britpop," to avoid a chart battle with Taylor Swift's latest record. Williams, who is currently tied with The Beatles for 15 UK number one albums, stated he is "desperately" competitive and wants to secure a record-breaking 16th chart-topper. Acknowledging Swift's immense popularity, he humorously admitted he "can't compete with that one" and decided to shift his album's release to February. To promote the new record, Williams plans to embark on a tour of smaller, more intimate venues across the UK.</p>

          <p>The United Kingdom and India are deepening their economic and strategic partnership, a move seen as partly influenced by trade tensions with the United States. During a recent visit, British Prime Minister Keir Starmer and Indian Prime Minister Narendra Modi emphasized their commitment to ratifying a new trade deal that slashes tariffs on goods like textiles, cars, and whiskey. This Comprehensive Economic and Trade Agreement (CETA) is expected to significantly boost bilateral trade and provides India with a crucial alternative market. The strengthened alliance also includes cooperation on defense technology, critical minerals, and digital infrastructure. (not investment advice)</p>
