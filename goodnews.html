          <p>Wayne Rooney, former Manchester United captain, disputes Marcus Rashford's claim that an inconsistent environment hindered his performance at the club. Rooney argues that individual application and effort are more crucial than external factors when players underperform. He suggests that blaming the environment is an easy excuse when players are not playing well or are left out of the team. Rooney emphasizes that Rashford's ability to run more and do more in games is unrelated to the environment, despite acknowledging his personal liking for Rashford. The author reflects a neutral, yet critical, tone on Rashford's claim.</p>

          <p>Former members of the military in England and Wales will soon be able to download digital versions of their identity cards, allowing them to more easily prove their veteran status. This initiative will benefit approximately 1.8 million veterans, who can use the digital ID to access public services such as healthcare, housing support, and discounts. The digital veteran card is optional and will be stored in the government's One Login smartphone app, with digital driving licenses to follow. This project serves as a case study for a broader digital ID scheme planned for all British citizens, addressing privacy and security concerns along the way.
