          <p>A federal judge blocked the Trump administration from deploying the California National Guard in Los Angeles, ordering President Trump to return control to Gov. Gavin Newsom. Judge Charles Breyer ruled that California officials are likely to succeed in their challenge to the president's decision to federalize the National Guard in response to protests in Los Angeles, and granted their request to block his use of the forces to assist immigration agents during raids. Breyer stated that Trump's actions exceeded his statutory authority and violated the Tenth Amendment. The Justice Department appealed the order, but Newsom praised the decision as a victory for the Constitution and democracy.</p>

          <p>A federal judge ruled that President Donald Trump's federalizing of California National Guard troops and deploying them to Los Angeles was "illegal," ordering him to return control of the Guard to Gov. Gavin Newsom. Judge Charles Breyer stayed his temporary restraining order to allow the Trump administration to appeal the decision. Newsom and California's attorney general sued to reverse Trump's federalization of the Guard without the governor's consent. Breyer stated that none of the conditions required for Trump's federalization of the Guard existed, and that Trump's actions threatened the constitutional balance of power between the federal and state governments.</p>

          <p>The article discusses Dan Wang's observation of China as an "engineering state," highlighting the nation's impressive infrastructure and technological advancements. China has rapidly developed its transportation systems, including subway stations and high-speed rail, surpassing the United States in the scale and speed of construction. The country's focus on STEM fields has led to a large number of engineering graduates and a prioritization of engineering in national security. This contrasts with the United States, which Wang characterizes as a "lawyerly state," where lawyers often hold top government positions.</p>

Judge Charles Breyer rejected the administration's argument that the courts do not have authority to review a president's decision on whether the National Guard is needed. Breyer stated that the situation in Los Angeles did not constitute a rebellion, and Newsom argued that Trump's use of the military was unlawful.</p>

          <p>A federal judge has ruled against President Trump's use of the National Guard in Los Angeles, siding with the state of California's argument that the president erred in how the guard was being activated. The order requires Trump to return control of the National Guard to California Gov. Gavin Newsom by noon Friday (Pacific Time). The ruling could still be appealed, but it's a setback for the White House in the dispute over the powers it can assert in cracking down on illegal immigration - and over public opposition to it. It was not immediately clear if or when Guard units would be removed.</p>

          <h2>Study Suggests Pigs May Have Been Domesticated in China Earlier Than Previously Thought</h2>
          <div class="timestamp">2025-06-12 21:00:11 EDT</div>
        </div>
        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Research suggests that pigs were domesticated in southern China as early as 8,000 years ago, challenging the conventional view that pigs were first domesticated in the Near East. The study, published in the Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences (PNAS), analyzed two early Neolithic sites in the Yangtze Delta region. The findings indicate that the domestication of Sus scrofa, the wild boar, occurred alongside the development of rice cultivation and sedentary lifestyles in ancient Chinese society. This discovery offers new insights into the origins of animal domestication and early agricultural practices.</p>

          <p>Patrick Reed made a double-eagle, also known as an albatross, at the US Open, marking only the fourth in the tournament's history since records began in 1983. Reed holed his second shot from 286 yards on the par-5 fourth hole. Despite the albatross, Reed finished the day at 3-over 73, including a triple bogey on the final hole. The albatross is considered one of the rarest shots in golf, with only a few hundred occurring each year compared to the thousands of holes-in-one.</p>

Parties are using social media to appeal to voters, especially those unaffiliated, with major issues including support for households facing rising living costs and political funding scandals involving the LDP. Around 300 candidates are running in the assembly election, making it the highest number of candidates in over 30 years.</p>

          <p>The NHS in England will offer a world-first "Trojan horse" therapy for blood cancer, specifically myeloma. This therapy sneaks toxic drugs inside cancer cells, halting the cancer for nearly three times longer than current therapies. The drug, belantamab mafodotin, is an advanced form of chemotherapy that delivers a larger dose to cancer cells while reducing side effects. Clinical trials showed it halted the cancer for three years, compared to 13 months with current therapies.</p>
