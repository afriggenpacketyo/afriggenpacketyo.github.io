          <h2>Bessent Highlights Progress in Strategic Decoupling with China Through Tariff Agreement</h2>
          <div class="timestamp">2025-05-12 08:49:11 EDT</div>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Treasury Secretary Scott Bessent stated that the recent trade agreement with China marks a step in the U.S.'s strategic decoupling from reliance on Chinese products. While a complete break is unlikely, Bessent emphasized the importance of decoupling for strategic necessities, particularly after the COVID-19 pandemic exposed vulnerabilities in supply chains. The agreement involves suspending reciprocal tariffs, with the U.S. maintaining tariffs to protect its steel industry, critical medicines, and semiconductors. Bessent expressed optimism about Chinese officials assisting the U.S. in stopping the flow of fentanyl precursor drugs, indicating further talks are expected in the coming weeks.</p>

          <p>Global stock markets surged following a trade truce between the U.S. and China, implementing a 90-day cooling-off period and temporarily ending their tariff war. U.S. tariffs on Chinese imports will decrease from 145% to 30%, with Beijing lowering its tariffs from 125% to 10%. This agreement follows an initial trade deal with the United Kingdom, and Republican strategist Ryan Williams views it as a positive first step. The truce aims to address concerns over the economy and inflation, potentially improving President Trump's approval ratings which have been declining due to economic anxieties.</p>

          <p>The Federal Aviation Administration (FAA) is considering reducing flights at Newark Liberty International Airport after recent equipment failures and air traffic controller shortages caused significant flight disruptions. Transportation Secretary Sean Duffy warned that similar issues could occur at other airports nationwide, emphasizing the need to modernize aging U.S. aviation infrastructure. A late-April incident involved air traffic controllers losing the ability to communicate with planes, leading to numerous delays and controller trauma leave. Runway construction at Newark is also exacerbating delays as the busy summer travel season approaches.</p>

          <p>President Donald Trump's plan to tie Medicare drug prices to the lowest prices paid by other countries is facing strong opposition from the pharmaceutical industry. Drugmakers argue that this ‚Äúmost favored nation‚Äù approach could reduce their profits and impact research and development of new medications. Stephen J. Ubl, president and CEO of PhRMA, stated that the plan could cut billions from Medicare without guaranteeing patient access to medicines, and potentially increase reliance on China for innovative drugs. The executive order, likely impacting drugs covered by Medicare Part B, aims to lower costs for beneficiaries receiving medications during doctor's office visits.</p>

          <p>The U.S. and China have reached a temporary agreement to significantly ease tariffs imposed over the last couple of months, signaling a potential breakthrough in trade negotiations.

The current proposals would require artists to opt out of having their copyrighted works scraped by large language models.

          <p>John Cena revealed that he was diagnosed with skin cancer after spots were found on his pectoral and trapezius muscles during routine dermatology visits. This prompted him to integrate sunscreen into his daily routine after neglecting SPF in the past. Cena is now advocating for increased sunscreen use, especially among men, who are more likely to develop and die from melanoma. He emphasized that wearing SPF is like brushing your teeth and wants to encourage men to keep sunscreen next to their toothpaste.</p>

          <h2>The Importance of Cultivating 'Islands of Competence' in Children</h2>
          <div class="timestamp">2025-05-12 08:00:00 EDT</div>
        </div>
        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Clinical psychologist Robert Brooks argues that every child possesses distinct areas of ability, or ‚Äúislands of competence,‚Äù and that nurturing these strengths is crucial for growth. Research shows that ‚Äústrength-based parenting‚Äù correlates with lower stress levels and higher engagement in school. When young people experience themselves as strong and capable, they are better equipped to persevere through obstacles in other areas of their lives. Parents can help fortify children‚Äôs islands by identifying the island, naming it, building on it, using strengths to address weaknesses, and telling an optimistic story.</p>

          <h2>Treasury Yields Rise on Hopes of Recession Avoidance Following US-China Trade Deal</h2>
          <div class="timestamp">2025-05-12 07:55:02 EDT</div>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Treasury yields moved higher after the U.S. and China agreed to reduce tariffs, a move welcomed by investors. Tariffs between both countries will decrease from 125% to 10%, according to the terms of the deal. Economists had worried that the U.S., and perhaps the globe, could be pushed into a recession if both countries kept in place high tariffs on one another. Odds of a rate cut from the Federal Reserve in the near-term are also dropping as there may be less of a reason for the central bank to intervene and boost the labor market if the U.S. avoids a recession.</p>

          <p>Stock futures soared after the U.S. and China announced a truce in their trade war by agreeing to suspend steep tariffs for 90 days. The U.S. reduced its levies on Chinese imports to 30% from as high as 145%, while China cut its tariffs on American goods to 10% from 125%. Global stock markets also rose on news of the de-escalation. Some market analysts, however, warned that the road ahead remains uncertain, as the U.S. still has much higher tariffs on China than on other countries.</p>
