          <p>The perpetually grumpy German children's TV character, Bernd das Brot (Bernd the Bread), has achieved viral fame in the US after being featured on John Oliver's "Last Week Tonight." For 25 years, this world-weary loaf has been a cult figure in Germany, embodying a humorless German stereotype. Fans appreciate his stoic humor and constant listlessness, which contrasts with typical cheerful children's programming. His recent appearance with Oliver, where he quipped, "My life is hell," resonated with US audiences, garnering thousands of new fans.</p>

          <p>Gold prices have reached an all-time high of $3,800 per ounce, prompting investors who bought at lower prices to consider selling for profit. Experts recommend evaluating the timing, reviewing investment types (physical gold, ETFs, stocks), and comparing selling options, including local dealers or buyback programs. It is crucial to research current prices and understand potential tax implications, such as capital gains. While selling can lock in profits, some analysts suggest gold may still have room to appreciate, making continued holding an option for portfolio diversification and market turbulence hedging.

          <p>President Donald Trump has revealed a 21-point plan aimed at ending the war in Gaza, ahead of his meeting with Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu. The plan, which includes a pathway to a Palestinian state, demands the release of all remaining hostages in Gaza in exchange for hundreds of Palestinian prisoners. It also calls for Hamas's removal from power and disarmament, reform of the Palestinian Authority, and a halt to Israeli military operations and occupation of Gaza. The proposal, reportedly aided by the Tony Blair Institute, emphasizes economic growth for Gaza and security guarantees from the US and regional powers.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>A stress physiologist, Dr. Rebecca Heiss, argues that conventional stress management advice often misses a crucial element: channeling stress energy outward to help others. Her research, spanning two decades, suggests that 58% of people stress more when trying to control it internally. Instead, "stress springboarding" involves using stress as fuel for meaningful actions that benefit others, such as assisting a struggling colleague or volunteering for a cause. Brain imaging indicates that helping others activates reward centers and reduces activity in stress-related regions, effectively rewiring the brain for more effective stress handling.</p>
