          <p>South Sudanese models are gaining prominence in the fashion world, recognized for their striking features and resilience. Despite facing challenges like civil war and displacement, many have found success on international runways. However, some models have experienced exploitation, including being asked to pay fees or being paid in clothes rather than money. The industry's demand for diversity and the determination of these models suggest that South Sudan will continue to be a significant presence in the fashion industry for years to come. This has led to more open-mindedness about the career choice in urban areas, with many families becoming supportive of their daughters' success.</p>

          <p>Simone Biles publicly criticized Riley Gaines for her comments about a transgender woman softball player, calling Gaines "sick" and a "sore loser." Biles advocated for inclusivity in sports, suggesting the creation of a transgender category. Gaines, who has been vocal about transgender women competing in women's sports since tying with Lia Thomas in 2022, responded by saying Biles should not be advocating for transgender women in women's sports with her platform. The exchange highlights the ongoing debate surrounding transgender athletes and differing perspectives on inclusivity and fairness in sports.</p>

          <p>Gaziantep, Turkey, has become synonymous with baklava, transforming the sweet pastry into a tourist attraction and a cultural obsession. The city's baklava is distinguished by its thin layers, use of sugar syrup, and abundance of local pistachios. The traditional method of making baklava involves skilled artisans who have perfected the recipe over generations, using key ingredients like durum wheat flour, clarified butter, and Gaziantep pistachios. While baklava is found in many countries, Gaziantep has elevated it to an art form, celebrated in ceremonies, gifted as souvenirs, and enjoyed by locals and tourists alike.</p>

With members embedded in multiple agencies, the team's approach is becoming "institutionalized," according to an official. The DOGE's focus on efficiency and streamlining processes is expected to have a lasting impact on government operations, regardless of Musk's personal involvement.
