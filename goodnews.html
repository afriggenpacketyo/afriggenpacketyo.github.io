          <p>Conservative Karol Nawrocki, backed by President Trump, narrowly won Poland's presidential election against liberal Warsaw Mayor Rafa≈Ç Trzaskowski. The outcome suggests Poland is expected to take a more populist and nationalist path under its new leader. EU Commission President Ursula von der Leyen expressed confidence in continued cooperation with Poland. Nawrocki, a 42-year-old amateur boxer and historian, was tapped by the Law and Justice party for a fresh start and has been critical of President Volodymyr Zelenskyy, accusing him of taking advantage of allies.</p>
