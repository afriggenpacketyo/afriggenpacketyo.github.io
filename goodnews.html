        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Australia's Prime Minister Anthony Albanese secured a landslide re-election victory, partly fueled by anti-Trump sentiment among voters. While Albanese avoided direct criticism of Trump, the global instability caused by Trump's policies resonated in the Australian election. Opposition leader Peter Dutton's adoption of Trump-like messaging backfired, contributing to his defeat. Voters expressed concerns about the cost-of-living crisis and the impact of Trump's tariffs on their retirement accounts. The article suggests that Australians rejected Dutton's policies because they were seen as echoing the erratic and poorly considered approach associated with Trump.</p>

The Inchunwa Project supports this revival through research, community gatherings, and tattoo sessions, emphasizing the cultural and spiritual significance of the practice.

          <p>The Federal Reserve, led by Jerome Powell, is facing a difficult situation as it considers whether to hold interest rates steady or cut them. While officials are inclined to maintain rates due to inflation concerns, President Trump is pressuring the Fed to cut rates to stimulate the economy. Recent economic data, including a healthy increase in April payrolls, supports the Fed's ability to stand pat. However, uncertainty surrounding trade policies and potential tariffs adds complexity to the decision-making process. The article suggests that Powell will likely prioritize price stability amidst these conflicting pressures.</p>

          <p>African traders are increasingly bypassing the US dollar in favor of China's yuan for international transactions, particularly in commercial hubs like Nairobi and Lagos. This shift involves logistics companies facilitating Kenyan Shilling-yuan conversions for Chinese imports, enabling traders to pay in local currency. The companies manage yuan payments to Chinese sellers and handle the flow of goods, streamlining the trade process. This trend reflects growing economic ties between Africa and China and a move away from traditional reliance on the US dollar.</p>
