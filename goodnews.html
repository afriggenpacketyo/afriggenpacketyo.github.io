          <p>President Donald Trump celebrated a 6-3 Supreme Court decision that significantly curbed the power of federal judges to issue nationwide injunctions against executive actions. He hailed the ruling, which stemmed from challenges to his order on birthright citizenship, as a "monumental victory" that prevents a "handful of radical left judges" from blocking his policies. Democratic leaders, however, condemned the decision as a dangerous step toward authoritarianism that weakens judicial checks on presidential power.</p>

          <p>Despite concerns that President Trump's tariffs would trigger a new wave of inflation, U.S. prices have remained relatively stable. Economists suggest this is due to several short-term strategies employed by businesses to absorb the initial shock. These tactics include aggressively pre-ordering inventory before tariffs took effect, temporarily absorbing costs to avoid scaring consumers, and utilizing logistical loopholes like bonded warehouses to delay or lower duty payments.

The album is set in downtown Manhattan and delves into themes of desire, confusion, and a period of personal transition in the artist's late 20s. While praised for its craftsmanship and conversational style, the review notes that the album's introspective focus can sometimes feel insular and muddle its visceral energy.</p>
