          <p>U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE) arrested eleven Iranian nationals across eight states and nine cities in a 48-hour operation, including one individual on a watchlist. Mehran Makari Sahel, allegedly a former member of the Islamic Revolutionary Guard Corps (IRGC) with Hezbollah connections, was among those apprehended. ICE reported that five of those arrested had prior criminal convictions, and all eleven face charges beyond civil immigration violations, posing a potential threat to public safety. In addition to the Iranian nationals, a U.S. citizen was arrested for threatening law enforcement officers and harboring an illegal alien, with officials stating the arrests are part of a crackdown on illegal immigration following U.S. strikes on Iranian nuclear sites. The Department of Homeland Security activated its National Terrorism Advisory System due to concerns about potential retaliation, and officials are collaborating with local authorities to address potential threats. Optimism is tempered by the serious nature of the alleged crimes and the potential for escalation, but the proactive measures taken by law enforcement provide a degree of reassurance.</p>

          <p>A central bank advisor in China is advocating for a more proactive fiscal policy in response to rising global uncertainties, particularly following the outbreak of war in the Middle East. While fiscal discipline is typically seen as essential, the current circumstances may warrant a different approach, according to Huang Yiping. Heightened geopolitical tensions, including recent clashes between Israel and Iran, have raised concerns about global economic stability. President Trump stated that Israel and Iran had agreed to a ceasefire set to take effect within 24 hours.</p>

          <p>China has released details about its upcoming Tianwen-3 Mars sample return mission, which aims to bring back at least 500 grams of Martian material by 2031. The mission will use a lander-mounted drill, a robotic arm, and, for the first time, a helicopter drone to collect surface samples. The drone will be equipped with a robotic arm and claw to retrieve larger rocks from over 100 meters away and transport them back to the lander. Returned samples will be processed in a planetary protection laboratory with high-level biocontainment capabilities to ensure the safety of the Earth environment.</p>

The Trump administration's proposed budget for fiscal 2026 calls for scaling back financial aid, including reducing the maximum federal Pell Grant award. Despite increasing tuition costs, the actual amount students and families pay after scholarships and grants are deducted is the key factor to consider.

          <p>California's groundwater supplies experienced a significant boost due to average precipitation, with aquifers gaining an estimated 2.2 million acre-feet of groundwater.

Despite the replenishment, groundwater pumping for agriculture continues, with the Central Valley accounting for the majority of groundwater extraction statewide. Governor Newsom emphasized the need to modernize the state's water infrastructure, reiterating support for the Delta Conveyance Project, while state programs like LandFlex have helped save groundwater by reducing pumping on small and midsize farms.</p>

Strengthening your credit profile and shopping around for different lenders can help secure a better rate, and borrowers may soon see some relief if the Fed decides to pause rate hikes.

The park's emergency team, including trained firearms staff, was deployed, and police were notified to support the team. Staff monitored the bears on CCTV, and they remained calm, not breaching any public areas. Eventually, Mish returned to the enclosure on her own, and Lucy was lured back with a bell and her favorite foods.</p>

          <p>Senators Tim Scott and Cynthia Lummis are introducing a framework for a major bill to set the rules for digital assets. The bill aims to define when crypto is a commodity or a security, allow crypto exchanges to register with the Commodity Futures Trading Commission, and reduce the Securities and Exchange Commission's regulation of digital currencies. The proposed legislation also includes measures to prevent money laundering and sanctions evasion. Scott hopes the bill will provide clarity for digital asset regulation, building on the bipartisan momentum from the recent stablecoin bill passage. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>Senate Majority Leader John Thune has announced that senators will remain in Washington until the chamber passes a megabill to fund much of President Trump's domestic policy agenda. This announcement comes as the "One Big Beautiful Bill Act" is undergoing scrutiny by Senate Parliamentarian Elizabeth MacDonough for potential violations of Senate rules. This review, known as the Byrd Bath, is still underway in the Senate, potentially delaying the bill's passage before the planned July 4 recess.</p>

          <p>Federal Reserve Chair Jerome Powell has emphasized the central bank's commitment to keeping inflation in check, stating that policymakers will remain on hold until they better understand the impact of tariffs on prices. He characterized economic growth as strong and the labor market near full employment, but noted that inflation remains above the Fed's 2% target. Powell's cautious stance comes amid ongoing criticism from President Trump, who has urged the Fed to cut interest rates. Powell is scheduled to present his comments to congressional committees this week.</p>

          <p>NATO Secretary General Mark Rutte has stated that the U.S. and President Donald Trump are fully committed to NATO, aiming to reassure allies amid concerns that Washington might withdraw support due to uneven defense spending. Rutte emphasized that this commitment comes with the expectation that European and Canadian allies will increase their defense spending to equalize with the U.S. Ahead of the summit, NATO members agreed to increase defense spending to 5% of gross domestic product (GDP) by 2035. Despite tensions, allies are keen to maintain Trump's support, given his skepticism toward international collectives like NATO.</p>

          <p>President Trump is attending a NATO summit in The Hague, Netherlands, following a ceasefire announcement between Iran and Israel. Prior to the summit, Trump said both Iran and Israel had violated the ceasefire, but later stated Israel would not bomb Iran again. During the summit, Trump aimed to secure a commitment from NATO allies to spend at least 5% of GDP on defense, with the alliance already agreeing to this boost. Russia's war on Ukraine is also a key topic of concern, though it is unclear whether the U.S. will support language citing Russia as the main threat to NATO.</p>
