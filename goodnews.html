          <p>England has announced its squad for the first Test match against India, recalling Jacob Bethell and including Jamie Overton. Bethell returns to the squad after missing the Zimbabwe match due to IPL commitments, though his place in the final XI is not assured. Gus Atkinson is out with a hamstring injury, joining other sidelined fast bowlers, while Chris Woakes and Brydon Carse return. Overton is in the Test squad for the first time since the 2022 tour of Pakistan, and Josh Tongue and Sam Cook are also included, with Matthew Potts missing out. The series opener is scheduled for June 20 at Headingley. The optimism score for this article is neutral, as it simply reports team selections and injury updates. </p>

          <p>This article reports that athletes participating in the World Cup, individuals holding dual citizenship, and those with existing visas will be exempt from the Trump administration's new travel ban. The ban, which restricts entry into the United States for nationals from specific countries, includes exceptions to accommodate international events and pre-existing legal permissions. This ensures that the World Cup can proceed without disruption and that individuals with established ties to the U.S. are not unduly affected. The article focuses on the exceptions rather than the ban itself, providing a balanced perspective on the policy's implementation. </p>

          <p>German Defense Minister Boris Pistorius stated that Germany needs to recruit up to 60,000 additional service personnel to meet NATO's updated defense requirements amidst growing tensions with Russia. Germany is adapting its military posture in response to NATO's plans for collective defense, shoring up its eastern flank following Russia's invasion of Ukraine. Pistorius has proposed a model relying on voluntary service, with the option to make conscription compulsory if needed, where 18-year-olds would receive a questionnaire about their interest in the army and physical condition. Germany had conscription for young men until 2011, when it was scrapped. </p>

          <p>British money transfer firm Wise announced its plan to move its primary listing location to the U.S., which is a blow to the London stock exchange. Wise stated in its full-year earnings statement that it will move to a dual listing, shifting its main listing hub to the U.S. while maintaining a secondary listing in London. This move would allow Wise's shares to trade on both a U.S. stock exchange and the LSE, and shares of Wise traded 7% higher during early morning deals Thursday. The company's decision reflects a broader trend of firms seeking more favorable listing environments. </p>

The Department for Education has allocated ¬£1 billion to fund the change up to 2029 and pledged ¬£13 million to food charities to fight food poverty.

          <p>The UK's medicines regulator has warned women using weight-loss jabs to use effective contraception, as it's uncertain if the medicines could harm an unborn baby. Weight-loss jabs may reduce the effectiveness of the contraceptive pill, particularly in overweight or obese women, due to side effects like vomiting and diarrhoea. The MHRA advises women to use contraception while taking GLP-1 medicines and for a specific period afterward, ranging from one to two months depending on the drug. The warning comes amid concerns that the growing popularity of these injections means many women are not using the drugs safely. </p>

The writers also debate whether having two small-market teams in the finals is a problem, highlighting the coaching advantage, unheralded players to watch, and finals MVP predictions.

          <p>Susanna Rustin explores the generational divide in views on sex and gender in Britain, noting that younger people are more likely to support transgender rights activism. She argues that the progressive explanation for this age gap is progress, with younger generations being more relaxed about sex and sexuality. However, Rustin contends that valuing inclusion over bodily privacy and fairness is sexist, as women are more disadvantaged by these changes. She suggests that consciousness of sexual difference accumulates across the life-course, influencing views on gender identity. </p>

          <p>Two major convenience store chains in Japan, Family Mart Co. and Lawson Inc., have started selling government-released stockpiled rice at select stores in Tokyo and Osaka to help consumers struggling with soaring rice prices. The rice from the 2021 harvest will be sold in small portions to make it affordable, with Family Mart pricing its 1-kg package at 388 yen and Lawson's at 389 yen and 756 yen for 2 kg. Lawson plans to expand availability nationwide on June 14, while Family Mart will also expand areas selling the rice, and Seven-Eleven Japan Co. will start selling stockpiled rice in some stores on June 17. This measure is intended to increase access to rice for consumers facing financial difficulties. </p>
