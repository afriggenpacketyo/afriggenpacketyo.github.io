          <p>Ferrari is grappling with tyre performance issues, hindering their ability to compete with McLaren in Formula 1, as highlighted after the Miami Grand Prix. Team principal Frederic Vasseur acknowledged that Ferrari's car pace matched Red Bull and Mercedes during the race but was compromised by poor grid positions due to tyre struggles. Small upgrades are expected for the upcoming races in Imola and Monaco, with stricter rules on front wing deflection anticipated to level the playing field in Barcelona.

Experts believe that their agile supply chains and ability to operate on thin margins will allow them to continue offering competitive prices.

Government jobs, once seen as less appealing due to lower pay and limited personal choices, now offer stability and security amidst economic uncertainties.
