          <p>A Chinese national, Zhimin Qian, has been convicted in London for her central role in a massive cryptocurrency money laundering operation. The scheme, which defrauded over 128,000 investors in China between 2014 and 2017, resulted in the seizure of 61,000 bitcoins, valued at over £5 billion. After fleeing China, Qian attempted to launder the funds in the UK by purchasing property before her arrest, which followed a complex, multi-jurisdictional investigation. Her legal team stated she hopes the guilty plea will help facilitate compensation for the victims from the seized assets.</p>

          <p>A Chinese court has sentenced 11 members of the notorious Ming crime family to death for their involvement in running extensive scam and gambling operations in Myanmar. The family was a key player in Laukkaing, a town on the China-Myanmar border that became a hub for criminal activities, including trafficking and forced labor in scam centers. The court found them guilty of generating over $1.4 billion from illegal activities and being responsible for the deaths of several workers. This verdict signals Beijing's intensified crackdown on cross-border criminal enterprises that have victimized thousands of Chinese citizens.</p>

          <p>The UK's Labour government plans to launch a new digital hospital service, NHS Online, by 2027 to help alleviate pressure on the healthcare system and reduce patient waiting lists. The service will be accessible via the NHS app and will feature dedicated doctors for online assessments, consultations, and follow-up appointments. Officials state the initiative aims to modernize the NHS, freeing up in-person capacity for those who need it most by handling millions of appointments virtually. While the plan builds on successful pilot programs, concerns remain about implementation, staffing, and ensuring access for patients who are not digitally proficient.</p>

          <p>Zijin Gold, the overseas mining division of China's Zijin Mining, experienced a dramatic surge of over 60% in its Hong Kong trading debut. The company raised approximately $3.2 billion in its initial public offering, making it the world's second-largest IPO of the year. The successful listing comes as gold prices have reached record highs, driven by strong safe-haven demand and global economic uncertainty. This strong performance highlights a resurgence in Hong Kong's IPO market and investor confidence in the precious metals sector. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>A U.S. District Judge has blocked a planned wave of terminations at the U.S. Agency for Global Media (USAGM) and its subsidiary, Voice of America (VOA). In a sharply worded ruling, Judge Royce Lamberth criticized agency head Kari Lake, stating her administration showed a "brazen disinterest" in its legal obligations to provide reliable news coverage, particularly in mandated language services. The judge accused the agency of misleading the court about the certainty of the layoffs and warned that their conduct could have justified civil contempt proceedings. The order preserves the jobs through October 14, pending a new plan to restore legally required programming.</p>

          <p>Heather Knight, who captained the England women's cricket team for nine years, discusses her transition back to being a regular player after being replaced as skipper. She reflects on the all-encompassing nature of the captaincy and the revival of her more rebellious "alter ego" now that she is free from leadership duties. Despite an injury that sidelined her for the summer, Knight expresses pride in her achievements, including a 2017 World Cup victory, and feels ready to close that chapter of her life. Now focused on her playing career, she is preparing for the upcoming World Cup in India and Sri Lanka.</p>

        </div>
        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>The Reserve Bank of Australia (RBA) has decided to maintain its benchmark policy rate at 3.6%, citing persistent inflation, which is at its highest level in over a year. The decision was widely expected by economists, as recent data suggests inflation may be higher than previously forecast, driven by rising costs in housing, food, and alcohol. The RBA signaled that while private demand is recovering, the economic outlook remains uncertain due to both domestic and international factors. This hold follows a series of rate cuts earlier in the year aimed at curbing inflation. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>A number of Brazilian strikers currently playing in the English Premier League are in contention for the starting number nine position on the national team ahead of the next World Cup. With a rich history of legendary goalscorers, Brazil is now looking to its English-based talent to lead the attack. Players like Brentford's Igor Thiago, Tottenham's Richarlison, and Chelsea's Joao Pedro are all making their case with strong performances for their respective clubs. Their form in one of the world's most competitive leagues will likely be a key factor in the selection process for Brazil's upcoming World Cup qualifiers.</p>

          <p>Major grocery retailers in China, including Walmart and Alibaba's Freshippo, are shifting their strategy to combat an economic slump by emulating discount chains like Aldi. They are streamlining their large hypermarkets and increasingly focusing on their own private-label products, which offer quality comparable to name brands at lower prices. This move is a direct response to a change in consumer behavior, as shoppers become more frugal and value-conscious amid economic uncertainty. The goal is to win back customers by adopting a business model that has proven successful in the US and Europe.</p>

          <p>Two mountain lion cubs that were found alone and malnourished earlier this year have been successfully rehabilitated and released back into the wild in San Diego County. The cubs were cared for at the San Diego Humane Society’s Ramona Wildlife Center, where staff worked to ensure they did not become accustomed to humans. This was done to give them the best chance of survival and to prevent future human-wildlife conflicts. The release is a positive development for the "near-threatened" species, whose population in California is estimated to be significantly lower than previously thought.</p>

Despite an underwhelming regular season by their standards, the team finished strong and now faces a new challenge: becoming the first MLB team in 25 years to win back-to-back championships. With a star-studded but recently inconsistent lineup and questions surrounding their bullpen, the team is counting on its strong starting pitching to lead the way. The players acknowledge the pressure is ever-present for a team with a record-setting payroll.</p>
