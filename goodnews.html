          <p>A local government in China detailed the penalties imposed on a 20-year-old, surnamed Liu, who refused to serve in the military due to personal preferences, which is part of a broader effort to discourage military service dodging. Liu is now banned from civil service jobs, state-owned enterprises, and faces travel restrictions, along with a fine of 38,000 yuan (US$5,300). These measures aim to reinforce the importance of fulfilling military service obligations and ensure that young people understand the significance of serving in the armed forces, which is a common practice in China.</p>

          <p>President Trump publicly criticized Walmart for attributing price increases to tariffs on imported goods, insisting that the company should absorb the costs instead. Walmart had warned that prices on various items, including bananas and car seats, could rise due to the tariffs. Trump's remarks underscore the ongoing tension between his administration's trade policies and major American companies, which are facing challenges from rising import taxes. Walmart has always worked to keep prices as low as possible and "we won't stop." </p>

        </div>
        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>The Menendez brothers, convicted of murdering their parents, have seen a shift in public perception due to increased awareness of trauma and sexual abuse. New evidence and media portrayals have garnered sympathy for their claims of abuse, potentially influencing their chances of parole. A Los Angeles judge reduced the brothers' sentence to include the possibility of parole, which could be granted at a hearing next month. The shift in how the public views criminal justice, with more emphasis on rehabilitation and reducing prison populations instead of the tough-on-crime mentality that dominated Los Angeles at the end of the 20th Century, has further helped their case.</p>

Peters' images are featured in his new book, which serves as a "rallying cry" to transform manicured spaces into wildlife-friendly havens. He started concentrating on his own garden wildlife after a diagnosis of bowel cancer in 2018, perfecting a technique to "make time stop" to get shots of birds and butterflies taking off and in mid flight. This work also captures rare images of birds - showing the effect of diffraction on their wings, giving a rainbow effect.</p>
