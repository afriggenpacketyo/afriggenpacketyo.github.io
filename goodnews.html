        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>A high-ranking Chinese resources official has publicly advocated for the nation to take a more assertive role in developing international regulations for deep-sea mining. Citing China's extensive number of mining areas and diverse seabed resource claims, the official stated that the country should be a key guide in forming the regulatory framework. This strategic push aims to enhance China's global influence and competitiveness in securing critical minerals like cobalt and copper, which are essential for advanced technologies such as electric vehicles. The statement emphasizes a critical period where international maritime rules are still being formulated.</p>

          <p>Rhun ap Iorwerth, leader of Plaid Cymru, is set to declare at his party's annual conference that they are prepared to replace the long-governing Welsh Labour party. He will argue that change in Wales is inevitable and will position Plaid Cymru as the primary alternative for voters wanting to prevent a victory by Reform UK in the next Senedd election. For a century, Labour has dominated Welsh politics, but recent polls suggest a tighter race. Plaid Cymru aims to broaden its appeal beyond its traditional strongholds by focusing on a platform of new energy and ideas rather than making independence the central issue.</p>

          <p>Treasury Secretary Scott Bessent has reduced the list of potential candidates for the next Federal Reserve chair from eleven to five following a series of intensive interviews. The remaining contenders include current Fed officials Michelle Bowman and Christopher Waller, as well as former Fed Governor Kevin Warsh, former economic advisor Kevin Hassett, and BlackRock's Rick Rieder. Bessent is reportedly seeking a candidate open to new ideas on monetary policy and willing to potentially scale back the Fed's size and scope. The final decision will be made by President Trump after another round of interviews, likely after Thanksgiving. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>A ceasefire between Israel and Hamas has officially begun, with the Israel Defense Forces (IDF) repositioning troops along newly established deployment lines in Gaza. This move is the first step in a phased agreement that includes the release of all hostages held by Hamas in exchange for over 1,000 Palestinian prisoners. To support and monitor the agreement, U.S. Central Command is establishing a coordination center in Israel with approximately 200 U.S. service members, who will not enter Gaza but will assist with humanitarian aid and security logistics. The deal also calls for increased humanitarian aid to enter the besieged territory.</p>

          <h2>Upcoming 401(k) Rule Change to Impact Tax Deductions for High Earners</h2>

          <p>A significant change to 401(k) plans, enacted by the Secure 2.0 Act, will soon alter how high earners make catch-up contributions. Starting in 2026, individuals earning more than $145,000 from their employer in the prior year must make their catch-up contributions to an after-tax Roth account, eliminating the option for a traditional pretax deduction. This rule does not affect standard 401(k) contributions but specifically targets the additional amounts saved by those age 50 and older. Financial planners advise that now is a critical time for affected workers to strategize with advisors about their multi-year tax projections. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>A free speech institute affiliated with Columbia University has won a major legal victory against the Trump administration over the detention of pro-Palestinian students. A federal judge ruled that the detention and attempted deportation of student Mahmoud Khalil and others was unconstitutional and intended to suppress free speech. The case was brought by the Knight First Amendment Institute, which argued the administration was targeting noncitizen students for their political activism. The victory highlights a growing tension between the institute and Columbia University itself, which recently settled with the administration over antisemitism claims in a move critics called capitulation.</p>

          <p>Ecuador's national soccer team is preparing for the 2026 World Cup with high expectations, following a record-breaking qualification campaign where they finished second in South America. Under coach Sebastián Beccacece, the team has developed a formidable defensive strategy, conceding only five goals throughout the entire qualifying process. This success is attributed to the growth of the domestic league, a strong youth development system producing European-caliber players like Moisés Caicedo, and a disciplined, counter-attacking style. As they prepare for friendlies against the U.S. and Mexico, the team's goal is to maintain their intensity and achieve their best-ever World Cup result.</p>

          <p>The 2025 Nobel Peace Prize has been awarded to Venezuelan opposition leader María Corina Machado for her persistent efforts to promote democratic rights and transition the country away from authoritarian rule.

Machado founded the pro-democracy group Súmate and has led the opposition despite being expelled from office in 2014. The committee stated she embodies the hope for a future where citizens' fundamental rights are protected and their voices are heard, emphasizing that democracy is a precondition for lasting peace.</p>

          <p>Following the Israeli Cabinet's approval of a ceasefire agreement, Israeli forces have started to withdraw troops from Gaza, marking a significant step toward ending the two-year war. The initial phase of the deal focuses on the release of all hostages held by Hamas in exchange for approximately 2,000 Palestinian prisoners and detainees. As troops pull back to a buffer zone, Palestinian residents have begun gathering near Gaza City, expressing hope to return to their homes. The agreement, brokered with U.S. involvement, leaves critical questions about Gaza's future governance and reconstruction unresolved, but brings a halt to a devastating conflict.</p>

          <p>A 1,900-year-old Roman grave marker discovered in a New Orleans backyard has been traced back to the granddaughter of a U.S. soldier who served in Italy during World War II. The woman, Erin Scott O’Brien, explained that her grandfather, Charles Paddock Jr., brought the artifact home after the war and it was passed down to her. Unaware of its historical significance, she used the marble tablet as a garden decoration and left it behind when she sold the house in 2018. The new owners, an anthropologist and her husband, identified the Latin inscription and contacted experts, leading to the artifact's identification and plans for its repatriation to an Italian museum.</p>

          <p>Katrina Thompson, the mayor of Broadview, Illinois, and a former resident of Los Angeles during the 1992 riots, asserts that President Trump is fabricating a narrative of urban unrest to justify deploying the National Guard. Thompson states that the situation in her Chicago suburb, a recent focus of federal immigration enforcement, is calm and bears no resemblance to the widespread violence she witnessed in Los Angeles. A federal judge recently issued a restraining order blocking the deployment in Illinois, citing no credible evidence of rebellion. The mayor's perspective provides a local counterpoint to the administration's claims of widespread chaos in American cities.</p>
