          <p>Loretta Swit, best known for her role as Major Margaret "Hot Lips" Houlihan on the hit TV series M*A*S*H, has passed away at the age of 87 in her New York home, with her representative stating that she likely died of natural causes. Swit's portrayal of the tough yet vulnerable Army nurse earned her two Emmy Awards and four Golden Globe nominations during the show's 11-season run. She also worked to develop the character beyond the "Hot Lips" stereotype, aiming for a more realistic and intelligent depiction, according to an interview with Suzy Kalter. Beyond M*A*S*H, Swit had a prolific career in theater, film, and television, while also being an artist and animal rights activist.</p>

          <p>Rugby league authorities are expressing their disappointment over the sport's lack of knighthood or damehood recognition in its 130-year history, contrasting it with rugby union and other sports. The Speaker of the House of Commons, Sir Lindsay Hoyle, supports this sentiment, highlighting the numerous rugby league players who have excelled and inspired future generations. David Baines, chair of the all-party Parliamentary rugby league group, suggests that the lack of recognition may stem from class prejudice, given the working-class backgrounds of many rugby league stars. This push for recognition coincides with Kevin Sinfield's charitable fundraising efforts for the sport.</p>

          <p>Donald Trump announced he is doubling tariffs on steel imports to 50% and celebrated a "blockbuster" agreement for Japan-based Nippon Steel to invest in US Steel during a rally in Pennsylvania. The increased tariff aims to further secure the steel industry in the United States, with Trump stating that the new tariffs will also apply to imported aluminum. Trump framed the administration‚Äôs drive to boost domestic steel production as a matter of national security and promised every US steel worker would soon receive a $5,000 bonus. He also repeated false claims about the 2020 election being stolen and called on Congressional Republicans to support his "one big, beautiful bill."</p>

Prime Minister Jonas Gahr Store has acknowledged the issue, and the government plans to move the celebrations to the post-exam period starting next year.
