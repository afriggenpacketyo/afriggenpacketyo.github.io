          <div class="timestamp">2025-07-09 03:06:11 EDT</div>
        </div>
        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Major UK housebuilders have collectively agreed to pay £100 million towards affordable housing initiatives, a significant step to prevent a formal decision by the Competition and Markets Authority (CMA) on whether they breached competition law. The seven implicated firms, including industry giants like Barratt and Persimmon, have also committed to ceasing the sharing of commercially sensitive information, such as house sale prices, except in tightly controlled situations. Although the companies maintain no admission of liability or wrongdoing, this agreement allows the CMA to prioritize fostering a more competitive housing market in the future, concluding an investigation into alleged information exchanges concerning pricing and buyer incentives. This resolution aims to address market concerns without a prolonged legal battle.</p>

          <p>With all 23 British players now out of the Wimbledon singles, former professional Naomi Broady offers an insightful analysis of their performances, highlighting key takeaways for their future development. She notes Jack Draper's need for more grass-court time despite a strong overall season, Emma Raducanu's "incredible tournament" where she pushed the world number one, and Katie Boulter's continued improvement despite a shock early exit. Broady also praises Sonay Kartal's breakthrough to the fourth round and Cameron Norrie's recovery of form to reach the quarter-finals. The article emphasizes the unique pressure British players face at Wimbledon and their potential to build on these experiences for future success.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Palm Beach County, Florida, has unanimously approved a resolution to ceremonially rename a four-mile stretch of Southern Boulevard, specifically the portion extending from Palm Beach International Airport to the Mar-a-Lago resort, as "President Donald J. Trump Boulevard." President Trump publicly praised the decision on Truth Social, expressing his gratitude and calling it a "wonderful honor" from the "Great State of Florida," which he noted winning "BIG three times." The legislation also includes renaming another section of the road "PBSO Motorman Highway" to honor three motorcycle deputies who died in a crash last year, with new signs for both names expected later this year.</p>

          <p>Lena Dunham's new Netflix series, "Too Much," offers a fresh perspective on the London rom-com genre, drawing inspiration from her own experiences of moving to the city and confronting the gap between her romanticized British fantasies and the actual reality. Having grown up as an "Anglophile" captivated by classical literature and period dramas, Dunham found adjusting to London's social cues and linguistic subtleties in her 30s particularly confounding. The 10-episode show, produced by Working Title and starring Megan Stalter and Will Sharpe, features a host of celebrity cameos. This article highlights how the series delves into the authentic, often messy, aspects of adulting and dating in a new country, moving beyond traditional idyllic portrayals.</p>

          <p>China's ambitious "Green Great Wall" project has reached a significant milestone with the completion of a 1,856-kilometer green belt in Inner Mongolia, successfully containing the Badain Jaran, Tengger, and Ulan Buh deserts. This massive environmental undertaking spans a total area of 94,700 square kilometers. The strategy involves initially stabilizing shifting sands using straw checkerboards, then planting drought-resistant trees like sacsaoul to create a robust and effective sand prevention and control system. This achievement in the Alxa league, the westernmost part of Inner Mongolia, represents a major advancement in China's long-term national efforts to combat desertification and strengthen ecological barriers.</p>

          <p>Milwaukee Brewers phenom Jacob Misiorowski delivered an "unbelievable" performance on the mound, striking out 12 Los Angeles Dodgers batters over six innings and extending their losing streak to five games with a 3-1 victory. Despite the Dodgers' game plan to "stress him as much as we can" by working long at-bats, Misiorowski's exceptional command and triple-digit fastball proved overwhelming for their lineup. Although Shohei Ohtani hit an early leadoff home run, the Dodgers struggled to capitalize on subsequent scoring opportunities, leaving runners stranded.

          <p>An opinion piece posits that Hong Kong is uniquely positioned to become a central hub for global public goods, leveraging the shifting center of gravity for global development and cooperation towards the East, particularly as the U.S. reconsiders its foreign aid approach. The article highlights the recent end of USAID's independent agency status and the high-profile inauguration of China's International Organisation for Mediation in Hong Kong, suggesting China is actively filling a void left by the U.S. It criticizes the "America first" mentality under President Trump for neglecting soft power cultivation and dismantling key U.S. development institutions, arguing this short-sighted approach creates opportunities for other global actors like Hong Kong.</p>

Scalise advocated for her release, emphasizing her "life's work" and community involvement. While the Department of Homeland Security maintains her illegal status, her attorney noted that Scalise's "absolutely crucial" intervention highlights the challenges faced by other long-term residents in similar situations who lack access to political influence for their cases.</p>
