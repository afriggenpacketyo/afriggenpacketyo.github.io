          <p>In the current economic climate, savers are weighing the benefits of short-term versus long-term certificates of deposit (CDs) for a $5,000 investment. Unusually, short-term CDs currently offer slightly higher annual percentage yields (APYs) due to banks hedging against potential future interest rate cuts by the Federal Reserve. However, calculations show that long-term CDs, despite lower rates, generate substantially greater total returns over their extended terms due to the power of compounding. The choice depends on an individual's financial goals, balancing the higher immediate rates and flexibility of short-term CDs against the larger overall earnings from long-term options.

          <p>Meta CEO Mark Zuckerberg has announced plans for a massive investment in artificial intelligence infrastructure, with the company's first AI data supercluster, named Prometheus, set to come online in 2026. This initiative is part of a broader strategy to build several multi-gigawatt clusters to train advanced AI models and attract top research talent. The move follows Zuckerberg's expressed frustration with Meta's progress in AI, particularly after the lukewarm reception of its Llama 4 models. By creating Meta Superintelligence Labs and committing billions to compute power, the company aims to aggressively compete with rivals like OpenAI and Google in the race to develop leading AI technology.</p>

          <p>Following new analyst coverage from Melius, CNBC's Jim Cramer expressed his continued confidence in Starbucks and Texas Roadhouse. Melius initiated Starbucks with a "sell" rating, a position Cramer disagrees with, highlighting CEO Brian Niccol's ongoing positive changes and citing a more bullish outlook from Citi. Conversely, Melius gave Texas Roadhouse a "buy" rating, calling it a rare growth story in casual dining, which Cramer supported, noting its potential as a high-growth stock. The discussion took place amid broader market uncertainty following President Trump's tariff threats, with Cramer suggesting individuals might see buying opportunities. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>Starbucks is making its popular "secret menu" official by adding previously unlisted drink combinations to its mobile app, exclusively for rewards members. The initiative introduces four new customized beverages and is part of a broader strategy by CEO Brian Niccol to revitalize the brand and re-engage customers. This move aims to enhance the customer experience following recent menu simplifications and changes to add-on pricing. To further promote the new feature, the company is hosting a contest where customers can submit their own custom drink creations for a chance to win up to $25,000.</p>

          <p>A comprehensive study by CNBC has ranked U.S. states based on quality of life, a crucial factor for businesses seeking to attract talent in a mobile workforce. Vermont claimed the top spot for the fifth consecutive year, excelling in metrics like low crime, clean air, and strong protections for reproductive and voter rights. Other top-ranking states include Maine, New Jersey, Minnesota, and Connecticut, which scored well on health, safety, and inclusiveness. The methodology considers a wide range of factors, including crime rates, environmental quality, healthcare access, child care availability, and legal protections against discrimination, reflecting the evolving priorities of American workers.</p>

          <p>Bitcoin's value soared to a new record high, trading above $120,000 as U.S. lawmakers began "Crypto Week" to deliberate on new digital asset regulations. The rally is fueled by significant inflows into Bitcoin ETFs, with one recent day seeing $1.18 billion in new investments, and increased buying from institutional and corporate investors. Analysts suggest that growing regulatory clarity in the U.S., supported by the Trump administration, is boosting investor confidence. While some experts predict Bitcoin could reach $125,000 or higher in the coming months, potential risks include trade disputes and the Federal Reserve's hawkish monetary policy.

The schedule also places new sports like flag football in prime-time slots to maximize exposure. With the games returning to U.S. soil, the schedule is optimized for American prime-time television, aiming to boost viewership after lower ratings from recent games held in Asian time zones.</p>

Svyrydenko, 39, has risen quickly through government ranks and played a key role in recent international negotiations, including a significant mineral deal with the United States.

          <p>Amid escalating criticism from the White House, Federal Reserve Chair Jerome Powell has asked the Fed's inspector general to conduct a review of a major renovation project for its Washington, D.C. headquarters. The project has drawn accusations of "fundamental mismanagement" and "excess spending" from Trump administration officials, who claim its cost has ballooned beyond its initial $2.5 billion estimate. The Fed, which is self-funded and not reliant on taxpayer money, has defended the renovation as necessary to address safety issues and bring the aging buildings up to modern code. This move to involve the inspector general appears to be a direct response to the political pressure.</p>

          <p>England's second-place finish in their Euro 2025 group has sparked debate over whether it provides them a more favorable route in the knockout stages. By not winning the group, the Lionesses avoid a quarter-final clash with powerhouse Germany and are on the opposite side of the bracket from World Cup winners Spain, a potential finalist opponent. They will instead face Sweden, a strong but historically less dominant team than Germany in the Euros. Should they advance, their semi-final opponent would be either Norway or Italy, both ranked outside the world's top 10, suggesting a potentially smoother path to the final.</p>

          <p>A bipartisan group of female senators is promoting the "She Drives Act" to address the higher rate of injury and death for women in car crashes. The legislation would require the use of more advanced crash test dummies that better represent the female population, as current tests primarily use a dummy based on an average-sized male from the 1990s. Data shows women are 73% more likely to be seriously injured in a crash. Proponents argue that female-simulating dummies, which are already used internationally, would provide crucial data to design safer vehicles for everyone, while the Department of Transportation has committed to accelerating the process.</p>

          <p>With the Federal Reserve potentially cutting interest rates later this year, financial experts are advising savers on how to choose the best certificate of deposit (CD) term. Some experts suggest that short-term CDs remain attractive, as banks are offering competitive rates to attract deposits while anticipating future rate drops. Others argue for locking in today's high yields with a longer-term CD before rates potentially fall. For those uncertain, a CD ladder strategy, which involves spreading deposits across multiple terms, is recommended to balance long-term yields with regular access to funds as they mature.
