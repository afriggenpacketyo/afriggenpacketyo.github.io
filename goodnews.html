          <p>A 6.3 magnitude earthquake struck central Colombia, causing alarm among residents in cities like Bogota, Medellin, and Cali. The shallow quake, centered near Paratebueno, prompted people to evacuate buildings, though initial reports indicated no significant damage. The Colombian Geological Service reported several aftershocks following the initial tremor. Colombia is located in the Pacific Ring of Fire, a region prone to seismic activity, which makes this event a somber reminder of the country's geographic reality. The National Unit for Disaster Risk Management is assessing the situation in various municipalities to ensure citizen safety.</p>

          <p>Costco has introduced a new frozen strawberry lemonade at its food courts, sparking varied reactions from members. The drink, priced at $2.99, boasts real fruit and no artificial flavors or colors, but some customers find it too tart or sweet. While some reviewers praise the drink as refreshing, others express disappointment, with some longing for the return of the previous strawberry banana smoothie or even the churro. One customer even had to use a blender to make the drink drinkable due to fruit chunks getting stuck in the straw, indicating a potential quality control issue. This new beverage is the latest in a series of food court changes at Costco, including the revival of the combo pizza in calzone form and the replacement of Pepsi products with Coca-Cola. </p>

          <h2>Psychologist Identifies Common Sources of Conflict in Relationships</h2>
          <div class="timestamp">2025-06-08 13:36:16 EDT</div>
        </div>
        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>A psychologist specializing in couples identifies tone of voice, family relations, household chores, and communication styles as the most frequent causes of conflict in relationships. A sour tone can signal contempt, a major predictor of divorce, while family disagreements often stem from unmet needs or value clashes. Arguments over chores frequently reflect an unequal distribution of labor and a lack of acknowledgment for the invisible load. Ineffective communication can escalate minor issues into major fights, but the psychologist suggests strategies for moving past these issues, such as naming the effect of a condescending tone, reassuring one another in family disputes, acknowledging the invisible load, and using a designated word or phrase to signal a time-out during heated conversations. By understanding the underlying psychology behind these conflicts, couples can take steps to improve their communication and strengthen their relationships.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>England defeated West Indies in the second T20 match at Bristol, securing a series victory with a remarkable chase of 197 runs. Jos Buttler's 47 and Harry Brook's 34 provided a solid foundation, while Jacob Bethell's explosive cameo of 26 runs and Tom Banton's unbeaten 30 sealed the win. West Indies had earlier posted 196, recovering from a slow start to score 75 runs in the final four overs. Adil Rashid's expensive spell contributed to England's struggles, but the team's batting performance ultimately proved decisive in securing the series win. The team's performance in this game showed both strengths and areas for improvement.</p>

          <p>Peru's government has reversed a decision to reduce the protected area around the Nazca Lines, following criticism that the change would expose the ancient site to the risks of informal mining. The government had initially cut back the protected zone from 5,600 to 3,200 square kilometers, but has now reinstated the original boundaries. A technical panel will be formed to develop a future proposal for zoning and land use in the area, ensuring the preservation of the UNESCO World Heritage site. The Nazca region contains hundreds of pre-Hispanic artifacts and is renowned for its giant desert etchings of animals, plants, and geometric figures, making its preservation a priority.</p>

          <p>Marc-Andre ter Stegen's performance was a positive highlight for Germany despite their 2-0 loss to France in the Nations League third-placed playoff. Ter Stegen made several excellent saves, preventing France from increasing their lead. However, his club situation at Barcelona is uncertain, as he has struggled to secure playing time since returning from injury. Reports suggest he may become the third-choice goalkeeper, potentially affecting his rhythm and preparation for the World Cup. Despite his lack of club games, Germany coach Nagelsmann is likely to give Ter Stegen time, given his experience and recent form.</p>
