          <p>President Trump expressed his intention for the government to continue making deals like the recent acquisition of a 10% stake in Intel, asserting it will boost the U.S. economy with more jobs and wealth. White House economic advisor Kevin Hassett indicated this is part of a broader strategy to establish a sovereign wealth fund, a mechanism primarily used by countries with vast natural resources as funding backstops for transactions. The administration frames this increased federal involvement in private industry as a way to support companies and encourage domestic production. Trump believes such deals will ultimately make the USA "RICHER, AND RICHER."</p>

The PSL, introduced in 2003, remains the coffee giant's most successful seasonal beverage, having sold hundreds of millions since its debut. This menu refresh, which includes new offerings like Salted Pecan Cream Cold Foam, aims to boost sales and in-store traffic, which have seen recent declines in the U.S. CEO Brian Niccol anticipates the PSL's return will attract a significant number of customers, helping to revitalize the company's performance and address recent sales challenges.</p>

          <p>Donna Morris, Walmart's chief people officer, emphasizes reliability as the most crucial trait she seeks in employees, calling it a "total green flag." She values individuals who consistently deliver on expectations, ideally ahead of schedule, demonstrating integrity and trustworthiness in their work. While encouraging employees to be open to new opportunities and "put their hand up" to take on more, Morris cautions against over-promising, as it can lead to burnout and erode trust if commitments are not met. The article suggests strategies for effective work, such as acting as one's own assistant to manage tasks and minimize distractions for increased productivity.</p>

          <p>Keurig Dr Pepper announced its acquisition of Dutch coffee and tea company JDE Peet's for approximately $18 billion, a strategic move expected to revitalize the U.S. giant's declining coffee sales. The deal, which offers a 33% premium to JDE Peet's shareholders, is projected to generate $400 million in cost synergies over three years. Following the acquisition, Keurig Dr Pepper plans to split its beverage and coffee units into two separate, U.S.-listed companies, effectively unwinding its 2018 merger. This strategic restructuring aims to enhance market appeal with thrifty at-home coffee consumers and attract new clientele. (not investment advice)</p>

The mission, which launched from Kennedy Space Center, completed its 28-hour rendezvous ahead of schedule. Among the crucial cargo is an add-on thruster kit designed to help boost the space station's altitude and counteract atmospheric drag, supplementing existing Russian re-boost operations. Astronaut Mike Fincke expressed gratitude from the ISS, highlighting the importance of the resupply for ongoing science experiments and the crew's daily sustenance.</p>

          <p>The US-China Business Council has advised that recent exit bans on two American businesspeople in China do not alter the overall travel risk for US-based executives. The trade group concluded that these specific situations appear to follow existing enforcement patterns and are not indicative of a broader "geopolitical or retaliatory" shift. While acknowledging that the high-profile incidents prompted companies to reassess their travel procedures to limit risks, the council maintains that the risk of exit bans, detentions, or other complications for most American travelers has not increased. This article suggests a nuanced view of the current travel environment.</p>

          <p>Nvidia is poised to release its fiscal second-quarter earnings, marking two years of transformative growth driven by the generative AI boom, which has seen its revenue triple and profits quadruple. The company, now valued at over $4 trillion, faces high expectations despite a projected slowdown in growth to 53%. Its data center revenue, primarily from major internet and cloud providers, accounts for 88% of sales. Key focus points include the performance of its Blackwell chip line and the impact of a recent deal with the Trump administration to regain access to the Chinese market for its H20 AI chip, with analysts expecting conservative guidance.

          <p>In a memorable moment, Shohei Ohtani high-fived a persistent heckler after hitting his 45th home run, securing an 8-2 victory for the Los Angeles Dodgers against the San Diego Padres. The heckler had been taunting Ohtani throughout the game for his hitless performance in the series, prompting the normally decorous MVP to detour for the interaction. Ohtani's unexpected gesture, described as out of character by his manager, showcased his personality and provided a satisfying end to the interaction. This crucial win also leveled the NL West race with 31 games remaining, intensifying the rivalry between the two teams.</p>

          <p>Leaders of South Korea and Japan met in Tokyo, signaling a new era of cooperation aimed at developing "stable, future-oriented" ties in areas like AI, industry, and denuclearization. This diplomatic shift, including scheduled defense minister meetings, is partly driven by the unpredictable foreign policy of U.S. President Donald Trump and closer ties between North Korea/China and Russia. Both nations seek a united front against potential U.S. protectionism and aim to strengthen their alliance, as they are no longer certain the U.S. will meet its obligations as an ally.

          <h2>The Evolution of American Exercise Culture from Post-WWII Inactivity to Modern Obsession</h2>

        </div>
        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>This article explores the historical transformation of American exercise culture, tracing its evolution from a post-WWII era where physical exertion was discouraged, particularly for women, to today's fitness obsession. Journalist Danielle Friedman highlights how figures like JFK, the women's movement, and fitness pioneers such as Bonnie Prudden and Jane Fonda challenged outdated beliefs about exercise. The 1970s, with the rise of running, aerobic dancing, yoga, and bodybuilding, marked a significant turning point, commercializing workouts and making fitness aspirational. This cultural shift reflects a uniquely American drive for self-improvement and physical prowess, moving away from past fears of over-exertion.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>The Northern Lights consortium has commenced operations at the world's first commercial carbon storage facility in the North Sea, aiming to combat climate change. The project captures liquified CO2 from European industrial smokestacks, transports it by ship, and injects it 1.6 miles deep under the seabed for permanent storage. While carbon capture and storage (CCS) is recognized by the IPCC and IEA as a climate tool, it remains complex, controversial, and costly. Critics, like Stanford professor Mark Jacobson, question its efficacy and motivations, advocating for a primary focus on transitioning to clean energy sources instead of relying on such technologies.</p>

          <p>India has shared a warning with Pakistan regarding potential cross-border flooding, a surprising act of humanitarian cooperation given their strained relationship. This information-sharing occurred despite India previously putting a decades-old water-sharing treaty in "abeyance" following heightened tensions and military clashes. Both nuclear-armed rivals are currently grappling with deadly floods caused by relentless monsoon rains, which have claimed hundreds of lives in Pakistan and dozens in India. Pakistan's foreign ministry acknowledged the warning but reiterated its call for India to adhere to the Indus Waters Treaty to ensure regional stability regarding water resources.</p>
