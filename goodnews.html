          <h2>Chinese Astronomers Claim Ancient Star Catalogue as World's Oldest</h2>
          <div class="timestamp">2025-05-05 03:32:35 EDT</div>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Two Chinese scientists assert that "Shi‚Äôs Star Catalogue," an astronomical list of celestial bodies, is the world‚Äôs oldest star log, dating back approximately 2,400 years to around 335BC. Researchers used image processing technology to convert ancient records into measurable celestial coordinates, confirming the observations' approximate age. If verified, this would predate the Hipparchus star catalogue from Greece, previously considered the oldest. Experts believe detailed astronomical studies began in both China and Greece around the same period. </p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>A new evolutionary genetic analysis by Chinese and Dutch researchers suggests that the first roses were likely yellow, despite the common association of roses with the color red. The study, published in Nature Plants, examined domesticated and wild rose samples to trace the flower's origins. The research team concluded that the common ancestor of roses most likely had single-petal flowers with yellow color and seven leaflets. Roses are known as the 'queen of flowers' and a symbol of love and beauty. </p>

          <p>Eighty years after the Battle of Berlin, which marked the end of Nazi Germany, the city still bears visible scars from the intense fighting. While central Berlin has been transformed through restoration and modern architecture, bullet-riddled facades and gaps in rows of houses serve as reminders of the past. The battle in late April and early May 1945 reduced much of the city to rubble. Despite the destruction, the city quickly rebuilt its infrastructure, eventually becoming the capital of a reunited, democratic Germany. </p>

          <p>Japan is projected to be the fourth-largest provider of official development assistance (ODA) among OECD members in 2024, with Britain reclaiming third place. The United States remains the top ODA donor, followed by Germany. Japan's decline in donations is attributed to the yen's depreciation and a contrast to sharp increases in previous years. Japan views ODA as an important diplomatic tool in the Indo-Pacific region. Overall ODA by Development Assistance Committee members fell 7.1 percent in real terms, marking the first decline after five consecutive years of growth. </p>
