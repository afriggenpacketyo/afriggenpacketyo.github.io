          <h2>Nigeria Considers Gender Bill to Enhance Political Inclusion</h2>
          <div class="timestamp">2025-05-19 10:57:00 EDT</div>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Nigerian women are advocating for reserved seats in parliament to address their systemic exclusion from the political process. The country's senate has only four women compared to 109 men, and female lawmakers occupy only 16 of the 360 seats in the House of Representatives. Gender rights advocates are supporting the 'Reserved Seat for Women bill,' which aims to reserve seats for women in federal and state legislatures. Supporters believe this legislation could lead to more inclusive governance, smarter policies, and a more stable economy, drawing comparisons to Rwanda's progress in gender equality and economic outcomes.</p>

          <div class="timestamp">2025-05-19 10:52:05 EDT</div>
        </div>
        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>As inflation eases in 2025, lenders are offering differing rates for home equity loans and home equity lines of credit (HELOCs). HELOCs typically offer lower variable rates that change with economic conditions, while home equity loans feature higher, fixed rates that remain stable throughout the term. The flexible draw periods and ongoing borrowing risk associated with HELOCs enable lower initial rates, whereas fixed rates on home equity loans command a premium due to the risk lenders assume. Both options can be beneficial for consolidating debt or funding major expenses.</p>

          <p>Britain and the European Union have reached a landmark agreement aimed at improving security cooperation and reducing trade barriers introduced after Brexit. The agreement seeks to strengthen ties between the two entities as the United States signals a reduced commitment to European security. British Prime Minister Keir Starmer aims for a "reset" of relations with the EU, almost nine years after the Brexit vote. The deal addresses politically sensitive issues such as fishing rights and includes plans for a youth program to facilitate travel and work between Britain and Europe.</p>

          <p>Portugal's governing center-right coalition won a snap election but failed to secure a majority, as the hard-right Chega party gained significant ground. While the results are unlikely to drastically alter Portugal's leadership, they solidify Chega's position as a powerful political force. The Democratic Alliance, led by Prime Minister Lu√≠s Montenegro, secured 32 percent of the vote. Chega, which means ‚Äúenough‚Äù in Portuguese, is the first hard-right party to gain ground in Portugal‚Äôs political scene since 1974, capitalizing on anti-immigration sentiment and economic resentments.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>A new "reset" deal between the UK and the EU aims to deepen ties in the UK's most important trading relationship, potentially boosting economic growth. The agreement reduces red tape and checks for foodstuffs, particularly benefiting producers and sellers between Britain and the EU. By agreeing to follow EU rules on plant and animal health, the government faces accusations of selling out on sovereignty, but it smooths the path for over 1,500 products crossing borders. While the government claims this agreement will be worth ¬£8.9bn to the UK by 2040, it would only recoup a small fraction of the GDP lost as a result of Brexit.</p>
