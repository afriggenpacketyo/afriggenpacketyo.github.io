          <p>Amid the wave of pardons and commutations President Trump has doled out to some of his supporters and surrogates, one former MAGA loyalist in Idaho is fighting to return her pardon.\n\nPamela Hemphill is one of the more than 1,500 people whom Mr. Trump pardoned earlier this year for their roles in the U.S. Capitol Insurrection. She has invoked help from her Republican senator to formally refuse and block the pardon Trump issued her on Jan. 20, his first day back in the White House.</p>

          <p>Author Salman Rushdie spent years in hiding after Iran's leader Ayatollah Khomeini called for his assassination in 1989, declaring Rushdie's novel, "The Satanic Verses," blasphemous and an insult to Islam. After 10 years Rushdie came out of hiding and moved to the United States, where he felt safe. Then, on Aug. 12, 2022, at a literary festival in Chautauqua, New York, he was attacked by a knife-wielding assailant. Rushdie was stabbed 15 times and nearly died. He lost his right eye in the attack. He has come to terms with the attempt on his life the only way he knows: by writing about it in his latest book. "Knife," which was published in April 2024.</p>
