          <p>A team of researchers from China has developed a new form of blockchain technology specifically designed to withstand attacks from future quantum computers. Standard blockchain systems, which underpin cryptocurrencies and other secure digital ledgers, rely on encryption methods that could be vulnerable to the immense processing power of quantum computing. The new solution, created by a team from the Beijing Institute of Technology and Guilin University of Electronic Technology, aims to solve this emerging security problem. This development addresses growing concerns that even the most advanced current security protocols could be compromised by next-generation computing threats, ensuring the long-term viability of blockchain applications.</p>

          <p>A skydiving plane carrying 15 people crashed shortly after takeoff from Cross Keys Airport in Williamstown, New Jersey, with all individuals on board surviving the incident. The pilot of the Cessna 208B reported engine trouble and was attempting to return to the airport when the aircraft went down in a wooded area. Emergency responders, who recently conducted a mass casualty drill at the same airport, were praised for their swift response. While several injuries were reported as severe or critical, officials expressed amazement that there were no fatalities. The same aircraft was involved in a previous incident in 2023 where its nose landing gear collapsed during landing.</p>

The kickoff event in Des Moines will feature musical performances and a fireworks display. This initiative begins as Congress debates a divisive tax and spending package central to Trump's agenda.

          <p>Following Clayton Kershaw's historic 3,000th career strikeout, this opinion article argues that he has cemented his status as the greatest pitcher in the history of the Los Angeles Dodgers, surpassing even the legendary Sandy Koufax. The author contends that while Koufax had an unparalleled five-year peak, Kershaw's greatness is defined by his remarkable longevity and endurance over 18 seasons. The piece highlights that Kershaw has surpassed Koufax in nearly every significant career pitching statistic, including wins and strikeouts. While acknowledging Kershaw's postseason struggles, the author emphasizes that his sustained excellence and leadership have been the cornerstone of the Dodgers' modern era of success.</p>

The article celebrates how different dialects, particularly from Latin America, enrich the language with new words and nuances, making it more expressive. While acknowledging that linguistic snobbery exists, the author argues that the collective, cross-continental use of Spanish is what keeps it alive and thriving, viewing its many variations not as obstacles but as a testament to its resilience and beauty.</p>

During a visit to Beijing, Armenian Foreign Minister Ararat Mirzoyan stated that both nations are ready to elevate their bilateral ties to a strategic partnership. This diplomatic pivot follows Armenia's frustration with Russia's failure to intervene in the 2020 Nagorno-Karabakh war against Azerbaijan. As a result, Armenia announced its withdrawal from the Moscow-led Collective Security Treaty Organisation. The move to strengthen ties with China represents a significant strategic shift for the South Caucasus nation as it seeks new international alliances.</p>

          <p>With the Republican majority in the U.S. House of Representatives being exceptionally narrow, the possibility of a tie vote on legislation has become more relevant. This article explains the simple but crucial rule governing such a scenario: if a vote on any question results in a tie, the measure automatically fails. Unlike the Senate, where the Vice President can cast a tie-breaking vote, the House has no such mechanism. This rule was recently highlighted during a failed vote to impeach Homeland Security Secretary Alejandro Mayorkas. The current political dynamics mean that even a few defections can lead to a legislative stalemate, making every vote critical for the majority party.</p>

          <h2>Hong Kong's IPO Market Experiences a Major Resurgence in First Half of Year</h2>
          <div class="timestamp">2025-07-02 21:57:20 EDT</div>

          <p>Hong Kong's market for initial public offerings has seen a dramatic resurgence, with new listing volumes soaring to $14 billion in the first half of the year, a significant increase from $1.8 billion in the same period of 2024. This boom is fueled by a wave of Chinese companies seeking to raise capital in the city, driven by regulatory support from Beijing, a slower pace of listings on the mainland, and concerns over potential delisting from U.S. exchanges. Major deals, like battery maker CATL's $5 billion secondary listing, have positioned Hong Kong to potentially become the world's top listing destination this year, marking a strong recovery from several years of lackluster activity.

          <p>A federal judge in Washington, D.C., has blocked a Trump administration policy that severely restricts the ability of migrants who cross the southern border to seek asylum. In his ruling, U.S. District Judge Randolph Moss stated that the president had exceeded his legal authority and could not unilaterally create an "alternative immigration system." The policy was based on a January executive order in which President Trump declared the situation at the border an "invasion." The judge's decision certifies a class of all people affected by the order and has been stayed for 14 days to allow the administration time to appeal.</p>

          <h2>Study Links Estrogen-Progestin Hormone Therapy to Increased Breast Cancer Risk</h2>
          <div class="timestamp">2025-07-02 20:59:26 EDT</div>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>A new study published in The Lancet Oncology has found that a specific type of hormone therapy for menopause symptoms is associated with an increased risk of breast cancer. The research indicates that for women under 55 with a uterus, combination therapy using estrogen plus progestin (a synthetic hormone) increases the risk. Conversely, for women who have had a hysterectomy and can take estrogen alone, the therapy was found to reduce the risk of breast cancer. This research refines the understanding of hormone replacement therapy, highlighting that the type of treatment and a woman's individual health profile are crucial factors in determining its safety and effectiveness.</p>
