          <p>Former Labour leader Jeremy Corbyn, along with MP Zarah Sultana, is establishing a new left-wing political party but has yet to decide on a name, opting instead to involve supporters in the process. The currently unnamed party has reportedly attracted over 600,000 registered supporters, who are being asked to help define its platform and identity. Before it can field candidates, the party must register an official name with the Electoral Commission, which has strict rules to prevent confusion with existing parties. This unconventional approach aims to build a grassroots movement from the ground up, emphasizing supporter engagement.</p>

          <p>The Los Angeles Lakers have solidified Luka Doncic's position as the franchise's new centerpiece with a three-year, $165 million contract extension, a move that signals a clear shift in the team's future. This commitment, however, intensifies questions surrounding the role of LeBron James, who is under contract for only one more season. The article analyzes the new dynamic, noting that general manager Rob Pelinka has pledged full support to Doncic's camp, a gesture aimed at building a strong relationship. With James' future uncertain, the Lakers are navigating a delicate transition from one superstar era to the next.</p>

          <p>Comedian Harry Hill has shared that the early death of his stepfather was the catalyst for his decision to leave a career in medicine and pursue comedy. Hill, who qualified as a doctor in 1988, felt unsuited for the profession and recalled feeling emotionally overwhelmed when delivering bad news to patients. His stepfather's death at age 54 made him realize he did not want to spend his life in a job he was not passionate about. The move ultimately led to a successful entertainment career, including the popular show 'Harry Hill's TV Burp'.</p>

          <p>Meta Platforms, a key advocate for open-source AI with its Llama models, has signaled a more cautious approach to its strategy, a shift that contrasts with China's accelerated development in the open-source sphere. Computer scientist Andrew Ng suggests that China's competitive, "Darwinian" ecosystem is allowing it to rapidly advance its foundational models, potentially surpassing the U.S. in this domain. This comes as Chinese tech giants like Alibaba and Zhipu AI release powerful new open-source models, indicating a vibrant and fast-moving landscape that is challenging established leaders in the field.</p>

          <p>A recent mountain cleanup day at Breckenridge Ski Resort in Colorado resulted in the collection of 780 pounds of trash and lost items, revealing some unusual finds. The effort, involving 150 employees, turned up items likely dropped from ski lifts, including an iPod Nano, a Canadian coin, and an inexplicable hamburger flipper. The most peculiar discovery was a message in a bottle that contained an old COVID-19 vaccination card. The resort noted that while many items were trash, larger pieces were recycled, and in rare cases, valuables like an engagement ring have been reunited with their owners.</p>

          <h2>Historical Mystery of Winston Churchill's Gift Platypus Solved</h2>

        </div>
        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Researchers have likely solved the 80-year-old mystery of how a platypus named Winston, a diplomatic gift to Winston Churchill from Australia during World War II, died during its voyage to England. While wartime myth blamed the animal's death on shock from a nearby Nazi submarine attack, newly analyzed records suggest a more mundane cause. Archival logs of water and air temperatures on the ship indicate that the platypus was exposed to prolonged heat as it crossed the equator. This, combined with potentially reduced food rations, would have been enough to kill the sensitive creature, debunking the more dramatic wartime tale.</p>

          <p>China is increasingly relying on the development of theme parks and attractions to fuel its economy and boost consumer spending.
