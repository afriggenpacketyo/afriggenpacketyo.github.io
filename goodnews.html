          <p>DeFi Development, a company focused on accumulating Solana, is launching a global franchise model named the DFDV Treasury Accelerator. This initiative allows international partners to operate their own Solana treasuries with support from DeFi Development, which in turn receives an equity stake. The strategy, backed by investors like Pantera Capital, evolves the MicroStrategy playbook by combining validator infrastructure and capital markets innovation. The company aims to reach one SOL token per share by 2028, reflecting a growing trend of firms adopting crypto treasury strategies. (not investment advice)</p>

          <h2>Fact Check Finds No Scientific Evidence That Sunscreen Increases Skin Cancer Risk</h2>
          <div class="timestamp">2025-07-17 07:26:00 EDT</div>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>A fact-check by DW has determined that claims circulating on social media that sunscreen increases the risk of skin cancer are false. Health officials and scientific studies confirm there is no evidence to support this association. The rising incidence of skin cancer globally is attributed to factors like better diagnostics, increased sun exposure, and the historical use of less effective sunscreens, not the use of modern protective products. While countries like Australia and the U.S. have high skin cancer rates and sunscreen sales, experts state there is no valid data directly linking sunscreen use to a higher prevalence of the disease.</p>

          <p>Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskiy has named Olha Stefanishyna, the deputy prime minister for Euro-Atlantic integration, as the new ambassador to the United States. This move is seen as an effort to repair relations with Washington following public clashes between Zelenskiy and U.S. President Donald Trump. Stefanishyna has been a key figure in Ukraine's EU accession process since 2020. She will replace the current ambassador, Oksana Markarova, who faced criticism from the Trump administration during the 2024 U.S. election for allegedly favoring the Democratic Party.</p>

          <p>An article explores the growing issue of smartphone addiction, which studies link to negative mental health symptoms like depression and anxiety. It highlights that while apps are designed to be engaging, addiction is often a tool to escape stress, creating a cycle of cause and effect with mental health challenges. Scientists recommend a multi-faceted approach to combat this, including creating physical distance from the phone, reducing notifications, and using self-control apps. Therapies like CBT and mindfulness, along with replacing screen time with exercise or nature, are also proven effective in addressing the root causes of the addiction.</p>

          <p>Russian customs and security services have seized 1,800 pounds of cocaine, valued at over $153 million, in what they call their largest bust of Latin American drugs this year. The narcotics were discovered hidden in a shipment of bananas, with the packages disguised in briquettes labeled with a luxury fashion brand's logo. The operation was conducted based on a tip from foreign counterparts about a South American criminal group's smuggling channel. This seizure is part of a growing trend where traffickers use Russia as a transit hub and conceal cocaine within banana shipments globally.</p>

          <p>Russ Miller, nicknamed the "River Cowboy," has dedicated decades to removing thousands of discarded tires from Kentucky's Red River Gorge. After observing the waterway becoming a "conveyor belt of trash," he founded the grassroots group Friends of Red River in 1996 to organize cleanups. The state generates an estimated one million unaccounted-for waste tires annually, many of which are illegally dumped in rivers due to a lack of convenient disposal options. Miller's persistent efforts have inspired a community of volunteers and raised awareness, leading to recent state-level legislative action to address the pervasive pollution problem.</p>

          <p>An article from Vox analyzes the resurgence of foldable smartphones, like Samsung's Galaxy Z Fold and Flip series, as a meaningful evolution in a stagnant hardware market. While early models were flawed, the latest iterations are becoming appealing alternatives to the standard smartphone slab. These devices offer adaptability, with smaller outer screens for quick tasks and larger inner screens for immersive use, evoking nostalgia for the more compact flip phones of the past. This innovation suggests the smartphone will remain a central gadget for the foreseeable future, bridging the gap before potential replacements like AR glasses become mainstream.</p>
