          <p>In its 60th year, the World Conker Championships in Northamptonshire have crowned a new winner, first-time competitor Matt Cross. The event saw heightened interest following a cheating scandal last year, which led to the previous champion being cleared but ultimately knocked out in the first round of this year's contest. The competition overcame fears of a cancellation due to a shortage of quality conkers, with donations coming from as far as the royal estate at Windsor Castle.</p>

          <p>The Denver Broncos defeated the winless New York Jets 13-11 in a defensively dominated game in London. Despite their offense struggling, the Broncos' defense was formidable, sacking Jets quarterback Justin Fields nine times to secure the victory. The Jets' offense was historically ineffective, finishing with just 82 total net yards and an abysmal minus-10 passing yards. A late field goal by Wil Lutz provided the winning margin for Denver.</p>

          <p>UK Prime Minister Keir Starmer is set to attend an international peace summit in Sharm El-Sheikh, Egypt, to mark the signing of the Gaza peace plan. Downing Street stated that Starmer will pay tribute to U.S. President Donald Trump for his role in brokering the deal between Israel and Hamas. The UK's involvement has been questioned by officials from the US and Israel, who suggested Britain's role was minimal, a claim disputed by the UK education secretary.</p>

          <p>The first phase of the Donald Trump-brokered peace plan for Gaza involves a reciprocal exchange of Israeli hostages and Palestinian prisoners, set to occur on Monday. This follows a ceasefire that began Friday and an increase in humanitarian aid entering the territory, with Israeli forces partially withdrawing to an agreed-upon line. Subsequent phases of the 20-point plan, which are yet to be negotiated, aim to demilitarize Gaza and establish a new governance structure, though significant disagreements remain.</p>
