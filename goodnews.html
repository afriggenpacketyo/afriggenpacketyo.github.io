        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Chinese scientists have developed a low-cost, edible, and washable protein-based coating that extends the shelf life of various fruits by 2.5 times by reducing moisture loss and microbial growth. Tested on 17 fruit varieties, the coating effectively delays rot for almost a week or more, costing only 9 US cents per kilogram. This eco-friendly strategy matches existing preservation methods while reducing carbon dioxide emissions and toxicity risks, offering a promising solution to global food waste, considering that around a third of all food produced globally is wasted, most of it perishable items like fruits and vegetables. The coating is universally applicable for both post-harvest and fresh-cut fruits due to its edible properties and ease of washability. </p>

          <p>Rice prices in Japan have more than doubled in May, marking the largest increase in over half a century, following similar spikes in previous months. The Japanese government has released emergency stockpiles to moderate the price of this staple food. Japan's core inflation rate climbed to 3.7% in May, its highest level since January 2023, driven significantly by rising rice prices, which account for approximately 50% of core inflation. Measures to reduce rice prices could boost household spending if reductions extend to processed foods and lower restaurant prices. (not investment advice)</p>

Attendance has averaged just 36,433 through 20 matches, with nearly half the seats empty, even after FIFA slashed ticket prices. Managers have noted the strange atmosphere and the impact of the hot, sticky summer weather on both play and attendance. Some suggest this tournament is providing good preparation for national team players ahead of the real World Cup's return to North America next year, exposing them to the weather, travel, and atmosphere they can expect then.</p>

He intends for none of his children to have access to their inheritance for 30 years, wishing for them to live like normal people and build themselves up alone.

          <p>As the 50th anniversary of "Jaws" is marked, recent shark attacks are grabbing headlines, but experts say the rise in sightings is due to more people in the water and better technology, not an increase in shark populations. Florida beaches have logged the highest number of shark attacks, with 942 unprovoked bites since 1837. Shark Angels founder Julie Andersen emphasizes the importance of shark conservation, aiming to transform fear into fascination and dispel myths. One endurance athlete is swimming around Martha‚Äôs Vineyard to raise awareness of the need to protect sharks and change public perception.</p>

After a five-year suspension due to Covid controls and cross-border tensions, China is allowing pilgrims to return to the Tibet autonomous region this summer to follow two pilgrimage routes. The sites are sacred to followers of Hinduism, Buddhism, Jainism and Bon, and the pilgrimages are usually organized by the Indian government. According to Yang Yabo, pilgrimages by Indian devotees to Tibet have played a positive role in restoring stability in China-India relations during times of crisis.</p>

Trade-war fears have receded after U.S. and Chinese trade representatives agreed to honor the consensus reached in Geneva, allowing for rare earth and tech trade between the two countries while suspending prohibitive tariffs.

          <p>Former President Joe Biden criticized "ongoing efforts to erase history" during a Juneteenth Celebration Service at a historic African Methodist Episcopal Church in Galveston, Texas. He took part in the service at the Reedy Chapel AME Church, one of the locations where an order announcing the end of slavery in Texas was read in 1865. Biden also chided what he referred to as "ongoing efforts to erase history from our textbooks and our classrooms," seemingly referencing President Trump's actions.</p>

          <p>The Border Patrol's San Diego Sector uncovered an uncompleted narcotics smuggling tunnel extending from a Tijuana residence into a commercial warehouse in Otay Mesa. The tunnel, roughly half-mile-long, was equipped with electrical wiring, lighting, ventilation systems, and a track system. U.S. and Mexican authorities believe the passage was dug to transport large-scale contraband, and contractors are expected to pour thousands of gallons of concrete into the tunnel to prevent its future usage.</p>

          <p>A federal judge ruled that the Trump Administration cannot withhold transportation grant funding from Democrat-led states refusing to cooperate with immigration enforcement. Chief U.S. District Judge John McConnell granted a preliminary injunction, stating that "large-scale irreparable harm would occur without the preliminary injunction." The ruling comes ahead of a grant application deadline, and the judge found no plausible connection between cooperating with ICE enforcement and the purposes of the Department of Transportation.</p>

          <p>At a high-level summit, China and its Central Asian partners voiced shared security concerns and showed a united front amid a turbulent global landscape, raising questions about Russia's regional dominance. Kremlin spokesman Dmitry Peskov dismissed such fears, saying there was "no reason for such fears." Peskov added that China is Russia's privileged strategic partner, and the Central Asian countries are Russia's natural historical partners, despite China's growing influence in the region.</p>

          <p>Meta is expanding its AI talent pool by hiring Daniel Gross, the CEO of Safe Superintelligence, and former GitHub CEO Nat Friedman. Earlier this year, Meta attempted to acquire Safe Superintelligence, valued at $32 billion, but was rebuffed by Ilya Sutskever. Gross and Friedman will work on products under Alexandr Wang, and Meta will gain a stake in NFDG, a venture capital firm run by Gross and Friedman. Zuckerberg's aggressive hiring tactics highlight the escalating AI talent war, with companies racing to develop powerful large language models.</p>
