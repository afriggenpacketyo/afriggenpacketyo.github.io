          <p>President Trump has signed an order confirming parts of a trade deal between the UK and US, reducing tariffs on UK cars shipped to the US. The agreement, reached last month, allows up to 100,000 cars into the US at a 10% tariff, instead of the 25% import tax imposed earlier this year. The order also includes a similar system for steel and aluminium, though specific details are yet to be announced, and removes tariffs on certain aerospace products. The UK government has stated it will continue to pursue 0% tariffs on core steel products as agreed, while granting a tariff-free quota of 1.4 billion litres of US ethanol. </p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>The US Supreme Court has rejected an appeal to revive the copyright trial over Ed Sheeran's hit song "Thinking Out Loud," ending a decade-long legal battle. Structured Asset Sales (SAS) claimed Sheeran's song copied Marvin Gaye's "Let's Get It On," but the court sided with earlier rulings in Sheeran's favor. Amy Wadge, who co-wrote "Thinking Out Loud" with Sheeran, expressed immense relief, stating that the copyright trials had been haunting her for the past 10 years. The court agreed that the chord progression and harmonic rhythms in Gaye's song are too commonplace to be legally protected. </p>

          <p>President Trump's actions and strategy of "masterful ambiguity" in the third round of the Iran-Israel conflict have dominated international and national events. Analysts in Israel believe Trump gave Prime Minister Netanyahu a green light to strike Iran after Iran failed to negotiate the dismantling of its nuclear weapons program. Trump has maintained a deliberate ambiguity about his role, offering to mediate peace while warning enemies against harming Americans. The article suggests that Trump's approach has allowed Israel to degrade Iran's nuclear and ballistic missile programs, and that Trump is using the situation to message various political objectives. </p>

          <p>With air travel becoming increasingly unreliable, travel experts are offering advice on how to manage flight delays and cancellations effectively. Recommendations include rebooking flights online or through airline apps while in line at the customer service desk, calling customer service hotlines in other languages, and seeking assistance at airport lounges. Passengers are also advised to know their entitlements from the airline and travel insurance, book early-morning flights, and explore alternative transportation options. Booking direct with airlines and being courteous to customer service representatives can also improve the chances of receiving refunds or flight credits. </p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Al-Hilal's chief executive stated that a loan move for Cristiano Ronaldo before the Club World Cup would have been "completely counter-intuitive" due to his affiliation with their rival club, Al-Nassr. Although both clubs are controlled by the country's Public Investment Fund (PIF), and Ronaldo's contract with Al-Nassr ends in June, Al-Hilal decided against the move. The executive explained that taking the biggest player from their biggest opponent, even for a short period, did not align with their strategy. They are focusing on reinforcing the team in the traditional transfer window after the tournament. </p>

The sustainability of this rebound depends on predictable policies, macro stimulus, and stable US-China relations. (not investment advice)</p>
