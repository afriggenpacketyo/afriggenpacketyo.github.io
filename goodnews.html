          <p>American tennis player Taylor Fritz has secured a spot in the Wimbledon semi-finals for the first time in his career after a victory over Karen Khachanov. Fritz appeared to be in control after winning the first two sets, but he experienced a sudden collapse in the third, which he lost 6-1. Following a medical timeout to address taping on his foot, he managed to regain his form and close out the match, successfully avoiding a decisive fifth set.</p>

          <p>One year after his Conservative Party's significant election loss, former U.K. Prime Minister Rishi Sunak is set to return to the investment bank Goldman Sachs as a senior adviser. Sunak had previously worked at the firm as an analyst in the early 2000s before his political career. To mitigate risks of unfair influence, a governmental appointments watchdog has imposed restrictions on his role for a year, limiting his advisory scope to matters not conflicting with his time as Prime Minister.</p>

          <p>The Transportation Security Administration (TSA) is set to end its long-standing policy that requires passengers to remove their shoes during airport security checks. The new rule will be rolled out at many major U.S. airports, aiming to expedite the screening process for travelers in general security lines. This marks a major policy shift nearly two decades after the rule was implemented in response to the 2006 Richard Reid 'shoe bomber' attempt.</p>
