          <p>Shares of PepsiCo increased after activist investment firm Elliott Management announced it has acquired a $4 billion stake in the consumer goods company. In a letter to PepsiCo's board, Elliott outlined an agenda to restore business momentum and unlock shareholder value, calling the company's recent underperformance a "historic opportunity" for a turnaround. The firm, known for driving changes at major corporations, stated its goals are to help PepsiCo sharpen its focus, boost innovation, and improve efficiency. PepsiCo has acknowledged Elliott's investment and stated it will review the firm's perspectives while continuing its own strategy for sustainable growth. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>Bitcoin's price increased on Tuesday, moving contrary to a broader stock market sell-off, though it did not match the performance of gold, which surged to a new record high. The cryptocurrency reclaimed the $111,000 level while stocks fell amid concerns over a court ruling against U.S. tariffs and the potential fiscal impact. Market analysts suggest that while Bitcoin benefits from some of the same safe-haven drivers as gold, its recent performance has been tempered by a significant rotation of investment into other cryptocurrencies like Ethereum. The market is now watching for the Federal Reserve's next interest rate decision, which could influence Bitcoin's future movements. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>A federal judge has barred the Trump administration from using National Guard and other military troops for domestic law enforcement actions in California, such as making arrests or conducting searches. The ruling stems from a lawsuit filed by the state challenging the deployment of troops to Los Angeles to handle protests related to immigration policies. Judge Charles Breyer determined that the action willfully violated the Posse Comitatus Act, which prohibits the use of U.S. military forces for civilian law enforcement. The injunction is currently limited to California, and the judge has stayed the decision to allow time for a federal appeal.</p>

          <p>Authorities have arrested a 66-year-old man, Saul Gonzalez, for the 2005 murder of Valerie Laguna, a 26-year-old woman who was nine months pregnant when she was killed. Laguna's body was discovered in a cemetery in Cotulla, Texas, with the cause of death determined to be blunt force trauma to the head. The case remained unsolved for two decades until advanced forensic investigation techniques linked Gonzalez to the crime. He has been indicted by a grand jury on a capital murder charge and is being held on a $1 million bond, bringing a significant development to a case that the local community has long remembered.</p>

          <p>Despite a recent slowdown in automotive shipments from China to Russia, analysts suggest there is significant potential for the two nations to expand their trade relationship, particularly in transactions settled in their local currencies. During Russian President Vladimir Putin's visit to Beijing, the two countries signed over 20 bilateral agreements covering energy, aerospace, and agriculture. This push for deeper economic ties comes as both nations face increasing trade pressure and tariffs from the United States. Russia seeks Chinese consumer goods and machinery that are now difficult to import from the West due to sanctions, creating new market opportunities for China.</p>

          <p>Long-serving Democratic Representative Jerry Nadler of New York has announced that he will retire and not seek re-election in 2026, after 34 years in Congress. The 78-year-old lawmaker stated that his decision was influenced by the need for a generational change within the Democratic party, citing the difficult end to Joe Biden's presidential bid as a key factor. Nadler, a former chair of the House Judiciary Committee who played a central role in both of Donald Trump's impeachments, suggested other aging Democrats should also consider stepping aside. His retirement opens up a competitive primary for his safe Democratic seat covering parts of Manhattan.</p>

          <p>The Utah Supreme Court has halted the scheduled execution of death row inmate Ralph Leroy Menzies, ruling that a lower court must reevaluate his mental competency. Menzies, 67, was sentenced to death for a 1986 murder and had chosen to be executed by firing squad. His lawyers argued that he has developed severe dementia during his 37 years on death row and can no longer understand why he is facing execution. Citing a U.S. Supreme Court precedent that protects individuals who cannot comprehend their punishment, the state's high court determined there was a significant question about his fitness to be executed.</p>

          <p>Zack Polanski has been elected as the new leader of the Green Party in the United Kingdom, defeating two of the party's sitting Members of Parliament. Running on a platform of bold communication and "eco-populism," Polanski aims to shift the party further to the left and adopt a more confrontational style. The 42-year-old London Assembly member has had an unconventional path to politics, with previous careers as an actor and hypnotherapist. His victory signals a potential change in direction for the party, as he advocates for collaborating with other left-wing movements to challenge the Labour government more directly.</p>

          <p>In an innovative experiment, biologists are using drones equipped with loudspeakers to scare gray wolves away from cattle herds along the California-Oregon border. The drones blast a variety of sounds, including clips from the movie "Marriage Story" and heavy metal music like AC/DC's "Thunderstruck," to haze the predators. This nonlethal method is part of an ongoing effort to find new ways to manage the growing wolf population and reduce conflicts with ranchers. Researchers from the USDA developed the technique, which has shown initial success in interrupting wolf hunts by exploiting the animals' fear of novel and loud noises.</p>

          <p>McDonald's is bringing back its "Extra Value Meals" in an effort to win back customers who have pulled back on spending due to persistent inflation. The fast-food chain announced that starting September 8, it will offer discounted meal bundles, including a $5 sausage and egg McMuffin meal and an $8 Big Mac meal. The move comes after the company reported a significant drop in traffic among low-income consumers and experienced sluggish breakfast sales. By re-emphasizing value, McDonald's aims to address the financial pressures facing its customer base and boost sales in a more uncertain economic environment.</p>
