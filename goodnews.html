        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>A significant heat wave is expected to bring record-high temperatures to the eastern United States, with the National Weather Service issuing extreme heat alerts for over 150 million Americans. The heat wave, impacting from the Midwest to the East Coast, is expected to last through at least Wednesday, posing a risk to those without adequate cooling or hydration. Meteorologists attribute the heat wave to a heat dome trapping heat and humidity, with forecasts calling for heat indexes well into the 90s or even triple digits. Health officials advise staying indoors with air conditioning, avoiding strenuous outdoor activities, and staying hydrated to prevent heat-related illnesses.</p>

          <p>The average price of rice in Japan fell below 4,000 yen ($27) per 5 kilograms for the first time in around three and a half months, reaching 3,920 yen, according to the government. The drop is attributed to increased distribution of stockpiles, with the farm minister stating that the government's message is proving effective. The market share of blended rice, including reserve rice, rose 6 percentage points to 50 percent. The government has also implemented measures prohibiting the reselling of rice at higher prices to ensure stable consumer access.</p>

          <p>Major U.S. health insurers have voluntarily agreed to speed up and reduce prior authorizations, a process that often causes delays and burdens for patients and providers. Plans under insurers like CVS Health, UnitedHealthcare, Cigna, Humana, Elevance Health, and Blue Cross Blue Shield committed to actions aimed at connecting patients to care more quickly and reducing administrative burden. The changes will be implemented across markets, including commercial coverage and certain Medicare and Medicaid plans, benefiting an estimated 257 million Americans. Insurers say the process ensures patients receive medically necessary care and allows them to control costs.</p>

          <p>Zohran Mamdani, a democratic socialist state politician, has gained significant support in the New York City mayoral race, challenging frontrunner Andrew Cuomo. Mamdani's campaign has been boosted by his social media presence and endorsements from Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez and Bernie Sanders. He proposes bold ideas, including freezing rent increases, building new affordable housing, and eliminating fares on city buses, funded by increased corporate taxes. His opponents have criticized his limited political record, while Mamdani has tied Cuomo to Donald Trump and accused him of Islamophobia.</p>

While the Trump administration remains in the early stages of formulating its China policy, Beijing should advance a leader-driven process to stabilise bilateral ties, laying the groundwork for a trade agreement ahead of a potential summit.</p>

          <p>The article explores the question of whether moderate drinking is safe, addressing conflicting research on alcohol consumption. While heavy drinking is widely agreed to be harmful, the safety of small amounts of alcohol remains debated. Public health experts emphasize that understanding what constitutes moderate drinking is crucial, as many people underestimate their alcohol intake. Although some studies suggest potential cardiovascular benefits from very modest alcohol consumption, doctors advise against starting to drink for health reasons.</p>
