        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Google faces a setback as an advisor to the European Union's top court recommended dismissing its appeal against a record 4.1 billion euro antitrust fine. The advocate general at the European Court of Justice advised the court to uphold the fine, which had already been reduced from 4.34 billion euros. The EU's General Court had previously determined that Google had abused its dominance in the Android mobile operating system market. This opinion strengthens the likelihood that Google will have to pay the substantial fine.</p>

          <p>The Chinese embassy in Israel announced plans to evacuate its citizens via the Egyptian border starting Friday, following the safe evacuation of 1,600 nationals from Iran and several hundred from Israel. This decision comes after a phone conversation between Chinese Foreign Minister Wang Yi and his Egyptian counterpart. The evacuation is a response to the escalating conflict between Israel and Iran, which has entered its seventh day with missiles impacting both strategic and residential areas. Chinese citizens holding valid passports or travel documents are eligible for evacuation via bus through the Taba border crossing.</p>

          <p>Japanese Prime Minister Shigeru Ishiba has ruled out dissolving the House of Representatives for the time being, ensuring elections for both parliamentary chambers will not coincide in July. This decision follows Yoshihiko Noda's, head of Japan's main opposition party, refusal to submit a no-confidence motion against Ishiba's Cabinet to avoid stalling progress on key political issues. Ishiba's government is currently grappling with differences with the United States over tariffs imposed by President Donald Trump, while also facing rising tensions in the Middle East. Ishiba pledged to implement measures to alleviate potential gasoline price hikes, such as additional subsidies, to ease the strain on households.</p>

          <p>Pasadena's Rose Bowl will replace its traditional Fourth of July fireworks show with a drone show this year, marking a significant shift. The change comes amid growing concerns about air pollution caused by fireworks, as the South Coast Air Quality Management District has noted a spike in fine particle pollution levels on July 4 and 5. The Rose Bowl will host FoodieLand instead of a soccer match, and officials are urging people not to gather outside the venue without a ticket.

          <p>Mitigation efforts to reduce dust emissions from the dry bed of Owens Lake have been successful, according to a new report. The L.A. Department of Water and Power's dust control measures have reduced emissions to a point where other dust sources in the area now cause most of the poor air quality days. Research indicates that significant dust sources include land where floods have left deposits, the Keeler Dunes, and areas disturbed by road infrastructure. Scientists say bringing the area into attainment with air quality standards will require additional efforts to control these off-lake dust sources.</p>
