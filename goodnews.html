The budget includes cuts to healthcare for undocumented immigrants and reinstates asset limit tests for Medi-Cal enrollees, while preserving funding for Homeless Housing, Assistance and Prevention grants. The agreement also requires legislators to pass a bill lessening the number of building projects requiring a full environmental review under CEQA.

          <p>Two young bears escaped from their enclosure at a U.K. wildlife park and devoured a week's worth of food store honey before falling asleep. The bears, Mish and Lucy, posed no threat to the public, and visitors were escorted to a secure building as a precaution. The bears were returned to their enclosure by keepers and promptly fell asleep. The park said an "operational error" allowed the bears to escape and is conducting a full internal investigation. The optimism score reflects the harmless nature of the incident and the quick resolution.</p>

          <h2>UK Climate Advisers Say Heat Pumps and EVs Making Progress</h2>

          <p>The UK's climate advisers say that more people are buying electric cars and installing heat pumps than ever before, but those numbers need to increase even further. The independent Climate Change Committee said that the government needed to make sure that households benefit from the switch to cleaner technologies through lower bills. Greenhouse gas emissions within the UK's borders have already fallen by more than half since 1990. The optimism score reflects the progress in transitioning to cleaner energy but also the challenges that remain.</p>
