          <p>A federal judge has issued a preliminary injunction, blocking the Trump administration from implementing mass layoffs and reorganizing major federal agencies. The judge stated that while presidents can set policy priorities, Congress is responsible for creating and funding federal agencies and defining their duties. The court order prevents further reductions in force and reorganization of the executive branch while the lawsuit proceeds. This decision underscores the separation of powers between the executive and legislative branches regarding the structure and function of federal agencies.</p>

        </div>
        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Home equity lines of credit (HELOCs) can be a useful tool this summer, but only with careful consideration. Experts recommend using HELOCs to take advantage of potentially falling interest rates, consolidate credit card debt, or fund home improvements. Conversely, they advise against using them for non-essential expenses like vacations or building a pool, as these uses carry significant financial risk. HELOCs use your home as collateral, so it's crucial to have a solid repayment plan and understand the potential consequences of default. (not investment advice)</p>

        </div>
        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Despite comparisons to right-wing populist leaders globally, President Trump's foreign policy decisions suggest a focus on transactional deals rather than ideological alignment. Examples include direct negotiations with entities like Hamas, the Houthis, and Iran, and criticism of Apple's move to India despite it aligning with "friendshoring" principles. Even leaders like Hungary's Viktor Orb√°n, a Trump ally, have diverged by maintaining close economic ties with China. These actions indicate that Trump's approach is driven more by securing quick wins and financial benefits than by supporting politicians who share his views on issues like migration and wokeness.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>A recent study has found that clownfish shrank during a severe ocean heat wave in Papua New Guinea in 2023. Scientists measured the length of 134 clownfish monthly and observed that most of them got shorter, potentially as an adaptation to survive hotter ocean temperatures. The fish that shrank had a higher chance of survival, suggesting that being small can be advantageous in a hot climate. This discovery adds complexity to understanding how marine life adapts to climate change.</p>

          <p>The latest Mission: Impossible film, "The Final Reckoning," marks a shift from cipher to human being for Ethan Hunt, the series' protagonist. While the film delivers the required action and globe-trotting, it also attempts to bring cohesion to Hunt's decades-long collection of missions. This self-reflexiveness, however, encumbers the film, leaving less time for the balletic set pieces that propelled the franchise to its peaks. The choice of villain, an AI system called the Entity, reiterates Hunt's importance, but the film's triumphalism about Hunt the man leaves the viewer a little cold.</p>
