          <h2>American Eagle Stock Surges Following Strong Earnings and Successful Marketing Campaigns</h2>

          <p>Shares of American Eagle Outfitters soared over 20% after the retailer reported second-quarter earnings that significantly beat Wall Street expectations and re-issued positive full-year guidance. The company credited its success to recent marketing campaigns featuring actress Sydney Sweeney and NFL player Travis Kelce, which it said drove an uptick in customer engagement and sales. Despite some controversy surrounding the slogans, the campaigns led to product sellouts and the acquisition of 700,000 new customers. The strong performance marks a turnaround for the retailer, which had previously struggled with merchandising missteps and economic pressures. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>Macy's stock surged after the department store chain reported second-quarter earnings that surpassed analyst expectations and raised its financial outlook for the full year. The company saw its best comparable sales growth in three years, attributing the positive trend to its strategy of renovating and investing in a core group of 125 stores. CEO Tony Spring noted that despite economic pressures like tariffs, the consumer remains resilient and continues to spend on fashion and new items. The strong performance provides a much-needed boost for the retailer, which had previously cut its guidance due to economic uncertainty. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>With the price of gold reaching a new all-time high of nearly $3,550 per ounce, investors who purchased gold bars from retailers like Costco have seen a significant increase in their investment's value. An ounce of gold bought a year ago for around $2,500 has appreciated by approximately 42%, driven by economic uncertainty, inflation concerns, and falling interest rates. However, those looking to sell should not expect to receive the full spot price, as dealers typically offer 5% to 10% less. Additionally, profits from selling physical gold are taxed as collectibles by the IRS, which can significantly reduce the net return. (not investment advice)</p>

Two passersby heard the toddler screaming and climbed through the vehicle's open sunroof to rescue the child, who was reportedly hot and sweating profusely. Police arrived and placed the child in an air-conditioned cruiser until paramedics transported them to a local hospital for evaluation. The mother told officers she had been checking on the napping child in between shopping at several stores, with the last check being 20 minutes prior to the rescue.</p>

          <h2>Newly Unearthed Dinosaur Fossil Reveals Unprecedented Spiked Body Armor</h2>

          <p>Researchers in Morocco have discovered the remains of a unique armored dinosaur, named Spicomellus, that lived over 165 million years ago. The herbivore, roughly the size of a small car, possessed an extraordinary defense system, including three-foot-long spikes on its neck and ribs fused with outward-projecting spikes, a feature never before seen in any vertebrate. This discovery challenges previous understandings of ankylosaur evolution, suggesting these dinosaurs developed elaborate armor much earlier than previously thought. Scientists believe the complex armor was likely used for both defense against predators and for attracting mates or deterring rivals.</p>

          <p>A Long Island judge has ruled that advanced DNA testing, specifically whole genome sequencing, can be used as evidence in the trial of accused Gilgo Beach serial killer Rex Heuermann. This landmark decision marks the first time such cutting-edge forensic evidence will be admissible in a New York State court, potentially revolutionizing how cold cases are prosecuted. Prosecutors used the technology to link hairs found with victims' remains to Heuermann and his family members. The defense had challenged the method's reliability, but the judge found its underlying principles to be accepted within the scientific community.</p>

The proposal is one of several futuristic transit options being explored to manage increased traffic from major development projects like the expansion of Disney's theme parks and the new OC Vibe entertainment district. A preliminary study commissioned by the city from a gondola company pitched creative ideas, such as designing support towers to resemble the stadium's iconic 'Big A' landmark.

          <p>As the Powerball jackpot swells to an estimated $1.4 billion, an analysis of lottery data highlights how a winner's location can significantly impact their take-home prize. While the odds of winning are astronomical, the tax implications vary widely by state. Winners in states with no income tax, such as Florida and Texas, would receive the largest payout after federal taxes are withheld. In contrast, states with high income taxes, like New York, would see the annuitized payout reduced by over $140 million. The data also identifies the most and least frequently drawn numbers in recent drawings.</p>

In late-stage trials, the pill demonstrated weight loss of up to 16.6%, comparable to the injectable version, and a favorable safety profile. The development of an effective pill could help alleviate supply shortages of injectable treatments and potentially offer a more accessible and convenient option for patients managing chronic weight issues.</p>

His remains were recovered from the wreckage in 1957 but could not be identified at the time.

          <p>A U.S. Court of Appeals has ruled against the Trump administration's use of the 1798 Alien Enemies Act to expedite the deportation of Venezuelan migrants accused of gang ties. The court found that the current situation does not meet the law's requirement of an 'invasion or predatory incursion,' thereby blocking its application in this context. The administration had invoked the obscure wartime statute to remove hundreds of alleged Tren de Aragua members. This ruling represents a significant legal setback for the administration's strategy and a victory for civil liberties groups who argued the president was overreaching his authority.</p>
