          <p>Chime, a financial technology company, has filed to go public on the Nasdaq under the ticker symbol "CHYM," distinguishing itself as a technology company rather than a bank. The company generates revenue from interchange fees on Chime debit and credit card purchases, with banks passing on a portion of these fees to Chime. As of March, Chime reported 8.6 million active members, a 23% year-over-year increase, and an average revenue per active member of $251, up from $231. This move comes amid market volatility that has caused other companies to delay their IPO plans. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>The stock market has rebounded to pre-tariff levels, but investors remain cautious due to uncertainty surrounding final tariff levels, according to The New York Times article. Despite stocks rising and government bond market volatility subsiding, investors are struggling to assess the economy's direction. The latest Consumer Price Index reading showed slower inflation in April than expected, but some believe tariff-fueled inflation may take months to appear in economic data. The Federal Reserve is also in a wait-and-see mode, holding off on interest rate cuts until the inflationary impact of tariffs is clearer, which contributes to ongoing market uncertainty.

          <p>Major League Baseball commissioner Rob Manfred has announced that players' ineligibility from the game ends upon their deaths, effectively removing Pete Rose and other deceased players from MLB's permanently ineligible list.

Manfred stated that a deceased person no longer poses a threat to the integrity of the game, and the policy change was prompted by an application filed by the family of Pete Rose.

The game involves a bat, a ball, a bowler (pitcher), and a batsman (batter) who defends a wicket. The bowler tries to hit the wicket, while the batsman tries to hit the ball as far as possible to score runs. A run is scored when the ball crosses the boundary line or when the batsmen run between the wickets.
