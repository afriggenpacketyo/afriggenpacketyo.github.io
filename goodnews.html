          <p>Mahmoud Khalil, a Columbia University graduate and activist, arrived in New Jersey after a federal judge ordered his release from ICE detention in Louisiana. The Trump administration had sought Khalil's deportation for his role in campus protests against Israel, alleging his activities aligned with Hamas, though he was never charged with any crimes. Judge Michael Fabiarz ruled that Khalil posed no threat and his detention was an attempt to punish him for his anti-Israel speech. Khalil's arrest in March sparked protests and discussions about free speech, and he was denied release to attend the birth of his son. This article covers the legal battle and the implications for free speech rights. The optimism score reflects the positive outcome of Khalil's release, balanced against the initial injustice of his detention.</p>
