          <p>The U.S. Army's 250th birthday celebration on June 14 will include a military parade in Washington, D.C., featuring troops, tanks, aircraft, and an Australian Cattle Dog named "Doc Holliday." Doc Holliday, part of the 1st Cavalry Division Horse Cavalry Detachment, will ride in a wagon pulled by two mules. The parade, costing an estimated $45 million, aims to strengthen the connection between America and its Army. President Trump will administer the constitutional oath to 250 Army enlistees after the parade.</p>

          <p>A recent study in JAMA Network Open reveals that breakfast cereals marketed to children have become less nutritious between 2010 and 2023. Researchers found increases in total fat, sodium, and sugar content, while protein and dietary fiber decreased. The study highlights the importance of healthy breakfast choices for children's energy and concentration. While some studies suggest cereals can be part of a nutritious diet, the trend toward lower nutritional quality raises concerns about parents' ability to provide a healthy start to the day.</p>

          <p>A tax bill passed by the House includes a provision to lift the SALT deduction cap to $40,000, potentially providing tax savings for homeowners with high property taxes. The change, effective for the 2025 tax year, would benefit those whose deductible expenses exceed their standard deduction. However, the full deduction would only be available to filers with household incomes below $500,000. While proponents say it would ease the tax burden for middle-class families, critics argue it would primarily benefit high-income homeowners and increase the U.S. debt.</p>

          <p>Bitcoin continued its rally, reaching a new record high above $111,000, driven by increasing institutional ownership and corporate adoption.

The price rise is taking place despite a drop in U.S. equities, suggesting investors are looking for alternative stores of value. U.S. President Donald Trump and his artificial intelligence and crypto czar David Sacks have pushed forward a pro-crypto agenda, further supporting the market. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>The Navy has reversed its ban on 381 books from its libraries after a Pentagon review using standardized search terms for diversity, equity, and inclusion (DEI) titles. The new review found only about 20 books needing removal pending further assessment by a Department of Defense panel. The reversal follows a May 9 Pentagon memo setting a deadline for military services to remove DEI-related books. The Navy initially used its own terms, identifying titles like "I Know Why the Caged Bird Sings," but the DOD's search terms yielded far fewer books.</p>

        </div>
        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>The possibility of an annuity running out of money depends on the type of annuity. Immediate and lifetime annuities are designed to provide a steady income stream for life, while fixed-term annuities pay out for a set number of years. Variable or indexed annuities can be tied to investment performance, potentially depleting the cash value. Strategies to safeguard annuity payments include choosing a lifetime income annuity, adding an income rider, diversifying retirement income, researching the insurance company, and monitoring withdrawal habits.

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>The Senate passed the No Tax on Tips Act, which eliminates federal taxes on service and hospitality workers' tips, but this policy incentivizes businesses to lower wages and rely more on tips. A more effective solution would be to address the subminimum wage, which allows employers to pay tipped workers less than the minimum wage. Eliminating the subminimum wage would help alleviate poverty and ensure fair compensation for all workers. Congress should consider expanding the standard deduction or increasing the minimum wage to provide meaningful support for low-wage workers.</p>
