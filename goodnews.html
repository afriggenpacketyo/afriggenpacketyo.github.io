Mr. Dan‚Äôs victory will likely calm fears in Europe‚Äôs political mainstream that Romania, which borders Ukraine and plays a vital role in defending NATO‚Äôs eastern flank against Russia, might join Hungary and Slovakia in opposing help for Ukraine and in cozying up to Moscow.</p>

While Trump touts the factory as a win for his economic policies, the facility relies on international technologies and supply chains. The factory is also part of a US strategy to counter China's technological dominance. The TSMC factory is closely guarded as it is the most important factory in the world, and it's being built by a company you've never heard of: TSMC, the Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing Company.</p>
