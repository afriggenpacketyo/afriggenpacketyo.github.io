          <p>A federal judge in Boston temporarily halted the Trump administration's ban on Harvard University enrolling international students, responding to a lawsuit filed by the university. The lawsuit challenged the Department of Homeland Security's decision to revoke Harvard's ability to enroll foreign students, citing the university's tolerance of "anti-American, pro-terrorist agitators." Judge Allison Burroughs issued a temporary restraining order, stating that Harvard would suffer irreparable injury if the ban took effect before a court hearing, which is scheduled for Tuesday. The ban would affect over 7,000 current visa holders studying at Harvard, including Princess Elisabeth of Belgium.</p>

          <p>Harvard professor Steven Pinker argues that criticisms against Harvard have become excessively negative, labeling it as "Harvard Derangement Syndrome." He acknowledges Harvard's issues, including academic freedom erosion and viewpoint diversity, but argues against the notion that it's a "woke madrasa." Pinker highlights examples of intellectual freedom at Harvard, noting that many faculty members report findings regardless of political correctness. He advocates for proportionality in dealing with educational institutions and suggests diagnosing specific problems rather than resorting to punitive measures like defunding.</p>
