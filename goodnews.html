          <p>Celebrating its tenth anniversary, Ethereum has transformed from a small, idealistic project into a foundational technology for global finance, now valued at over $420 billion. The article traces its journey from a bare-bones launch to becoming the "invisible backbone" of Wall Street, powering decentralized finance and tokenized assets. Co-founder Vitalik Buterin reflects on the platform's unexpected growth while also warning about the risks of centralization as mainstream adoption increases. The platform's stability and programmability continue to attract major institutions like BlackRock and Deutsche Bank, cementing its role in the future of finance. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>A federal appeals court has largely maintained restrictions on immigration enforcement tactics in the Los Angeles area, upholding a lower court's finding that agents cannot detain individuals based solely on factors like race or speaking Spanish. The ruling stems from controversial raids by the Trump administration that sparked protests and fear within the region's Latino community. The court affirmed that such factors do not constitute reasonable suspicion for a stop, a violation of the 4th Amendment. While advocates praised the decision for protecting constitutional rights, the Department of Homeland Security criticized it as judicial overreach undermining their enforcement efforts.</p>

          <p>NBA superstar Luka Doncic has signed a contract extension with the Los Angeles Lakers, ending speculation about his future and solidifying his role as the franchise's centerpiece. The 26-year-old guard, who was acquired in a trade from the Dallas Mavericks last season, announced the deal himself, expressing his commitment to bringing championships to the team. Lakers management praised Doncic as a transcendent player who will lead the franchise into its next era. As part of his announcement, Doncic also pledged a $5 million donation to support 77 young athletes worldwide in pursuing their dreams.</p>

          <p>Former Labour leader Jeremy Corbyn and fellow MP Zarah Sultana are in the process of forming a new left-wing political party in the UK, but it currently lacks a name. With a reported 600,000 registered supporters, the founders are inviting public input on what to call the new venture, aiming for a name that encapsulates its core values. The process is more than just branding; the party cannot field election candidates until a name is officially registered with the Electoral Commission, which has strict rules to prevent confusion with existing parties. This crowdsourcing approach reflects a modern, digitally-driven strategy for building a political movement from the ground up.</p>

          <p>The Los Angeles Lakers have officially committed to Luka Doncic as the future face of the franchise by signing him to a three-year, $165 million contract extension. This move, celebrated with a dedicated press conference, signals a clear shift in the team's hierarchy. The article explores the implications of this decision for LeBron James, who is under contract for only one more season. While Doncic is now firmly positioned as the team's centerpiece, James's future role and whether he will retire as a Laker remain uncertain, creating a potentially uneasy dynamic between the established superstar and the newly anointed one.</p>

          <p>Comedian Harry Hill has shared that the early death of his stepfather from cancer was a pivotal moment that inspired him to leave his career as a doctor and pursue comedy. Hill, who qualified as a physician in 1988, felt unsuited for medicine and recalled feeling out of his depth when breaking tragic news to patients. Witnessing his stepfather pass away at 54 without getting to enjoy retirement solidified his decision to change paths, thinking, "I don't want that to be me." He described leaving his hospital job for the last time as a terrifying but exciting moment where a great weight was lifted.</p>

          <p>Paola Clouatre, the wife of a U.S. Marine Corps veteran and mother of two young children, has been released from ICE custody after being detained for two months. She was arrested in May during what she believed was a routine green card application interview, despite having just given birth. Her husband, Adrian Clouatre, said he felt betrayed by the arrest, which occurred amid the Trump administration's intensified immigration enforcement. Her release on a recognizance bond, which requires her to wear an ankle monitor, allows her to reunite with her family while her immigration case continues through the legal system.</p>

          <p>A group led by Boston Celtics minority owner Steve Pagliuca has reached a deal to buy the WNBA's Connecticut Sun for a record $325 million, with plans to relocate the team to Boston by the 2027 season. The agreement, which is pending league approval, also includes a $100 million contribution for a new practice facility in Boston. The Sun, currently owned by the Mohegan Tribe, has been one of the league's most successful teams on the court but lacks modern facilities. This sale reflects the WNBA's rapid growth and increasing franchise valuations, far surpassing previous sale prices and expansion fees.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Researchers have likely solved the 80-year-old mystery of how a platypus named Winston, a diplomatic gift to UK Prime Minister Winston Churchill from Australia during World War II, died during its voyage. For decades, it was rumored the creature died from shell-shock after its ship encountered a German U-boat. However, new analysis of the platypus attendant's logs by Australian researchers reveals a more likely cause. The records show that water and air temperatures on the ship climbed well above the safe threshold for a platypus as it crossed the equator, suggesting the animal essentially died from heat stress rather than the trauma of war.</p>

          <p>China is increasingly turning to theme parks as a strategy to boost its economy and fuel consumer spending, with thousands of families recently attending the opening of the world's largest Legoland resort despite a heatwave. The country already has over 4,400 amusement facilities, a number projected to grow significantly in the coming years. According to the global association for the theme park industry, these attractions act as powerful economic drivers, with every yuan of operating revenue generating nearly four yuan in the local economy. This trend highlights a key part of China's effort to stimulate domestic consumption through large-scale entertainment projects.</p>

          <p>A high-stakes competition is underway at the New Orleans Saints training camp, where two Australian punters are battling for a single, multi-million dollar NFL contract. Incumbent Matt Hayball, a former Geelong Cats player, is facing a challenge from rookie James Burnip, who recently finished a standout career at the University of Alabama. Both athletes are graduates of the ProKick Australia academy. The situation epitomizes the cut-throat nature of the NFL, where only one will secure the lucrative roster spot by the final cuts on August 26, leaving the other unemployed and hoping for an opportunity with another team.

          <p>Dodgers pitcher Blake Snell delivered a sharp performance in his first start since returning from a shoulder injury, striking out eight batters over five innings. However, his strong outing was marred by two home runs from Rays slugger Yandy Díaz, who took advantage of the short right-field wall at the team's temporary ballpark. The Dodgers ultimately lost 4-0. Despite the loss, Snell's return is a positive sign for the team, as he filled the strike zone and showed dominant stuff, flashing the potential that earned him a $182 million contract and bolstering the team's rotation for their championship defense.</p>
