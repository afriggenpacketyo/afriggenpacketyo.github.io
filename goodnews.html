          <p>Chinese citizens are celebrating the reported combat success of the J-10C fighter jet in the India-Pakistan conflict, with Pakistan claiming to have shot down Indian Rafale jets using the Chinese-made aircraft. However, the Chinese government and official media have remained largely quiet on the matter. A foreign ministry spokesman stated he was ‚Äúnot familiar‚Äù with the reports, urging both sides to exercise restraint. Analysts suggest Beijing's restraint is due to diplomatic considerations regarding the conflict between its neighbor India and its ally Pakistan, as well as military prudence.</p>

The U.S. currently imposes tariffs of 145% on imports from China, which has retaliated with a 125% levy on American goods.

The spacecraft, designed to withstand the harsh conditions of Venus, may survive its Earth reentry due to its resilient construction. Weighing 495 kilograms and measuring 1.17 meters in diameter, Cosmos 482 is larger than most space debris. Although its reentry is uncontrolled, its smooth shape may allow for reasonably accurate calculations of its descent. The risk of injury from space debris is considered low.</p>
