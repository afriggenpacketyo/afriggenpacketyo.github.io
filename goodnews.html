          <p>President Trump has suggested that U.S. companies should move from quarterly to semiannual earnings reports to encourage long-term strategic focus over short-term profits. The proposal, which would require approval from the Securities and Exchange Commission, has revived a long-standing debate on corporate transparency and management priorities. While some business leaders support the idea, critics worry that less frequent reporting could reduce vital transparency for investors and potentially lead to increased market volatility and opportunities for fraud.</p>

The achievement highlights the company's continued market dominance as it navigates formidable challenges from AI competition and heightened regulatory scrutiny in both the U.S. and Europe.</p>

          <h2>Federal Reserve Rate Cut Unlikely to Cause Immediate Drop in Mortgage Rates</h2>
          <div class="timestamp">2025-09-15 16:10:43 EDT</div>
        </div>
        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>As the Federal Reserve prepares to lower its benchmark interest rate, experts advise that homeowners should not expect an immediate corresponding drop in mortgage rates. Mortgage rates, particularly for 30-year fixed loans, are more closely tied to the long-term bond market, like the 10-year Treasury note, rather than the Fed's short-term federal funds rate. Lenders have largely already priced in the anticipated cut, meaning current mortgage rates already reflect the market's expectation of a looser monetary policy moving forward.

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>A federal judge has ruled that the Trump administration's mass firing of over 25,000 probationary federal workers was illegal. U.S. District Judge William Alsup found that the U.S. Office of Personnel Management overstepped its authority by directing individual agencies to terminate employees, a power reserved for the agencies themselves. While reinstatement is not being ordered due to the time that has elapsed, the ruling requires agencies to amend the personnel files of affected workers to clarify they were not fired for poor performance.</p>

Individuals with income from self-employment, investments, or the gig economy are urged to review their obligations to avoid potential underpayment penalties from the IRS. (not investment advice)</p>
