          <p>China, a leading producer and consumer of aluminum, relies heavily on imported high-quality bauxite. However, a new French technology developed by IB2 is being implemented in Shanxi province to enable the production of aluminum from China‚Äôs low-grade ore. This technology neutralizes silica and sulfur, allowing the Bayer process to efficiently refine high-silica bauxite. This innovation could significantly reduce China‚Äôs dependence on foreign sources of aluminum ore and contribute to a greener aluminum industry, aligning with Beijing's environmental goals.</p>

          <p>In an Oval Office meeting, Canadian Prime Minister Mark Carney rebuffed President Trump's idea of the U.S. acquiring Canada, stating that Canada is "not for sale, ever." This exchange followed Trump's remarks romanticizing a "wonderful marriage" between the two countries. Carney emphasized the importance of partnership and collaboration while firmly opposing any notion of Canada becoming the 51st state. Despite trade tensions and border disputes, both leaders affirmed their commitment to maintaining friendly relations, though disagreements on tariffs persist.</p>

          <p>The UK government is introducing a new law to protect war memorials, including the statue of Winston Churchill in Parliament Square, making it a criminal offense to climb them. This measure, included in the Crime and Policing Bill, aims to prevent desecration and show respect for national heroes. Offenders could face up to three months in prison and a ¬£1,000 fine.

          <p>One year after a tornado destroyed his family's home in Bartlesville, Oklahoma, 9-year-old River Garrett focuses on rebuilding rather than dwelling on the loss. River's family survived, but their ranch was leveled during the storm that caused $25 million in damage and killed two people. River's positive outlook and understanding that others had it worse has inspired his community. He has a new room filled with some of his old things and a renewed appreciation for the little things in life.</p>

          <p>Elon Musk's efforts to maintain privacy around his $6 million mansion in West Lake Hills, Texas, have faced scrutiny after neighbors complained about unauthorized construction. Musk's team lobbied city officials to keep details of his security operations private, citing his work with the Trump administration as justification. However, city officials denied the request for a closed meeting, and Musk's appeal to keep the fence and gate on his property was rejected by the Zoning and Planning Commission, highlighting tensions between the billionaire and local residents.</p>

          <p>Burger King is facing a class action lawsuit alleging that its Whopper advertisements exaggerate the size of the burger, making it appear 35% larger with twice the amount of meat. A U.S. District Judge ruled that it is "plausible" that reasonable consumers could be misled by the promotional images. The lawsuit claims the burgers are depicted as "overflowing" their buns. Burger King maintains that its marketing team "styled sandwiches more beautifully" and that consumers know the photos are to make items appear appetizing. Subway faces a similar lawsuit over misleading ads.</p>
