          <p>An opinion piece argues that the Philippines and China should improve their diplomatic relations despite ongoing maritime disputes. The author suggests that focusing too heavily on the sea row has damaged broader connections, hindering economic cooperation and people-to-people exchanges. The piece advocates for exploring areas of collaboration without compromising each country's positions. It highlights China's economic success and potential for partnership in areas like renewable energy and tourism, while urging both nations to adopt more effective diplomatic strategies used by other Southeast Asian coastal states. The author believes that allowing security issues to dominate the relationship is unwise and unproductive.</p>

          <p>Walmart plans to expand its drone delivery service to 100 stores in Atlanta, Charlotte, Houston, Orlando, and Tampa, bringing the total number of states with this option to five. Customers can request deliveries through the Wing app, with drones operating within a six-mile radius of the stores. This expansion aims to compete with rivals like Amazon by offering convenience and speed, with deliveries taking 30 minutes or less. The most frequently delivered items include eggs, ice cream, pet food, and fresh fruit, and Walmart intends to add a drone delivery option within its own app, testing a $19.99 delivery fee or free service for Walmart+ members.</p>
