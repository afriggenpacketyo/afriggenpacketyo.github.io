          <p>NBA star Luka Doncic has signed a multi-year contract extension with the Los Angeles Lakers, solidifying his role as the franchise's future cornerstone. The 26-year-old guard, who was acquired in a trade from the Dallas Mavericks last season, announced the deal himself, expressing excitement to pursue championships in Los Angeles. While the exact terms were not disclosed, the move ends speculation about his potential departure and signals the team's commitment to him in the post-LeBron James era. Doncic also pledged a $5 million donation to support 77 young athletes globally.</p>

          <p>Former Labour leader Jeremy Corbyn, along with fellow independent MP Zarah Sultana, is establishing a new left-wing political party in the UK, which has already attracted over 600,000 registered supporters. Unconventionally, the party has been launched without an official name, with the founders planning to involve supporters in the selection process. This move aims to build a grassroots movement, though the party cannot field election candidates until it registers a name with the Electoral Commission. The initiative reflects a desire to create a modern political brand distinct from established parties.</p>

          <p>The Los Angeles Lakers' decision to sign Luka Doncic to a massive contract extension officially positions him as the new face of the franchise. This strategic move, however, intensifies questions about the future role of LeBron James, who is under contract for only one more season. This article analyzes the team's public display of commitment to Doncic, suggesting it's a clear signal of a power shift that James, accustomed to being the franchise's focal point, will have to navigate.

          <p>British comedian Harry Hill has shared that the death of his stepfather at age 54 was the catalyst for his decision to leave medicine and pursue comedy. A qualified doctor, Hill felt unsuited for the profession, recalling an instance of breaking tragic news to a patient where he felt "completely out of his depth." He explained that his stepfather's passing made him realize he didn't want to spend his life in a career he wasn't passionate about. The move ultimately led to a successful career in entertainment with popular shows like "Harry Hill's TV Burp."</p>

          <p>Meta Platforms, a key advocate for open-source AI with its Llama models, is now indicating a more cautious approach to its open-source strategy. This shift comes as Chinese tech companies are rapidly advancing and releasing their own powerful open-source AI models. Experts like Andrew Ng suggest that China's competitive, "Darwinian" open-source ecosystem could be its path to surpassing the US in AI development. Recent releases from companies like Alibaba and Zhipu AI underscore this trend, with their new models claiming top performance benchmarks among open-source competitors.</p>

          <p>An annual mountain cleanup at Breckenridge Ski Resort in Colorado resulted in the collection of 780 pounds of trash and some peculiar finds. Over 150 employees participated in the effort, recovering items dropped from ski lifts and left behind on the slopes. Among the unusual discoveries were an old iPod Nano, a hamburger flipper, and a message in a bottle that contained a COVID-19 vaccination card. The resort noted that while many items were trash, larger pieces were recycled, and occasionally, they are able to reunite lost valuables with their owners.</p>

Her detention stemmed from a years-old, unknown deportation order issued after her mother, who abandoned her as a teen, missed an immigration hearing.

          <p>The long-standing mystery surrounding the death of a platypus gifted to Winston Churchill during World War II has finally been solved. The platypus, named Winston, was a diplomatic gift from Australia in 1943 but died during the final leg of its sea voyage to the UK. For decades, it was rumored that the creature died from shell-shock caused by a nearby German U-boat attack. However, recent archival research has revealed that the platypus likely died from heatstroke, as logbooks showed water temperatures in its enclosure climbed well above a safe threshold as the ship crossed the equator.</p>
