          <p>Roku is shifting from its ad-supported model by launching "Howdy," a new commercial-free streaming service priced at $2.99 per month. The service will feature 10,000 hours of content from partners like Warner Bros. Discovery and Lionsgate, alongside Roku's original programming. This move complements Roku's existing free, ad-supported Roku Channel and aims to attract a broader audience without directly competing with premium services. The launch follows a strong financial quarter for Roku, which saw its platform revenue increase significantly.</p>

The company reported a 33% year-over-year revenue increase to $668.5 million, driven by high demand for its body cameras, drones, and other security technologies. Citing accelerating demand, Axon has also raised its full-year revenue forecast to between $2.65 billion and $2.73 billion. The growth was seen across all its segments, including a 19% increase in its TASER unit. (not investment advice)</p>

The company is repurposing old electric vehicle batteries, which still have usable capacity, to create microgrid energy storage systems for data centers. Redwood has partnered with AI infrastructure firm Crusoe on its first project, which generates 12 megawatts of power from a solar array and stores it in the repurposed batteries. This innovative approach aims to provide scalable, 24/7 renewable power at a cost-effective rate for the rapidly growing data center market.</p>

          <p>Following a significant downward revision of recent U.S. job numbers, which led to the firing of the BLS commissioner, experts clarify that such revisions are a standard part of the process. The Bureau of Labor Statistics initially releases preliminary estimates and later refines them as more complete payroll data becomes available from businesses. While the latest revision was unusually large for a non-recessionary period, former officials stress it does not indicate manipulation or failure, but rather reflects the challenge of timely data collection. The process is designed to balance the need for speed with the pursuit of accuracy. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>The acting head of NASA has directed the agency to deploy a small nuclear power plant on the moon's surface by late 2029, aiming to pre-empt similar plans by China and Russia. The directive warns that the first nation to establish a lunar reactor could declare an exclusive zone, potentially hindering the U.S. Artemis exploration program. The Fission Surface Power program will rely on microreactor technology to generate at least 100 kilowatts of electricity. This ambitious goal comes as the Trump administration has proposed budget cuts for NASA and seeks to expedite the commercialization of small nuclear reactors.</p>

          <p>LAFC is set to sign South Korean national team captain Son Heung-min from Tottenham Hotspur for a transfer fee reported to be the highest in MLS history. The move is seen as a major coup for both the league and the club, expected to significantly boost LAFC's offense and engage Southern California's large Korean American community. For Son, the transfer allows him to adapt to North American conditions ahead of the 2026 World Cup. The signing is anticipated to be a financial success for LAFC through marketing and sponsorship, similar to the impact of other international stars in U.S. sports.</p>

          <p>A weeklong manhunt has ended with the capture of Austin Robert Drummond, the prime suspect in the killing of four people in northwest Tennessee. Drummond, 28, was apprehended in a wooded area in Jackson and is considered a suspect in the deaths of Cortney Rose, her two children, and her daughter's boyfriend.

          <h2>New History Argues Iranian Revolution Was a Contingent Event, Not an Inevitable Outcome</h2>

          <p>A new book by Scott Anderson, "King of Kings," challenges deterministic views of the 1979 Iranian Revolution, presenting it as a contingent event shaped by miscalculation and accident. The book argues that the rise of Ayatollah Khomeini's theocracy was not inevitable but resulted from a convergence of factors. These included the Shah's hubris and secret illness, and the U.S. government's profound ignorance and internal division regarding the situation in Iran. By focusing on the actions of key individuals in the crucial months leading to the revolution, the book suggests that a series of freakish circumstances led to the outcome.</p>

          <h2>Examining the Pros and Cons of Purchasing an Annuity at Age 70</h2>
          <div class="timestamp">2025-08-05 11:18:11 EDT</div>
        </div>
        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>For individuals turning 70, an annuity can provide a guaranteed income stream for life, offering peace of mind in a volatile economic climate. Buying an annuity at an older age typically results in higher monthly payments, as the insurer's payout period is expected to be shorter. This can be particularly advantageous for healthy individuals with a family history of longevity, especially with current interest rates making fixed annuities more attractive. However, potential downsides include high fees, a lack of liquidity, and the possibility of not recouping the initial investment if one's health declines unexpectedly. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>Students in Scotland have received their national exam results, showing a slight increase in pass rates compared to last year for National 5, Higher, and Advanced Higher qualifications. The Scottish Qualifications Authority (SQA) also reported a narrowing of the attainment gap between students from the most and least deprived areas. A record number of young Scots have been offered university or college places, and there was a notable increase in vocational and technical qualifications. Some mail deliveries of certificates to island communities were delayed by a storm, but digital results were available.</p>
