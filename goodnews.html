        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Columbia University-trained psychologist Becky Kennedy outlines three powerful steps for building emotional endurance, which is the capacity to handle stress without being overwhelmed by negative emotions. She suggests using visual aids to understand that learning involves struggle, engaging in positive self-talk to reframe internal dialogues, and undertaking small, manageable experiments to build tolerance for discomfort. Kennedy emphasizes that these practices can transform challenging moments into opportunities for growth, making the process of developing resilience feel more manageable and constructive. The article presents these techniques as accessible ways to improve mental strength and coping skills in daily life.</p>

Despite building a vast lifestyle empire with her husband Chip, Gaines finds solace and meditation in daily routines like cooking dinner.

          <h2>Gallup Poll Shows American Alcohol Consumption at Lowest Point Since 1939</h2>

        </div>
        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>A recent Gallup survey reveals that only 54% of Americans report drinking alcohol, the lowest percentage recorded since the poll began in 1939. This decline is accompanied by a growing public awareness of the health risks associated with alcohol, with a majority now believing even moderate consumption is unhealthy. The article attributes this shift to updated medical guidance from organizations like the World Health Organization, which states no level of alcohol is safe. Furthermore, a significant drop in underage drinking has been observed, contributing to positive public health outcomes like fewer alcohol-related deaths and accidents.</p>

          <p>Activist investment firm Engine Capital has taken an approximately 3% stake in life sciences company Avantor and is urging its board to implement significant changes to address chronic underperformance. In a public letter, Engine Capital outlined a plan that includes focusing on operational excellence, reducing costs, optimizing the company's portfolio, and refreshing the board of directors. The firm criticizes Avantor's past leadership for flawed capital allocation, including costly acquisitions and rebuffing a potential takeover offer at a significant premium. Engine Capital suggests these changes could unlock substantial shareholder value, proposing a potential sale of the company as an alternative. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>Kash Patel, a former FBI Director and loyalist to Donald Trump, has won a defamation lawsuit by default against blogger Jim Stewartson. A federal judge in Las Vegas awarded Patel and his foundation $250,000 in damages after Stewartson failed to respond to the lawsuit in court. The suit cited numerous posts where Stewartson accused Patel of being a "Kremlin asset" and planning the January 6th Capitol attack. The judge ruled that Stewartson acted with malice, stating that while criticism of public figures is protected, defamatory falsehoods are not. Stewartson claims he was never properly served with the lawsuit.</p>

This shift is partly driven by Samsung's innovative foldable phones, like the Z Fold 7, which offer new form factors that appeal to consumers seeking novelty beyond the standard smartphone design. While Apple remains the market leader, Samsung's wider range of products at various price points and its early adoption of new technologies are creating renewed competition.

Rather than relying on zero-tolerance policing, the city's approach, led by Mayor Brandon Scott, identifies individuals at the highest risk of violence and offers them social services, job training, and a path away from crime, while also ensuring accountability for those who continue violent activities.

          <p>A recent survey found that Americans believe the ideal age to begin saving for retirement is 27, with a goal of retiring by 58. However, certified financial planners recommend starting even earlier to fully leverage the power of compound interest. Experts emphasize that beginning in one's early 20s allows savings more time to grow, potentially leading to a significantly larger nest egg. While starting at 27 is still considered a viable timeline, it often requires more aggressive saving strategies to meet retirement goals, especially for those hoping to retire before the traditional age.
