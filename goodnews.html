          <p>FBI Deputy Director Dan Bongino provided an update on the agency's operations, emphasizing the focus on removing dangerous illegal aliens who prey on citizens and protecting children from predators. Bongino highlighted 'Operation Restoring Justice,' which led to the arrest of 764 child predators nationwide, and warned those targeting children. The FBI is also addressing high-profile cases, including the attack on Rep. Steve Scalise and the Jeffrey Epstein case, while countering what Bongino described as false media narratives and defending FBI Director Patel. Bongino assured the public that the FBI is committed to its reforms and encouraged Americans to monitor their progress.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>As global uncertainties increase, China is looking to diversify its sources of imported food, with Southeast Asian countries becoming key suppliers. Yunnan, a Chinese province bordering Myanmar, Laos, and Vietnam, plays a vital role in this regional agricultural cooperation. Yunnan's involvement began decades ago with the "alternative crop cultivation programme," aimed at reducing opium production by sharing agricultural technology. Overseas agricultural investment and cooperation are seen as effective ways to support China's food security by diversifying its food supply sources, especially as Chinese food consumption patterns shift towards more meat, dairy, fruits, and vegetables.</p>

          <p>Samii Wood, a professional cuddler in Bedfordshire, promotes the health benefits of platonic touch through "cuddle puddles" and one-on-one therapy. Wood believes that touch boosts serotonin and oxytocin levels while lowering cortisol, which can help individuals with nervous system issues, PTSD, or loneliness. While she emphasizes the platonic and nurturing nature of her services, some experts like Sophie Scott stress the importance of relationships in touch therapy, arguing that safety and trust are crucial for positive outcomes. Pep Valerio, a client of Wood's, testifies to the healing power of these sessions, highlighting the safe environment and emotional release they provide.</p>

          <p>Starbucks and Luckin Coffee are finding success in China by focusing on lower-tier cities amidst sluggish consumption and intense price competition. Starbucks saw flat same-store sales, but a transaction increase offset a decline in average spending, with significant store expansion into county-level markets. The article notes that while this shows efforts to defend market share, it's crucial to monitor expansion beyond wealthier cities. Overall, coffee shop growth is concentrated in second and "new first-tier cities," indicating a broader trend of coffee consumption in less globally-connected urban centers.</p>

The affected areas include Florida, Tennessee, Georgia, South Carolina, and North Carolina. Unlike typical atmospheric rivers that originate from the Gulf of Mexico or the Caribbean and land in the Western U.S., this event is due to a "cutoff low," diverting the jet stream eastward. While this may alleviate recent droughts in certain areas, there is also a risk of flooding and flash floods.</p>

Vance and Rubio contacted Prime Minister Modi and General Munir respectively, urging de-escalation, leading to a cease-fire brokered with American involvement.

          <p>U.S. and Chinese officials met in Switzerland for trade talks, with President Trump claiming "great progress" and a "total reset negotiated." However, there was no immediate confirmation of progress, and talks are set to resume Sunday. Trump suggested lowering tariffs on China, while Chinese officials pushed for the U.S. to drop its tariffs first. The talks aim to de-escalate trade tensions and stabilize world markets, but analysts doubt any substantive results will be achieved at this meeting.</p>
