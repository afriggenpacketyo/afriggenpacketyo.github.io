        </div>
        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Ford's large, gas-powered Expedition SUV is experiencing a significant sales surge, with August sales increasing by 53.7% year-over-year, marking the model's best performance in 21 years. This growth contrasts with the broader industry rush towards electric vehicles, indicating strong continued consumer demand for traditional internal combustion engine vehicles, particularly large family SUVs. While Ford's EV sales also grew, the success of the high-profit Expedition highlights the company's strategy of balancing EV development with its profitable lineup of trucks and SUVs. The trend suggests some consumers are still willing to invest in large, expensive gasoline vehicles despite rising interest in EVs.</p>

          <p>Daniel Levy has announced he is stepping down as the executive chairman of Tottenham Hotspur, concluding a 24-year tenure at the helm of the English football club. Appointed in March 2001, Levy's leadership saw the club transform significantly, including the construction of a new state-of-the-art stadium and consistent competition in top-tier European football. His departure comes after the club recently secured its first trophy in 17 years by winning the Europa League. In a statement, Levy expressed pride in the club's growth into a 'global heavyweight' and thanked the fans for their support throughout his long journey with the team.</p>

          <p>Lindsey Stewart's new book, "The Conjuring of America," examines the deep and often overlooked influence of conjure, a spiritual practice developed by enslaved Black people, on mainstream American culture. The article highlights how this hybrid tradition, rooted in African religions, has shaped everything from New Year's culinary traditions like black-eyed peas to the evolution of blues music. Stewart argues that the conjure woman has been a central figure in American history, shaping practices around medicine, childbirth, and community protection. Amid a recent resurgence in pop culture, the book traces conjure's legacy through food, music, and folklore, revealing the obscured contributions of Black women.</p>

          <p>The National Weather Service has significantly expanded its Flood Inundation Mapping (FIM) tool, which now provides real-time flood forecast visualizations for areas covering 60% of the U.S. population. The interactive online tool offers Google Earth-style views of current and predicted floodwaters, designed to help forecasters, emergency managers, and the public make better-informed decisions. Previously available to a smaller portion of the country, the expansion now includes the Great Plains, Southwest, and West Coast, along with Hawaii and parts of Alaska. This development is considered a 'game-changer' for providing actionable information during severe weather events, with full national coverage expected next year.</p>

          <p>Broadcom is set to report its fiscal third-quarter earnings, with analysts anticipating significant revenue growth of 21% year-over-year, largely fueled by the booming demand for artificial intelligence hardware.

Wall Street expects Broadcom's AI-related revenue to continue its strong upward trajectory, with some analysts projecting that custom silicon could generate over $25 billion for the company next year.

          <p>A 78-year-old woman from Miami Gardens, Florida, has successfully obtained her birth certificate for the first time in her life, resolving a lifelong documentation issue. Born at home in Georgia during the segregation era, Jessie Lovette never received official proof of her birth, a problem that was exacerbated by the implementation of the federal Real ID law. After a lengthy process assisted by her son, the arrival of the document has brought immense joy and relief, allowing her to secure a Real ID and alleviating fears related to proving her U.S. citizenship. The family now hopes to get her a passport for international travel.</p>

          <p>The average interest rate for a 30-year fixed-rate mortgage in the United States has fallen to 6.5%, its lowest point since last October. This continued decline in borrowing costs, reported by Freddie Mac, provides some relief to prospective homebuyers by increasing their purchasing power. The drop from 6.56% the previous week reflects growing market expectations that the Federal Reserve will cut its benchmark interest rate later this month. Mortgage rates are not set by the Fed but are heavily influenced by its policy decisions and the performance of the 10-year Treasury note in the bond market. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>The NBA is considering a significant change to its All-Star Game format for the 2026 event in Los Angeles, aiming to inject more competition and excitement into the showcase. The proposed format would feature a round-robin tournament with three eight-player teams: two composed of U.S.-born players and one team of international players. This move comes after years of criticism over the lack of defensive effort, which culminated in a 211-186 score in the 2024 game. The league and the players' union have presented the idea to the competition committee, hoping the USA vs. World concept will motivate players and re-engage fans.</p>
