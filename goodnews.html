          <p>An unusual dust storm swept across northwest Indiana and north-central Illinois, dramatically reducing visibility and prompting the National Weather Service to issue warnings. The article describes how the storm, originating near Bloomington, Illinois, was caused by strong winds from thunderstorms lifting dry soil from parched farmland. Visibility dropped to near-zero conditions on major highways, and Chicago experienced a dramatic scene as the dust cloud rolled in. Meteorologists noted the rarity of such an event in the region, attributing it to exceptionally dry soil conditions.</p>

          <p>The UK's Eurovision entry, Remember Monday, finished in 19th place despite possessing strong vocal harmonies and West End experience. The article suggests the song's chaotic mix of musical styles and over-the-top staging may have contributed to its failure to connect with voters. While the band received praise from professional juries, the public vote eluded them for the second year in a row. The article also explores the role of politics in Eurovision voting and emphasizes the importance of approaching the contest with a positive attitude.</p>

          <p>The article explores how public perception of Lyle and Erik Menendez, who murdered their parents in 1989, has shifted over time due to pop culture and a growing understanding of trauma and sexual abuse. Initially portrayed as greedy monsters, the brothers now have a new generation of supporters who are more sympathetic to their claims of sexual abuse. This shift in public opinion may influence their chances of parole, as a judge recently reduced their sentence to include the possibility of parole. The article examines the role of TikTok, Netflix, and celebrities like Kim Kardashian in reshaping the narrative around the case.</p>
