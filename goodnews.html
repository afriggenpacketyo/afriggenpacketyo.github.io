          <p>A preliminary magnitude 4.1 earthquake struck parts of Tennessee, Georgia, and North Carolina on Saturday morning, centered near Greenback, Tennessee. Residents in Atlanta and western North Carolina reported feeling the tremors, with over 23,000 reports received by the USGS within the first hour. While there were no immediate reports of significant damage or injuries, the event served as a reminder of earthquake preparedness for residents in the Eastern Tennessee seismic zone. The article notes that earthquakes are not uncommon in this region, and seismic waves travel more efficiently in the Eastern U.S. due to its geology, allowing the earthquake to be felt over a larger distance.</p>

          <p>In an excerpt from his memoir "Who Knew," media executive Barry Diller discusses his career and the importance of instinct over data in decision-making. Diller recounts his time at ABC, where he popularized the made-for-TV "Movie of the Week," emphasizing that predicting the public's appetite is impossible and that data can harm instinct. He shares stories of greenlighting successful projects like "Brian's Song" and "The Night Stalker" based on gut feeling, highlighting the value of simple human instinct overreliance on structured information and MBA-style analysis. Diller argues that too much information can obscure the essence of a good idea.</p>

          <p>In "The Afterlife of Malcolm X," journalist Mark Whitaker examines the lasting influence of Malcolm X, focusing on Spike Lee's 1992 biopic. The excerpt details the artistic choices made during the film's production, such as recreating Roxbury in Brooklyn and filming the assassination scene with haunting dialogue, music, and camera work. Denzel Washington's portrayal aimed to convey Malcolm's premonition of his death, using techniques like the "double dolly shot" and a subtle expression of relief upon seeing his assassin. The article highlights Lee's efforts to capture Malcolm's fatalistic state of mind and the impact of his martyrdom.</p>

          <p>Climate change is altering bird migration by affecting their food sources and resting places, leading to shorter routes or abandonment of original habitats. Rising sea levels and ocean acidification impact crustaceans, a vital food source, while extreme weather events pose direct threats to migratory birds. Warmer temperatures reduce food scarcity, prompting changes in migration behavior, potentially causing conflicts with resident animals. The article emphasizes the importance of protected areas and bird-friendly environments to mitigate these effects and preserve the crucial role migratory birds play in maintaining ecosystem health and food security.</p>
