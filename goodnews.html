          <h2>Passing Star Could Destabilize Solar System, Impacting Earth's Orbit</h2>
          <div class="timestamp">2025-06-19 01:32:33 EDT</div>
        </div>
        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>A recent study published in the journal Icarus suggests that a passing star could cause more instability in the solar system than previously believed, potentially impacting the orbits of planets, including Earth. Computer simulations indicate that isolated models of the solar system may underestimate the extent of future orbital changes of giant planets. The gravitational tug from a passing star could transform Pluto from a stable object to one with chaotic gravitational interactions, and the risk of instability for Mars could increase significantly. While the probability of a collision with Earth is relatively low at 0.2 percent, it is still higher than previous estimates, underscoring the vulnerability of the solar system to planetary chaos.</p>

          <p>Archaeologists have reconstructed thousands of fragments of 2,000-year-old wall plaster, revealing remarkable frescoes from a luxurious Roman villa in Central London. The frescoes, discovered in 2021, depict musical instruments, birds, flowers, and fruit, providing insights into the affluence of the area, described as the "Beverly Hills of Roman London". The art also offers clues about the artists, with one fragment bearing the Latin word "Fecit," meaning "has made this." This discovery highlights the thriving settlement outside central Roman London and showcases the Romans' commitment to investing in the city. </p>

          <p>Dongchoon Circus Troupe, South Korea's last and 100-year-old circus, continues to perform despite the decline of the circus industry. Founded in 1925, Dongchoon once thrived with animal acts, skits, and magic shows, but now focuses on acrobatic performances. Head Park Sae-hwan worries about the circus's future, as it is the only one left in the country. The circus has adapted by offering only acrobatic performances and refraining from too-risky acts, with its acrobats now being Chinese due to a lack of South Korean interest. Local tourism has been boosted by Dongchoon's presence, drawing both older and younger generations.</p>

          <p>Businesses are increasingly employing "tariff engineering" to skirt higher duties imposed by the U.S. government by strategically altering an item's materials, dimensions, or compositions. While most new tariffs are broad-based, exemptions for certain products allow companies to benefit through these changes. Some manufacturers bundle steel and aluminum elements to qualify for lower duties, while others remove elements based on tariff reversals. This practice is legal as long as goods are honestly presented to customs officers, and it involves strategic design choices to create different products subject to different tariff classifications.
