          <div class="timestamp">2025-09-14 20:11:23 EDT</div>
        </div>
        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Australian researchers have achieved a significant breakthrough with the approval of a single-dose vaccine to protect koalas from chlamydia, a major cause of death and infertility for the marsupials. Developed over a decade, the vaccine reduces infection, prevents disease progression, and can even reverse existing symptoms. Chlamydia can cause blindness and starvation in koalas, and while antibiotics exist, they are not always effective and can have adverse side effects. This innovative vaccine offers hope for reducing the devastating spread of the disease and aiding koala conservation efforts.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Fitness experts are highlighting the benefits of "Zone Zero," a low-intensity activity level where heart rate stays below 50% of maximum, encompassing gentle movements like walking or stretching. While not an official medical category, this concept encourages everyday activity, supporting recovery, regulating blood sugar, and improving circulation without stress. It serves as a foundation for fitness, complementing more vigorous workouts, and is easily accessible without special equipment. This approach helps people stay active, especially those not ready for traditional exercise, by focusing on consistent, light movement throughout the day.</p>

        </div>
        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>With two weeks left in the regular season, the Dodgers are in a crucial battle for playoff positioning, specifically aiming for a bye into the division series. Currently trailing the Phillies for the second-best record, securing a bye is seen as advantageous by the team's president of baseball operations, Andrew Friedman, despite past division series losses. A bye offers rest for injured players and allows for optimal pitching rotation, avoiding the risks of the wild-card round. The upcoming series against the Philadelphia Phillies is therefore vital for their postseason aspirations.</p>

          <p>Week 2 of the NFL season delivered several key matchups, with the Philadelphia Eagles defeating the Kansas City Chiefs 20-17 in a Super Bowl rematch, driven by Jalen Hurts and Saquon Barkley. The Cincinnati Bengals secured a 31-27 victory over the Jacksonville Jaguars, but star quarterback Joe Burrow exited with a toe injury, expected to miss several weeks. Other notable games included the Dallas Cowboys' overtime win against the New York Giants and the Detroit Lions' dominant performance over the Chicago Bears.

          <p>The UK and US have unveiled the Atlantic Partnership for Advanced Nuclear Energy, a landmark agreement aimed at fast-tracking nuclear power development and creating thousands of jobs. This initiative, expected to be formalized during President Trump's visit, will streamline regulatory approvals, reducing licensing periods for new power stations. Key projects include a proposal for up to 12 advanced modular reactors in Hartlepool and nuclear-powered data centers in Nottinghamshire, collectively worth billions. The collaboration seeks to enhance energy security, cut household bills, and reduce reliance on Russian nuclear materials by 2028.</p>

          <p>Jim Edgar, a popular two-term Republican governor of Illinois, has died at 79 from complications related to pancreatic cancer. Credited with bringing financial stability to the state in the 1990s, Edgar was known for his moderate politics, successfully pushing for budget cuts and making a temporary income tax surcharge permanent to fund public schools. He remained a respected figure, later expressing unease with the Republican party's shift and supporting Kamala Harris.

          <p>Danny Murphy's analysis suggests Manchester United's ongoing problems stem from player selection and positioning rather than their 3-4-2-1 formation under Ruben Amorim. While the team shows improved compactness, individual errors, particularly from Bruno Fernandes in a deeper midfield role, are costing them points. Murphy argues Fernandes' defensive instincts are lacking for that position, and other players like Luke Shaw are also shoe-horned into uncomfortable roles. The article emphasizes that despite a not-horrendous start to the season, these personnel issues are preventing the team from consistent success.</p>
