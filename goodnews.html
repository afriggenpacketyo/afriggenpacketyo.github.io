          <p>Former President Donald Trump has denied a Wall Street Journal story claiming that Treasury Secretary Scott Bessent persuaded him not to fire Federal Reserve Chair Jerome Powell. The report suggested Bessent warned that such an unprecedented move could destabilize financial markets and noted the Fed was already likely to cut interest rates. Trump dismissed the story as "typically untruthful" on Truth Social, asserting his own superior understanding of the market and the economy. This denial occurs amidst ongoing criticism of Powell by Trump and his allies over the central bank's policies and management.</p>

          <p>American golfer Scottie Scheffler has won his first British Open, claiming the Claret Jug at Royal Portrush with a dominant four-stroke lead over runner-up Harris English. The 29-year-old world number one finished the tournament at 17-under-par, marking his second major victory of 2025 and his fourth major overall. This win places him in an elite group with Jack Nicklaus, Gary Player, and Tiger Woods as the only players to win The Open, the Masters, and the PGA Championship before turning 30. Scheffler now only needs a U.S. Open title to complete the coveted career Grand Slam.</p>

          <p>Following his dominant victory at the Open Championship, Scottie Scheffler described the win as a dream come true but stood by his earlier statements about the limitations of professional sports for personal fulfillment. The world number one acknowledged the joy and excitement of winning golf's oldest major but clarified that such success does not satisfy the "deepest desires of your heart." He suggested his message was misconstrued by some as a lack of passion for the game he has dedicated his life to. Scheffler now holds four major titles and is one win away from a career Grand Slam.</p>

          <p>At a concert in Wisconsin, Coldplay frontman Chris Martin humorously acknowledged the recent viral incident involving his "Jumbotron Song." Before performing the song, Martin jokingly advised the audience, "if you haven’t done your makeup, do your makeup now," giving them a friendly warning they might appear on the big screens. This comes after a man and woman at a previous show were identified as a tech CEO and his HR chief in an intimate moment, leading to the CEO's resignation. The band has not directly addressed the fallout, but Martin's on-stage comment served as a lighthearted nod to the controversy.</p>
