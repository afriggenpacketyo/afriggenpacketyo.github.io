          <p>The NFL's spring league meetings concluded with a failed proposal to ban the "tush push," a play successfully utilized by the Philadelphia Eagles. The Green Bay Packers' proposal to ban the play fell short of the required 75% majority, with a vote of 22-10. The Eagles, along with several other teams, voted against the ban, ensuring that the play will remain in the NFL. The "tush push," also known as "The Brotherly Shove," involves pushing the quarterback forward for short yardage, a tactic the Eagles have executed with exceptional success.</p>

Alfie believes art excuses societal objections, taking refuge in poetry and drama while grappling with repressed homosexuality in 1964 Dublin.
