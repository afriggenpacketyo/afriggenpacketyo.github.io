          <p>President Donald Trump's visit to Saudi Arabia, Qatar, and the United Arab Emirates was characterized by opulent displays and historic economic agreements. The Gulf states committed to significant investments in the U.S., including a $1.2 trillion economic exchange with Qatar and a $600 billion investment pledge from Saudi Arabia. While some question the feasibility of these figures, the visit underscored the Gulf states' desire to strengthen ties with the U.S. for business, military, and technological partnerships. The article suggests that the Gulf countries are competing with other regions, such as Europe, for closer relations with the U.S. administration, and that these economic deals are vital to increase the attractiveness of the Middle East visit.</p>

          <p>An international team of researchers has conducted an extensive genetic analysis tracing the longest human migration from Asia to the Americas.

This work, led by the GenomeAsia 100K consortium, could provide new insights into disease susceptibility and drug responses among indigenous populations.</p>
