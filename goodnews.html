          <p>President Donald Trump delivered a commencement address to West Point graduates, emphasizing a foreign policy focused on peace and partnership. Trump criticized past administrations for involving the military in nation-building endeavors, asserting his commitment to prioritizing core national interests. He praised the cadets for choosing a life of service over careers in business, highlighting the values of honor and sacrifice. Trump's speech underscored his "Golden Age" agenda and his intent to avoid what he sees as misusing the military for unintended missions, focusing instead on making peace with other countries, even those with profound differences.</p>

          <p>This article argues that the Defund movement, sparked by the murder of George Floyd, has been more successful than commonly perceived. The authors contend that the movement illuminated a new vision of community safety prioritizing care, restoration, and prevention over policing. They highlight that the movement shifted public opinion, led to increased investments in community safety, and inspired radical policy proposals. Despite setbacks like the failure of the Minneapolis ballot amendment, the authors emphasize that the movement achieved significant wins, including cuts to police budgets and increased investments in community services.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>A recent Kyodo News survey reveals that nearly 60% of Japanese citizens expect rice prices to decrease under the leadership of the new farm minister, Shinjiro Koizumi. This follows the dismissal of his predecessor due to controversial remarks about receiving gifted rice, seen as insensitive amid rising rice prices. The survey also showed that 44.7% believe rice prices should fall below 3,000 yen per 5 kilograms, a target lower than recently pledged by Prime Minister Shigeru Ishiba. The approval rating for Ishiba's Cabinet has slightly increased, though disapproval remains high.</p>

          <p>Japanese Prime Minister Shigeru Ishiba has committed to improving the treatment and working conditions of Self-Defense Forces (SDF) members, acknowledging the increasingly challenging security environment they face. Speaking at a roundtable with young personnel in Kyoto Prefecture, Ishiba emphasized the need to appropriately support SDF members as they carry out their duties, regardless of the risks. His remarks follow the enactment of a revised law that includes enhanced allowances for SDF members, addressing a shortage of recruits. This commitment comes amid efforts to boost Japan's defense capabilities in response to regional geopolitical tensions.</p>

          <p>A virologist is urging calm after West Nile virus was detected in UK mosquitoes for the first time, noting that mosquito-borne diseases are "likely" to increase in range due to climate change. Fragments of the virus were found in wetland in Retford, Nottinghamshire, but there have been no human cases of locally-acquired West Nile Virus in the UK to date. The public does not need to be "too concerned," but should be aware that these viruses are likely to increase in range. The best way to avoid the virus is to "avoid being bitten" by covering up and using insecticide.</p>

          <p>A sonic boom caused by a SpaceX Dragon capsule re-entering the atmosphere startled residents across Los Angeles late Saturday evening. The unpiloted spacecraft, returning from the International Space Station, carried approximately 6,700 pounds of crew supplies and equipment. The sonic boom is part of a growing trend for Southern Californians living near Vandenberg Space Force Base, where SpaceX launches and landings are becoming more frequent. Despite consternation from residents, military officials have rejected calls to reduce the sonic booms, as SpaceX plans to increase rocket launches from the base.</p>
