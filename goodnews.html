          <div class="timestamp">2025-09-07 08:30:08 EDT</div>
        </div>
        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Despite being a major exporter of green technology, China is increasing its coal power capacity, a move that appears contradictory to climate goals. However, this strategy serves as a crucial support system for its rapidly expanding renewable energy sector. With solar and wind power generation growing faster than the grid can sometimes handle, and hydropower being unreliable due to droughts, coal plants act as a shock absorber. This backup power ensures grid stability during peak demand, allowing for the continued, aggressive integration of renewables without risking blackouts.</p>

          <p>The online marketplace Vinted originated from co-founder Milda Mitkutė's personal need to downsize her wardrobe before moving to a smaller apartment in 2008. After discussing the idea with a friend, Justas Janauskas, they quickly launched a website for selling secondhand clothes, which rapidly gained popularity in Lithuania. The platform expanded internationally, becoming a major player in the sustainable fashion movement alongside competitors like DePop. Despite early struggles, including a near-collapse in 2016, Vinted became Lithuania's first tech unicorn in 2019 and achieved its first profit in 2023.</p>

          <p>The movement to recognize Palestinian statehood is gaining momentum, with 147 countries now officially acknowledging it. Recently, several European nations, including France, Canada, and Belgium, have announced their intention to join this consensus at the upcoming UN General Assembly, a significant shift in Western policy. This trend has been accelerated by Israel's ongoing war in Gaza, which has prompted countries like Ireland, Norway, and Spain to formally grant recognition. While the U.S. has historically blocked full UN membership for Palestine, the growing international pressure reflects widespread frustration with the stalled peace process.</p>

          <p>Following a record-breaking $1.8 billion Powerball jackpot won in Texas and Missouri, an analysis of lottery data reveals significant disparities in take-home winnings based on state taxes. While federal taxes claim about 37% of the prize, state income taxes can further reduce the payout. States like California, Florida, and Texas do not tax lottery winnings, allowing winners to keep the most money. In contrast, states with high income taxes, such as New York, result in the lowest after-tax payouts. The odds of winning the jackpot are 1 in 292.2 million. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>The South Korean government has announced a deal with the United States for the release of over 300 of its citizens who were detained during a large-scale immigration raid at a Hyundai manufacturing site in Georgia. The raid, part of the Trump administration's broader immigration enforcement actions, targeted a plant under construction for producing electric vehicle batteries. U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement detained 475 people in total. South Korea expressed "concern and regret" over the raid and plans to send a charter plane to bring the released workers home.</p>

          <p>English cricketer Jacob Bethell has expressed that he probably should have played more domestic cricket during a relatively quiet first home summer in his international career. After a promising debut Test series last winter, the 21-year-old all-rounder has had limited opportunities, missing one Test for the Indian Premier League and serving as a spare batter for much of the series against India. This lack of match time has led to questions about his management, as he has faced significantly fewer balls this summer compared to the previous year, though he acknowledges the break might also be beneficial.</p>

          <p>Hypertension, often called the "silent killer" as it typically has no symptoms, affects over half of Americans by age 40 and is a leading cause of heart disease, stroke, and dementia. New recommendations from the American Heart Association advocate for early intervention, including lifestyle changes like a low-sodium diet, exercise, and stress reduction when blood pressure exceeds 130/80 mm Hg. For readings of 140/90 or higher, medication is advised to manage the condition effectively.

          <p>Financial analysts are highlighting three high-yield dividend stocks—PepsiCo, ConocoPhillips, and Watsco—as potentially undervalued investment opportunities. The article notes that PepsiCo has attracted a significant stake from an activist investor who sees untapped potential, while ConocoPhillips' stock has dipped with energy prices despite strong free cash flow forecasts. Watsco, a leader in the HVACR market, is facing temporary market softness, which may present a buying opportunity for long-term investors.

          <p>As gold prices continue to hit new records, climbing near $3,600 an ounce, financial experts are offering guidance on how to invest in the precious metal. Gold is often seen as a safe-haven asset during times of economic uncertainty and low interest rates, and its value has risen about 35% this year. Most experts recommend gaining exposure through gold-backed exchange-traded funds (ETFs), such as SPDR Gold Shares (GLD), which are considered more liquid and cost-effective than owning physical gold. Financial advisors typically suggest limiting gold allocation to a small portion, under 3%, of a diversified investment portfolio. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>A district judge in Utah has thrown out the state's congressional map, ruling that the Republican-controlled legislature unconstitutionally overrode the will of voters who had established an independent redistricting commission. In 2018, Utah voters approved a measure to end gerrymandering, but lawmakers later gutted the commission and drew a map that heavily favored the GOP by splitting Democratic-leaning Salt Lake County. The ruling orders the legislature to draw a new, fairer map, representing a significant victory for voting rights advocates and a pushback against partisan efforts to predetermine election outcomes.</p>
