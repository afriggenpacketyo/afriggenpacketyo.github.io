          <p>Egg freezing is gaining popularity among young women as a way to preserve their fertility, offering the chance to delay motherhood and alleviate the pressure of the biological clock. While the procedure is expensive, with a single cycle costing upwards of $12,000, more companies are offering it as a covered benefit. Experts caution that egg freezing is not a guarantee and that the optimal time to have a baby is still in a woman's 20s or early 30s. There are concerns about the commercialization of fertility treatments.</p>

          <p>Egg freezing is gaining popularity among women to preserve their fertility, with procedures increasing significantly in recent years. The process involves hormone injections, egg retrieval, and storage in liquid nitrogen, with costs ranging from $12,000 to $15,000 per cycle, plus annual storage fees. While some companies offer egg freezing as a benefit, many women pay out of pocket. Younger women are increasingly choosing egg freezing, with the optimal age being in their 20s, as egg quality decreases with age.</p>

          <p>Egg freezing, a medical procedure in which a woman's eggs are harvested, frozen, and stored, is becoming increasingly popular, but it comes with significant costs. A single cycle can cost $12,000 to $15,000, with additional expenses for storage and later fertilization. While some employers offer coverage, most women pay out of pocket. The procedure does not guarantee success, and doctors recommend multiple cycles to increase the chances of having a baby.
