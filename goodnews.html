          <p>Adolfo Macias, the infamous Ecuadorian drug lord known as "Fito," has consented to be extradited to the United States to face drug and weapons trafficking charges. Macias, leader of the "Los Choneros" gang, was recaptured in June following a dramatic prison escape that plunged the nation into a wave of gang violence. His extradition marks a significant moment for Ecuador, which has been battling powerful drug cartels, and represents a major victory in President Daniel Noboa's crackdown on organized crime and lawlessness.</p>

With plans to land astronauts on the moon before 2030, China's space program is developing key hardware like the Mengzhou crew capsule and the Long March-10 moon rocket. While NASA's Artemis program technically has an earlier target for a crewed lunar landing, it faces considerable technical hurdles. The intensified competition is highlighted by increased U.S. funding for NASA, signaling a new and determined space race.</p>
