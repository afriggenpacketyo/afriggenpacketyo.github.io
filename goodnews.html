          <p>Energy management company Schneider Electric is collaborating with Nvidia to develop sustainable infrastructure for the growing artificial intelligence sector. The partnership focuses on creating advanced power and liquid cooling systems for data centers that house energy-intensive AI chips, like Nvidia's new Blackwell series. Schneider Electric's chairman, Jean-Pascal Tricoire, notes that AI itself can improve energy efficiency by four to nine times more than it consumes. This collaboration aims to create standardized data center blueprints that accelerate construction and optimize energy usage in the new era of AI-driven computing.</p>

        </div>
        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Arianna Huffington is advocating for a cultural shift away from the belief that success requires constant overwork, labeling it a "collective delusion." Drawing from her personal experience of collapsing from exhaustion in 2007, she argues that burnout is a serious health risk, not a badge of honor. As CEO of Thrive Global, Huffington promotes taking small, incremental "micro steps" to build healthier habits, such as prioritizing sleep and recharging. She emphasizes that scientific data shows people are more effective, creative, and resilient when they are well-rested, challenging the persistent fear that self-care leads to falling behind professionally.</p>

          <p>The Trump administration and Pfizer have announced an agreement for the pharmaceutical company to voluntarily lower the prices of many of its drugs in the U.S. Under the deal, Pfizer will sell existing drugs to Medicaid at the lowest price offered in other developed nations and apply similar pricing to new drugs for all payers. In exchange, Pfizer will receive a three-year exemption from potential pharmaceutical tariffs, contingent on its planned $70 billion investment in domestic manufacturing and research. The White House is also launching a website, TrumpRx.gov, to facilitate direct purchase of these discounted medications.</p>

          <p>Jamie Siminoff, the founder of Ring, has returned as CEO of the Amazon-owned video doorbell company just over a year after stepping down. He aims to restore the company's original mission of "making neighborhoods safer," now with a greater emphasis on leveraging artificial intelligence. At a recent Amazon event, Siminoff introduced new cameras and an AI feature to help find lost dogs, signaling a move back toward security applications. He reaffirmed his support for law enforcement partnerships, which have been controversial, while stating Ring will work through third-party platforms like Axon to manage police requests for footage.</p>

        </div>
        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Despite recent interest rate cuts by the Federal Reserve, it is still possible to earn significant returns through high-yield certificate of deposit (CD) accounts. The article outlines several strategies, such as depositing $24,000 into a one-year CD with a 4.20% rate or $8,200 into a three-year CD at 3.95% to yield around $1,000 in interest. As rates are expected to continue falling, savers are encouraged to act promptly to lock in current returns. This provides a stable alternative to more volatile market investments.

          <p>Nvidia's market value exceeded $4.5 trillion after its stock reached a new record high, driven by a series of major deals that solidify its central role in the AI boom. The chipmaker's recent agreements include taking a substantial equity stake in OpenAI and partnering to build massive AI data centers, a project valued at $500 billion. Additionally, cloud provider CoreWeave, in which Nvidia is a large shareholder, secured a $14.2 billion deal to supply Meta with AI infrastructure. These developments have led analysts to increase their forecasts for AI infrastructure spending, further boosting investor confidence in Nvidia.</p>

          <p>U.S. Citizenship and Immigration Services (USCIS) is planning to reopen the Deferred Action for Childhood Arrivals (DACA) program to new applicants in compliance with a court order. The program, which protects immigrants brought to the U.S. as children from deportation, has been closed to new entrants since 2021 due to legal challenges. Under the new plan, applicants outside of Texas would be eligible for work permits and deportation protections, while Texas residents would only receive deportation deferrals.

          <p>Despite facing arrests and government suppression, Russia's underground music scene has become a significant channel for anti-war sentiment and political resistance. Musicians perform banned songs in public spaces, echoing the role artists played during the final years of the Soviet Union. The Kremlin has labeled many popular artists as "foreign agents" and outlawed their music, but these actions often backfire, increasing the songs' popularity online. This growing movement offers a rare sign of hope and defiance for young Russians disheartened by the ongoing war and deepening domestic repression, showing that the spirit of protest has not been silenced.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Financial experts suggest that robo-advisors are suitable for investors in the early "accumulation phase" of building wealth, as they offer low-cost portfolio management for those with less complex financial situations. These automated platforms typically have lower fees and account minimums than human advisors. However, as an individual's financial life grows more complicated, reaching a "ceiling of complexity," the personalized and holistic services of a human financial advisor become more valuable. A human advisor can offer expertise in areas beyond basic investing, such as tax planning, insurance, and estate planning.</p>

          <p>Recent decisions by the Securities and Exchange Commission are expected to significantly increase the number of exchange-traded funds (ETFs) available to investors. The SEC's approval of generic listing standards for spot crypto ETFs will streamline the launch process for funds based on digital currencies like Solana and XRP. Separately, the agency granted approval for traditional mutual fund companies to offer their portfolios as an ETF share class, with dozens of firms expected to follow suit. These regulatory changes could open the floodgates for thousands of new investment products. (not investment advice)</p>

Organizers and researchers suggest this spiritual awakening may be a response to the isolation of the pandemic and a life inundated with technology.
