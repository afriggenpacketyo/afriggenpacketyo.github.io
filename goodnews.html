          <p>UK Prime Minister Keir Starmer has scheduled an emergency cabinet meeting to discuss a European-led peace plan and humanitarian aid for Gaza, following warnings of mass starvation. Starmer presented the plan to U.S. President Donald Trump during a meeting in Scotland, emphasizing the need for immediate relief. The move comes amid growing domestic pressure, with over 250 MPs signing a letter urging the government to recognize Palestinian statehood. The proposed plan aims to provide a pathway to a two-state solution and build on collaboration with France and Germany.</p>

          <p>Colorado Buffaloes head football coach Deion Sanders revealed he was diagnosed with high-risk bladder cancer, a fact he had kept private from his team and the public. During a press conference with his medical team, he announced that he is now considered "cancer-free" following successful treatment. The procedure involved the robotic removal of his bladder and the creation of a new one from his own intestines. Sanders became emotional while discussing his journey and expressed hope that his story would encourage others to schedule health checkups.</p>

          <p>A stone carving found at an altitude of 4,300 meters near the source of the Yellow River is being re-examined for its historical significance. According to a researcher from the Chinese Academy of Social Sciences, the inscription details a journey undertaken during the reign of Qin Shi Huang, China's first emperor. The text describes a carriage expedition to a mountain, which some believe may have been part of the emperor's legendary quest for the elixir of life. This artifact is considered the only known Qin-era carving that remains at its original site.</p>

          <p>The Israeli military has announced daily "tactical pauses" in fighting in three populated areas of Gaza to allow humanitarian aid to enter the beleaguered territory. The pauses will occur for 10 hours each day, creating secure land routes for the UN and other agencies to address a severe hunger crisis. The move follows international pressure and stark images of starving children, with food experts warning of an impending famine. While the UN welcomed the step, it reiterated that a broader ceasefire is necessary to reach everyone in need.</p>

          <p>Prime Minister Keir Starmer's recent interactions with U.S. President Donald Trump in Scotland are being viewed as providing invaluable, albeit unconventional, diplomatic face time. The visit, which included a helicopter tour of Trump's golf course and a lengthy press Q&A, allowed Starmer to directly engage with the president on key issues like Gaza and immigration. While the access is seen as a positive for the UK-US relationship, it also presents risks for Starmer, who must navigate the president's free-wheeling style. Downing Street hopes this access can help align U.S. policy with UK and European goals.</p>

          <p>Following a new state law in Texas, school districts are rolling out policies to prohibit student cell phone use during the school day. Districts are choosing different enforcement methods; for example, Corpus Christi ISD will require students to store their devices in backpacks, while Gregory-Portland ISD will use magnetically sealed pouches. The law, House Bill 1481, mandates that schools either ban personal devices from property or designate a storage method. The move aims to reduce distractions and address concerns about the impact of smartphones on the educational environment and student mental health.</p>

The suspect, Bradford Gille, has been charged with terrorism and attempted murder; all victims are expected to survive. Gille has a history of mental health issues, and authorities had a court order to place him in protective custody but could not locate him before the attack.</p>

          <p>To improve access to some of its most popular campgrounds, California State Parks is launching a new lottery-style drawing system for reservations. The system is being rolled out at select sites in Malibu Creek, Morro Bay, and McArthur-Burney Falls state parks, where campsites often sell out within minutes. Would-be campers can enter a free drawing for a chance to book a spot months in advance, with unsuccessful applicants gaining points to improve their odds in future drawings.

While the team's offense has struggled in July, preventing runs is seen as a key to their potential playoff success. Harrison Bader of the Minnesota Twins has emerged as a prime target; he is a premium defender who is also having a solid offensive season. The move would address defensive weaknesses and could be more impactful than simply adding another bat to a lineup of underperforming superstars.</p>
