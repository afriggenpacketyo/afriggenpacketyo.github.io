          <p>This article explores how Estonians are actively preparing for a potential Russian invasion, highlighting a deep-rooted culture of self-defense and community resilience. It features Ave Ungro, a member of the Women's Voluntary Defense Organization, who trains in military skills and first aid to protect her country. Estonia, a NATO and EU member, is significantly increasing its defense spending to 5.4% of GDP by 2029, a record among NATO states, to bolster its defenses. While not fearing a direct invasion, the country is concerned about ongoing Russian sabotage, such as GPS jamming. The article emphasizes Estonia's strong alliances and advanced military technology as crucial deterrents.</p>

          <p>This article highlights a significant surge in French citizens joining military reserves, driven by growing fears of war in Europe and concerns about an aggressive Russia and potential U.S. unreliability under Donald Trump. France aims to more than double its reservist numbers to 105,000 by 2035, alongside President Macron's plans to sharply boost military investment to €64 billion by 2027. Trainees, from students to engineers, undergo rigorous training, motivated by a desire to protect their country and a realization that peaceful times may be ending. This trend mirrors broader European efforts to enhance defense capabilities and reinforce the link between generations and the military.</p>

          <p>This article reports on a call from disability charity Disabled Motoring UK for all UK airports to waive drop-off fees for blue badge holders. The charity argues that the current system is inconsistent and complex, with many airports still charging disabled passengers for close-to-terminal drop-offs, sometimes as high as £7. While some airports offer discounts or exemptions, others require complex online registration or charge full fees, causing frustration and inconvenience. This article highlights the need for standardized, respectful treatment of disabled customers and greater accessibility at airports across the country.</p>
