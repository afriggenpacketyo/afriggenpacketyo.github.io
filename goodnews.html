          <p>President Trump is expected to announce a "comprehensive" trade agreement with the United Kingdom, marking the first such deal since imposing tariffs on numerous trading partners. The agreement aims to strengthen the relationship between the two nations, with details expected to be revealed at 10 a.m. from the Oval Office. A senior British official confirmed the deal, stating it would benefit both countries, although specifics remain unclear.  The agreement is anticipated to address British tariffs on U.S. cars and farm goods, as well as taxes on U.S. technology companies, while trade experts suggest it may be a preliminary framework for future negotiations rather than a finalized agreement.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>President Donald Trump announced that the U.S. has struck a "comprehensive" trade deal with the United Kingdom, making it the first country to do so after the U.S. imposed "reciprocal" tariffs in April. The announcement was made via a post on Truth Social, where Trump stated the agreement would solidify the relationship between the two countries for many years.  While the U.K. government acknowledged ongoing talks, they refrained from commenting on specific details.  The deal comes after Vice President JD Vance indicated the U.K. had a "good chance" of securing a trade agreement with the U.S., though Trump had previously downplayed the necessity of such deals.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>The United States and Britain are expected to announce a trade deal that will reduce the impact of President Trump's tariffs and potentially provide a political boost for Prime Minister Keir Starmer.  Trump announced the impending deal on social media, emphasizing its comprehensive nature and long-term benefits for both nations.  The agreement aims to lower or eliminate U.S. import taxes on U.K. cars and steel, while the U.S. seeks greater access to the British market for agricultural products.  The deal is seen as a vindication of Starmer's approach to Trump and could ease pressure on U.K. businesses.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>This article explores the science behind mRNA vaccines, addressing their mechanism, safety, and potential applications beyond infectious diseases.  mRNA vaccines, like those for COVID-19 and RSV, use messenger RNA to instruct cells to produce viral proteins, triggering an immune response. The article clarifies that mRNA cannot alter DNA and that these vaccines have undergone extensive safety monitoring.  Researchers are also exploring mRNA technology for treating cancer, cardiovascular disease, autoimmune disorders, and rare genetic conditions like cystic fibrosis, offering hope for new therapies where traditional methods have fallen short.</p>

        </div>
        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>The US and UK are expected to announce a deal to reduce tariffs, likely involving exemptions or lowering tariffs on specific goods rather than a comprehensive trade agreement. Cars are a key focus, with potential reductions to the 25% import tax on cars and car parts or a quota system. Steel and aluminum tariffs are also under discussion, with the UK seeking a reduction or removal of the 25% tariff, which impacts various products.  The agreement's impact on pharmaceuticals is uncertain, while the UK may consider lowering its digital services tax on US firms in exchange for lower tariffs on exports.</p>

          <p>Coleen Rooney has expressed her relief after the final part of her legal battle with Rebekah Vardy concluded, stating she looks forward to moving on with her life.  A judge ruled that Mrs. Vardy must pay over ¬£1.4 million of Mrs. Rooney's legal costs following the "Wagatha Christie" libel trial, which Rooney won in 2022. Rooney stated that the claim did not need to be made or run for as long as it did, and thanked her legal team, family, and the public for their support. The legal battle stemmed from Rooney's accusation that Vardy's Instagram account leaked private information to the press.</p>

          <p>A columnist humorously suggests reopening Alcatraz as a prison for ruthless offenders, praising Trump's idea and expanding on it with satirical proposals for other California landmarks.  These suggestions include transforming Great America theme park into "Make America Great Again," turning the Oakland Coliseum into a venue for reenactments of the January 6th Capitol attack, and converting Hearst Castle into the Western White House. The author's satirical approach highlights the absurdity of certain political ideas and the potential for repurposing existing resources in unconventional ways.</p>
