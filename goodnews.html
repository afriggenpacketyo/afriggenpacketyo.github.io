          <p>Maurene Comey, a former prosecutor for the Southern District of New York and the daughter of former FBI Director James B. Comey, has filed a lawsuit alleging her termination was politically motivated. The suit claims her firing was an unconstitutional act by the Trump administration, done without cause or due process, likely because of her father's contentious relationship with the former president. Comey, who handled high-profile cases involving figures like Jeffrey Epstein and Sean Combs, argues that career federal prosecutors should be shielded from political influence. She is seeking reinstatement to her position along with back pay, asserting that her removal undermines the principles of an independent justice system.</p>

In just five weeks, the station hired 50 staff members, including local talent returning to their hometown, to build the operation from the ground up. The venture is described as having a startup's entrepreneurial energy but with the established journalistic credibility and backing of the CBS News network. The team aims to deliver community-focused journalism, beginning with 6 p.m. and 11 p.m. newscasts, with plans to expand to a morning show in the future.</p>

          <p>On his show, Jim Cramer noted the S&P 500 reaching an all-time high, buoyed by positive news on U.S.-China trade talks and anticipation of a Federal Reserve interest rate cut. He addressed China's antitrust accusations against Nvidia, expressing little concern and viewing the move as politically motivated amidst broader trade negotiations. Cramer strongly endorsed buying shares in Boeing, urging investors to "pound the table" on the stock despite recent price drops related to certification delays for its 777X jet. He views the decline as a prime opportunity to increase holdings in the aircraft manufacturer. (not investment advice)</p>

Describing himself as "just a mixed-race kid from a block of flats in a place called Kirkby," Graham expressed his profound humility and disbelief at receiving such an honor from his peers. He paid tribute to his family, particularly his wife Hannah Walters, whom he called his "rock" and "soulmate," stating that without her, he would be dead. The win marks a significant career milestone for the acclaimed actor, known for his powerful performances in productions like "This Is England."</p>

          <div class="timestamp">2025-09-15 12:05:29 EDT</div>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>The U.S. and China have agreed to a "framework" deal concerning the American operations of TikTok, according to U.S. Treasury Secretary Scott Bessent. The agreement, reached during trade talks in Madrid, is intended to pave the way for U.S. ownership of the popular social media app and will be finalized by Presidents Donald Trump and Xi Jinping. This development comes ahead of a looming deadline for TikTok's parent company, ByteDance, to sell its U.S. division or face a nationwide ban due to national security concerns. While details are pending, the move signals a potential resolution to the long-standing dispute over the platform's control and data security.</p>

          <p>Alphabet, the parent company of Google, has become the fourth company to achieve a market capitalization of $3 trillion, following in the footsteps of Nvidia, Microsoft, and Apple. The company's stock surged over 4% after a recent antitrust ruling delivered lighter-than-feared penalties, avoiding a forced divestiture of its Chrome browser. This milestone comes as Alphabet navigates intense competition in the artificial intelligence sector and persistent regulatory scrutiny in both the U.S. and Europe. The stock has gained more than 30% this year, significantly outperforming the broader Nasdaq index. (not investment advice)</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>President Donald Trump has suggested that publicly traded companies should move from quarterly to semiannual earnings reports, a change he argues would save money and encourage a focus on long-term strategy over short-term profits. In a social media post, he stated the idea is subject to approval by the Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) and contrasted the U.S. short-term focus with China's longer-term view. This revives a proposal from his first term, which aligns with arguments from figures like Warren Buffett and Jamie Dimon against quarterly guidance. Critics of the proposal, however, maintain that quarterly reporting is essential for investor transparency and market stability. (not investment advice)</p>

          <h2>Analysis Reveals Renewable Energy as Most Cost-Effective Power Source</h2>
          <div class="timestamp">2025-09-15 11:52:00 EDT</div>
        </div>
        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>A CBS News analysis, using the Levelized Cost of Energy (LCOE) benchmark, has determined that renewable sources like onshore wind and utility-scale solar are the cheapest forms of energy to produce. Even without government subsidies, renewables outperform more expensive fossil fuels like coal and natural gas, as well as nuclear power. The report notes that while the Trump administration is phasing out clean energy incentives and promoting fossil fuels, the fundamental economics favor renewables due to their low operating costs once built. However, experts caution that a diverse energy mix is necessary to ensure grid reliability, as the intermittent nature of wind and solar requires backup power sources. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>The Federal Reserve is widely anticipated to cut its benchmark interest rate for the first time since 2024, offering potential relief for consumers with high-interest debt. Although a single small cut won't drastically lower rates on credit cards, which average over 20%, it signals a shift in monetary policy. Financial experts advise consumers to act now by paying down variable-rate debt, locking in high yields on savings accounts and CDs before rates fall, and improving their credit scores to qualify for better loan terms. For the housing market, lower rates could also help unfreeze sales by making mortgages more affordable for prospective buyers. (not investment advice)</p>
