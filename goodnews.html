          <p>D. Wayne Lukas, a towering figure in horse racing, has passed away at the age of 89. Known for his 15 Triple Crown race victories and a record-tying 20 Breeders' Cup wins, Lukas was a Hall of Famer who transformed the sport. His family and colleagues remembered him as a mentor who brought "heart, grace, and grit" to horse racing, continuing to work from his pony in the early mornings even in his late 80s.

          <p>Warren Schaeffer, the interim manager for the Colorado Rockies, was ejected from a game for the first time in his managerial career after a vehement argument with the home plate umpire. The confrontation occurred after umpire Ramon De Jesus called a third strike on outfielder Tyler Freeman, prompting Schaeffer to storm the field, spike his hat, and get into a face-to-face dispute. Despite the team's poor season record, the passionate display appeared to energize the players, who went on to secure a 4-3 extra-innings victory against the Milwaukee Brewers.</p>

          <p>Vin Diesel has announced that the final installment of the "Fast & Furious" franchise could feature the return of Brian O'Conner, the character played by the late Paul Walker. Speaking at an automotive event, Diesel stated he made the character's return one of his conditions for the finale, which is planned for an April 2027 release. Walker passed away in 2013 during the production of "Furious 7," which used a combination of archival footage, digital effects, and his brothers as stand-ins to complete his scenes.

          <p>A controversial provision to mandate the sale of hundreds of thousands of acres of public land in the West has been removed from the Republican tax and spending bill following strong bipartisan backlash. The measure, championed by Senator Mike Lee, was intended to raise funds and address housing affordability but drew criticism from fellow Republicans, conservation groups, and recreation advocates. Lee stated he withdrew the proposal due to an inability to secure safeguards preventing the land from being sold to foreign interests or large corporations. Conservationists celebrated the move as a victory but remain vigilant against future threats.</p>

          <p>Seed oils, such as canola, soybean, and sunflower oil, have become a subject of intense health debate, with some public figures labeling them as harmful "poisons." These oils are high in polyunsaturated fats, particularly omega-6 fatty acids, which has led to concerns about inflammation. However, many nutrition researchers and major health organizations maintain that the evidence does not support these claims. They argue that when substituted for saturated fats, these oils can actually be beneficial for heart health, and the controversy is largely fueled by online influencers rather than robust scientific data.</p>
