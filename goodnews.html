          <p>A mobile prison is visiting schools in the U.K. to educate students about the realities of life behind bars and the consequences of crime. The interactive experience, which includes scanned, photographed, and fingerprinted students dressed in inmate attire, aims to deter them from engaging in criminal behavior. Students are taken into replica cells complete with stainless-steel toilets to make the experience as realistic as possible, sparking tough conversations about drugs, alcohol, and violence. Organizers emphasize that this project is not a scare tactic, but rather an informational initiative to help young people make informed choices and understand their responsibilities, especially since children as young as 10 can be arrested in the U.K.</p>

          <p>Hawaii's Kilauea volcano has resumed its sporadic eruption, sending lava hundreds of feet into the air and releasing plumes of ash and volcanic material. The activity, which lasted for several hours, featured lava fountains reaching heights of over 1,000 feet from the mountain's north vent. An eruptive plume containing ash, volcanic rock, and Pele's hair was also released, posing a potential hazard to residents and visitors in the area. Kilauea, one of Hawaii's most active volcanoes, has been emitting lava fountains frequently since December 2024, drawing tourists to witness the spectacle, and the USGS also offers multiple YouTube livestreams of the volcanic activity.</p>

Lauren Bell's game-changing wicket of Matthews, who scored 71 from 54 balls, contributed to England's victory, while Heather Knight's unbeaten 66 from 47 balls helped England post a competitive total, and Knight suffered a hamstring problem during her knock.</p>

          <p>King Charles and Queen Camilla have arrived in Canada for a two-day visit, interpreted as a show of support for the country amidst ongoing tensions with the U.S. and President Donald Trump. Prime Minister Mark Carney, who campaigned on an anti-Trump platform, welcomed the royal couple in Ottawa. The King's visit will culminate in a "Speech from the Throne" to Canada's Parliament, the first by a monarch in nearly 50 years, expected to affirm Canada's sovereignty and reject Trump's suggestions of a U.S. takeover. This visit is viewed as a diplomatic balancing act, as King Charles also maintains relations with the U.S. as head of state of the UK.</p>

          <p>EU leaders are expressing optimism for a swift resolution to the trade war with the US after President Donald Trump postponed the threatened 50% tariffs on the bloc until July 9. The delay follows a conversation between Trump and Ursula von der Leyen, who agreed to expedite trade negotiations. While Emmanuel Macron expressed hope for minimal tariffs, Giorgia Meloni is reportedly seeking a meeting between Trump and European leaders. The EU's offer to eliminate tariffs on cars and industrial goods remains on the table, but Trump's on-again, off-again tariff threats have created uncertainty for businesses.

Mayor Eduardo Paes's decree outlaws food and drink sales, chair rentals, loudspeakers, and live music in kiosks without official permits, while also restricting beach huts to numbered names. While some welcome the move, others fear it will stifle Rio's vibrant beach culture and affect the livelihoods of musicians and vendors, and the restrictions on music are particularly contentious, with concerns raised about silencing the soul of the waterfront.</p>

          <p>A German man, Tom Kopke, has won the Cooper's Hill Cheese-Rolling race in Gloucestershire, England, for the second consecutive year. Kopke competed against others who tumbled and rolled down a steep grassy slope to claim the 3.6-kilogram Double Gloucester cheese, and the dry weather made the incline more treacherous than usual. The women's race was won by Ava Sender Logan, running in support of the Refugee Community Kitchen, and the races date back centuries and have become a global curiosity.</p>
