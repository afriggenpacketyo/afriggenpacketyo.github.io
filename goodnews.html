          <h2>Iran Unlikely to Block Strait of Hormuz Despite Tensions with Israel</h2>
          <div class="timestamp">2025-06-13 07:55:24 EDT</div>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Despite heightened tensions following Israeli strikes on Iran, experts believe it's unlikely that Tehran will block the Strait of Hormuz, a critical oil artery, as retaliation. The Strait sees about 20 million barrels of oil pass through daily, representing nearly one-fifth of global oil shipments, but disrupting this flow could harm Iran's interests, especially its relationship with China, its largest oil importer. Analysts note that closing the Strait is likely physically impossible and would trigger further retaliation, as well as potentially impacting Iran's own access to goods. While attacks on tankers are possible, a full-scale blockade is considered unlikely due to the presence of the US Fifth Fleet.</p>

          <p>Bhoomi Chauhan, a business administration student, narrowly missed the ill-fated Air India flight AI171 to London Gatwick due to heavy traffic that caused her to arrive at Ahmedabad airport just 10 minutes late.

Chauhan described her survival as a "miracle" after learning of the tragic fate of the flight she was supposed to be on.</p>

          <p>Summer Fridays, once a popular workplace perk, are becoming increasingly rare as companies shift towards more flexible work arrangements, such as work-from-home Fridays. While employees value summer Fridays highly, as they offer a chance to prevent burnout and boost morale, most workers are not offered any summer-specific benefits. As hybrid work schedules become more prevalent, fewer employees are commuting on Fridays, leading some companies to phase out the traditional summer Friday policy. However, a survey indicates that workers still appreciate the opportunity for a shortened workweek during the summer months.</p>

          <p>Rare earth elements (REEs), a group of 17 chemical elements, play a crucial role in modern technology, including smartphones, electric vehicles, and defense systems. These elements are essential for manufacturing permanent magnets, which are vital for electric vehicles and wind turbines, and are also used in fighter jets and submarines. China dominates the mining and processing of REEs, controlling 70% of global production, leading Western nations to seek alternative sources and develop domestic supply chains. The EU and the US are investing in internal supplies and strategic projects to ensure access to these critical materials, with Ukraine and Greenland being potential areas of interest.</p>

          <p>Sir Geoff Palmer, Scotland's first black professor and chancellor emeritus at Heriot-Watt University, has died at the age of 85, leaving behind a legacy as an academic and human rights advocate. Born in Jamaica, Sir Geoff moved to the UK as a teenager and became known for his work in grain science and technology, including inventing the barley abrasion process. Tributes poured in from political figures and colleagues, recognizing his significant impact on Scotland and his contributions to justice and equality. His academic achievements earned him the American Society of Brewing Chemists Award of Distinction, while his later work included leading Edinburgh's Slavery and Colonialism Legacy Review Group.</p>

          <p>Chinese scientists have achieved a significant breakthrough in extracting rubidium directly from salt lake brine on a commercial scale, potentially reducing China's reliance on imports, primarily from Canada. This new industrial-scale method produces ultra-pure rubidium chloride from ultra-low concentrations, offering a new domestic source for this strategically vital material. Rubidium, used in electronics, specialty glass, and aerospace, has extensive military, technological, and civilian applications, including improving the performance of perovskite solar cells and in ultra-precise atomic clocks.</p>

The experiment aimed to understand how to manage AI and integrate it into journalism, with the newspaper now planning to embrace AI-written content permanently in a weekly section. While the AI work is transparent, other publications have been less forthcoming about their use of AI, leading to issues like errors and fabrications. The editor of Il Foglio believes AI should augment, not replace, human intelligence in journalism.</p>
