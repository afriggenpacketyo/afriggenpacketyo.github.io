          <h2>Uber's Revenue Falls Short of Expectations Despite Increase in Trips</h2>

          <p>Uber's first-quarter results for 2025 revealed that while earnings per share exceeded expectations, revenue fell slightly short of anticipated growth. The ride-sharing company reported a 14% increase in revenue compared to the same period last year, along with a net income increase from a net loss in the first quarter of 2024. Key segments such as mobility and delivery saw bookings increase year-over-year, and the number of monthly active platform consumers grew by 14% to 170 million. Uber CEO Dara Khosrowshahi highlighted autonomous vehicles as the single greatest opportunity for the company, noting that Uber has reached an annual run-rate of 1.5 million autonomous vehicle trips.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>The UK government has lowered the minimum age to become a train driver from 20 to 18 in an effort to address driver shortages that frequently disrupt rail services. Transport Secretary Heidi Alexander called the change a bold action to improve train services and unlock thousands of jobs, with the Rail Safety and Standards Board affirming that 18-year-olds are capable of safely becoming train drivers. This initiative aims to attract school or college leavers into the profession as a growing number of drivers are set to retire by 2029, while also addressing the underrepresentation of women and ethnic minorities in the field. Training to become a mainline train driver typically takes one to two years, and the government believes new jobs and apprenticeships could become available as early as December.</p>

          <p>Uber CEO Dara Khosrowshahi addressed employee concerns at an all-hands meeting after the company announced it would increase in-office requirements and change employee benefits. The company is now requiring employees to come into the office three days a week, up from two, and has raised the eligibility requirement for its month-long paid sabbatical benefit. Khosrowshahi defended the policy changes, stating that being in person more frequently is better for collaboration, innovation, and company culture. He said the changes were not related to cost cutting or planned layoffs, but rather to ensure Uber remains a high-performing company. The CEO acknowledged that the changes may be unpopular but emphasized their importance for the company's overall success.</p>

          <p>Former President Donald Trump has offered to assist with the development of the Obama Presidential Center in Chicago, citing significant cost overruns and delays. Trump linked the project's problems to its embrace of diversity, equity, and inclusion (DEI) policies, claiming that prioritizing DEI over meritocracy has led to construction issues. The Obama Foundation, however, stated that Trump's remarks were not based in facts and that the center is not involved in the lawsuit, nor did it delay the timeline of the facility which is set to open in 2026. The foundation emphasized that the project is being funded privately and will serve as an economic engine for Chicago.</p>

        </div>
        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Chinese scientists have discovered genetic secrets in the roots of upland rice that are linked to drought resistance, potentially transforming widely cultivated irrigated rice into drought-tolerant varieties. They have identified a gene, HMGB1, that obstructs the development of deeper, thicker roots in upland rice, which are crucial for drought resistance. By removing this gene, irrigated rice developed longer roots and greater drought tolerance, similar to upland rice, enabling it to thrive in water-scarce environments. The findings, published in Molecular Plant, could significantly improve food security in regions facing water scarcity.</p>

The deal includes an exemption on national insurance contributions (Nics) from one to three years for people on short-term visas. Business Secretary Jonathan Reynolds asserts the deal will not impact British workers, pointing to existing agreements preventing double taxation. Opposition parties argue the exemption could make Indian workers cheaper to employ, but Reynolds insists Indian workers will still pay the NHS immigration surcharge and not be eligible for National Insurance benefits. The deal aims to boost trade between the UK and India, particularly benefiting the Scotch whisky industry.</p>

Despite advancements in machine learning, AI's limitations in quantitative thinking, logical reasoning, and web research hinder its ability to accurately predict world events. However, the gap between AI and human forecasters is narrowing, and AI's ability to analyze vast amounts of data and avoid cognitive biases could eventually make it a valuable tool for prediction. As AI models improve, they could transform various fields by providing more accurate and timely forecasts, although trust and adoption by decision-makers remain challenges.</p>
