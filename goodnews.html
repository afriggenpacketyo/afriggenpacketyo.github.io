          <p>The European Commission has unveiled a proposed €2 trillion, seven-year budget that significantly boosts defense and space investment to €131 billion, a fivefold increase from current levels. The plan, which requires unanimous approval from member states, aims to address modern geopolitical realities while also dedicating 35% of funds to climate and biodiversity projects. To finance the budget without increasing member contributions, the EU is looking to new revenue streams, including duties on e-waste and tobacco. The proposal also includes €100 billion in support for Ukraine and increased funding for migration management. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>Nvidia CEO Jensen Huang has sold another 225,000 shares of the company's stock, valued at approximately $37 million, as part of a pre-arranged trading plan established in March. This is the latest in a series of sales that have seen Huang unload about 1.2 million shares for around $190 million this year. The transactions come as Nvidia's stock has surged, briefly making it the world's most valuable company due to high demand for its AI chips. The company also announced plans to resume sales of its H20 chips to China following indications of U.S. government approval. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>A 54-pound meteorite, confirmed to be the largest piece of Mars ever found on Earth, has been sold at a Sotheby's auction for nearly $5.3 million. The rock, designated NWA 16788, was discovered in Niger's Sahara Desert in 2023 after traveling an estimated 140 million miles through space. This meteorite is exceptionally rare, representing about 6.5% of all known Martian material on our planet. Scientists and collectors value such specimens for the invaluable data they provide about the red planet, offering insights into its geological history and composition.</p>

          <p>Theatricum Botanicum's current season features two classic plays reset in American history: Anton Chekhov's "The Seagull" and John Galsworthy's "Strife." "The Seagull: Malibu" transposes the drama to the 1970s "Me Generation," creating a groovy, if sometimes inconsistent, parallel to the original's ennui. "Strife," a 1909 play about a labor dispute, is moved to 1890s Pennsylvania, exploring the human cost of a standoff between capital and labor. While the review notes some uneven acting, it praises the productions for their ambitious vision and the unique experience of seeing these works in an outdoor setting.</p>
