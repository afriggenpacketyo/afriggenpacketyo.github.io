          <p>A federal judge has temporarily halted the Trump administration's plans to restructure government agencies and cut tens of thousands of federal jobs, stating that the overhaul was not authorized by Congress. The judge sided with unions, non-profits, and local governments who filed a lawsuit, imposing a 14-day pause on the layoffs. The ruling emphasizes that while the President can seek changes to executive branch agencies, it must be done lawfully and with Congressional approval. The administration's plans, led by Elon Musk and the Department of Government Efficiency (DOGE), aimed to eliminate duplicate roles and automate tasks.</p>

          <p>Arab countries anticipate increased economic engagement with the U.S. during President Trump's visit, while the focus remains on promoting regional security cooperation, potentially overshadowing progress on the Gaza conflict. Saudi Arabia, Qatar, and the UAE seek U.S. investments in various sectors, including defense, artificial intelligence, and technology. Saudi Arabia is pursuing partnerships with American firms and has offered $600 billion in trade and investment over four years, while the UAE plans to invest $1.4 trillion in the U.S. over the next decade. Analysts suggest Trump's "big announcement" could involve Hamas hostages, a potential U.S.-Iran nuclear deal, or the Houthi militia in Yemen.</p>

          <p>Japan's former Emperor Akihito was discharged from a Tokyo hospital after undergoing medical tests for myocardial ischemia, a heart condition involving reduced blood flow to the heart muscle. Although the 91-year-old showed no symptoms, he will require careful follow-up care. He was admitted to the hospital after an earlier checkup detected signs of the condition. Akihito previously received treatment for heart failure in 2022 and abdicated from the Chrysanthemum Throne in April 2019, marking the first abdication by a Japanese monarch in around 200 years.</p>

          <p>Kosmos-482, a robotic Soviet spacecraft launched in 1972 with the intention of landing on Venus, is expected to re-enter Earth‚Äôs atmosphere. Due to a rocket malfunction, it has been adrift in space for 53 years. The spacecraft, weighing roughly 1,050 pounds and cloaked in a protective heat shield, was designed to survive a plunge through the Venusian atmosphere, meaning it has a good chance of surviving re-entry into Earth's atmosphere. While the exact landing location is unknown, its orbit places it between 52 degrees north and 52 degrees south latitude.</p>

While the UK's Digital Services Tax was discussed, it was not abolished as part of the deal.

However, uncertainties remain regarding products shipped to the United States via the European Union.

          <p>A federal judge has temporarily blocked the Trump administration from carrying out sweeping cuts and layoffs at over a dozen government agencies, citing that the moves exceeded legal authority. The judge ruled that the plaintiffs, a group of federal employee unions, are likely to show that the administration's attempts to reorganize and downsize the federal government are unlawful. The restraining order affects 20 federal agencies, including OMB, SSA, and the departments of State, Treasury, and Veterans Affairs. This halts the administration's efforts to cut bureaucratic bloat, which federal unions and Democratic lawmakers view as disruptive to public services.</p>
