          <p>An in-depth look at Luka Doncic portrays him as the talented but polarizing heart of Slovenia's national basketball team and a superstar in the NBA. The article details his exceptional offensive skills, which earned him Rookie of the Year and numerous accolades, while also noting criticisms regarding his defensive efforts, fitness, and frequent arguments with officials. It also covers his controversial trade from the Dallas Mavericks to the Los Angeles Lakers, a move that shocked the league but has seemingly provided him with renewed motivation as he leads his country in the EuroBasket tournament.</p>

          <p>Shares for Inditex, the parent company of Zara, surged after it reported a significant year-on-year sales jump for its new Autumn/Winter collections, reassuring investors despite weaker-than-expected second-quarter results. The company stated that its latest clothing lines have been very well received by customers, leading to a 9% increase in constant currency sales in the early part of the third quarter. This positive momentum has bolstered market confidence in the fast-fashion giant's performance and strategy moving forward. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>A research team from the Chinese University of Hong Kong has developed an artificial intelligence system that automates a robotic arm to function as a third hand for surgeons during operations. This innovation is designed to handle routine tasks such as retracting tissue and clipping blood vessels, allowing the human surgeon to focus on more complex aspects of the procedure. The technology aims to alleviate the strain on surgeons and potentially reduce long wait times for operations, which are growing due to aging populations and increasing clinical demand for medical procedures.</p>

          <p>A new exhibition titled "Wohnkomplex: Art and Life in Plattenbau" at Das Minsk museum in Potsdam is exploring the complex cultural legacy of East Germany's prefabricated concrete slab apartment buildings. These structures, once promoted as a socialist utopian solution to housing shortages, became symbols of societal transformation and distress after German reunification, associated with unemployment and rising extremism. The exhibition uses art to delve into the collective memory of the Plattenbau, viewing it not just as architectural heritage but as a space that raises questions about community, belonging, and memory.</p>

          <p>Despite a poor run of results with only two Premier League wins since April, underlying statistics suggest that Manchester United's performances under manager Ruben Amorim have been improving. The team ranks highest in the league for shots taken and near the lowest for shots faced in their last ten games, indicating dominance in chance creation and restriction. However, the club has severely underperformed in converting its chances and preventing goals, suggesting that issues with player efficiency and confidence, rather than tactical failure, are the primary cause of their low point tally.</p>
