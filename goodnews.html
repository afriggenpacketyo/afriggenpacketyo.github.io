          <p>In an economy marked by inflation, certificates of deposit (CDs) offer a way for savers to protect their purchasing power, with many top accounts currently providing returns that exceed the inflation rate. This article provides an overview of current national average CD yields for various terms, such as 1.99% APY for a one-year CD, while also listing higher rates available from specific online banks. To secure the best rates, consumers are advised to explore online banking options and consider short-term CDs, which presently offer higher yields due to an inverted yield curve.

          <p>For homeowners, tapping into home equity through a loan or line of credit (HELOC) remains an affordable borrowing option compared to personal loans or credit cards. As of early October 2025, the average interest rate for a 10-year home equity loan is 8.36%, while the average HELOC rate is 7.89%. These products offer significantly lower rates than alternatives and may provide tax benefits if used for eligible home renovations. However, since the home serves as collateral, it is crucial for borrowers to carefully consider the terms. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>Despite a challenging housing market, prospective homebuyers and those looking to refinance can still find viable options. As of October 6, 2025, the national average interest rate for a 30-year fixed mortgage is 6.34%, while a 15-year fixed mortgage averages 5.64%. To secure the best possible rates, experts advise strengthening one's credit profile, paying bills on time, and comparing offers from multiple lenders. A potential pause in Federal Reserve rate hikes could also bring further relief to borrowers in the near future. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>In the second quarter of 2025, real estate investors purchased one-third of all single-family homes sold in the U.S., the highest proportion in five years, according to a report from CJ Patrick Co. Although the total number of homes bought by investors decreased compared to last year, their market share grew due to an overall slowdown in home sales. Small investors, owning ten or fewer properties, continue to dominate the market, while large institutional investors have been selling more homes than they buy, potentially reducing competition for traditional homebuyers.

          <p>Alternative asset manager Ares Management has increased its three-year fundraising targets by 25%, driven by unexpectedly strong momentum from individual wealthy investors. CEO Michael Arougheti noted that this "retail revolution" is a significant shift, with individual investors seeking diversification away from increasingly concentrated public markets. The firm, which already manages over $50 billion in retail-targeted vehicles, is expanding its product development and client education to serve this growing segment, allocating high-quality deals to both its institutional and wealth management platforms.

          <p>The World Trade Organization has increased its forecast for global trade volume growth in 2025 to 2.4%, up from a previous estimate of 0.9%. This optimistic revision is attributed to strong demand for AI-related goods, front-loading of U.S. imports ahead of tariffs, and favorable macroeconomic conditions. However, the outlook for 2026 has been sharply downgraded to just 0.5% growth, as the WTO anticipates a cooling global economy and the full impact of higher trade tariffs. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>Two-time Olympic gold medalist Caster Semenya has clarified that her legal challenge against World Athletics' sex eligibility rules is not finished, despite recent reports suggesting otherwise. Speaking to DW, the South African athlete stated, "It's not the end, it's just the beginning," and that her legal team is still finalizing its next steps. Semenya, who has a difference of sexual development (DSD), has been in a years-long battle against regulations requiring her to medically lower her natural testosterone levels to compete in the female category, arguing the rules are discriminatory.</p>

          <p>Qualcomm has announced its acquisition of Arduino, an Italian company known for its inexpensive programmable circuit boards widely used by hobbyists, startups, and researchers for prototyping robots and other hardware. The deal aims to give Qualcomm a direct line to the grassroots level of the robotics industry, hoping to build loyalty among developers who may eventually scale their projects into commercial products. Arduino will operate as an independent subsidiary, and for the first time, will release a board featuring a Qualcomm processor, making advanced AI capabilities more accessible to developers.</p>

          <p>The Nobel Prize in Physics has been awarded to John Clarke, Michel H. Devoret, and John M. Martinis for their pioneering experiments in quantum mechanics that have become the basis for modern quantum computers. Their work in the 1980s demonstrated that quantum phenomena, such as "tunneling," could be reproduced in macroscopic electrical circuits, not just in the sub-atomic world. This breakthrough laid the foundation for the development of superconducting qubits, which are the primary hardware components used in today's most advanced quantum technologies. The laureates will share the prize money of 11 million Swedish kronor.</p>

          <p>The Pentagon is set to select a defense contractor to design and build the U.S. Navy's next-generation stealth fighter, known as the F/A-XX. The multi-billion dollar program, which will replace the aging F/A-18 Super Hornet fleet, is a competition between Boeing and Northrop Grumman. The decision to proceed comes after months of delays caused by a funding dispute between the Pentagon and Congress, which ultimately allocated additional funds to accelerate the program. This new carrier-based jet is considered crucial for countering potential threats from China in the coming decades.</p>

          <p>For the first time in history, renewable energy sources generated more electricity globally than coal during the first six months of 2025, according to a report by the energy think tank Ember. This milestone is described as a crucial turning point, with solar and wind power now expanding quickly enough to meet the world's increasing electricity demand. The shift was primarily driven by strong renewables growth in China and India, which led to a reduction in their fossil fuel consumption. This trend signals the beginning of an era where clean energy growth outpaces overall demand growth.</p>

Inspired by her own frustrating experience as a new mother, Modi launched Bobbie in 2018 to offer a higher-quality, subscription-based product and to change the culture surrounding formula feeding. The company, which recently introduced the first USDA Organic Whole Milk formula made in the U.S., has grown rapidly, particularly after a 2022 nationwide shortage highlighted the risks of the concentrated market.

Despite this growth, AI still trails far behind traditional methods like general internet searches and recommendations from friends and family. The travel industry views the increasing use of consumer-facing AI as both a challenge to existing business models and an opportunity for innovation.</p>
