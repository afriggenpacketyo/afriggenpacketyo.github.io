          <h2>New Study Suggests China's Tibetan Dam May Increase India's Dry-Season Water Supply</h2>
          <div class="timestamp">2025-07-13 00:00:09 EDT</div>
        </div>
        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>A new scientific study indicates that China's controversial mega-dam project in Tibet might not cause the water crisis in India that many feared. By analyzing data from two existing upstream dams, researchers found that water flows downstream during the dry season have actually increased. Specifically, low flows in February were up by over 50%, suggesting the dams help regulate water levels by storing it during wet seasons and releasing it during dry periods. This outcome counters widespread concerns in India about potential droughts resulting from the dam's construction.</p>

          <p>As the global space economy is projected to reach $1.8 trillion by 2035, China is significantly increasing its focus on private investment in the aerospace industry. This shift is driven by technological advancements and state support, with private investment expected to constitute 45% of the sector's total by 2025. Successful private Chinese companies like i-Space and LandSpace are already making significant strides with orbital rocket launches. Hong Kong, with its unique financial and international standing, is well-positioned to become a crucial hub for financing and supporting this burgeoning commercial space sector in mainland China.

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Several start-ups, including UK-based Better Dairy, are pioneering the production of lab-grown cheese that aims to replicate the taste and texture of traditional dairy products. The process involves using genetically modified yeast to produce casein, the key protein in milk, through precision fermentation, which is then combined with plant-based fats. While these companies hope to launch their products within a few years, they face significant challenges, including high production costs, regulatory approval for "novel foods," and a recent decline in consumer demand for plant-based alternatives. Proponents highlight the environmental and health benefits, such as being lactose-free and lower in saturated fats.</p>

          <p>The reality show "Love Island" is experiencing a resurgence in popularity, with TV viewership returning to levels not seen in recent years.
