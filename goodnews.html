          <p>A Kyodo News survey reveals a rise in approval ratings for Japanese Prime Minister Shigeru Ishiba's Cabinet, reaching 37%.  This increase is linked to public support for a policy shift towards increasing rice production amid shortages and record-high prices.  However, a significant portion of respondents still deem the government's response to rising rice prices insufficient.  The survey also highlights public opposition to the ruling party's plan for cash handouts to combat inflation.</p>
