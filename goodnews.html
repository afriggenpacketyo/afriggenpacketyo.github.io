          <p>Former Vice President Kamala Harris is contemplating her next political move, potentially including a run for governor of California, another presidential bid in 2028, or stepping away from elected office. Harris made her first major public appearance since her 2024 defeat, criticizing President Trump's economic policies. Sources close to Harris indicate she is engaging with Democratic officials and strategists to help shape the party's future direction. She is expected to announce her decision by the end of the summer and will headline a Democratic National Committee fundraiser in New York in May.</p>

          <p>Secretary of State Marco Rubio has added interim national security advisor, acting administrator of USAID, and acting archivist for the National Archives and Records Administration to his responsibilities. This unusual accumulation of roles raises questions about his capacity to effectively manage each position, particularly given President Trump's unconventional governing style. The appointment was unexpected, with State Department spokesperson Tammy Bruce learning of it during a press conference. While some see it as a sign of Trump's trust in Rubio, others question the practicality of juggling so many responsibilities.</p>
