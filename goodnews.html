        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>The NHS app is set to become the primary communication method for millions of patients in England, with a ¬£50 million investment aimed at modernizing healthcare interactions. This move will allow patients to receive test results, screening invitations, and appointment reminders directly on their smartphones, reducing reliance on traditional letters. The government anticipates saving ¬£200 million over three years by digitizing these processes, freeing up NHS phone lines and resources for frontline services. While acknowledging concerns about access for elderly patients, the Department of Health and Social Care assures that those unable to use the app will receive text messages and letters as a last resort, ensuring comprehensive coverage. This digital upgrade seeks to streamline healthcare management for patients and improve efficiency within the NHS.</p>

          <p>A salvage team is en route to a cargo ship, the Morning Midas, which caught fire in the Aleutian Islands while carrying approximately 3,000 vehicles destined for Mexico. The crew, expected to arrive early next week, will assess the ship's condition, which is currently afloat and emitting smoke, and arrange for firefighting and ocean towage. All 22 crew members were safely evacuated and remain onboard the rescue vessel, and officials are monitoring the ship's onboard systems. The incident has prompted comparisons to a similar 2023 fire on a freighter carrying electric vehicles, highlighting the need for improved emergency response protocols on shipping routes.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Significant progress has been made in the fight against cancer, with the age-adjusted death rate in the US declining by about a third since 1991, and this has resulted in over 4 million fewer cancer deaths. Breakthroughs in treatments like stem-cell harvesting and CAR-T therapy have transformed cancer from a death sentence to a more manageable condition. The decline in smoking has contributed to this trend, but advancements in screening and treatment for non-lung cancers and childhood cancers have also played a crucial role. Immunotherapies, such as CAR-T therapy, are showing promising results, turning a patient's own T-cells into guided missiles to combat cancer, and people are living longer due to these advancements.</p>

          <p>Grant Hardin, a former police chief and convicted killer, was captured after escaping from an Arkansas prison and impersonating a corrections officer. Hardin, known as the "Devil in the Ozarks," was serving sentences for murder and sexual assault, and his escape triggered a nearly two-week-long manhunt in the rugged mountains of northern Arkansas. He was apprehended 1.5 miles from the prison after a brief attempt to flee, and investigators are now questioning him about the escape. Hardin's capture brings relief to the community, particularly the family of his murder victim, and his criminal past includes a history of problematic behavior in law enforcement.</p>

          <p>Morgan Stanley has upgraded MP Materials, a rare-earth miner, citing its growing strategic importance to the US amid geopolitical tensions with China, and this makes the supply of critical minerals more uncertain. The investment bank projects a 32% upside from Friday's close, emphasizing that MP Materials owns the only operating rare earth mine in the US, located in Mountain Pass, California. As China dominates the global market for rare earth refining and processing, MP Materials is seen as the most vertically integrated rare earths company outside of China, and this is a boon to the company's ability to benefit from government support and develop a fully domestic rare earth supply chain in the US.</p>

          <p>The article explores the concept of time limits on federal rental aid, focusing on a program in Delaware that requires recipients to work and save money. While some argue that time limits encourage self-sufficiency and increase turnover, others worry about the potential for harsh consequences and homelessness. The success of the Delaware program is attributed to interest-bearing savings accounts and additional support services, and this is what makes it successful, but a two-year time limit proposed by the Trump administration is deemed unrealistic.</p>

          <p>Ncuti Gatwa's brief tenure as the Doctor in *Doctor Who* represented a welcome departure from the show's previous direction, and he was the first Black, openly queer, and African-born actor to play the role. Gatwa's Doctor brought a bracing, unapologetic queerness to the series, and he was more emotionally available than previous incarnations. His casting allowed the series to explore the ramifications of the Doctor's ability to look like anyone, and this is something that had not been done before.</p>
