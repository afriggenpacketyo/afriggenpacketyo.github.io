          <div class="timestamp">2025-10-07 02:05:15 EDT</div>
        </div>
        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>The World Bank has upgraded its 2025 GDP growth forecast for China to 4.8%, up from a previous prediction of 4%, citing the positive effects of government support measures. This revision brings the forecast closer to Beijing's official target of around 5%. Despite ongoing trade tensions with the U.S., China's exports have remained resilient, offsetting domestic weaknesses like the property slump and sluggish consumer spending. However, the World Bank anticipates this momentum will slow, projecting growth to ease to 4.2% in 2026 as stimulus measures are likely to be scaled back. (not investment advice)</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Chinese electric vehicle manufacturer BYD has announced a dramatic 880% increase in its UK sales for September compared to the previous year, making the UK its largest market outside of China. The company sold over 11,000 cars, largely driven by its Seal U plug-in hybrid SUV, and now holds a 3.6% share of the UK market. This growth occurs as the UK has not imposed tariffs on Chinese EVs, unlike the EU and the US, making it an attractive market for brands like BYD. The surge aligns with record-high EV sales in the UK, although petrol and diesel vehicles still constitute the majority of new car purchases. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>England and Manchester City defender John Stones has disclosed that he considered retiring from football last season due to persistent injury problems. The 31-year-old struggled with foot and hamstring issues, which limited his appearances and caused significant mental strain, leading him to question his future in the sport. Despite these challenges, Stones has returned to the pitch and has been included in the England squad for upcoming matches, reaffirming his commitment and fighting spirit. He also credited England manager Thomas Tuchel for supporting him during his recovery by inviting him to a team training camp.</p>

          <p>For the first time in 100 years, pine martens have been released into Exmoor National Park in a significant conservation effort. The Two Moors Pine Marten Project introduced 19 of the mammals, relocated from Scotland, to secret locations within the park. Each animal is fitted with a radio collar to allow researchers to monitor their progress and integration into the ecosystem. Conservationists from the Devon Wildlife Trust have hailed the reintroduction as a "positive sign for nature," emphasizing the crucial role pine martens play in balancing woodland ecosystems and restoring biodiversity.</p>

          <p>China is rapidly expanding its crude oil storage capacity, a strategic move accelerated by global energy market volatility following Russia's invasion of Ukraine. State-owned oil companies are set to add at least 169 million barrels of storage capacity across 11 new sites through 2026, significantly boosting the nation's strategic petroleum reserves. This stockpiling campaign aims to mitigate China's vulnerability as the world's largest oil importer and is contributing to supporting global oil prices. The initiative reflects Beijing's broader goal of enhancing its energy security amidst geopolitical risks. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>The city of Atlanta has passed new legislation requiring all new and replacement roofs to be "cool roofs," which are more reflective to combat the effects of urban heat. This initiative is projected to cool the city by an average of 2.4 degrees Fahrenheit and save residents an estimated $315 million in energy costs over 35 years. The policy is designed to mitigate the "heat island" effect, where dense concentrations of concrete make urban areas significantly hotter. City officials have framed the ordinance as a measure for climate justice, aimed at protecting public health and reducing energy burdens.</p>

          <p>California has passed a new law requiring streaming services like Netflix, Hulu, and YouTube to regulate the volume of their commercials, ensuring they are not significantly louder than the programs they interrupt. The legislation, signed by Governor Gavin Newsom, extends existing federal regulations for broadcast and cable television to the streaming industry. The bill was inspired by the common annoyance of sudden volume spikes during ad breaks. Because many major streaming platforms are based in California, this state law is expected to set a de facto national standard for commercial audio levels.</p>
