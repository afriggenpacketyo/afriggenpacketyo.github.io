          <p>The United States men's national team faces a challenging summer as it prepares for the 2026 World Cup, with the upcoming Gold Cup presenting a unique set of circumstances. The team is missing key players, and the tournament is seen as less prestigious than other international competitions. However, the Gold Cup still offers an opportunity for the USMNT to rehabilitate its reputation and identify new depth pieces within its roster. Coach Mauricio Pochettino has a chance to cultivate closeness and feistiness, qualities that have been lacking in recent performances, while key players such as Malik Tillman and Johnny Cardoso will have a chance to prove their worth.</p>

          <p>Archaeologists have uncovered what is believed to be the largest intact remains of an ancient Native American agricultural site in the eastern United States, located in northern Michigan. Using drone technology, researchers mapped parallel rows of earthen mounds, revealing raised gardening beds used by ancestors of the Menominee Indian Tribe of Wisconsin. The scale of the agriculture is surprising given the northerly location and challenging growing conditions, suggesting a significant investment of labor in crop cultivation. The discovery highlights the extent and sophistication of indigenous farming practices before European colonization.</p>

Anglers are enthusiastic about the reopening, but face potential crowds and limited catches.

Smith recounts how Alessandra Williams helped save the film by raising money to buy it from Miramax, and he is now touring with the remastered version, pairing screenings with Q&As and stand-up performances.

          <p>The private equity sector is facing scrutiny over its ability to generate top returns amid geopolitical tensions and volatility in public markets. The sector is holding nearly 30,000 unsold companies worth about $3.6 trillion, leading to concerns about limited partners realizing returns. Despite these challenges, some attendees at the SuperReturn conference defended private equity, arguing that it outperforms public markets over the long term. Some areas ripe for private equity backing include European defense firms, undervalued mid-caps, and Middle Eastern data centers. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>The Japanese government approved a plan to enhance the disaster resilience of the country's infrastructure over the next five years, with a project cost expected to exceed 20 trillion yen. Focusing on measures to address aging infrastructure, the plan specifies 326 measures to be taken by government bodies from fiscal 2026 through 2030. The plan addresses prolonged water outages following the Noto Peninsula earthquake and the formation of a sinkhole in Saitama Prefecture.
