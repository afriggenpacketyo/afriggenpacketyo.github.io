          <p>Employers in the U.S. added 139,000 jobs in May, exceeding economists' forecasts and indicating a steady labor market despite economic challenges like tariffs. The unemployment rate remained at 4.2% for the third consecutive month, matching expectations. Although job growth was slightly weaker compared to previous months, analysts suggest the labor market is holding up, particularly in the health care, leisure, and hospitality sectors. Experts caution that economic headwinds could still impact growth in the coming months, and the Federal Reserve is likely to remain on the sidelines regarding interest rate changes.

          <p>The Swiss government has proposed stringent new capital rules for UBS, requiring the banking giant to hold an additional $26 billion in core capital after its acquisition of Credit Suisse in 2023.
