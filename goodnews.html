The meeting occurred amid ongoing tariff uncertainty and repeated calls from Trump for Powell to lower interest rates, with Trump previously threatening to remove him from his position.

          <p>Harvard University secured a temporary victory in its legal battle against the Trump administration's efforts to restrict foreign student enrollment. A federal judge upheld a block on the government's order, and the Department of Homeland Security now grants Harvard 30 days to prove it meets the requirements of the Student and Exchange Visitor Programme (SEVP). The administration alleges Harvard is hostile to Jewish students and promotes pro-Hamas sympathies, which the university argues is retaliation for exercising its First Amendment rights. The legal battle raises questions about the government's power to dictate university curriculum and enrollment.</p>

          <p>The Federal Reserve issued a rare statement asserting its independence after Chair Jerome Powell met with President Trump, emphasizing its nonpartisan role in setting monetary policy based on economic data. Powell told Trump that the Fed will set monetary policy to support maximum employment and stable prices, relying solely on objective analysis. The statement highlights the Fed's awareness of Trump's pressure campaign to lower interest rates, as the president has repeatedly criticized Powell's decisions. Trump has called Powell a "fool" for not lowering rates and has even threatened to remove him from his post.</p>

He was a strong advocate for writing in local African languages, exemplified by his 1980 novel, *Devil on the Cross*, which was published in Gikuyu.
