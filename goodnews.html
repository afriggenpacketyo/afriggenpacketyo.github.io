          <p>Meta's pursuit of Perplexity highlights Mark Zuckerberg's intensified efforts to strengthen the company's AI capabilities amid competition from OpenAI and Google. Meta ultimately acquired a 49% stake in Scale AI and brought on board Scale AI's founder Alexandr Wang and other employees to work on AI products. Earlier this year, Meta also attempted to acquire Safe Superintelligence and has reportedly offered substantial signing bonuses to poach OpenAI employees. OpenAI CEO Sam Altman acknowledged Meta's aggressive pursuit of AI talent, viewing OpenAI as its biggest competitor.</p>

          <p>Gailard Sartain, known for his role on "Hee Haw" and appearances in films like "Mississippi Burning" and "The Buddy Holly Story," passed away at the age of 81 from natural causes. Sartain's wife, Mary Jo, encouraged people to continue sharing stories about him, highlighting his impact on those who knew him. He played various characters on "Hee Haw" for 20 years and also starred in the spin-off, "Hee Haw Honeys." Sartain considered his role as a racist sheriff in "Mississippi Burning" a career high, as it allowed him to break away from being typecast as a purely comedic actor.</p>

Kroger is focusing on value-minded shoppers by simplifying promotions, lowering prices on products, and emphasizing its private brands.

          <p>A federal judge in New Jersey ordered the release of Columbia University activist Mahmoud Khalil from ICE detention, determining that he is not a threat to the community or a flight risk. Khalil, a green card holder, was detained by immigration agents in March, leading to legal challenges and concerns about his detention's justification. The judge found that the Department of Homeland Security's allegations were insufficient to continue his detention and suggested that the immigration charge was being used to punish Khalil for his anti-Israel speech. The White House intends to appeal the decision.</p>

          <p>A federal judge blocked the Trump administration from requiring states to cooperate with federal immigration authorities to receive transportation funding. The ruling sided with 20 states that argued the administration lacked the authority to tie transportation dollars to immigration enforcement. Judge John McConnell deemed the policy arbitrary and capricious, stating that Congress did not authorize the Secretary of Transportation to impose immigration enforcement conditions on transportation funds. The Trump administration has threatened to cut off funding to "sanctuary" jurisdictions, arguing that their policies hinder ICE's ability to apprehend undocumented immigrants.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>The interest-earning possibilities of CDs and money market accounts are similar but not identical, especially in today's cooling rate climate. CD rates vary based on the lender and the term length, while money market accounts have variable interest rates that will inevitably change over time. Currently, money market account rates top out around 4.32%, while the highest rates on CDs are topping out around 4.49% for 6-month CDs, while declining slightly for longer terms. Savers will need to weigh the guaranteed interest they can earn with a CD versus the slightly more they can maybe make with a money market account to determine which is their most profitable option.

          <p>The food industry is increasingly adding protein to various products, from iced tea to popcorn, reflecting Americans' growing obsession with protein. This trend has led to the creation of protein-fortified versions of everyday foods, including protein water, protein pasta sauce, and even protein-infused alcoholic beverages. While some experts believe increased protein intake is beneficial, most agree that the average person does not need to consume excessive amounts. Food companies are capitalizing on the perception of protein as "healthy" to make their products more appealing, but consumers should be wary of the nutritional value of these protein-enhanced items.</p>

Murkowski emphasized that she cannot support cuts that would harm Alaskan beneficiaries, given the state's high healthcare costs and the significant number of children on Medicaid.
