          <h2>UK Government Pledges to Halve Sewage Pollution in Waterways by 2030</h2>

        </div>
        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>The UK government has announced a plan to significantly reduce sewage discharges into English and Welsh waterways, aiming for a 50% reduction by 2030. Environment Secretary Steve Reed described the water sector as "broken" and signaled tougher regulations, including potential prison sentences for non-compliant water company executives. The plan, part of a "water revolution," also includes banning plastic-containing wet wipes and cutting phosphorus pollution, though critics note the pledge is not legally binding. This initiative follows public outrage over increased pollution incidents and executive bonuses amid rising consumer water bills.</p>

          <h2>Fitness Trend of Using Vibration Plates for Weight Loss Examined by Experts</h2>
          <div class="timestamp">2025-07-20 05:00:56 EDT</div>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Vibration plates are a trending fitness device on social media, with users claiming they aid in weight loss and fat burning by stimulating muscles through whole-body vibration. Fitness experts confirm that these machines can improve muscle activation, strength, and balance, and may also enhance bone density, particularly for older adults. However, they caution that vibration plates do not burn a significant number of calories and are not a substitute for traditional exercise and a healthy diet. Medical professionals advise that individuals with certain health conditions, such as joint issues or cardiovascular problems, should consult a doctor before using the device.</p>

          <h2>Astronomers Witness Earliest Stages of Rocky Planet Formation for the First Time</h2>
          <div class="timestamp">2025-07-20 04:11:00 EDT</div>
        </div>
        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Using the James Webb Space Telescope and the ALMA array, astronomers have for the first time directly observed the initial stages of rocky planet formation around a young, sun-like star named HOPS-315. Located 1,370 light-years away, the infant star's surrounding gas disk showed signs of silicate minerals condensing, the fundamental building blocks of planets like Earth. This discovery provides an unprecedented glimpse into the processes that may have occurred at the dawn of our own solar system. The finding suggests that the formation of Earth-like planets could be a common process, offering new insights into the potential for similar worlds elsewhere in the universe.</p>

          <p>In response to a potential 30% US tariff, South Africa is intensifying efforts to increase its exports to China and address a significant trade imbalance favoring Beijing. A high-level South African delegation visited China to promote investment and diversify exports from raw commodities to higher-value goods like pharmaceuticals and green energy technology. Deputy President Paul Mashatile highlighted the need to overcome market access barriers and create a more balanced trade relationship. While China presents a crucial alternative market, observers caution that it is not a simple replacement for the US and that over-dependence carries its own risks.</p>

          <p>Officials in Kerr County, Texas, have significantly revised the number of individuals missing after the devastating floods earlier this month, lowering the count from 97 to just three. The city of Kerrville announced that extensive follow-up work by local and state agencies verified that many people initially reported as missing were safe. At its peak, over 160 people were listed as unaccounted for in the hard-hit county. This positive development comes as a relief, although the overall death toll from the statewide flooding stands at 134, with 107 of those fatalities occurring in Kerr County.</p>

In 1925, Sir Malcolm Campbell achieved a speed of 150.766mph on the beach, a feat that brought him international fame. The car will be present for a ceremonial start-up attended by Campbell's grandson, Don Wales, who is also a record-breaker. Now housed at the National Motor Museum, the iconic vehicle's return commemorates a pivotal moment in automotive history and the legacy of the Campbell racing dynasty.</p>

          <p>A Wisconsin man, initially the prime suspect in his girlfriend's 2016 murder, was ultimately exonerated thanks to data from his Fitbit activity tracker. After Nicole Vander Heyden was found beaten and strangled, suspicion fell on her boyfriend, Doug Detrie, with whom she had been earlier that night. However, investigators discovered that his Fitbit data corroborated his story that he was asleep at home during the time of the murder, showing minimal movement. This technological alibi, along with other digital evidence from the real killer's phone, led to Detrie's release and the subsequent arrest and conviction of another man, George Steven Burch.</p>

          <p>The upcoming week in financial markets will be heavily focused on the earnings reports of major European banking institutions, including Unicredit, BNP Paribas, and Deutsche Bank. Analysts are optimistic that the banking sector will continue its resilient performance, potentially driving positive growth for the Stoxx 600. Simultaneously, markets are in a holding pattern ahead of the European Central Bank's policy meeting, where interest rates are expected to remain unchanged. However, the looming threat of 30% tariffs on EU imports by the U.S. could force the ECB to cut rates in the near future. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>German goalkeeper Ann-Katrin Berger became a national hero after her decisive performance in a penalty shootout victory against France in the Euro 2025 quarter-final. Berger, who has twice overcome thyroid cancer, made two crucial saves and even scored a penalty herself to secure the win. Her journey is particularly inspiring, as she learned of her cancer's recurrence during the 2022 Euros but has since made a full recovery to perform at the highest level. The 34-year-old's calmness and skill were instrumental in Germany's advancement to the semi-finals after playing most of the match with only 10 players.</p>
