          <p>President Trump signed an executive order officially lifting U.S. sanctions against Syria, a move intended to support the nation's path toward peace and stability. This action follows a promise made to Syria's new president, Ahmad al-Sharaa, and dismantles the existing sanctions architecture while retaining some restrictions on former leader Bashar Al Assad. Administration officials stated the goal is not nation-building but to provide Syria's interim government an opportunity to stabilize. The U.S. also hopes this will encourage Syria to normalize relations with neighbors, including Israel, under the Abraham Accords.</p>

          <p>A recent WalletHub study reveals that American travelers are paying more attention to credit card perks like travel and rental car insurance to offset rising costs. According to a national survey, 43% of people are more likely to explore these benefits due to new tariffs and inflation. The most desired perk is travel accident insurance, followed by trip cancellation coverage and rental car insurance. The study highlights that many consumers are unaware of the benefits their cards offer, which could potentially save an average person over $1,000 annually.</p>

          <p>With interest rates elevated, savers are weighing the benefits of various accounts for a significant deposit like $10,000. This article compares the interest earnings between short-term Certificates of Deposit (CDs) and money market accounts. Calculations show that for 3-month and 6-month terms, a CD currently offers a slightly higher return. However, for a 9-month term, a money market account could yield more, assuming its variable rate remains stable. Savers must consider the guaranteed fixed rate of a CD against the flexible but variable rate of a money market account, especially with potential Fed rate cuts looming. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>Financial advisor Dave Ramsey has offered unconventional advice for aspiring homeowners struggling to save for a down payment. He suggests that temporarily pausing contributions to retirement accounts like a 401(k) or IRA is an acceptable short-term strategy to accumulate funds for a home more quickly. However, Ramsey strongly warns against borrowing from or cashing out existing retirement funds, as this can trigger taxes and penalties while damaging long-term growth. This advice is aimed at those finding it difficult to balance saving for both retirement and homeownership simultaneously. (not investment advice)</p>

        </div>
        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>This article outlines several timely reasons why opening a Home Equity Line of Credit (HELOC) could be a smart financial move for homeowners in July. With average home equity at a record high, HELOCs offer an accessible way to borrow large sums, and interest rates have fallen significantly since last year. The approval process can be quicker than for unsecured loans, and the variable rates are advantageous as the Federal Reserve is expected to issue further rate cuts. Additionally, a HELOC's flexibility allows borrowers to pay interest only on the funds they use. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>For the first time, Wimbledon has replaced human line judges with an electronic line-calling system, drawing varied responses from players and fans. While many players appreciate the accuracy and impartiality of the AI-powered calls, some find the automated voice too quiet and miss the tradition and drama of the human element. Players like Frances Tiafoe noted the absence of the suspenseful challenge system, which engaged the crowd. The move reflects a broader trend in tennis toward technology, though it has also sparked protests over the loss of jobs.</p>
