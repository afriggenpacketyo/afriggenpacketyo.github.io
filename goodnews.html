          <div class="timestamp">2025-06-18 05:15:59 EDT</div>
        </div>
        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Scientists predict that endangered sharks, rays, and native oysters may flourish in UK waters as they adapt to rising ocean temperatures. A study mapped the responses of 19 threatened marine species to climate change, identifying potential biodiversity hotspots in the North Sea within the next 50 years. While mobile species are expected to adapt well, static creatures like sea pens and the ocean quahog clam may struggle, impacting ecosystems and food chains. The findings aim to guide government planning for Marine Protected Areas, emphasizing the need to manage threats like fishing, disease, and pollution to ensure these species thrive in their new habitats.</p>

          <p>Rising egg prices have led to a surge in interest among Americans in raising chickens at home, with searches for DIY chicken coop plans increasing significantly. Tractor Supply Co. reports a rise in chicken coop sales and chick purchases, indicating a growing trend of backyard poultry farming. Experts advise potential chicken owners to consider the long-term commitment, costs, and local regulations involved in raising chickens. While backyard chickens can provide fresh eggs and encourage outdoor activity, they require significant care, financial investment, and protection from predators and diseases.</p>

The number of Chinese companies attending the show has more than doubled since 2023, with many making their first appearance in Paris. This surge in participation reflects a desire to expand into the European market, driven by plateauing domestic profits and intense competition within China.

          <p>The Leo Baeck Institute (LBI) is commemorating its 70th anniversary, marking decades of preserving and promoting German-Jewish cultural heritage. Founded in 1955 by German-speaking Jewish intellectuals, including Hannah Arendt, the LBI aimed to showcase what the Nazis had destroyed and celebrate the cultural achievements and everyday life of German Jews. With branches in New York, London, and Jerusalem, the LBI houses a vast collection of historical objects, books, letters, and artworks, most of which have been digitized and made accessible online. The institute faces challenges due to attacks on academic life and the rise of right-wing parties, but continues its mission to combat antisemitism and foster an open society.</p>

          <p>Boeing is advocating for Europe to reduce its dependence on China for critical minerals, similar to the approach taken by the United States. Boeing Global Services' Turbo Sjogren emphasizes that the aerospace supply chain is global, necessitating collaboration among nations. He points out that US legislation has been in place since 1973, requiring the aerospace industry and defense sector to avoid reliance on countries like China for essential materials. This call to action underscores the growing concerns about supply chain security and the need for diversification in the aerospace industry.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Faced with increasing tariffs, businesses are resorting to "tariff engineering" to lower their duty liabilities by strategically altering product classifications. This involves changing an item's materials, dimensions, or composition to fit into a different harmonized system code, which can result in lower tariff rates. While not inherently illegal, this practice requires careful navigation of over 5,000 product classification codes used by U.S. customs authorities. Examples include adding cubic zirconia to lapel pins to classify them as jewelry and adding zippered pockets to women's shirts to qualify for lower duties.</p>
