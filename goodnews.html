        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>South Korea's opposition leader Lee Jae-myung is projected to win the country's snap presidential election, according to exit polls. This election was triggered by the impeachment and removal of former President Yoon Suk Yeol. Lee, who narrowly lost the 2022 election to Yoon, held a lead in opinion polls, though his eligibility was questioned due to pending charges of breaching election laws. As president, Lee is expected to navigate trade negotiations with the U.S. and policies concerning China and North Korea, while also contending with reviving South Korea's economy.</p>

This move is part of Klarna's effort to shift its image from a BNPL provider to a more comprehensive banking player ahead of a potential IPO.

          <p>Jack Draper's defeat at the French Open has highlighted the gap he still needs to bridge to compete with top players like Jannik Sinner and Carlos Alcaraz. Draper's loss meant he missed an opportunity to avenge his US Open defeat by Sinner. Former world number four Greg Rusedski notes that Draper needs a full year of health to consistently rise in the rankings like Sinner and Alcaraz. Draper is on the cusp of breaking through but needs to maintain consistency to challenge the top players.</p>

          <p>Constellation Energy's shares rallied after Meta signed a 20-year agreement to purchase nuclear power from the company. Meta will buy approximately 1.1 gigawatts of energy from Constellation's Clinton Clean Energy Center in Illinois, which is the entire output from the site's nuclear reactor. The long-term agreement will support the plant's continued operation and relicensing, as it was in danger of closing without the commitment from Meta. The deal contributes to Meta's goal of achieving 100% clean electricity.</p>
