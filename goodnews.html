          <p>Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing Company (TSMC) announced a record-breaking third-quarter profit, with a 39.1% year-over-year increase that surpassed market expectations. This significant growth is primarily driven by the global boom in artificial intelligence, as TSMC is a key manufacturer of advanced AI processors for major clients like Nvidia and Apple. The company's high-performance computing division, which includes AI and 5G applications, constituted 57% of its revenue. Consequently, TSMC has raised its full-year revenue growth forecast for 2025 to the mid-30% range, signaling strong confidence in sustained demand for its cutting-edge chip technology.

        </div>
        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Nick Clegg, a former top executive at Meta and previous UK Deputy Prime Minister, has cautioned that the artificial intelligence sector is facing a high probability of a market correction due to "unbelievable, crazy valuations." He described the current investment climate as a spasm of deal-making that could be unsustainable, questioning whether major tech companies can recoup their massive infrastructure investments. Clegg also expressed skepticism about the immediate prospects of artificial superintelligence, suggesting the industry's focus on utility will persist even if a market bubble bursts. He believes the societal adoption of AI will be slower than many technologists predict. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>The United Kingdom's economy grew by a slight 0.1% in August, according to the Office for National Statistics, following a revised 0.1% contraction in July. The modest expansion was primarily driven by a 0.7% increase in the manufacturing sector. Despite this return to growth, economists describe the overall outlook as weak, with households facing slowing wage increases and high costs for essentials. The figures arrive ahead of a crucial Budget next month, with the government facing pressure to stimulate the economy while managing borrowing. (not investment advice)</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Uruguay's Senate has passed a bill legalizing euthanasia, making it the first country in Latin America to formally do so. The "Dignified Death" bill allows mentally sound adult citizens with terminal, irreversible diseases to choose a medically assisted death. The legislation, which does not permit assisted suicide, received broad support in both houses of parliament and is backed by over 60% of the Uruguayan public, according to recent polls. This landmark law continues Uruguay's history of socially liberal policies in a predominantly Catholic region, following its earlier legalization of cannabis, same-sex marriage, and abortion.</p>

          <p>The Toronto Blue Jays secured a decisive 13-4 victory over the Seattle Mariners in Game 3 of the American League Championship Series, narrowing their series deficit to 2-1. The Blue Jays' offense exploded for 18 hits, including five home runs, overwhelming Mariners' starting pitcher George Kirby. Toronto's hitters were notably aggressive, with all five homers coming within the first three pitches of the at-bats. The offensive surge was a critical turnaround for the Blue Jays, who had scored only four total runs in the first two games of the series, and it sets a more competitive tone for the remainder of the championship.</p>

          <p>U.S. President Donald Trump announced that Indian Prime Minister Narendra Modi has assured him that India will stop purchasing oil from Russia, though he noted the process would take time. The move is seen by Washington as a crucial step in isolating Moscow economically over its war in Ukraine. India, one of the largest buyers of Russian crude, has previously defended its purchases as necessary for energy security and price stability. In response, India's external affairs ministry stated its import decisions are guided by consumer interests but also noted ongoing discussions to deepen energy cooperation with the United States.</p>

          <p>A 76-year-old hillwalker, Ian Currie, has shared his story of survival after being lost for eight days in a remote part of the Scottish Highlands. The experienced walker became disoriented during bad weather on a strenuous trek from Glenfinnan to Knoydart, with the river he was following becoming swollen and impassable. After his tent and phone were soaked, he spent several nights cold and exhausted, believing he would die from exposure. He was eventually found by the local landowner and a group of deer stalkers after a friend had raised the alarm, ending what he described as a "long black nightmare."</p>

          <p>The People's Bank of China (PBOC) has set the yuan's daily midpoint reference rate against the U.S. dollar at its strongest level in a year. This move comes amid growing market expectations that the U.S. Federal Reserve will implement further interest rate cuts this year to counter economic risks from U.S.-China trade tensions. A stronger fixing by the central bank can help manage currency expectations and stabilize the yuan. The adjustment reflects the shifting dynamics in global monetary policy as central banks navigate economic uncertainty. (not investment advice)</p>
