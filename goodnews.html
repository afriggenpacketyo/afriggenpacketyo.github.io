          <p>French automaker Renault is reportedly in discussions with Chinese car manufacturer Chery to produce vehicles together in South America. The proposed partnership would involve Chery utilizing Renault's existing factories in Colombia and Argentina. In exchange, Chery would provide capital and product design, gaining access to the South American market while Renault benefits from investment in its facilities. The plans include producing combustion-engine cars in Colombia, primarily under the Renault brand, and potentially investing in a plug-in hybrid pickup truck line in Argentina. The talks are ongoing and a final agreement has not yet been reached.</p>

          <p>Shares of South Korean semiconductor giants Samsung Electronics and SK Hynix experienced a significant surge after announcing a partnership with the artificial intelligence firm OpenAI. The collaboration, part of OpenAI's 'Stargate' initiative, aims to increase the supply of advanced memory chips, such as high-bandwidth memory (HBM), which are essential for powering next-generation AI models. As a result of the news, SK Hynix's stock jumped over 9% to its highest point since 2000, while Samsung's shares rose over 4%. This partnership solidifies the chipmakers' critical role in the expanding AI technology supply chain. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>Elon Musk has reached an unprecedented financial milestone, becoming the first person ever to have a net worth of over $500 billion. This surge in wealth is primarily attributed to the strong performance of Tesla's stock, which has risen significantly this year, along with increasing valuations for his other ventures like SpaceX and xAI. The achievement solidifies his position as the world's wealthiest individual, far surpassing his closest competitors. Investors have reportedly responded positively to Musk dedicating more focus to his companies recently, contributing to the upward trend in his fortune.</p>

          <p>President Trump has signed an executive order declaring that any armed attack on Qatar will be treated as a threat to the national security of the United States. This move, which provides the Gulf state with a rare promise of U.S. military defense, comes in response to an Israeli bombing in Doha that targeted Hamas leaders but also killed a Qatari serviceman. The executive order solidifies the security relationship between the two nations, as Qatar hosts the largest U.S. military base in the region. Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu has since expressed regret for the strike and for violating Qatari sovereignty.</p>

          <p>A high-rise residential building in the Bronx's Mott Haven neighborhood experienced a partial collapse following a powerful explosion in its boiler room. The blast destroyed an entire corner of the 20-story New York City Housing Authority building, sending a cascade of bricks and debris onto the street below. Despite the extensive structural damage, officials reported that miraculously, no injuries or fatalities occurred. An investigation is now underway to determine the exact cause of the explosion, and 38 apartments have been evacuated as a precaution while inspectors assess the building's structural integrity.</p>

          <p>Cleveland Browns rookie quarterback Shedeur Sanders responded to questions about his place on the team's depth chart by remaining completely silent. After fellow rookie Dillon Gabriel was promoted to the starting position, leaving Sanders as the third-string QB, Sanders pantomimed answers without speaking when approached by reporters. This unconventional method of avoiding comment follows recent remarks he made suggesting he was capable of playing better than many current NFL quarterbacks. The silent protest has drawn comparisons to other famous non-responses from athletes and coaches, becoming a notable moment in the early NFL season.</p>

          <p>The Los Angeles Lakers are expressing confidence in new signee Jake LaRavia, a 23-year-old wing player expected to complement the team's stars. Standing at 6-foot-7, LaRavia is known for his three-point shooting and defensive versatility, fitting the 'three-and-D' role the team needs. Both LeBron James and coach JJ Redick have praised the young player's potential and commitment. LaRavia, a former first-round pick, aims to provide energy and spacing on the court to support high-usage players like Luka Doncic, making his addition a key part of the team's strategy for the upcoming season.</p>

          <p>CNBC's Jim Cramer advised investors that the market's top-performing stocks from the third quarter could offer a roadmap for the remainder of the year. He noted that fund managers often purchase recent winners in the fourth quarter to bolster their portfolios, potentially driving these stocks higher. Companies like AppLovin, Western Digital, and Seagate saw massive gains, largely driven by the AI boom and increased data storage demand. While Cramer believes these winners are a good place to be, he also cautioned that the most substantial gains for the year may have already occurred. (not investment advice)</p>

          <h2>A Guide to Selecting and Using Different Types of Cooking Oils</h2>

        </div>
        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>This article debunks common myths about cooking oils to help consumers make healthier and more practical choices. Contrary to some claims, common vegetable and sunflower oils are not unhealthy; they are low in saturated fats and high in essential polyunsaturated fats. Modern margarines are also a healthy option, as harmful trans fats have been removed from their formulation. For cooking methods, oils with high smoke points like vegetable or sunflower oil are best for deep frying, while extra virgin olive oil, with its lower smoke point, is better suited for dressings or drizzling over finished dishes.</p>
