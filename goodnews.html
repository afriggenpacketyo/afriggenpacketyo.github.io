          <p>Ole Miss head coach Lane Kiffin offered a lighthearted, three-word response after his daughter, Landry, revealed her relationship with LSU star linebacker Whit Weeks. Landry, a sophomore at Mississippi, posted a photo with Weeks on Instagram, which quickly gained attention. With LSU and Ole Miss scheduled to play a highly anticipated SEC game soon, Kiffin's quip, "Take the over," humorously predicted a high-scoring contest between the two teams. This new romance adds an extra layer of bragging rights to the upcoming college football clash.</p>

          <p>China has officially backed Brazil's ambitious $125 billion Tropical Forests Forever Facility, a significant boost for the initiative ahead of COP30. This fund, developed with the World Bank, aims to reward nations for preserving tropical forests by investing in low-risk assets and channeling returns to tropical countries. Payments are contingent on keeping annual deforestation below 0.5%, with a fifth of resources allocated to Indigenous peoples and local communities. Brazilian President Lula da Silva announced a $1 billion contribution from Brazil, emphasizing that the fund is an investment in humanity and the planet, not charity.</p>

          <p>The Liberal Democrats concluded their conference with a "punchy" speech from leader Sir Ed Davey, who adopted an aggressive stance against Reform UK and its leader, Nigel Farage. The party sees an opportunity to challenge Reform and Donald Trump, using Farage as a catalyst for fundraising and recruitment among activists. Despite accusations of scaremongering, particularly regarding gun laws, the Lib Dems are determined to be heard and expand their appeal to disaffected Conservative voters. Internal polling reportedly suggests growing openness to voting Liberal Democrat, even as they navigate a competitive political landscape with a noisy new rival.</p>

          <p>Tether, the issuer of the largest stablecoin, is reportedly planning to raise between $15 billion and $20 billion, which could value the crypto company at an astounding $500 billion. This valuation would place Tether on par with some of the world's largest private companies, including OpenAI and SpaceX. The proposed private placement would involve new equity in exchange for a roughly 3% stake, though talks are in early stages and details could change. Tether has recently been expanding its U.S. presence, aligning with President Trump's pro-crypto stance, and launched a new U.S.-regulated token called USAT. (not investment advice)</p>

This operational site, filled with Oracle Cloud infrastructure and Nvidia chips, is part of an unprecedented global boom in AI infrastructure. OpenAI's CFO, Sarah Friar, emphasized the "massive compute crunch" necessitating such large-scale construction, with plans for additional sites across the U.S. and a potential to scale past a gigawatt of capacity. The project, also funded by SoftBank and involving Nvidia, aims to meet the surging demand for AI computing.</p>

          <p>Los Angeles Mayor Karen Bass announced that her administration has successfully averted all planned layoffs of city workers, initially numbering over 1,600, despite a $1 billion budget shortfall. This achievement follows months of negotiations and cost-cutting measures, including agreements with city unions for unpaid holidays and scaling back hiring in the LAPD and fire department. While some workers had already faced layoffs, agreements secured their reinstatement. Mayor Bass celebrated the outcome as a testament to solidarity, though Councilmember Tim McOsker cautioned that the city's budget challenges will persist, necessitating continued focus on long-term solutions.</p>

          <p>Major League Baseball will implement a player challenge system for called balls and strikes starting in the 2026 season, following years of testing in the minor leagues. This new system, powered by baseball's automated strike zone (ABS), aims to balance the umpire's role with the ability to correct missed calls in high-leverage situations. Each team will receive two challenges per game, retaining a challenge if the call is overturned. Players, including relief pitcher Tayler Saucedo, have expressed support, noting its efficiency and positive impact on umpire performance. This move represents a significant evolution in baseball's use of technology for officiating.</p>

Canadian Prime Minister Mark Carney acknowledged the potential, noting that many homegrown AI talents currently migrate to the US. Experts believe Canada, with its world-class institutions and proximity to the US, is a natural destination for professionals affected by the H-1B changes. While Canada has its own immigration challenges, a 2023 program for US-based H-1B holders to obtain work permits saw 10,000 applications in 24 hours, indicating strong interest in relocating north.</p>

This investment is part of a broader infrastructure partnership, aiming to deploy 10 gigawatts of power for AI, with the first gigawatt data center expected online in late 2026. The collaboration highlights the critical role of Nvidia's GPUs in the burgeoning AI ecosystem and the massive global demand for AI infrastructure, projected at $375 billion in 2025. Critics, however, raise concerns about "circular financing" potentially overestimating chip demand, while proponents see it as a sign of unmet AI needs.</p>

          <p>Car buyers are rushing to purchase electric vehicles (EVs) to capitalize on federal tax credits of up to $7,500 for new and $4,000 for used EVs before they expire on September 30. These credits, introduced under the 2022 Inflation Reduction Act, are being phased out by President Trump's "One Big Beautiful Bill Act." This urgency has driven record EV sales in August, with new EV sales up 17.7% and used EV sales up 59% year-over-year. Dealerships are offering aggressive incentives, like $40 monthly lease rates, to clear inventory before the credits end, creating uncertainty for the EV market's sales landscape post-September.
