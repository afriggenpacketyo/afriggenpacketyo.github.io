          <p>The UK's Financial Conduct Authority (FCA) is planning a compensation scheme for victims of mis-sold car finance, with payouts likely to be under £950 per deal. The move follows a Supreme Court ruling that, while not finding hidden commissions broadly unlawful, deemed exceptionally large commissions to be unfair. The FCA will consult on the details of the scheme, which could cost the industry between £9 billion and £18 billion and cover agreements dating back to 2007. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>Major restaurant chains are increasingly adding spicy menu items to attract Gen Z and Gen Alpha customers, who show a strong preference for bold flavors. Companies like Chipotle, Cava, and Wendy's are launching spicy sauces, sides, and main dishes as a low-cost way to generate buzz and drive sales amid slower consumer spending. This trend is heavily amplified by social media platforms like TikTok, where spicy food challenges and taste tests frequently go viral, creating urgency among younger diners.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Dallas Cowboys owner Jerry Jones downplayed star defender Micah Parsons' public request for a trade, characterizing it as "negotiation talk." The dispute stems from a breakdown in contract extension talks, with Parsons seeking a deal that would likely make him the highest-paid defender in the NFL. While Parsons has not been practicing due to a back injury, Jones expressed confidence that the situation would be resolved, comparing it to past high-profile contract standoffs with other star players.</p>

          <p>For couples facing a rocky marriage without a prenuptial agreement, divorce attorneys recommend taking proactive steps to protect personal finances. Key advice includes gaining full transparency into all joint financial accounts, assets, and liabilities while still married, making the process smoother if a divorce occurs. Another option is a postnuptial agreement, which can define how assets, particularly those from a business started during the marriage, would be divided, providing security for both parties.</p>

        </div>
        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>A parenting expert who has studied over 200 parent-child relationships suggests using specific phrases to de-escalate tantrums by connecting with a child rather than trying to control them. Instead of punishments, phrases like "You're having a big feeling. I'm right here with you" and "Your feelings make sense" can validate a child's emotions and make them feel safe. This approach, which focuses on co-regulation and setting boundaries with compassion, helps build trust and can reduce the frequency of future meltdowns.</p>

          <p>An expert analysis suggests that recent conflicts in the Middle East, particularly the direct Iran-Israel confrontation, are causing China to shift its regional strategy. While maintaining its economic interests, Beijing is reportedly adopting a more pragmatic stance, recognizing Iran's relative weakness and Israel's strategic and technological importance. This could lead to China playing a more balanced, mediatory role, potentially restraining Iran while strengthening its own global image as a responsible power, a move that could reshape regional geopolitics.

This official scheme would build on the efforts of private organizations that have already brought a small number of Palestinian children to the UK for privately funded, complex medical procedures unavailable in the war-torn territory.</p>
