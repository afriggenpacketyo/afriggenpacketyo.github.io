          <p>Filmmaker Ken Burns has described the American Revolution as one of the most significant events in world history, arguing it fundamentally 'turned the world upside down' by creating the concept of a citizen rather than a subject. In an interview, he emphasized that while the original promises of the Declaration of Independence did not include all people, its inspirational words have since driven progress for marginalized groups. Burns, promoting his upcoming documentary, also contended that embracing the complicated and flawed stories of historical figures enriches the nation's history and makes it accessible to everyone.</p>

          <p>Competitive eating legend Joey Chestnut made a triumphant return to win the 2025 Nathan's Famous Hot Dog Eating Contest, consuming 70.5 hot dogs and buns in ten minutes. Chestnut, who was banned from the 2024 event due to a sponsorship dispute, reclaimed his title from last year's winner, Patrick Bertoletti. The 41-year-old fell short of his own world record of 76 but expressed his excitement to be back competing in the iconic Fourth of July event. In the women's competition, reigning champion Miki Sudo secured her 11th victory by eating 33 hot dogs and buns.</p>

          <p>Carlos Alcaraz, the defending Wimbledon champion, secured his spot in the fourth round after a challenging four-set victory against Germany's Jan-Lennard Struff. Despite a strong start, Alcaraz faced significant pressure as Struff's powerful serve leveled the match in the second set. However, the world number two demonstrated his champion-level quality by overcoming key moments and breaking his opponent late in the fourth set to seal the win. Alcaraz acknowledged the stressful nature of the match and will now face Andrey Rublev as he continues his quest for a third consecutive Wimbledon title.</p>

          <p>Manchester City and England defender Kyle Walker is finalizing a move to Burnley after successfully passing a medical with the newly promoted Premier League club. The 35-year-old right-back is expected to sign a two-year contract, ending his distinguished eight-year tenure at Manchester City. During his time with City, Walker won 17 major trophies, including six Premier League titles and the Champions League. He spent the latter half of the previous season on loan at AC Milan, but the Italian club chose not to make the move permanent.</p>

          <p>The European Union held its first-ever summit in Moldova, a move demonstrating deeping ties and support for the nation's path toward EU membership. Moldovan President Maia Sandu stated the event shows the country's accession is 'already underway,' with the EU pledging €1.9 billion in investments. The summit addressed Moldova's vulnerability to Russian disinformation and hybrid threats, with leaders reaffirming their commitment to the country's security and sovereignty. Moldova is eager to advance its membership talks, which began last year alongside Ukraine, amid concerns that political roadblocks could stall progress.</p>

          <p>One in every ten new cars sold in the United Kingdom during June was manufactured in China, marking a significant increase in market share for Chinese brands. According to industry figures, brands like BYD and MG now account for 10% of UK sales, up from 6% a year ago, a trend driven largely by electric vehicles. This growth contrasts sharply with the situation in other G7 nations, such as the US and Canada, which have imposed heavy tariffs on Chinese EV imports. The UK has not yet followed suit, creating a major opportunity for Chinese automakers in the British market. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>A cardiologist with over two decades of experience treating heart attacks has identified five types of food he advises against feeding children to promote lifelong health. These include microwave popcorn with chemical-lined bags, flavored yogurts high in added sugar, processed meats like bacon and hot dogs, sugary cereals, and deep-fried foods. The doctor emphasizes that these foods contribute to inflammation and poor metabolic health, laying the groundwork for chronic diseases in adulthood. Instead, he recommends healthier alternatives like air-popped popcorn, plain yogurt with fruit, lean proteins, and whole foods.</p>

Publicly traded company Robinhood announced it would offer tokenized U.S. stocks on an Ethereum-based network, while giants like Deutsche Bank are building on its infrastructure. Ethereum's co-founder, Vitalik Buterin, noted that institutions value the network for its stability and dependability, not just speed. This shift towards utility suggests Ethereum is solidifying its position as the trusted back-end plumbing for the future of finance. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>In a hopeful effort to combat climate change's impact on marine ecosystems, scientists are transplanting crossbred coral fragments onto a Miami reef that was devastated by bleaching. The project involves breeding native Florida corals with specimens from a warmer reef in Honduras, with the goal of creating more heat-tolerant offspring. This marks the first time an international crossbreeding of corals has been permitted for planting in the wild. Researchers hope this innovative strategy will help Florida's iconic Elkhorn corals, which are crucial for coastal protection, survive rising ocean temperatures.</p>
