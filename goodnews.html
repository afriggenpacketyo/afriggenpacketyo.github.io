          <p>Canada has withdrawn its digital services tax on large tech companies just before it was set to take effect. The decision came after U.S. President Donald Trump announced he was halting all trade discussions with Canada in response to the proposed 3% levy, which would have affected American giants like Google and Amazon. Canadian officials stated the move is intended to allow for the resumption of negotiations for a new comprehensive economic and security agreement with the United States. The tax was originally introduced to address a gap where tech firms earned significant revenue from Canadians without being taxed locally.</p>

          <p>A black bear has been spotted for the second time in Greene County, Ohio, leading local police to issue a public advisory. The Yellow Springs Police Department humorously named the bear "Mosey" and urged residents not to approach, feed, or follow the animal. Officials from the Ohio Department of Natural Resources (ODNR) stated that black bears are typically shy and will avoid humans. To prevent attracting the bear, residents are advised to secure trash, take down bird feeders, and keep pet food indoors. The ODNR will continue to monitor the bear's movements but does not plan to intervene.</p>

          <p>The United Kingdom is bracing for the peak of a four-day heatwave, with temperatures forecast to reach 34¬∞C (93¬∞F) in central and eastern England. This would mark one of the hottest June days on record. An amber heat-health alert remains in effect for five regions, indicating that the high temperatures are likely to impact the entire health service and cause travel delays. The London Fire Brigade has also warned of a "severe" risk of wildfires due to the heat and low rainfall. Authorities are advising the public to stay out of the sun during the hottest part of the day.</p>

          <p>Pride Month culminated in large-scale marches across the globe, where participants both celebrated LGBTQ+ identity and protested against increasing political attacks. In New York City, the oldest and largest U.S. Pride event, the theme was "Rise Up: Pride in Protest," with many demonstrating against recent policies targeting transgender people. In Budapest, tens of thousands defied a government ban on LGBTQ+ public events to march for their rights. These events highlighted a dual focus within the community: celebrating hard-won freedoms while resisting a global rise in discriminatory legislation and rhetoric, underscoring that their joy itself is a form of resistance.</p>

The San Diego Humane Society's Ramona Wildlife Center cared for the cub for nearly five months, focusing on medical treatment while carefully preserving its wild instincts. After gaining sufficient weight and strength, and demonstrating natural survival behaviors, the cub was released in a remote area of the Santa Ana Mountains. The successful rehabilitation highlights the crucial work done by wildlife centers to give injured animals a second chance at life.</p>

The incident occurred on the Disney Dream as it was sailing from The Bahamas to Florida. The ship's crew immediately initiated a "man overboard" response, deploying a rescue boat and life preservers to safely recover both guests from the water within minutes. Disney Cruise Line commended its crew for their swift and effective actions. It remains unclear how the child fell from Deck 4, which is protected by safety barriers.</p>
