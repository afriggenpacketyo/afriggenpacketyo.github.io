          <p>Virginia Beach Parks and Recreation has installed kayak vending machines at Stumpy Lake Natural Area, Munden Point Park, and Lake Lawson/Lake Smith Natural Area. Renters can use a smartphone app to scan a QR code and access a kayak, life jacket, and paddle for a fee. The vending machines have proven popular, with nearly 900 kayaks rented at Munden Point and Lake Lawson/Lake Smith since their installation. The city plans to add another vending machine at the Bow Creek Stormwater Park upon its completion in 2026 or 2027, replacing a more cumbersome rental process that was staff-intensive and required cash handling. The optimism score reflects the positive impact of this innovative approach to outdoor recreation.</p>

          <p>A federal judge has blocked the Trump administration from making significant cuts to research funding provided by the National Science Foundation. The ruling struck down a policy change that would have capped indirect costs for universities, potentially stripping them of millions of dollars in research funding. The judge deemed the change arbitrary and capricious and contrary to law. The University of California estimated the change would have cost it nearly $100 million a year.
