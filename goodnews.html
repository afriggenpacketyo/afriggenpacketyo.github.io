          <h2>Chinese Scholar Argues Academic System Hinders Innovation</h2>

          <p>A Chinese academic, Wang Shuguo, argues that China's doctoral education system, with its overemphasis on published papers, stifles talent and hinders innovation. He points to DeepSeek, an AI start-up founded by Liang Wenfeng, who did not pursue a PhD, as an example of innovation occurring outside university laboratories. Wang suggests that China's technological breakthroughs are being driven by companies whose owners lack PhDs, implying a need for academic reform to foster more innovation. The current system, according to Wang, shackles talent and prevents the emergence of groundbreaking research findings. Optimism for the future of China's academic system is uncertain.</p>

          <p>Michael Saylor's bitcoin treasury strategy, which significantly increased Strategy's market capitalization, is now being adopted by other companies, including meme stock firms and media conglomerates. Despite announcements from Trump Media and GameStop regarding bitcoin investments, Wall Street remains skeptical, with shares of both companies declining. Saylor believes that the adoption of bitcoin by corporations marks a global shift in corporate finance and that bitcoin ambassadors are expanding its reach worldwide. The Biden administration previously viewed corporate bitcoin adoption as a regulatory concern, but the Trump administration has taken a different approach, establishing a U.S. Strategic Bitcoin Reserve and encouraging federal agencies to treat bitcoin as a long-term store of value.

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Due to trade tensions and recession fears, travelers are taking a more frugal approach to summer vacations, according to a Deloitte report. While more people plan to travel compared to last year, they are scaling back their spending plans, with budgets for their longest trips showing minimal increase from the previous year. Travelers are cutting back on in-destination spending, choosing to stay with family and friends, and driving instead of flying to save money. Despite lower travel costs, inflation is causing people to spend more overall, leaving less disposable income for non-essential items like travel.</p>

          <p>Afghanistan and Pakistan have decided to upgrade their diplomatic ties by appointing ambassadors in each other's capitals, signaling a warming of relations between the two countries. This decision follows a trilateral meeting in Beijing with their Chinese counterpart, Wang Yi, who expressed China's willingness to assist in improving Afghanistan-Pakistan relations. Relations between the two neighbors have been strained due to accusations that Kabul harbors Tehreek-e-Taliban Pakistan (TTP) and Pakistan's deportation of Afghans. The move is seen as a positive step toward enhanced bilateral cooperation.</p>

          <p>A rare, gold lobster was saved from being cooked at a restaurant in Rhode Island after a cook noticed its unusual coloration. The lobster, named Calvin, has a genetic mutation that occurs in approximately one in 30 million lobsters, resulting in a yellowish-orange shell. The restaurant donated Calvin to the Biomes Marine Biology Center, where it will be displayed for educational purposes. The center's director noted that gold lobsters are often mistaken for more common orange lobsters and emphasized the large number of lobsters caught, highlighting concerns about lobster stock depletion.</p>

          <p>The debate over women serving in combat roles has been reignited after Defense Secretary Pete Hegseth ordered gender-neutral fitness standards for all combat jobs. Emelie Vanasse, one of the first women to serve as an Army infantry officer, recounts her experience at Ranger School, emphasizing that she met the same standards as the men. Vanasse argues that lethality in combat extends beyond physical fitness to include tactical skills, decision-making, and leadership. She criticizes Secretary Hegseth's assertion that standards were lowered for women in combat, stating that it discounts the accomplishments of women who came before her.</p>

The California Model is based on the idea that imprisonment should focus on accountability and rehabilitation, offering inmates the chance to change and providing hope. The success of the California Model relies on having incarcerated people who want to change, and it is seen as a way to improve public safety and save money in the long run.</p>

          <p>Governors Tim Walz and Wes Moore advocated for a more forceful Democratic party at Jim Clyburn's Fish Fry in South Carolina. They emphasized the importance of recognizing the political gravity of the moment and actively engaging with various constituencies. While both governors denied any plans for a 2028 presidential run, they stressed the need to focus on the present and deliver an alternative to Trump.
