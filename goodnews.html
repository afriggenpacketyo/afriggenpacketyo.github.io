          <p>A new bill introduced in Congress seeks to classify National Weather Service (NWS) forecasters and staff as critical public safety roles. This legislation comes after the NWS experienced significant staff reductions due to DOGE cuts, losing nearly 600 employees. The bill aims to provide job security for weather service employees, recognizing their importance in public safety. By classifying these positions as critical, the bill intends to ensure that qualified professionals are available to provide accurate and timely weather forecasts.</p>

          <p>Centrus Energy, the only publicly traded uranium enricher, is seeking to diminish the U.S.'s reliance on foreign state-owned corporations for nuclear fuel. CEO Amir Vexler emphasized that current Western enrichment capacity is barely sufficient for existing plants, let alone planned expansions. With President Trump aiming to quadruple U.S. nuclear capacity by 2050, a significant increase in enrichment capacity is necessary. The U.S. currently relies on foreign countries for about 70% of its reactor fuel, including a substantial amount from Russia, which will be phased out by 2028. (not investment advice)</p>

This positive momentum in the IPO market is a boon for Goldman Sachs' investment banking business, which generates revenue from facilitating deals. The resurgence in IPO activity signals a potential recovery for a division that has been sluggish due to macroeconomic uncertainty. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>An escaped zebra named Ed has been located in Tennessee, nearly a week after escaping its owners. Rutherford County sheriff's deputies are tracking the zebra using a drone in a field near Christiana. The owners, Taylor and Laura Ford, originally named the zebra Zeke but renamed it Ed due to public interest. Animal advocacy groups have criticized the situation, stating that zebras are wild animals and do not belong in backyards. The sheriff's office is working with a veterinarian to safely capture the animal.</p>
