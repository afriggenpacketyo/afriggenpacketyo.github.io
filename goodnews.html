          <p>The UK government plans to invest ¬£1.5 billion in at least six new munitions and explosives factories to bolster its defense capabilities and deter adversaries. This investment aims to support the production of up to 7,000 UK-built long-range weapons and create approximately 1,800 new jobs across the country. Defense Secretary John Healey emphasized that lessons from the war in Ukraine highlight the need for a strong domestic defense industry. The move is part of the government's Strategic Defence Review and aims to ensure an "always on" munitions production capacity that can be quickly scaled up.</p>
