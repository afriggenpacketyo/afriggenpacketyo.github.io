          <p>President Trump declared that the US will double tariffs on steel and aluminum imports, raising them from 25% to 50%, in a move intended to bolster the domestic steel industry and decrease reliance on China. Speaking at a rally in Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania, Trump asserted that this action would stimulate local steel production and national output, while also securing the survival of US Steel. Trump highlighted a $14 billion investment into the area's steel production through a partnership between US Steel and Japan's Nippon Steel, though details remain unclear. Trump emphasized that the increased tariffs would prevent foreign steel from undercutting American manufacturers, ensuring the industry's resurgence. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>An opinion piece in the New York Times explores a possible link between the rise of therapy culture and declining childbirth rates among millennials and Gen Z. The author suggests that the redefinition of "harm," "abuse," and "trauma" has led to increasingly high standards for parenting, making the prospect of parenthood daunting for many. The author posits that the fear of failing to meet these standards may be contributing to the trend of childlessness. This cultural shift has contributed to a new, nearly impossible standard for parenting, making potential parents dread parenthood.</p>

          <p>Stablecoins, digital tokens pegged to the U.S. dollar, emerged as a key topic at the Bitcoin 2025 conference in Las Vegas, driving discussions about financial and political shifts in Washington. Vice President JD Vance endorsed crypto and stablecoins as a force multiplier for U.S. economic might, with White House officials highlighting their potential to streamline payment rails and unlock trillions in global demand for American debt. Legislation like the GENIUS Act and efforts in the House are aimed at establishing a regulatory framework for stablecoin issuers, with potential implications for the U.S. dollar's dominance as the world's reserve currency. Tether CEO Paolo Ardoino anticipates commodity trading firms will be major drivers of stablecoin adoption, while the SEC is shifting towards a more industry-friendly approach.</p>

          <p>A bipartisan group of over 130 retired judges has filed a brief urging a federal court to drop charges against Wisconsin Judge Hannah Dugan, arguing that her arrest undermines judicial immunity. Dugan was arrested by FBI agents for allegedly preventing the arrest of a man by immigration authorities at her courthouse. The judges argue that Dugan is entitled to absolute immunity for her official acts, similar to members of the legislative and executive branches. They call the prosecution an "egregious overreach by the executive branch" that threatens public trust in the judicial system.</p>

Trump blamed decades of Washington betrayals for the decline of the American steel industry and claimed the Nippon investment would make the American steelmaker synonymous with greatness.

          <p>The Public Broadcasting Service (PBS) has filed a lawsuit against President Trump to block his attempt to cut off its federal funding, accusing him of retaliating against the public broadcaster over "perceived political slights in news coverage." PBS argues that Trump's executive order violates the Constitution and a half-century-old law governing public television, which prohibits him from defunding PBS or serving as the arbiter of its programming. The lawsuit contends that the order infringes on PBS's editorial independence and violates the Constitution's protections of speech and press freedom. The White House claims the CPB was creating media to support a particular political party on the taxpayers' dime.</p>

          <p>China's "smart cities" initiative, which aims to use AI in urban management, faces similar challenges to those in other parts of the world, including privacy protection and limited community involvement. Cities like Nanjing are using AI to plan patrol routes and focus on areas often ignored by human patrols. While China has made rapid progress in scaling up the use of AI in urban management, analysts warn that the country's AI governance faces challenges that are mirrored globally. The Chinese leadership views AI as a tool for transforming the economy and refining governance.</p>

          <p>King Charles was gifted a Rolls-Royce Cullinan Series II motor car by the King of Bahrain, Hamad bin Isa al-Khalifa, as a coronation present. The car, valued at at least ¬£300,000, will be used for official purposes and not for personal use. Buckingham Palace released records listing the official gifts received by members of the Royal Family from 2020 to 2023, including a feather crown from Amazonian Indigenous leaders and two gold Blue Peter badges. Official gifts can be worn and used but are not considered the royals' personal property and eventually become part of the Royal Collection.</p>

          <p>Stephanie Case, an ultramarathon runner and new mom, breastfed her six-month-old daughter three times during a 100-kilometer race in Wales and went on to win the race. Case took breaks to breastfeed her daughter at checkpoints along the demanding course, defying conventional ideas about motherhood and athleticism. She consumed about 80 to 100 grams of carbohydrates an hour to fuel herself and maintain her milk supply during the race. Case hopes her victory will inspire other new moms to pursue their goals and maintain their identities as athletes.</p>

          <p>A key U.S. inflation gauge showed price growth cooled in April, with consumer prices rising just 2.1% compared to a year earlier, down from 2.3% in March. Despite rising incomes, spending by Americans slowed, potentially reflecting an early reaction to higher prices on some imported goods. Economists and business executives have warned that prices will likely head higher as Trump's widespread tariffs take effect, though the timing and impact of those duties are now in doubt due to legal challenges. The Federal Reserve is monitoring inflation and is expected to keep interest rates steady while evaluating the impact of tariffs on inflation and jobs. (not investment advice)</p>

          <h2>California Contests Trump Administration's Claim of Obstructing Immigration Law</h2>
          <div class="timestamp">2025-05-30 17:35:40 EDT</div>

          <p>California is challenging the Trump administration's claim that the state obstructs federal immigration law, requesting its removal from the list of sanctuary jurisdictions. Governor Gavin Newsom's office argued that federal court rulings have rejected the assertion that California law unlawfully obstructs the enforcement of federal immigration laws. The state's sanctuary policies, strengthened in 2018, aim to balance preventing local law enforcement from being used to round up law-abiding immigrants with allowing federal enforcement of immigration laws. The Trump administration's claim that California's sanctuary policies protect criminals from deportation has been repeatedly denied by Newsom.</p>
