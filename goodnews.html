          <p>The Ferrero Group, known for Nutella and Rocher chocolates, has announced its intention to purchase the cereal company WK Kellogg for approximately $3.1 billion. This acquisition includes well-known brands like Corn Flakes and Froot Loops, significantly expanding Ferrero's presence in the U.S., Canadian, and Caribbean markets. The deal, priced at $23 per share, caused WK Kellogg's stock to surge over 35%. This move is part of Ferrero's broader strategy to grow its international footprint, following previous acquisitions of Nestle's U.S. candy brands and Wells Enterprises ice cream.

          <p>The U.S. Department of Defense is set to become the largest shareholder in MP Materials, the owner of the only operational rare earth mine in the United States. The Pentagon will invest $400 million to expand the company's processing and magnet production capabilities, which are crucial for military hardware like F-35 jets and drones. This public-private partnership aims to reduce U.S. reliance on China for these critical materials, which currently supplies about 70% of imports. The investment caused MP Materials' shares to surge by approximately 50%. (not investment advice)</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Amazon's cloud division, AWS, has engineered its own hardware, the In-Row Heat Exchanger (IRHX), to cool the next generation of power-intensive Nvidia GPUs used in artificial intelligence. The company determined that existing commercial solutions were inadequate for its large-scale data centers, which are accommodating the massive energy demands of the AI boom. This custom hardware allows AWS to efficiently integrate Nvidia's latest high-density computing systems, like the GB200 NVL72, into its infrastructure. The move reflects Amazon's strategy of developing in-house hardware to reduce reliance on third parties and improve profitability.</p>

          <p>North Carolina has been ranked as the best state for business in the U.S. for 2025, according to CNBC's annual study. The state's success is attributed to its strong economy, which saw 3.7% GDP growth, and a world-class workforce that is attracting major investments from companies like Amazon and JetZero. Despite its political divisions, both parties in the state support pro-business policies. However, the article notes potential headwinds from federal policy changes, including cuts to Medicaid and FEMA, and a low ranking for Quality of Life due to a lack of worker protections.</p>

          <p>Delta Air Lines' shares surged after the company reinstated its 2025 profit forecast and projected a stronger-than-expected summer travel season. CEO Ed Bastian noted that while consumer booking patterns have shifted to be closer to travel dates, demand has stabilized after a dip earlier in the year. The airline now expects full-year earnings between $5.25 and $6.25 a share, revising a more optimistic January forecast. Strong growth from premium cabin sales and its American Express partnership helped bolster revenues, even as main cabin sales and overall fares have fallen. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>The UK's National Crime Agency (NCA) has arrested four individuals in connection with the major cyber-attacks that recently targeted retailers M&S and the Co-op. The suspects, including a 20-year-old woman and three teenage males, were apprehended on suspicion of blackmail, money laundering, and other computer misuse offenses. The hacks caused significant disruption, including bare shelves at the Co-op and an estimated £300m in lost profits for M&S.

          <p>Vietnam's government has approved a plan to substantially raise the special consumption tax on alcohol, from the current 65% to 90% by 2031. The move is part of a broader effort to curb what officials see as excessive and harmful drinking habits and to improve public health. The tax hike is also seen as a way to generate revenue for the state's ambitious goal of providing universal health insurance coverage. The alcohol industry has opposed the measure, warning of declining sales and the risk of pushing consumers toward a large, unregulated black market.</p>

          <p>Nepal is experiencing a significant surge in electric vehicle (EV) adoption, with the number of EVs increasing from 250 in 2020 to over 13,000 in 2024. This shift is driven by favorable government policies, including lower taxes on EVs compared to gasoline cars, and a desire to combat severe air pollution in cities like Kathmandu. The government has set an ambitious target for 90% of new private vehicle sales to be electric by 2030. While challenges like a lack of skilled technicians remain, the country is leveraging its abundant hydropower to create a sustainable transport ecosystem.</p>

          <p>A new book, "Loud and Clear," examines the Grateful Dead's legendary "Wall of Sound," a massive and innovative sound system from the early 1970s. The colossal rig, weighing as much as a dozen elephants, was designed to provide a perfect, consistent audio experience for the entire audience by placing the entire PA system behind the band. While a utopian concept, the wall was a logistical nightmare, plagued by technical glitches and immense costs that contributed to the band's eventual hiatus in 1974. The article reflects on this tension between technological perfection and practical sustainability in live music.</p>

          <p>As of July 10, 2025, the price of gold is reported at $3,331.03 per ounce. The article explains that gold is often viewed as a safe-haven asset and an inflation hedge, with its value historically holding steady during times of economic or market uncertainty. It outlines the various factors that influence the precious metal's price, including supply and demand, global economic conditions, inflation, interest rates, and geopolitical events. The text notes that because gold is priced in U.S. dollars, its value can also be inversely affected by currency fluctuations. (not investment advice)</p>
