        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Following a call between senior officials, the U.S. and China agreed to maintain open communication lines, indicating continued engagement towards a broader trade agreement. The call, between Chinese Vice Foreign Minister Ma Zhaoxu and U.S. Deputy Secretary of State Christopher Landau, follows high-level talks in Geneva where both sides agreed to temporarily lower tariffs. This call signals a reconnection on the diplomatic level and may pave the way for future talks on curbing fentanyl flows, a key priority for President Trump. The meeting also comes as trade tensions have raised fears of economic decoupling between the world's two largest economies.</p>

        </div>
        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Energy regulator Ofgem announced that energy bills in England, Scotland, and Wales will decrease by 7% in July, marking the first price drop in a year. This translates to a ¬£129 reduction in the annual bill for a typical household using gas and electricity. While this provides some relief, many people still struggle to afford energy, with customers owing suppliers approximately ¬£4 billion. Despite the decrease, prices remain significantly higher than historical levels, and the regulator's price cap does not apply in Northern Ireland, which operates its own energy market.</p>

          <p>Train services on Tokyo's busy Yamanote Line resumed Friday morning after being suspended for checks following pantograph issues.

Services on the Keihin-Tohoku Line, which runs alongside the loop line, also experienced suspensions but have fully resumed.

          <p>BYD, a Chinese carmaker, has outsold Tesla in Europe for battery electric vehicles (BEVs) in April, marking a significant milestone despite substantial tariffs on cars imported from mainland China. BYD's BEV sales increased by 169% year-on-year, reaching 7,231 units, while Tesla's sales declined by 49% to 7,165 units. This shift indicates the growing influence of Chinese carmakers in the European EV market, even with tariffs in place. Overall, BEVs accounted for 17% of new car registrations in Europe, with Chinese firms contributing significantly to the sector's growth.</p>

Rice prices have doubled over the year, with Prime Minister Ishiba pledging to lower them.
