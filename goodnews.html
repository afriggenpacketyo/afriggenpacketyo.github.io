          <p>Nvidia CEO Jensen Huang sold approximately $36.4 million in company stock as part of a pre-arranged trading plan. This sale occurs as Nvidia's stock continues to surge due to its dominance in the AI chip market, recently becoming the first company to exceed a $4 trillion market capitalization. Huang's personal net worth has soared to $143 billion, placing him in close competition with Berkshire Hathaway's Warren Buffett. The continued investor confidence in AI has dramatically increased both Huang's wealth and Nvidia's market valuation. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>For Americans on a fixed Social Security income, managing credit card debt can feel overwhelming, but debt forgiveness is a potential option. Qualifying often requires demonstrating financial hardship, a criterion that living on Social Security can help meet, strengthening one's negotiating position. However, saving the required lump sum for a settlement can be difficult on a limited budget. It's also important to note that federal law protects Social Security benefits from being garnished by credit card companies, offering a layer of security. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>High-yield savings accounts remain an attractive option for savers, with interest rates significantly higher than traditional accounts. A major advantage is the ability to earn substantial interest while maintaining flexible access to funds, which is crucial amid economic uncertainty. However, a key drawback is that these high rates are variable and likely to fall as the Federal Reserve is expected to cut rates later this year. Furthermore, the best rates are typically offered by online-only banks, which may be a downside for those who prefer traditional in-person banking. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>The price of Bitcoin surged to a new record high, surpassing $118,000, driven by the largest single-day inflow into Bitcoin ETFs this year, totaling $1.18 billion. The rally reflects growing institutional investment and speculation that future Federal Reserve leadership will be more dovish on monetary policy. This week's price increase triggered over $650 million in short liquidations, further fueling the upward momentum. The market remains optimistic about crypto's performance, anticipating more corporate adoption and potential new legislation favorable to the sector. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>English cricketer Joe Root has broken the world record for the most catches by a non-wicketkeeper in Test match history, surpassing Rahul Dravid's previous record of 210. Root secured his 211th catch during the third Test against India at Lord's, a milestone in his 156th Test match. A prolific batter, Root has spent most of his career positioned at first slip, a key fielding position that demands high concentration. He credits his early development and consistent practice for his success in a role where both opportunities and pressure are immense.</p>

          <p>Goldman Sachs is testing an autonomous AI software engineer named Devin, developed by the startup Cognition, marking a significant step in AI adoption on Wall Street. The bank's tech chief stated that Devin will augment the firm's 12,000 human developers by handling tedious tasks like code updates. This move signals a shift towards "agentic AI," where programs can execute complex, multi-step jobs with minimal human supervision. While raising productivity, the introduction of autonomous agents like Devin is also sparking renewed concerns about the future of human jobs in the financial sector.</p>

          <p>The European Union is pushing to secure an agreement on its new 2040 climate target by September, though the plan faces opposition from several member states. The European Commission has proposed a 90% reduction in emissions from 1990 levels, a goal that has created political friction. While most countries support the timeline, nations like Poland and Hungary argue that more time is needed to consider the profound economic impacts. The debate highlights the challenge of balancing ambitious climate action with economic concerns like defense spending and industrial support.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Amid debates over IVF and declining birth rates, a significant part of the fertility equation, male infertility, is often overlooked in policy discussions. Infertility in heterosexual couples stems from male factors as often as female ones, yet men are frequently not evaluated, and their treatments are less likely to be covered by insurance. This places a disproportionate medical and emotional burden on women, who undergo invasive procedures like IVF even when the issue is with their partner. Experts suggest that expanding access to male-specific fertility care could offer a less invasive, politically viable way to address falling birth rates.</p>

Following a successful trial by FIFA at the Club World Cup, the league has entered discussions with the International Football Association Board (IFAB) to use the technology. If approved, the cameras, mounted on a referee's ear, could be tested in the Premier League's pre-season tournament. The technology is seen as a way to bring fans closer to the game while also potentially assisting video assistant referees.</p>
