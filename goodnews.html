          <p>A spokeswoman for former President Joe Biden has confirmed that he recently underwent Mohs surgery, a procedure used to treat skin cancer. This type of surgery involves removing thin layers of skin until no cancerous tissue remains, aiming to preserve as much healthy tissue as possible. In 2023, Biden had a cancerous basal cell carcinoma lesion removed from his chest, and this recent procedure addresses a wound observed on his head. The surgery is considered highly effective for common types of skin cancer.</p>

          <p>A previously unknown final project by David Bowie, an 18th-century musical titled "The Spectator," has been discovered among his personal archives donated to the V&A Museum. Notes found in his locked New York study reveal his deep fascination with the art, satire, and criminal underworld of 1700s London, including notorious figures like thief Jack Sheppard. This discovery sheds new light on Bowie's creative ambitions in his final months, showing his long-held desire to write for the theater, an ambition he was exploring until his death in 2016.</p>

          <p>Bryan Hooper Sr. has been released from a Minnesota prison after his murder conviction was vacated, having spent nearly 27 years incarcerated for a crime he did not commit. His 1998 conviction was based largely on the testimony of a woman who has now confessed to the murder, along with testimony from jailhouse informants who had long since recanted. The Hennepin County Attorney's Office supported his release, stating it is their duty to correct mistakes and ensure justice is served for the wrongly convicted.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Nikesh Arora, CEO of Palo Alto Networks, suggested in an interview that enterprises will likely resist adopting agentic AI browsers due to significant security concerns. He argued that these AI agents, which can perform autonomous tasks like booking flights, would require access to user credentials, creating major risks for corporate security. Arora predicted that unless strong controls oriented around enterprise security are built into these browsers, companies will not permit their use, highlighting the fundamental conflict between the autonomy of agentic AI and corporate data protection.</p>

          <p>Dallas Cowboys owner Jerry Jones defended the controversial decision to trade star defensive end Micah Parsons to the Green Bay Packers, describing it as a move "based on mathematics." Jones explained that Parsons' historic contract, which made him the highest-paid non-quarterback in the NFL, would have consumed a prohibitive amount of the team's salary cap. He argued that the draft picks received in return and the freed-up capital will allow the Cowboys to pay for multiple top-tier players, improving the team's overall depth and availability.</p>
