          <p>American Airlines has hired Nat Pieper, an industry veteran with nearly three decades of experience at carriers like Delta and Alaska Airlines, as its new chief commercial officer. The move follows the ousting of the previous CCO after a business-travel strategy failed, leading to a sharp drop in revenue projections and straining relationships with corporate clients. Pieper, who most recently led the Oneworld airline alliance, will oversee American's commercial strategy, loyalty program, and network planning. His appointment is aimed at stabilizing the airline's commercial leadership and improving its profitability, which has been lagging behind competitors.</p>

        </div>
        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>This opinion article argues that President Donald Trump's construction of a new ballroom in the White House's East Wing is not a personal vanity project, but rather a necessary addition that celebrates American power and grandeur. The author contrasts this project with past renovations by other presidents, which are framed as serving personal tastes, suggesting the ballroom will be a timeless monument for the nation. The piece contends that objections from the political left stem from a reluctance to celebrate America's global dominance. It concludes that the privately funded ballroom is a fitting contribution to the nation's executive mansion.</p>

          <p>Growth in rents for single-family homes in the U.S. slowed to a 1.4% annual increase in August, the lowest level recorded in 15 years, according to a new report from Cotality. This slowdown continues a trend seen in the second half of the year, with weakening growth across all price tiers, though regional variations remain significant. Cities like Chicago saw strong growth, while Dallas experienced a decline due to a surge in new apartment supply. The data reflects a broader cooling in the rental market, including for multifamily apartments, as a construction boom increases housing availability. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>The Trump administration is reportedly in discussions with several quantum-computing companies, including IonQ and Rigetti Computing, about the Commerce Department taking equity stakes in exchange for federal funding. This move aligns with a recent strategy of Washington taking ownership positions in industries deemed vital to national security, following similar investments in rare earths company MP Materials and semiconductor firm Intel. The policy reflects a greater willingness for government intervention in strategic sectors to bolster domestic capabilities and maintain a competitive edge, particularly against China, in critical technologies like quantum computing.

          <p>A recent round of Champions League matches highlighted the impact of emerging young talent, with a record-tying six teenagers scoring goals. While established young stars like Barcelona's Lamine Yamal made their mark, other wonderkids also announced their presence on the European stage. Chelsea featured prominently, becoming the first team in the competition's history to have three teenage goalscorers in a single match: Marc Guiu, Estevao Willian, and Tyrique George. The success of these young players underscores a trend of clubs investing in and giving significant opportunities to the next generation of football stars.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>This article posits that the contemporary debate over free speech often misses a crucial point: the freedom of the thought process behind the speech. Drawing on John Stuart Mill, the author argues that speech is not truly free if it is constrained by prejudice, hatred, or manipulation, rather than a conscientious pursuit of truth. The essay identifies threats to free thought, such as cognitive biases, the spread of propaganda, and the consolidation of media ownership by billionaires. It concludes that defending free speech requires fostering a culture that supports education, scientific inquiry, and respectful engagement with dissenting views.</p>

          <h2>Professor Argues Student Use of AI Is an Adaptation, Not an Educational Crisis</h2>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>In this opinion piece, a professor and linguist argues against the widespread panic over students using AI for their academic work. The author contends that lamenting a decline in traditional reading and essay writing is misguided, as technology has simply provided new tools for accessing information and expressing ideas. The article suggests that instead of fighting AI, educators should adapt by creating assignments that AI cannot easily complete, such as those requiring personal reflection or in-class writing. The author concludes that AI can handle grammatical busywork, potentially freeing up students to spend more time on critical thinking and developing their own ideas.</p>

          <p>Boeing has named Landon Loomis, a former White House advisor and fluent Mandarin speaker, as the new president of Boeing China. The appointment comes as the aviation giant navigates renewed U.S.-China trade tensions that have directly impacted its business, including threats from the Trump administration to restrict aircraft parts exports. Loomis, who previously served as a trade attache at the U.S. Embassy in Beijing, is expected to leverage his deep government and industry experience to stabilize Boeing's crucial relationship with China. The move is critical as Boeing faces risks of lower deliveries and losing market share to its rival, Airbus.</p>

          <p>Wealth advisors are counseling high-income clients to increase their charitable giving before the end of 2025 to maximize tax benefits that are set to decline in 2026. A new tax bill introduces provisions that will reduce the value of charitable deductions for top earners by establishing a floor and a ceiling on deductible amounts. To take advantage of the current, more favorable rules, advisors recommend 'bunching' donations—making several years' worth of contributions at once. For those short on time, contributing to a donor-advised fund (DAF) is suggested as a way to secure the deduction now while deciding on specific charities later. (not investment advice)</p>

Despite the strong results, the company warned of a challenging short-term outlook due to persistent macroeconomic issues, including price competition and the effects of U.S. import tariffs on its vehicles.

          <p>The union representing Broadway's musicians, AFM Local 802, has reached a tentative three-year labor agreement with producers, successfully averting a strike that would have shut down nearly two dozen musicals. The deal, which includes wage increases and improved health fund contributions, was announced early Thursday after mediation. The agreement follows a similar deal reached by the Actors' Equity Association, resolving labor tensions that had been building as both unions worked under expired contracts. The resolution prevents a potentially crippling blow to Broadway, which has seen a strong financial recovery since the pandemic, recently recording its highest-grossing season ever.</p>

It explores a new generation of AI-powered browsers like ChatGPT Atlas and Comet that promise to simplify web navigation by acting as agents that search, summarize, and perform tasks for the user. While these tools do not yet fully deliver on their promises, the author suggests they offer a glimpse of a cleaner, more streamlined web experience reminiscent of Google Chrome's early days.

His appearance is intended to bolster Spanberger's campaign against Republican Lt. Gov. Winsome Earle-Sears.

Wembanyama's dominance overshadowed the highly anticipated debut of Mavericks' No. 1 draft pick, Cooper Flagg, who finished with a modest 10 points and 10 rebounds. The 7-foot-4 French phenom, returning from surgery, reminded the league of his formidable talent, outplaying veteran Anthony Davis and quieting the pre-game hype surrounding Flagg.
