          <p>The Cambridge Dictionary has incorporated over 6,000 new words and phrases, including Gen Z slang terms like "skibidi," "delulu," and "tradwife," reflecting the growing influence of internet culture on the English language. "Skibidi" is a nonsense word from a viral YouTube series, "delulu" is short for delusional, and "tradwife" describes women promoting traditional gender roles online. Other additions include "lewk" for a distinctive look and "mouse jiggler" for a device used to feign activity while working remotely, highlighting how modern work and social trends are shaping everyday speech.</p>

          <p>Most Asia-Pacific markets saw gains on Monday as investors anticipated details from the upcoming talks between the U.S. and Ukraine, following a U.S.-Russia summit that did not result in a ceasefire. Japan's Nikkei 225 and Hong Kong's Hang Seng Index advanced, while South Korea's Kospi experienced a decline. In economic news, Singapore's non-oil domestic exports contracted more than expected in July. The market movements reflect cautious optimism, influenced by a strong previous week on Wall Street driven by hopes for U.S. Federal Reserve rate cuts. (not investment advice)</p>

        </div>
        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>According to U.S. special envoy Steve Witkoff, Russian President Vladimir Putin has agreed to allow the U.S. and European allies to offer Ukraine a security guarantee similar to NATO's Article 5 collective defense principle. This development, described as a "game-changing" concession, emerged from the recent summit between President Trump and Putin in Alaska. Such an arrangement could serve as an alternative to Ukraine's formal NATO membership, a long-standing point of contention for Moscow. European leaders have welcomed the potential for these guarantees, though Ukrainian President Zelenskyy has noted that the details of how they would function remain unclear.</p>

          <h2>Actress Helen Mirren States the Role of James Bond Should Remain Male</h2>
          <div class="timestamp">2025-08-17 21:12:08 EDT</div>
        </div>
        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Dame Helen Mirren has expressed her belief that the iconic character of James Bond should continue to be portrayed by a male actor. In a recent interview, the Oscar-winning actress, who identifies as a feminist, argued that casting a woman would fundamentally change the character into something else. Her sentiment was echoed by former Bond actor Pierce Brosnan, who is starring alongside her in an upcoming film. The producers of the spy franchise have indicated they plan a "fresh" take on the character while honoring his legacy, but Mirren's comments add to the ongoing debate about the future of the 007 role.</p>

          <p>A growing movement across the Caribbean is fostering a stronger connection to the region's African heritage, driven by cultural exchange and new economic initiatives. This renewed interest, amplified by social media and the global popularity of Afrobeats music, is leading to increased travel to the continent and a greater appreciation for African traditions, food, and clothing. Concurrently, governments and financial institutions from both regions are working to enhance trade and transportation links, with leaders calling for "air and sea bridges" to forge a shared future. This modern wave of pan-Africanism is seen as more economically focused and sustainable than previous movements.</p>

          <p>At the age of 24, Coline Aguirre, a woman from France, purchased a century-old traditional farmhouse, or "kominka," in the Japanese countryside, fulfilling a dream that began during a high school exchange trip. She moved to Japan alone to undertake the restoration, teaching herself DIY skills to preserve the home's original character while modernizing essential systems. Now 27, she runs a real-estate consultancy helping others find similar properties, part of a growing trend of foreigners drawn to Japan's affordable rural homes and unique lifestyle. Her story highlights a personal journey of cultural immersion and entrepreneurial spirit.</p>

          <p>Two of China's largest drug manufacturers, Jiangsu Hengrui Pharmaceuticals and Hansoh Pharmaceutical Group, are projected to report substantial profit increases for the first half of the year. This growth is attributed to the successful rollout of innovative new drugs and increased revenue from technology licensing agreements. Analysts forecast that Hengrui's net profit could rise by as much as 40 percent. The positive outlook reflects a strategic shift within these companies, with a growing emphasis on novel drug development over the production of generic medications. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>Spanish golfer Jon Rahm has won the LIV Golf individual season championship for the second year in a row, earning the top prize of $18 million. He secured the title despite losing a playoff to Sebastian Munoz at the final regular-season event in Indiana. Rahm's overall performance throughout the season was strong enough to fend off his closest competitor, Joaquin Niemann of Chile. The result also had positive implications for European veterans Lee Westwood and Ian Poulter, who both performed well enough to avoid relegation from the league for the next season.</p>

The discussions involved high-level officials from both nations, including U.S. Treasury Secretary Scott Bessent and China's Vice-Premier He Lifeng.
