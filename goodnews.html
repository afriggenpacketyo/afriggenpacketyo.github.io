          <p>The New York Knicks are reportedly interested in Jason Kidd as a potential replacement for their head coach, Tom Thibodeau. Because Kidd is currently under contract with the Dallas Mavericks, the Knicks would need to formally request permission to speak with him. Kidd had previously interviewed with the Knicks in 2020 before Thibodeau was hired. Kidd has prior head coaching experience with the Nets and the Bucks, and he also served as an assistant coach for the Lakers. </p>

          <p>Gizmo, the second eaglet of Big Bear eagles Jackie and Shadow, has successfully taken her first flight from the nest. After a brief initial attempt, Gizmo soared into the air, joining her sister Sunny who had taken her first flight earlier in the week. The eaglets, born in March, have been practicing for their first flights for several days, flapping their wings and jumping from branch to branch. While it's unclear where Sunny and Gizmo will go, young eagles tend to return to the nest soon after their first flight and will likely remain in the habitat for one to three months.</p>

          <p>Coco Gauff has won her first French Open singles title, defeating Aryna Sabalenka in a three-set final. Gauff, the American second seed, secured a 6-7 (5-7), 6-2, 6-4 victory in a match marked by numerous breaks of serve and challenging windy conditions. This is Gauff's second Grand Slam singles title, adding to her US Open win in 2023, where she also beat Sabalenka. Gauff recovered from a shaky start, capitalizing on Sabalenka's errors to ultimately claim the victory.</p>

          <p>Charlotte Edwards began her tenure as head coach of the England women's cricket team with a clean sweep over the West Indies in both T20 and ODI series. This victory comes after a disappointing Ashes series and heavy criticism of the team's performance. While the series win is positive, it's important to note that England has historically dominated home bilateral series but struggled on the big stage. Tougher tests await, including a series against India and the 50-over World Cup in India and Sri Lanka.</p>

          <p>Cardiologists are raising concerns about the potential harm of excessive phone scrolling on heart health. Doomscrolling, especially in the morning or before bed, can increase anxiety, blood pressure, and sedentary behavior. Over time, this habit can lead to neglecting heart-healthy activities like exercise, sleep, and stress regulation. Cardiologists recommend setting time limits, avoiding scrolling in bed, and replacing the habit with healthier alternatives to protect heart health.</p>

          <p>Amid parliamentary deadlock, the politics of remembrance has gained momentum in France, with three new initiatives attempting to recognize and heal historical injustices. The French parliament voted to posthumously promote Alfred Dreyfus, recognize returnees from Indochina, and address a "double debt" to Haiti. While these initiatives are largely symbolic, they reflect a willingness to take historical responsibility, though some view them as easier to pass than structural reforms.</p>
