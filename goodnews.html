          <p>Indian Prime Minister Narendra Modi is set to visit China for the first time in seven years to meet with President Xi Jinping at the Shanghai Cooperation Organization summit. The meeting occurs against a backdrop of deep-seated suspicion and a significant trade imbalance, exacerbated by deadly border clashes in 2020. Despite these tensions, both nations face economic pressure from U.S. tariffs, potentially pushing them towards cautious cooperation. Experts remain skeptical about a long-term friendship but acknowledge the meeting as a signal of willingness to find common ground on pressing economic and supply chain issues.</p>

          <p>Dallas Cowboys owner Jerry Jones addressed the media to justify the surprising trade of star linebacker Micah Parsons to the Green Bay Packers, stating the move gives the team a "chance to be a better team." Jones emphasized that acquiring Pro Bowl defensive tackle Kenny Clark helps address the team's long-standing weakness in stopping the run. In addition to Clark, the Cowboys received two future first-round draft picks, which Jones believes can be leveraged to acquire multiple outstanding players. He maintained that the decision was a consensus among the front office and coaching staff and was not driven by any ill will over stalled contract negotiations.</p>

          <p>Conservation scientists are studying the DNA of the 'Druids Oak,' an 800-year-old tree in Buckinghamshire, to understand its remarkable longevity and resilience. The project, led by The Woodland Trust, aims to identify the genetic traits that allow ancient oaks to survive centuries of threats like climate change and disease. By analyzing the genomes of about 50 of the UK's most famous ancient oaks, researchers hope to select the best trees for future planting efforts. This knowledge could be vital for restoring Britain's woodlands and supporting the vast ecosystems that depend on these iconic trees.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Starting in January 2026, all young children in England and Wales will be offered a free chickenpox vaccine on the NHS. The vaccine will be administered in two doses at 12 and 18 months, combined with the existing MMR jab, with a catch-up program for slightly older children. Previously, parents had to pay up to £200 for the vaccine privately. Health officials hope this move will protect children from severe complications of the virus, which are rare but can be serious, and reduce the economic impact of parents taking time off work to care for sick children.</p>
