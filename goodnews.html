          <p>Traditional piano sales have plummeted dramatically since 1925, with only 17,294 units sold in 2024, reflecting profound changing cultural trends and economic pressures. Piano technician Hannah Beckett notes that millennials often struggle with homeownership, let alone purchasing a costly acoustic piano, impacting sales. However, the rise of digital and hybrid pianos offers more affordable and space-saving alternatives, crucially allowing a new generation to learn the instrument with accurate sounds and functional keys. This article suggests a cautious optimism for piano playing's future, as digital platforms provide accessible entry points and a potential resurgence as people seek alternatives to excessive screen time.</p>
