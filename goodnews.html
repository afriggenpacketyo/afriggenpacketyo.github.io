          <p>Chris Kirby, a 38-year-old entrepreneur, transformed his passion for hummus into a highly successful company, Ithaca Hummus. After leaving a burnout-inducing restaurant career, he launched his business at a local farmers market while studying at Cornell University, starting with just a $450 blender. By focusing on a quality product and a slow, deep growth strategy, the brand expanded into over 8,000 retailers nationwide. The company has generated over $150 million in lifetime sales and is projected to earn $50 million in revenue this year.</p>

          <p>Gold is widely regarded as a safe-haven asset and an inflation hedge, with its price subject to constant fluctuation. As of July 11, 2025, the price was noted at $3,357.20 per ounce, though this figure changes continuously. Key factors influencing its value include supply and demand, global economic conditions, inflation rates, and geopolitical uncertainty. Additionally, interest rates, currency movements, market sentiment, and the policies of central banks play significant roles in determining the precious metal's market price.

          <h2>The Efficacy of Classroom Brain Training Programs Remains Debated</h2>

          <p>Following learning disruptions from the COVID-19 pandemic, some experts suggest using 'brain training' programs in schools to improve children's cognitive skills like working memory. A recent German study indicated that such training improved IQ and long-term academic outcomes for young students. However, critics and other large-scale reviews express caution, noting that results from research settings often don't translate to real-world classrooms. Some researchers worry that replacing core subjects like reading with this training could be detrimental, especially for disadvantaged children, and that the overall evidence remains inconclusive.</p>

          <p>The Federal Reserve has subtly pushed back against escalating attacks from the Trump administration by publishing a "Frequently Asked Questions" page defending its $2.5 billion headquarters renovation. This move follows accusations from OMB Director Russell Vought of mismanagement and an "ostentatious overhaul," which some see as a pretext to pressure Fed Chair Jerome Powell. The Fed's webpage clarifies that costs increased due to unforeseen conditions like asbestos and design changes, and refutes claims of new "VIP dining rooms." The central bank, which is self-funded, is defending its operational independence against political pressure.</p>

          <p>The Association of Southeast Asian Nations (ASEAN) is intensifying its efforts to have global nuclear powers sign the Southeast Asia Nuclear-Weapon-Free Zone Treaty (SEANWFZ). The 1995 treaty aims to keep the region free of nuclear weapons, and Malaysia, the current ASEAN chair, is urging the US, UK, Russia, and France to endorse it. China has reportedly committed to signing the treaty without reservation, and there are indications Russia may follow suit. This diplomatic push occurs as global powers compete for influence and some ASEAN states explore civilian nuclear energy programs.</p>

          <p>The 2025 Wimbledon tournament highlighted the continued dominance of Jannik Sinner and Carlos Alcaraz in men's tennis, suggesting their rivalry will define the sport for years to come. In the women's draw, Iga Swiatek achieved a career milestone by winning on grass, completing her collection of Grand Slam titles on all three surfaces. The tournament also signaled a potential decline for Novak Djokovic, who failed to win a major, while British tennis saw promising performances and a historic men's doubles victory for Julian Cash and Lloyd Glasspool. The All England Club also faced scrutiny over a temporary failure of its new electronic line-calling system.</p>

The central bank plans to closely monitor economic conditions to effectively stimulate domestic demand and stabilize market expectations.

        </div>
        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Leah Goodridge, a former member of New York City's rent guidelines board, argues that proposals for a citywide rent freeze are not unrealistic and serve as a critical lifeline for many residents. Drawing on her experience as a tenants' rights attorney, she refutes criticisms that such measures are out of touch, pointing to the four times a freeze was implemented under the de Blasio administration based on data and reports. Goodridge contends that opposition to rent freezes is part of a broader agenda by landlords to weaken rent stabilization laws entirely. She frames the debate as a struggle against a powerful real estate industry prioritizing profits over people.</p>

          <p>An article explores the long and varied history of queerness, challenging the modern binary gender model by highlighting its acceptance in many past societies. It notes that while some historical periods saw draconian punishments for non-normative identities, others, like ancient Greece and Rome, were more accepting of same-sex relationships. The piece discusses notable queer figures from Leonardo da Vinci to Anne Lister, as well as the concept of a "third gender" in various cultures worldwide. It concludes by reflecting on the hard-won freedoms for LGBTQ+ people today and the ongoing need to protect these rights.</p>

This proposal comes as the government seeks a "fresh vision" for the state-owned enterprise, which has been plagued by the Horizon IT scandal and a poor commercial track record. The consultation will also examine the number of branches the Post Office should be required to operate and what future services it should offer, particularly banking. Proponents argue that a mutual model could help reform the organization's culture and prevent future scandals.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>This article argues that the YIMBY ("yes in my backyard") movement, which advocates for building more housing to increase affordability, is fundamentally a progressive cause rather than a centrist or libertarian one. It reframes the debate by comparing restrictive local zoning laws to a cartel's effort to limit supply and artificially inflate prices for the benefit of existing landowners. The author contends that opposing new housing development is a conservative stance that protects the wealth of a landowning elite. By fighting against this "regulatory capture," the pro-housing abundance movement aligns with populist, anti-monopoly principles aimed at creating a fairer market for everyone.</p>
