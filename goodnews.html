          <p>Financial experts recommend strategic steps to escape the payday loan debt cycle, which traps many in expensive debt. Negotiation with lenders for structured repayment plans is advised, alongside consulting credit counseling agencies or debt solutions companies. Alternatives to high-interest loans include personal loans, reduced credit card interest rates, debt transfers, family assistance, and selling unused items. Building a small emergency buffer through side gigs and exploring debt consolidation options can also help, but experts caution against debt management plans that may harm credit scores.

The visit is viewed as a symbolic gesture to reinforce Canada's independence, with Charles' presence reaffirming the country's unique national identity.

          <p>Amanda Litman, co-founder of Run for Something, argues that the Democratic party's reliance on seniority is a major weakness, as younger Democrats challenge incumbents and call out leaders who fail to push back against Trump. Her organization recruits and trains progressives under 40 to run for office, aiming to dismantle the gerontocracy. She advocates for open conversations about retirement and primaries, viewing them as clarifying and necessary for developing skilled and resilient leaders, and she emphasizes the importance of creating better workplaces to empower individuals to engage in politics.</p>
