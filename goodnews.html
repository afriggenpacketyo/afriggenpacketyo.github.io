          <p>Canada has withdrawn its planned Digital Services Tax on U.S. technology firms, paving the way for the resumption of trade talks with the United States. The move came after President Donald Trump suspended negotiations, calling the proposed 3% levy a "blatant attack" on the U.S. Canadian Prime Minister Mark Carney's office confirmed the policy reversal following a call with Trump, aiming to progress toward a new economic agreement.

          <p>Sergei Tikhanovsky, a prominent Belarusian opposition blogger, has been released from prison after five years of being held in solitary confinement. He was one of 14 political prisoners freed following a rare visit to Minsk by a senior U.S. delegation. In his first interviews, a visibly changed Tikhanovsky described the harsh conditions of his imprisonment but insisted his spirit remains unbroken. His release is seen as a diplomatic win for authoritarian leader Alexander Lukashenko, who has been largely isolated by the West.</p>

Trump, who has extended the deadline for the sale, suggested that any deal would likely require approval from Beijing, but expressed optimism that it would be granted.

          <p>China has conditionally resumed imports of Japanese seafood, partially lifting a blanket ban that was imposed in 2023. The suspension was enacted before Japan began releasing treated wastewater from the damaged Fukushima nuclear power plant. The new measure allows for shipments from most of Japan but maintains the ban on products from 10 prefectures, including Fukushima and Tokyo. This move is seen as a potential step towards resetting diplomatic and trade relations, which have been strained over the Fukushima water release issue.</p>

        </div>
        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>As electric vehicles (EVs) become more common, a growing number of passengers are reporting motion sickness. Research from institutions in China suggests that the unique acceleration and deceleration patterns of EVs are a primary cause. Specifically, the regenerative braking system, which recharges the battery while slowing the car, produces low-frequency movements that can induce queasiness. This issue of passenger comfort and health is becoming a key consideration for automakers as they continue to refine EV technology for a broader market.</p>
