          <p>Dr. Jane Goodall, the pioneering conservationist whose groundbreaking research in the 1960s transformed the world's understanding of chimpanzees, has passed away at the age of 91. Her work in Tanzania revealed that chimpanzees make and use tools, a discovery that challenged the definition of humanity itself. Goodall dedicated her life to advocacy, founding the Jane Goodall Institute to protect wildlife and establishing the Roots & Shoots youth program to inspire environmental stewardship globally.</p>

          <p>Intel's stock saw a 7% increase after a report indicated the company is in preliminary discussions to manufacture chips for its competitor, AMD. This potential partnership would be a major victory for Intel's foundry business, which aims to produce chips for other companies. Securing a major rival like AMD as a customer would signal strong confidence in Intel's manufacturing capabilities and could attract other significant clients, marking a key step in the company's turnaround strategy.</p>

          <p>A new bilingual special series from NPR, titled "Cumbia Across Latin America," documents the evolution of cumbia music from its origins on the Colombian coast. Born from a blend of African, Indigenous, and European influences, the genre has spread across the Americas, becoming a symbol of Latin American identity. Supported by the National Geographic Explorer Program, photographers traveled through six countries to capture the people and places that keep the vibrant musical tradition alive.</p>

          <p>As part of a broader series, this article explores the birthplace of cumbia in Colombia's Caribbean coastal region, where African, Indigenous, and European cultures converged. The music's roots are tied to the history of enslaved Africans, whose drum rhythms blended with Indigenous flutes and European song structures. Despite historical suppression and regional conflict, the genre has endured as a powerful form of cultural expression, with Black and Afro-descendant women playing a central role in preserving its legacy.</p>

          <p>The U.S. Supreme Court has issued an order allowing Federal Reserve Governor Lisa Cook to temporarily remain in her position, denying President Trump's request for her immediate removal. Trump had sought to fire Cook, a Biden appointee, over allegations of mortgage fraud, which she denies. Cook sued to block her removal, arguing it was an illegal attempt at political interference with the independent central bank. The court will hear full arguments on the matter in January, allowing Cook to continue participating in interest rate decisions for now.</p>

          <p>Following the Federal Reserve's recent interest rate cut, the cost of borrowing against home equity has become slightly more affordable for homeowners. A $70,000 home equity loan with a 15-year term now carries an average monthly payment of around $677, which is marginally lower than costs seen earlier in the year and last fall. While rates have declined, the article advises homeowners to carefully compare options, as the savings may be negligible and alternatives like a HELOC could be more suitable depending on individual financial circumstances.

          <p>General Motors and Ford both reported an approximately 8% increase in their third-quarter U.S. auto sales, largely driven by record demand for electric vehicles. Consumers appeared to rush to purchase EVs before the expiration of a $7,500 federal tax incentive at the end of September. GM's EV sales more than doubled compared to the previous year, while Ford's saw a 30% increase. This surge helped the overall industry achieve a higher-than-expected sales pace, with EVs capturing a record market share during the quarter.</p>

Neptune's CEO highlighted that his company remains open for business, able to provide insurance for homebuyers who would otherwise face delays in closing on their properties. The company uses AI to assess risk and offers higher coverage limits than the federal program. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>Amid rising financial stress for many households, this article explores several alternatives to filing for bankruptcy, a step with long-term negative consequences for credit. Strategies include debt consolidation through a personal loan to simplify payments and lower interest rates, and working with a credit counseling agency on a debt management plan. Other options are negotiating lower lump-sum settlements directly with creditors or enrolling in temporary creditor hardship programs. These methods can provide significant relief without the lasting damage that bankruptcy can inflict on one's financial future. (not investment advice)</p>
