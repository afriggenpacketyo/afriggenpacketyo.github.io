          <p>Rumeysa Ozturk, a Turkish student at Tufts University, was released from federal custody after a judge ordered her immediate release. She had been detained for six weeks, sparking outrage over immigration policies. Ozturk's visa was canceled amidst the Trump administration's crackdown on higher education, with accusations of antisemitism. Supporters argue she was detained in retaliation for criticizing the university's response to pro-Palestinian demands in a student newspaper. The article highlights the emotional toll on Ozturk and her supporters, with her release delayed due to the government's attempt to make her wear an ankle monitor.</p>

          <p>Willie Eugene Sims, 69, has been charged with the 1977 murder of Jeannette Ralston in San Jose, California, after nearly 50 years. Ralston was found strangled in her car, and the case went cold due to a lack of leads. The break came when a thumbprint on a cigarette carton from the crime scene matched Sims in the F.B.I.‚Äôs database, thanks to an upgraded fingerprint search algorithm. Sims, who had a prior conviction for assault, was identified through DNA evidence and an old sketch, bringing closure to Ralston's family.</p>
