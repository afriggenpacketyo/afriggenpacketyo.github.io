          <p>SpaceX successfully launched its massive Super Heavy-Starship rocket on its tenth test flight, marking a major triumph after previous failures and a series of delays. The Starship upper stage completed its planned suborbital trajectory, successfully deployed eight Starlink satellite simulators, and performed a controlled splashdown in the Indian Ocean, despite some re-entry damage to its protective skirt and a control flap. The Super Heavy booster also executed a successful splashdown in the Gulf of Mexico. This achievement is crucial for NASA's Artemis program and Elon Musk's long-term goals of Mars colonization, providing much-needed momentum for the ambitious project.</p>

China's industrial profits showed a notable recovery in July, slipping only 1.5% from a year earlier, marking the slowest pace of decline in five months. Concurrently, significant U.S. tariffs of 25%, pushing overall duties to 50%, are set to impact Indian exports, raising concerns about India's manufacturing appeal and economic growth.

During the contest, Contreras was ejected following an animated argument with plate umpire Derek Thomas, an incident where he also threw a bat that mistakenly hit a coach and tossed bubble gum on the field. Contreras intends to appeal the suspension, which allows him to play in Tuesday night's game. Crew chief Jordan Baker stated Contreras and manager Oliver Marmol were ejected for "saying vulgar stuff" and that Contreras made contact with the umpire.</p>

          <p>SpaceX's Starship megarocket achieved a successful 10th test flight, overcoming a series of explosive failures that had plagued the program this year. The 403-foot-tall vehicle launched from Texas, with its upper stage separating as planned and deploying mock Starlink satellites for the first time, a critical milestone. The Starship then made a successful splashdown in the Indian Ocean after enduring intense re-entry heat, a phase that previously shredded the rocket. This success is vital for Elon Musk's vision of Mars colonization and NASA's lunar missions, demonstrating the company's "fail fast, learn fast" development approach and its commitment to reusability.</p>
