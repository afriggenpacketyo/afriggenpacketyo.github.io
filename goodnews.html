          <p>Actor Richard Dreyfuss, 77, announced he would not be attending the SharkCon fan event in Tampa, Florida, due to a severe case of viral bronchitis. In a video message, the "Jaws" star explained that his doctors advised him against flying to prevent his illness from worsening and to avoid spreading it to others. Dreyfuss expressed his regret to fans, stating that his health must come first, and promised to attend a future event. The convention confirmed that all pre-paid photo ops and autographs with the actor would be automatically refunded.</p>

          <p>French President Emmanuel Macron announced plans to significantly increase France's defense budget, citing unprecedented threats to freedom since 1945. The annual defense spending is now set to reach €64 billion by 2027, a goal previously slated for 2030 and double the amount from when Macron took office in 2017. Macron justified the accelerated spending by pointing to Russia's war in Ukraine, conflicts in the Middle East, and growing uncertainty from the United States. He emphasized that to be free, France must be powerful and feared on the global stage. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>The latest "Superman" film, written and directed by James Gunn, launched with an estimated $122 million in ticket sales across the U.S. and Canada. This opening marks a crucial test for DC Studios, which has recently seen several of its superhero films underperform. The debut is the third largest of 2025 and the first DC title to surpass the $100 million opening weekend mark since 2017's "Wonder Woman." While the domestic performance was strong, international ticket sales were weaker, with the film earning $95 million from 78 markets.</p>

          <p>Italy's Jannik Sinner has won his first Wimbledon title, defeating two-time defending champion Carlos Alcaraz in a four-set final. The victory marks a significant comeback for the world number one, who had lost a five-set match to Alcaraz at the French Open just a month prior after holding championship points. Sinner's composed performance on Centre Court ended Alcaraz's 24-match winning streak and secured his fourth career Grand Slam title. The match is being hailed as another classic installment in the growing rivalry between the two young stars of men's tennis.</p>

          <p>Senators Lindsey Graham and Richard Blumenthal are leading a bipartisan effort to pass a sanctions bill that would give the president a "sledgehammer" against Russia's economy. The proposed legislation, which has 85 cosponsors, would allow for tariffs up to 500% on countries like China, India, and Brazil that support Russia's war effort by purchasing its goods. Graham stated that after months of President Trump leaving the door open for diplomacy with Putin, that door is now closing due to Russia's continued aggression. The move signals a potential turning point in the U.S. approach to the war in Ukraine. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>A 1940s-era fortune cookie factory in Denver has been transformed into a free public art gallery by its new owner, Amanda Precourt. After purchasing the dilapidated building nearly a decade ago, Precourt spent eight years renovating the space, which she hopes will serve as a place for community connection and healing through art. The gallery, named the Cookie Factory, opened in May and aims to provide a serene environment for visitors to engage with art. Its inaugural exhibition features nature-based work by artist Sam Falls and will run through September before a new artist is featured.</p>

          <p>Senator Maria Cantwell has called for a major, bipartisan investment to upgrade the nation's weather forecasting systems, labeling it a "national responsibility" following the deadly floods in Texas. As chair of the Senate Commerce Committee, Cantwell is pushing for improved technology like Doppler radar and better data analytics to provide more advanced warnings for extreme weather events. She argued that a small investment in science and forecasting at the federal level could save lives and prevent future tragedies like the one in Kerr County.

          <p>The European Union has announced it will suspend retaliatory tariffs on U.S. goods that were scheduled to take effect, hoping to negotiate a trade deal with the Trump administration by August 1. The decision came after President Trump threatened to impose new 30% tariffs on EU goods, escalating trade tensions. European Commission President Ursula von der Leyen stated that while the EU prefers a negotiated solution, it will continue preparing countermeasures in case a deal is not reached. The move provides a brief window to de-escalate a trade dispute that could impact trillions of dollars in transatlantic commerce. (not investment advice)</p>
