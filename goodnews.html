          <p>Despite facing backlash and shifting public sentiment, the movement to defund the police has led to progress in some cities, including Austin and Seattle. Inspired by calls for alternatives to policing, Seattle launched a third public safety department that responds to mental health crises. Austin has increased investment in homeless services after diverting funds from the police budget. Organizers say the movement has sparked conversations about city priorities and reimagining public safety. Some experts suggest the Trump administration's commitment to increasing law enforcement may inspire renewed interest in alternatives to policing.</p>

          <p>A recent study indicates that UK employees work from home more than nearly any of their global counterparts, averaging 1.8 days a week. Hybrid working patterns have become the dominant model in advanced economies, particularly in English-speaking countries. The popularity of home working in the UK is attributed to commuting costs and length. While some companies have implemented return-to-office mandates, home working levels in the UK have stabilized. The study also found that younger workers prefer office work for networking and learning opportunities.</p>

          <p>A recent study published in the journal *Food Science* challenges the assumption that homemade foods are inherently more nutritious or safer than industrially produced food items. The study compared nutritional values and harmful compounds in processed and homemade versions of common foods, finding that homemade options do not necessarily offer superior quality. Experts note that food processing can allow for tighter control of temperature and hygiene. While homemade preparation allows consumers to control ingredients, monitoring nutritional parameters is crucial regardless of where the food is prepared.</p>

The cub requires four enrichment and feeding sessions daily and will remain in the center's care for up to a year, with the goal of returning him to the wild.

          <p>Real estate experts are advising new homeowners to review their property tax assessments for accuracy. Inaccuracies in the assessment could result in overpayment of property taxes. New homeowners typically have the necessary documents, such as the title report and home inspection report, to appeal an inaccurate assessment. The title report can tell you the age of the house, while the home inspection report details the property's flaws. Experts say that a home sale will typically trigger a property tax reassessment because the property is changing hands.</p>

        </div>
        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Research suggests that the sensitivity of human teeth, which causes discomfort from cold or dental procedures, can be traced back to the exoskeletons of ancient armored fish. Scientists initially believed that certain fossils were the earliest vertebrates but later discovered they were invertebrates with structures similar to vertebrate teeth. The study found that these structures were likely used for sensing, and modern fish embryos have nerves in their tooth-like scales. This suggests that our teeth inherited the ability to sense pain and temperature from ancient fish.</p>
