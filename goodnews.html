          <h2>Students Recreate Ancient Rice Dish with Surprisingly Healthy Outcome</h2>
          <div class="timestamp">2025-05-04 07:00:51 EDT</div>

          <p>Researchers at Hunan University in China collaborated with students to recreate an ancient rice dish based on a 2,000-year-old bamboo manuscript called "Shi Fang." The manuscript contains recipes from the Han Dynasty era, including steamed fish and chicken soup. Using wooden steamers and clay pots, the students prepared a non-glutinous rice dish that turned out to be "loose yet elastic" in texture. The ancient rice had a pleasing texture and a lower sugar content than modern rice, leading researchers to describe it as a "comfort food." The project deepened the students' appreciation for traditional Chinese culture and ancient culinary practices.</p>

          <p>Dani Bowman and James B. Jones, stars of Netflix's "Love on the Spectrum," have voiced their disapproval of Robert F. Kennedy Jr.'s controversial statements about autism. Kennedy had suggested that autism "destroys families" and imposes significant limitations on individuals. Bowman, founder of DaniMation, and Jones, a technical support professional, both challenged Kennedy's remarks, emphasizing that autistic individuals are capable and can lead independent, fulfilling lives with support. They advocate for understanding and opportunity rather than pity or stereotypes, and some went as far as to call for Kennedy's resignation from his position.</p>

          <h2>Federal Reserve's Powell May Resist Pressure to Cut Interest Rates</h2>
          <div class="timestamp">2025-05-04 06:46:02 EDT</div>
        </div>
        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Federal Reserve Chair Jerome Powell faces a challenging situation as he considers whether to hold interest rates steady amid concerns about inflation and mounting pressure from President Trump to cut rates. Recent government data showing a healthy increase in April payrolls could support the Fed's decision to maintain current rates. However, uncertainty remains due to potential impacts from higher U.S. duties on imports. Economists anticipate Powell will prioritize price stability, given concerns that inflation expectations may be loosening, especially with solid job growth.</p>

          <p>In a guest essay for The New York Times, Helen Schulman reflects on her 33-year marriage, noting that she now hates her husband less, attributing it to his aging well and the collapse of his industry. She humorously recounts their early relationship and the challenges of balancing careers and raising children. Schulman acknowledges the unequal distribution of domestic responsibilities despite being a working mother steeped in second-wave feminism. She now appreciates her relationship more, recognizing the difficulties of managing life's demands and cherishing the present with her husband.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Traders across Africa are increasingly using China's yuan instead of the US dollar for international transactions, especially in hubs like Nairobi and Lagos. This shift is driven by the need to facilitate trade with China, the world's second-largest economy. Logistics companies play a key role, offering Kenyan Shilling-yuan conversion services and managing payments to Chinese sellers. This trend reflects a broader effort to reduce reliance on the US dollar and strengthen economic ties with China.</p>

Sarancha joined pro-Ukraine groups online and began to speak Ukrainian but only with his internet friends. He bought a new phone and filled it with pro-Russian pictures and messages. He says he likes everything about Ukraine because everyone is united for the sake of one goal.</p>

The streaming service has achieved critical success with shows like "Ted Lasso" and the Oscar-winning "CODA," attracting A-list talent and earning comparisons to HBO. However, Apple TV+'s subscriber base remains relatively small compared to competitors like Netflix, and it lacks the extensive content library of established studios. While praised for quality, the service's profitability and long-term sustainability remain subjects of debate, as Apple views it as part of a broader subscription services strategy.</p>

          <p>The Los Angeles Times conducted soil testing in Altadena and Pacific Palisades to assess contamination levels after wildfires. Reporters collected 40 soil samples from residential properties, following rigorous protocols to prevent cross-contamination. The samples were tested for 17 metals using EPA-approved methods at a state-certified laboratory. The methodology mirrored practices from previous post-wildfire efforts, but differed by collecting only one composite sample per property, which may have missed smaller contamination hotspots. The results revealed elevated levels of contaminants, highlighting potential risks to residents.</p>

          <p>President Trump's policies have had an unexpected influence on Australia's election, bolstering Prime Minister Anthony Albanese's re-election. While Albanese avoided direct criticism of Trump, the global turmoil set off by Trump's policies contributed to an anti-Trump sentiment among voters. The opposition leader's alignment with some of Trump's ideas also hurt his campaign. Voters were concerned about the rising cost of living and the impact of Trump's tariffs on their retirement accounts, leading to a resounding victory for Albanese and his Labor Party.</p>
