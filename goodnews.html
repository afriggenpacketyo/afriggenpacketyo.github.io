          <p>Two five-year-old European brown bears, Mish and Lucy, escaped their enclosure at Wildwood Devon wildlife park in England. The bears did not pose a threat to the public, who were moved to a secure building as a precaution. The animals were found in a staff food storage area, where they had feasted on a week's worth of honey and other snacks before being safely guided back to their enclosure. The park attributed the escape to an operational error and is conducting a full internal investigation to prevent future incidents.</p>

          <p>Japan has successfully launched its 50th and final H2A rocket, marking the end of a 24-year era for the country's space program.

The plaintiffs sued Trump for statements he made during a 2024 presidential debate, alleging he falsely claimed they had killed someone and pled guilty. Trump's legal team argued for dismissal under Pennsylvania's Anti-SLAPP law, which protects against lawsuits targeting public expression.
