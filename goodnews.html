        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Shares of Contemporary Amperex Technology, the world's largest battery manufacturer, experienced a significant jump in their Hong Kong trading debut. The IPO raised HK$35.7 billion, reportedly making it the largest global listing in 2025. CATL intends to allocate 90% of the funds raised to construct a new factory in Hungary, aimed at supplying batteries to European automotive clients. Despite a revenue drop in 2024 due to intense competition in China's EV market, the company's net profit increased by 15% year over year.</p>

          <p>China experienced a net capital inflow into its bond and equities markets in April, despite trade war challenges posed by the U.S. The State Administration of Foreign Exchange reported a net capital inflow of US$17.3 billion from both individuals and companies. This trend contrasts with concerns about rising Treasury yields and Moody's downgrade of the U.S. sovereign credit rating. Analysts suggest that investors are shifting away from U.S. dollar assets amid ongoing trade tensions.</p>

          <p>Richard Grenell, appointed by President Trump as the president of the Kennedy Center, has alleged that the center has "criminal" debt and deferred maintenance, planning to refer the matter to federal prosecutors.

Kennedy Center officials attributed the deficit figures to a review by the center‚Äôs new chief financial officer.

          <div class="timestamp">2025-05-19 22:03:52 EDT</div>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>China's central bank reduced its key lending rates by 10 basis points, marking the first reduction in seven months. The 1-year loan prime rate was lowered to 3.0% from 3.1%, and the 5-year LPR to 3.5% from 3.6%. The rate cuts came as state-backed commercial lenders reduced their deposit rates to protect their net interest margin. Analysts expect the PBOC to continue easing policy, forecasting further lending rate reductions by year-end. The Chinese offshore yuan has remained relatively stable, supported by a weakening U.S. dollar.</p>

          <p>A new EU deal is a reminder of the UK's uneasy relationship with its nearest neighbours, existing as members of the European Union and it continues as non-members. The government calls it a "reset" but in reality resetting, in one direction or another, is probably permanent or semi-permanent. The trajectory of the current government, within its own guardrails, is towards a closer relationship. The trajectory of its successors may be different. Some Brexiteers say not only is it in parts thin and oversold, but has also crossed a crucial rubicon: the acceptance of "dynamic alignment" in some areas.</p>

Senator Elizabeth Warren opposes the bill, saying it puts consumers at risk and enables corruption, while Senator Bill Hagerty defends the measure, stating that a lack of regulatory framework makes for uncertainty.</p>
