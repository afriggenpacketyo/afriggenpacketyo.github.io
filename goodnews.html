          <p>Kristian Nairn, widely recognized for his portrayal of Hodor in Game of Thrones, has been officially announced as the final celebrity contestant for the 23rd series of Strictly Come Dancing. He completes the 15-celebrity line-up for the popular BBC dance competition, joining other notable figures such as football pundit Karen Carney and ITV presenter Ross King. Nairn, who is also an accomplished house music DJ, expressed his enthusiasm for the physical challenge and the opportunity to improve his dancing skills. The article further highlights recent controversies that have affected the show, including alleged drug use among unnamed stars and past behavioral allegations against professional dancers, which have prompted the BBC to implement new welfare measures for the production.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>A team of young Chinese scientists at Tsinghua University's Institute for Interdisciplinary Information Sciences has developed a groundbreaking approach that could revolutionize computer speed. Led by Associate Professor Duan Ran, their new method addresses the "single-source shortest-paths" problem, a fundamental challenge in theoretical computer science focused on finding the most efficient path in a network. Unlike the long-standing Dijkstra’s algorithm, which faces speed limits due to its sorting process, this innovative approach skips sorting by focusing solely on the shortest distances between crucial points, dramatically reducing calculation time. This significant development, initially published on arXiv, also earned the prestigious Best Paper Award at the ACM Symposium on Theory of Computing, signaling a major advance in computational efficiency.</p>

          <p>Chinese President Xi Jinping has publicly reiterated his commitment to bolstering the nation's private sector, emphasizing the critical need for a level playing field and safeguarding entrepreneurs' lawful rights and interests. In a detailed speech, Xi called for the "solid and thorough" implementation of policies designed to promote private economic development, explicitly urging against "ambiguity, delay, or compromise." He acknowledged that many private businesses have reported limited tangible benefits from existing relief policies and underscored the importance of enhanced policy precision, ensuring that commitments translate into concrete, substantive assistance. This directive signals Beijing's ongoing efforts to restore confidence and resolve persistent challenges within the private economy.</p>

          <p>Two easyJet planes experienced a minor collision, clipping wings on the runway at Manchester International Airport in the United Kingdom on Friday morning, which resulted in a brief suspension of airport operations. A spokesperson for Manchester Airport confirmed that the incident occurred as the aircraft were taxiing, necessitating a temporary ground stop for immediate assessment. Fortunately, there have been no reports of any injuries to passengers or crew aboard either plane. Both aircraft were subsequently able to taxi back to a stand, allowing airport operations to resume within minutes. Authorities are currently investigating the precise circumstances of this ground incident, with easyJet handling arrangements for all affected passengers.</p>

          <p>Toni, Berlin Zoo's beloved young pygmy hippopotamus, is currently undergoing preparations for her transfer to Mulhouse Zoo in France, as part of the vital European Endangered Species Program (EEP). Since her birth in June 2024, Toni has captured widespread attention, cultivating a substantial online following and even securing a high-profile sponsor in German soccer player Antonio Rüdiger. The Berlin Zoo has arranged special "Toni Time" events from August 18-24, offering visitors a final opportunity to bid farewell. This relocation is crucial for broader conservation efforts, given that pygmy hippos are an endangered species with fewer than 2,500 individuals remaining in the wild. Toni's popularity has significantly boosted public awareness regarding her species' precarious situation and the importance of captive breeding programs.</p>
