          <p>A federal judge in Atlanta has blocked President Donald Trump's executive order aimed at overhauling U.S. elections, siding with Democratic state attorneys general who argued it was an unconstitutional overreach. The executive order, issued on March 25, sought to mandate documentary proof of citizenship for voter registration, accept only mailed ballots received by Election Day, and condition federal election grant funding on states adhering to the new ballot deadline. The attorneys general contended that the directive usurped the states' constitutional power and attempted to amend election law through executive action. The White House defended the order as a measure to ensure free, fair, and honest elections, calling proof of citizenship a "commonsense" requirement.</p>

The boat ran into trouble, and during an ensuing rescue operation, the sight of the Libyan Coast Guard caused panic among those on board, causing many to jump into the sea, fearing they would be sent back to Libya. Members of the Spain-based NGO Open Arms and others were able to rescue all aboard. The collection captures various events from around the world.</p>

          <h2>Why Iran is Unlikely to Block the Strait of Hormuz</h2>
          <div class="timestamp">2025-06-13 07:55:24 EDT</div>
        </div>
        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>The article explores the reasons why Iran is unlikely to block the Strait of Hormuz, a vital oil artery, despite heightened tensions with Israel. While such a move could disrupt global oil flows, analysts believe it is unlikely due to the potential for further retaliation and backlash from China, Iran's largest oil customer. Blocking the strait could harm Iran's own interests, as most of its daily consumption goods come via that route. The presence of the US Fifth Fleet in Bahrain also makes a full-scale blockade difficult.</p>
