        </div>
        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Former Labour leader Jeremy Corbyn, along with independent MP Zarah Sultana, has launched a new political party aimed at challenging the "rich and powerful." The yet-to-be-named party positions itself as a grassroots, community-led alternative to what Corbyn describes as the "control freaks" of the Labour Party. It intends to campaign on issues like wealth redistribution, child poverty, and anti-war stances, positioning itself to the left of Labour. The new entity plans an inaugural conference in the autumn to define its policies and may first contest local elections in May 2026.</p>

          <div class="timestamp">2025-07-24 11:35:46 EDT</div>
        </div>
        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Shares of American Eagle Outfitters experienced a significant jump, positioning it as a new meme stock fueled by retail investors on platforms like Reddit's Wall Street Bets. The rally was partly sparked by the announcement of a new marketing campaign featuring actress Sydney Sweeney, focusing on the brand's denim line. The stock's high short interest, with over 13% of its tradable shares sold short, made it an attractive target for traders looking to initiate a short squeeze. This surge provides a potential reprieve for the stock, which had fallen about 35% year-to-date. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>A judge in Bali has sentenced three British citizens to a 12-month prison term for smuggling nearly a kilogram of cocaine into Indonesia, allowing them to avoid a potential death penalty. Lisa Stocker, Jon Collyer, and Phineas Float were arrested in February after the drugs, valued at around £300,000, were discovered disguised in powdered dessert packets. Factoring in time already served, the trio could be released by early 2026. Indonesia has notoriously strict drug laws but has maintained a temporary halt on executions since 2017.</p>

This move comes as SCE faces multiple lawsuits, including from the city of Los Angeles, amid speculation that its aging equipment may have ignited the blaze.

          <p>Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky has announced a new draft law aimed at guaranteeing the independence of the country's key anti-corruption agencies. This move follows widespread protests and concern from Western partners after legislation was passed that brought the National Anti-Corruption Bureau (Nabu) and the Specialised Anti-Corruption Prosecutor's Office (Sap) under the control of the presidentially-appointed prosecutor general. Zelensky stated the new bill is "balanced" and will protect the institutions from Russian influence, effectively backtracking on the previous law. The European Commission welcomed the decision, emphasizing that the rule of law is crucial for Ukraine's EU membership aspirations.</p>

          <p>The European Central Bank (ECB) has decided to hold interest rates steady at 2%, pausing a year-long easing cycle that had seen eight consecutive cuts. The decision comes as policymakers assess the economic uncertainty created by potential U.S. trade tariffs under President Trump. With inflation currently at the bank's 2% target, officials see no immediate need for further adjustments. ECB President Christine Lagarde stated the bank is in a "wait and watch" position, as new tariffs on European goods could significantly impact the Eurozone's economy and future inflation outlook.

          <p>A professor from the University of Ljubljana attributes Slovenia's remarkable sporting success, exemplified by cyclist Tadej Pogacar, to a unique national sports culture. The country emphasizes physical literacy from a young age through a robust school system and a national fitness monitoring program called SLOfit. Unlike in many nations, soccer is not overwhelmingly dominant, allowing other sports like mountaineering and cycling to thrive. This environment, combined with a geographically diverse landscape, creates an ideal foundation for nurturing talent.
