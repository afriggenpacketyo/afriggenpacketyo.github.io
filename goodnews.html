          <p>Nottingham Forest has appointed Ange Postecoglou as its new head coach, replacing Nuno Espirito Santo who was dismissed just three games into the season. Postecoglou, who was sacked by Tottenham three months prior despite leading them to a Europa League victory, is known for his aggressive, possession-based 4-3-3 tactical system. This move signals a significant stylistic shift for Forest, which has recently invested in more technical players. The club's owner, Evangelos Marinakis, cited Postecoglou's consistent record of winning trophies as a key reason for the appointment, expressing ambition to compete for major honors.</p>

          <p>Shares of artificial intelligence infrastructure company Nebius Group surged over 50% in premarket trading after announcing a multi-billion-dollar deal with Microsoft. The Amsterdam-based firm, which spun out from Russian tech giant Yandex in 2023, will provide $19.4 billion worth of cloud computing power and GPUs for AI workloads through 2031. This agreement highlights the sustained high demand for the powerful computing equipment necessary for training and operating advanced AI systems.

          <p>An analysis examines why large orders for Boeing aircraft have become a recurring feature in bilateral trade deals under the Trump administration. These high-value, high-profile purchases serve as visible symbols of cooperation and help partner countries demonstrate a commitment to reducing their trade surpluses with the U.S. Unlike agricultural or steel imports, aircraft orders are less politically sensitive for domestic industries in countries like Japan or South Korea. Furthermore, the long production backlogs for planes mean that these multi-billion dollar announcements can be made without immediate financial strain, serving both pragmatic and performative purposes.</p>

          <p>Zookeepers at the Exotic Zoo in Telford, UK, are celebrating what they call "one of the rarest events in the animal kingdom" after a female casque-headed iguana gave birth without ever mating with a male. The iguana produced eight healthy hatchlings through parthenogenesis, a natural phenomenon where unfertilized eggs develop into embryos that are genetic clones of the mother. The zoo's director expressed astonishment, noting the discovery of fertile eggs was a complete surprise. The baby iguanas, described as "mini-mum clones," are currently in a climate-controlled nursery and will soon be on public display.</p>

          <p>The Mohamed bin Zayed University of Artificial Intelligence (MBZUAI) in the UAE has released a new, low-cost AI reasoning model named K2 Think, positioning it as a rival to systems from OpenAI and China's DeepSeek. Developed in partnership with the UAE-based AI firm G42, the model is significantly smaller than its competitors but claims to deliver comparable performance in math, science, and coding benchmarks. Researchers achieved this efficiency through methods like long chain-of-thought fine-tuning and test-time scaling. This development is part of the UAE's broader strategy to establish itself as a global leader in artificial intelligence.</p>

          <p>The burgeoning artificial intelligence industry is fueling real estate demand in major tech hubs across the U.S. and Canada. A CBRE analysis shows that the pool of tech workers with AI skills grew by over 50% in the past year, with concentrations in the San Francisco Bay Area, New York City, and Seattle. This influx of high-salaried talent has boosted both office leasing and apartment rental markets, with AI companies accounting for a significant portion of new office leases in San Francisco. Unlike other tech sectors that have embraced remote work, AI's current innovation phase has encouraged in-office collaboration, driving up residential rents in these key cities.

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Michael Clune's new novel, "Pan," offers a vivid and unconventional portrayal of an adolescent besieged by panic attacks. The book review highlights how Clune eschews a standard medical recovery narrative, instead delving into the protagonist's subjective and often surreal experience of anxiety. The narrator, Nicholas, perceives his panic not just as a mental illness but as a form of profound, terrifying insight, possibly connected to the mischievous Greek god Pan. Through a mix of 1990s suburban realism and philosophical inquiry, the novel transforms the harrowing nature of panic into a quest for transcendent meaning, using sharp, high-resolution prose to capture its disorienting effects.</p>

At the ceremony, Prime Minister Abiy Ahmed emphasized the dam is a source of prosperity and electricity for the region and insisted it poses no threat to downstream neighbors Egypt and Sudan. The $5 billion project, funded almost entirely by Ethiopia, is central to the nation's economic development, aiming to address widespread electricity shortages.
