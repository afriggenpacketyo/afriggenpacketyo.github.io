        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Tesla has formally applied for a license to supply electricity directly to households in the United Kingdom, a move that could challenge established energy providers. If approved by the regulator Ofgem, the company could begin operations as early as next year, leveraging its existing base of electric vehicle and home battery customers. This strategic expansion into the energy market comes as Tesla faces increased competition and a recent decline in its European vehicle sales. The company already operates a similar electricity supply business in Texas.</p>

          <p>In an unprecedented agreement, chipmakers Nvidia and AMD will pay the U.S. government 15% of their revenue from certain advanced AI chip sales to China. This arrangement is part of a deal to secure export licenses for powerful semiconductors, such as Nvidia's H20, which were previously restricted due to national security concerns. The move signals a potential easing of tech trade tensions between Washington and Beijing, though it has been questioned by policy experts. This development comes as the U.S. pressures major tech firms to increase domestic investment. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>The government of England and Wales is planning a major overhaul of road safety laws, which includes mandatory eye tests for drivers over 70 every three years. The proposed strategy also aims to lower the drink-driving limit to match Scotland's stricter standard and introduce penalty points for passengers not wearing seatbelts. These changes are motivated by concerns that current safety messaging is ineffective and a coroner's report labeling the UK's driver licensing system as too lax. The government source cited a need to reduce road fatalities.</p>

          <h2>The Science of Black Hole 'Music' Explained</h2>

          <p>While mature black holes are known for letting nothing escape, newly formed ones create a unique form of "music" through gravitational waves. When a black hole is born from a stellar collapse or the merger of two objects, the resulting distortion in spacetime rings like a bell. These vibrations, known as quasinormal modes, quickly fade as the black hole settles into a stable, perfect shape defined only by its mass and spin. This article explains that these gravitational wave signals provide a pure, predictable signature of a black hole's birth.</p>

          <h2>China's New Childcare Subsidy May Disproportionately Benefit Poorer Regions</h2>
          <div class="timestamp">2025-08-10 22:00:08 EDT</div>
        </div>
        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>China has launched a nationwide childcare subsidy program, offering families 3,600 yuan (about $501) annually for each child under three years old. This policy is an effort to address the country's declining birth rate. According to analysis, the subsidy is expected to have a more significant impact in less affluent regions and rural areas. For instance, the handout represents over 13% of an average resident's annual income in the poor province of Gansu, compared to just 4% in the wealthy city of Shanghai, potentially boosting consumption and birth rates more effectively in those poorer areas.</p>

          <p>SoftBank founder Masayoshi Son is aggressively pivoting his company to focus on artificial intelligence, a move described as his biggest bet yet. Son predicts the arrival of artificial superintelligence (ASI), thousands of times smarter than humans, within a decade and aims to position SoftBank at the center of this revolution. The strategy involves a comprehensive portfolio of AI-related investments, from chip designers like Arm to a significant stake in OpenAI. This high-risk, high-reward vision builds on Son's career of bold, long-term technology plays, despite some past investment setbacks. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>England's Justin Rose secured his first PGA Tour title in over two years, winning the St. Jude Championship in a dramatic three-hole playoff against American JJ Spaun. Rose, 45, held his nerve after the two finished tied at 16-under par, ultimately clinching the victory with a birdie on the third extra hole. The win was a disappointment for fellow Englishman Tommy Fleetwood, who had entered the final round with the lead but finished one shot back, tied for third. Fleetwood's search for an elusive first victory on the PGA Tour continues.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>The UK government has announced new measures to make it easier for NHS employers in England to hire newly qualified nurses and midwives. The changes aim to cut red tape, allowing hospital trusts to recruit staff based on anticipated needs rather than waiting for formal vacancies to arise. This initiative responds to warnings that there are significantly more graduates than available jobs in some areas, a situation exacerbated by record training numbers. While nursing unions welcomed the move, questions remain about how it will be funded amid tight trust budgets.</p>

          <p>In the Chargers' 27-13 preseason victory over the New Orleans Saints, quarterback Trey Lance made a strong case in the competition for the backup role. Lance demonstrated growing confidence, using his mobility to extend plays and scoring a five-yard touchdown on a designed run, finishing with 48 rushing yards. His performance contrasted with that of Taylor Heinicke, who looked rusty in his first preseason action. The game also highlighted the emergence of defensive end Caleb Murphy, who recorded two sacks and is making a compelling argument for a roster spot.</p>
