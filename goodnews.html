          <p>The Norwegian Nobel Committee provided unprecedented exclusive access to the BBC and Norway's national broadcaster, offering a rare glimpse into their secret deliberations for the Nobel Peace Prize. This historic event, a first in the award's 125-year history, showcases the committee's rigorous process of discussion and debate to reach a consensus-based decision, adhering strictly to Alfred Nobel's 1895 will. The article also highlights former President Donald Trump's vocal desire for the award, and the external pressure this places on the committee, though its chairman remains unfazed, reiterating their commitment to strong and principled choices based on criteria such as promoting fraternity between nations and peace congresses.</p>

          <p>A construction team at the Port of Long Beach made a startling discovery when they unearthed an eight-decade-old World War II-era explosive device. This unexpected find at one of the port’s container terminals led to an immediate evacuation of the area and the establishment of a safety perimeter by local police, fire departments, and the U.S. Coast Guard. The L.A. County Sheriff’s Department Bomb Squad responded, and a U.S. Marine Corps ordnance disposal team successfully determined the device was safe to transport before deactivating it off-site. The article reports that the port resumed normal operations later that night, highlighting the swift and effective inter-agency response to neutralize the potential threat.</p>

          <p>This article provides an insightful analysis of former President Trump's announced "first phase" Gaza peace plan, which involves the imminent release of all hostages and an Israeli troop withdrawal to an agreed-upon line. While Trump positions this as a foundational step toward comprehensive peace, the article notes that this initial agreement primarily resolves the hostage crisis, leaving underlying issues such as Hamas's disarmament and future Gaza governance largely unaddressed. It highlights Trump's strategy of using his personal influence and relationships with regional leaders to compel both Israeli Prime Minister Netanyahu and Hamas towards this agreement. The success of this initial phase could significantly influence Trump's future engagement in broader Middle East peace efforts.</p>

It covers their positions on critical issues such as Proposition 50 and congressional redistricting, immigration, homelessness, and affordable housing. While most Democratic candidates support Governor Newsom's redistricting efforts, Republicans largely criticize them. The article also includes a "One Question" series, where candidates like Xavier Becerra, Katie Porter, and Steve Hilton discuss what the current administration did right and what they would change, offering voters insights into their priorities and leadership philosophies ahead of the election.</p>

          <p>France is honoring Robert Badinter, the late justice minister, with a cenotaph at the Pantheon, the nation's highest commendation, on the anniversary of capital punishment's abolition. Badinter, who died at 95, is celebrated for his impassioned leadership in abolishing the guillotine in 1981, a deeply unpopular stance at the time. This article highlights his lifelong commitment to justice, including his fight for equal treatment of sexual orientations and against racial discrimination, a personal experience from his Jewish heritage during WWII. His legacy extends to advocating for prisoners' rights and decrying modern conflicts, cementing his status as France's moral conscience.</p>

It proposes demilitarizing Gaza under independent supervision and establishing a "technocratic, apolitical Palestinian committee" for governance, overseen by a "Board of Peace" chaired by Trump.
