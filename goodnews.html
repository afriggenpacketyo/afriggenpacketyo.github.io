          <p>Amazon Web Services experienced a major outage on Monday, impacting numerous websites and services, including Amazon.com, Disney+, Lyft, and others. The outage was first reported in AWS' main US-East-1 region, causing DNS problems with DynamoDB, a database service. AWS cited an "operational issue" affecting multiple services and worked on parallel paths to accelerate recovery, eventually mitigating the DNS issue. This outage highlights the dependence of the internet on a few major cloud service providers, serving as a reminder of the potential for widespread disruption when a provider experiences technical difficulties. The article indicates that the issue was not a cyberattack but rather a technical fault. The resolution involved internal migrations and fixes, with AWS confirming that services were recovering. The situation underscores the fragility of global technology infrastructure and the importance of robust redundancy measures. </p>

          <p>Shares of U.S.-listed companies related to the rare earth supply chain have increased, fueled by investors considering the impact of Chinese export restrictions. Rare earths are vital for modern technology, including semiconductors and electric vehicles, and the Trump administration is working to build a domestic supply chain. The article highlights the signing of an agreement between the U.S. and Australia to invest in joint ventures for critical mineral and rare earth supply chains. Investors are anticipating that the administration will back additional miners, with William Blair initiating coverage of USA Rare Earth with an outperform rating. The article suggests that the U.S. has enough heavy rare metals for military applications but the supply chain squeeze could impact EVs and other commercial technologies. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>Cleveland-Cliffs is exploring the possibility of entering the rare earths mining business, according to CEO Lourenco Goncalves. The steelmaker has identified two sites in Michigan and Minnesota with geological surveys indicating the presence of rare earths. Shares of Cleveland-Cliffs rose significantly following the announcement, as investors speculated on the company's potential in the rare earths market. The U.S. is dependent on Beijing for imports and China announced strict export controls on rare earths earlier this month, provoking President Donald Trump to threaten 100% tariffs in retaliation. The article suggests that Cleveland-Cliffs' potential entry into rare earths mining aligns with the administration's broader national strategy for critical mineral independence.
