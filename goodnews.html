          <p>Week four of the NFL season delivered a series of thrilling matchups, highlighted by a rare 40-40 tie between the Dallas Cowboys and the Green Bay Packers in a dramatic overtime contest. Elsewhere, the Kansas City Chiefs routed the Baltimore Ravens, whose quarterback Lamar Jackson left with an injury, while the Buffalo Bills and Philadelphia Eagles both maintained their perfect 4-0 records with victories. Other key results included the New York Giants securing their first win of the season against the previously undefeated Los Angeles Chargers. The day's action was filled with high-scoring games, late-game heroics, and significant shifts in team fortunes.</p>

          <p>New York City Mayor Eric Adams has officially suspended his campaign for reelection, citing fundraising difficulties and persistent media speculation as undermining his bid. His withdrawal transforms the race into a three-way contest between Democratic frontrunner Zohran Mamdani, independent candidate and former Governor Andrew Cuomo, and Republican Curtis Sliwa. Adams' decision follows a challenging year marked by a federal corruption scandal and low poll numbers. While his name will remain on the ballot, his exit significantly reshapes the political landscape for leading America's largest city.</p>

          <p>The United States has deployed a new mobile air defense system, the Indirect Fire Protection Capability (IFPC), to one of its bases in South Korea for the first time. This system, which is similar in function to Israel's Iron Dome, is designed to counter threats such as cruise missiles, drones, and rockets. The deployment is widely seen as a strategic response to growing military provocations from both North Korea and China. The move signals a significant enhancement of defensive capabilities in the region, aimed at protecting U.S. and allied forces from a range of aerial threats.</p>

          <p>As national retail chains close stores, rising vacancy rates in shopping centers and strip malls are creating new opportunities for small and local businesses. Landlords, facing softening demand, are becoming more willing to negotiate flexible lease terms and lower rents that were previously out of reach for smaller enterprises. This trend is allowing businesses like wellness practitioners, independent retailers, and service-based companies to secure prime commercial real estate. While the opportunities vary by region, the shift is enabling a new mix of local tenants to revitalize spaces once dominated by large national brands.</p>

          <h2>Analysts Debate Whether China's Surging Stock Market is a Sustainable Boom or a Bubble</h2>

          <p>China's stock market has experienced a significant rally this year, driven by optimism around artificial intelligence and government policies aimed at supporting key industries like semiconductors. The CSI 300 index has climbed approximately 16%, with retail investors, who dominate trading, shifting savings from bank deposits into equities. However, some experts are questioning the sustainability of this surge, as it appears disconnected from underlying economic fundamentals, which show signs of slowing. While some see policy tailwinds supporting the momentum, others warn that parts of the market are overheating and could be approaching bubble territory. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>The Phoenix Mercury staged a dramatic fourth-quarter comeback to defeat the top-seeded Minnesota Lynx 86-81, securing their spot in the WNBA Finals. Trailing by 13 points entering the final period, the Mercury outscored the Lynx 31-13, led by Alyssa Thomas's 23 points and DeWanna Bonner's crucial late-game scoring. The Lynx were hampered by the absence of star center Napheesa Collier, who was injured in the previous game of the semifinal series. Phoenix will now advance to the championship series for the first time since 2021, awaiting the winner of the Las Vegas and Indiana series.</p>

          <p>The Reserve Bank of India is widely expected to hold its key policy rate at 5.50% this week, but some economists believe a surprise rate cut is possible due to subdued inflation and concerns over U.S. trade tariffs. While the Indian economy showed strong growth in the June quarter, downside risks from trade tensions and tightening financial conditions could prompt the central bank to act preemptively. The RBI has already cut rates by 100 basis points this year to stimulate investment. Analysts are closely watching for the bank's decision and its outlook on growth and inflation.

          <p>The article explores the concept of "energy vampires"—friends who drain your emotional energy through constant complaining, self-centeredness, or a need for attention. Psychologists identify signs of such relationships and suggest that how you feel after an interaction is a key indicator. To manage these friendships, experts recommend setting clear boundaries, such as limiting the time spent together or the topics of conversation. They also suggest having an honest conversation about how the dynamic feels, as a true friend will be receptive to the feedback, which can help preserve the relationship.</p>

          <p>For Hong Kong to achieve its ambitions as a hub for green marine fuels, it must establish a reliable supply chain for green methanol, according to an executive from CM Energy. While the city has already facilitated fueling with LNG and biodiesel, the infrastructure for methanol is still lacking. The call for action was made during the maiden voyage of the "CM Hong Kong," the world's first large vehicle carrier capable of running on methanol. As Europe implements carbon-based import tariffs, the shipping industry faces growing pressure to adopt cleaner fuels, making the development of methanol infrastructure crucial for Hong Kong's port.</p>
