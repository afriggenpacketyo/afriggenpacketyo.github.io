        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Consumer Reports has released its latest recommendations for the best sunscreens, based on lab tests of 51 products. The top lotion sunscreens include Coppertone Water Babies lotion SPF 50, La Roche-Posay Anthelios kids SPF 50, and Supergoop! PLAY Everyday Lotion SPF 50. The report emphasizes the importance of wearing sunscreen daily, not just in the summer, and recommends applying a teaspoon per exposed body part 15-30 minutes before sun exposure. It is also advised to reapply sunscreen every two hours, especially after swimming or sweating. The optimism score is not applicable here.</p>

          <p>Former Real Madrid and Wales star Gareth Bale is reportedly part of a US-based consortium attempting to take over League One club Plymouth Argyle. Talks with the private equity firm are at an early stage. This move follows similar ventures by other football figures, such as Luka Modric's involvement with Swansea. Plymouth was relegated to the third tier last season and recently appointed Tom Cleverley as manager. The optimism score is not applicable here.</p>

          <p>The U.S. Army is undergoing a significant restructuring to accelerate the adoption of new technology and cut costs. The Army Transformation Initiative aims to shift resources to products that can be made quickly and cheaply, acknowledging the increasing importance of autonomous systems and the vulnerability of traditional weapons. The goal is to move beyond rigid acquisition processes and infuse formations with effective technologies. The 1st Brigade of the 101st Airborne Division is serving as a "transformation in contact" (TIC) brigade, equipped with AI-enabled platforms and advanced connectivity.

          <p>U.S. Steel shares surged after President Trump approved its merger with Japan's Nippon Steel, contingent on signing a national security agreement with the U.S. government. The agreement includes a golden share for the U.S. government, granting the president veto power over decisions to relocate headquarters, move the company outside the U.S., rename U.S. Steel, transfer production or jobs abroad, and close or idle plants. Despite Trump describing the deal as a "partnership," U.S. Steel will become a wholly-owned subsidiary of Nippon Steel North America. The optimism score is not applicable here.

          <p>The FDA allows specialized pharmacies to make copies of brand-name drugs when the drugs are in short supply. With the shortages of Wegovy and Zepbound ending, some telehealth companies are producing their own medicines with a twist by personalizing the medicines by adding one of nine supplements based on patients' unique needs. It is unclear whether OrderlyMeds' approach will work, but the telehealth platform is one of several companies testing the FDA's rules by continuing to make and sell the compounded drugs. A key question is where the line is between making "essentially a copy" of a commercially available drug and the personalized medicines compounding pharmacies have provided for decades.
