          <p>The UK government has pledged ¬£14.2 billion to the Sizewell C nuclear power plant project, aiming to lower household energy bills and enhance energy security. Prime Minister Keir Starmer emphasized that this investment is a step towards energy independence, but the project is expected to take at least 10 years to complete. Critics raise concerns about the project's cost and environmental impact, and negotiations with private investors are ongoing. The project is expected to generate enough power for six million homes and create 10,000 jobs during construction. </p>

          <p>Members of Parliament are scheduled to vote on decriminalizing abortion in England and Wales, a move that would end the threat of investigation or imprisonment for women terminating their own pregnancies. The proposed change aims to remove abortion from the Offences Against the Person Act of 1861. While the existing framework for accessing abortion would remain, the amendment seeks to protect women from criminal prosecution. The vote comes amid concerns about an increasing number of women being investigated for illegally ending pregnancies.</p>

          <h2>Debt Forgiveness Versus Debt Consolidation: A Comparison</h2>

        </div>
        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>This article compares debt forgiveness and debt consolidation as strategies for managing high credit card debt. Debt consolidation combines multiple debts into a single loan with a lower interest rate, while debt forgiveness involves negotiating with creditors to accept less than the full amount owed. The article highlights the costs, timelines, and credit implications of each approach, noting that debt forgiveness can significantly lower the amount owed but damages credit scores. The conclusion is that the best option depends on individual circumstances, with debt consolidation being preferable for those who can manage payments and want to protect their credit.
