Robert Jenrick told the BBC that this measure would provide officers with greater "confidence" in handling threats. The Conservatives also advocate for secure armories in maximum security jails, to be used as a last resort. The Ministry of Justice (MoJ) stated that some prison officers will use Tasers on a trial basis this summer, but argued that giving them lethal weapons would put them at greater risk.</p>
