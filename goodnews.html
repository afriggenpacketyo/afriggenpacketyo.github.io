          <p>Frederick M. Nicholas, a key figure in shaping the cultural landscape of Los Angeles, has passed away at the age of 105. A decorated WWII veteran, attorney, and real estate developer, he was instrumental in the development of major institutions like the Museum of Contemporary Art (MOCA) and the Walt Disney Concert Hall. Beyond his cultural contributions, Nicholas founded Public Counsel in 1970, now the nation's largest pro bono law firm, to provide legal aid to vulnerable populations. He is remembered for his immense energy and profound impact on the city's arts and public service sectors.</p>

          <p>Authorities are investigating the circumstances surrounding a 5-year-old girl who fell overboard from a Disney cruise ship, prompting her father to heroically jump in after her. The Broward Sheriff's Office clarified that the child was not being held over the railing, contrary to social media speculation, but had apparently climbed it while her parents were nearby. The father successfully kept his daughter afloat until a rescue boat arrived, an act a maritime attorney called heroic. Both were recovered safely, and the incident is being praised as a rare positive outcome for an overboard situation.</p>

          <p>A federal judge in Brooklyn has temporarily blocked the Trump administration's move to end Temporary Protected Status (TPS) for approximately 521,000 Haitian immigrants. The ruling states that Homeland Security Secretary Kristi Noem acted unlawfully by not following the congressionally mandated process for reconsidering Haiti's TPS designation. The judge found that the interests of the Haitian immigrants, who rely on the status to live and work in the U.S., outweigh potential harm to the government. This decision provides a temporary reprieve for Haitians amid ongoing instability in their home country.</p>

          <p>US soccer star Christian Pulisic, facing criticism for skipping the Gold Cup tournament, spent his time opening a new youth soccer facility in Culver City, California. After a grueling season with AC Milan, the 26-year-old stated he needed a mental and physical break ahead of next year's World Cup, a decision some former players called selfish. Pulisic defended his choice, and emphasized the joy of inspiring the next generation by providing free spaces for kids to play. His visit and interaction with young players at the "Stomping Grounds" facility highlighted his commitment to giving back to the game.</p>

He noted that Microsoft's Azure cloud business beat expectations, while Nvidia's dominance in AI chips and persistent demand fueled its rally despite earlier concerns. Cramer attributed Meta's success to its powerful advertising business, which blew past earnings estimates. He dubbed the trio the "M-N-Ms," suggesting they are the most reliable bets from the formerly dominant market-leading group. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>For the first time in over 50 years, the Bank of England is planning a major redesign of its banknotes and is seeking public opinion on potential new themes. Since 1970, the notes have featured notable historical figures, but future series could showcase subjects like nature, British innovation, architecture, or key historical events. The move could see figures like Winston Churchill replaced with images of animals, landmarks, or even cultural touchstones. The Bank aims to create designs that serve as a "symbolic representation of our collective national identity" and will continue to feature the reigning monarch.</p>

          <p>Real Madrid's decision to pay an ¬£8.4m fee to sign Trent Alexander-Arnold a month before his Liverpool contract expired is already paying dividends. The right-back's performance in the Club World Cup, including a key assist in the match against Juventus, helped the team advance and secure an additional ¬£10m in prize money. While still adapting to his new wing-back role under coach Xabi Alonso, Alexander-Arnold is growing in confidence and demonstrating his offensive prowess. His contributions are validating the club's calculated gamble to secure his services early for their tournament campaign.</p>

          <p>California has enacted its most significant reforms to the California Environmental Quality Act (CEQA) in over 50 years, a move intended to spur housing development. The new legislation, championed by Governor Gavin Newsom, largely waives CEQA requirements for most low- and mid-rise housing projects in urban areas already zoned for multifamily use. This eliminates the threat of lengthy environmental studies and lawsuits from opponents, which have historically delayed or blocked construction. While not a silver bullet for the housing crisis, the reform marks a seismic political shift, removing a key barrier to homebuilding in the state.</p>
