          <p>A Chinese woman, identified only by her surname Zhou, was dramatically rescued after being trapped in a guesthouse room for 30 hours due to a malfunctioning lock, without access to food or a toilet. In a desperate attempt to signal for help, she bit her finger and used her own blood to scrawl the emergency number "110" and her room number "625" on a pillow. This crucial distress message was then thrown from her sixth-floor window, where it was spotted by a quick-thinking food delivery driver, Zhang Kun. Zhang immediately contacted the police, who successfully kicked open the door to free the distressed woman, highlighting the profound impact of a simple act of observation and swift action.</p>

          <p>Tropical Storm Fernand is projected to weaken further over the central Atlantic Ocean in the coming days, with the National Hurricane Center confirming it poses no threat to land. Currently located east-northeast of Bermuda with maximum sustained winds of 45 mph, Fernand is anticipated to transition into a post-tropical cyclone soon and dissipate by Thursday. This storm marks the sixth named system of the 2025 Atlantic hurricane season, following Hurricane Erin, which reached Category 5 strength without making landfall. The National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration had forecast an above-normal season, predicting 13 to 18 named storms, with Fernand's path remaining safely away from populated areas.</p>

          <p>Two construction workers in China's Shaanxi province experienced a harrowing ordeal when a sudden rainstorm left them trapped mid-air on a suspended gondola. The incident, which occurred on August 26, 2025, saw the workers stranded for approximately 20 minutes before rescue teams were able to successfully bring them to safety. This event underscores the inherent risks associated with construction work, particularly when unexpected severe weather conditions arise, and emphasizes the critical importance of rapid emergency response mechanisms. The swift and successful rescue prevented any serious injury, turning a potentially dangerous situation into a testament to efficient emergency services and highlighting the need for robust safety protocols in such environments.</p>

          <p>Former England and Team GB rugby player Heather Fisher openly discusses her long struggle with alopecia, a condition that caused all her hair to fall out in five weeks, profoundly impacting her identity. She recounts years of avoiding mirrors and facing public discrimination, including being mistaken for a man and physically poked out of toilets. Despite these challenges, Fisher, a 2014 World Cup winner, emphasizes the importance of owning her appearance and the slow but positive shifts in sports towards inclusivity. Her story highlights personal battles beyond the pitch and the evolving landscape of athlete self-expression, particularly through social media.</p>

          <h2>Congressional Budget Office Report Sparks Debate on Effectiveness of Trump's Tariffs</h2>
          <div class="timestamp">2025-08-26 05:00:46 EDT</div>
        </div>
        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>A new Congressional Budget Office (CBO) report indicates that President Trump's tariffs could reduce primary deficits by $3.3 trillion over a decade, with an additional $0.7 trillion in interest outlay reductions, totaling $4.0 trillion. This surprising finding challenges conventional free-trade economic wisdom, which often views tariffs as detrimental. While some economists remain skeptical, acknowledging tariffs as a tax, others suggest they could be a strategic tool to promote freer global trade. The article also touches on the constitutional debate regarding presidential authority to impose such tariffs, a question potentially heading to the Supreme Court. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>China has successfully launched the Jiangmen Underground Neutrino Observatory (Juno) in Guangdong province, establishing the world's largest detector for elusive "ghost particles" known as neutrinos. This massive facility has begun collecting data, aiming to track these mysterious particles which possess no electrical charge and very little mass, moving at near-light speed. Housed 700 meters below ground, the detector, a giant acrylic sphere filled with 20,000 tons of liquid scintillator, will measure the mass of different neutrino types produced by two nuclear power plants 53km away. This achievement marks a "historic milestone" for the international project, initially proposed by the Chinese Academy of Sciences in 2008, advancing particle physics research.</p>

The game, which saw Liverpool's 16-year-old Rio Ngumoha score a 100th-minute winner, was characterized by frequent set-pieces, long throws, and a low ball-in-play percentage, the lowest in a Premier League match since 2010. Despite Newcastle playing with 10 men for much of the game after a red card, Slot noted the difficulty in securing the win due to the disruptive play, highlighting a feisty atmosphere amidst transfer rumors.</p>

          <p>South Korea's President Lee Jae Myung's inaugural foreign visit to Japan, a historic first since 1965, signifies a commitment to closer cooperation between the two nations. Analysts interpret Lee's foreign policy as prioritizing shared international challenges and interests, particularly within the context of addressing the "China challenge" in trilateral cooperation involving the US. Consequently, from Beijing's perspective, expectations for the Lee administration are low, leading to a recommendation for China to adopt a pragmatic view of Seoul's new government and its evolving diplomatic strategy. This development underscores a significant realignment in regional alliances and carries potential implications for China's broader foreign relations.</p>

This ambitious expansion is intended to invigorate the often-sluggish carbon market and tackle China's position as the world's largest carbon polluter.
