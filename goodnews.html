          <p>A new trend is emerging in Chinese higher education, with students increasingly choosing to major in technology and engineering fields like information technology and vehicle engineering. This shift reflects a national strategic focus on technological advancement, driven by intensified tech competition with the United States. These tech-focused disciplines have replaced subjects like international trade and urban planning, which were popular two decades ago during a different phase of China's economic development.</p>

          <p>Banyan Group founder Kwon Ping Ho observes that the modern tourist is vastly different from those of previous generations, seeking unique experiences over checklist sightseeing. Having been in the luxury hotel industry for three decades, he notes that younger, more seasoned travelers prioritize authentic interaction with local communities. Ho also highlights the rise of "rainbow tourism," with a more diverse, multi-directional flow of travelers from developing nations, a significant change from the predominantly Western-to-East tourism of the past.</p>

          <p>President Trump is scheduled to meet with NATO Secretary General Mark Rutte following an announcement that the U.S. plans to sell weapons to NATO allies, which can then be transferred to Ukraine. This move is seen as a way to expedite military aid, as transferring equipment from European allies is faster than ordering from U.S. factories. The meeting comes as the Trump administration faces pressure to take stronger action against Russia, including potential sanctions legislation aimed at crippling Russia's economy.</p>

Cramer posits that a combination of deregulation, pro-deal agencies, and tax cuts will continue to boost corporate profits and stock prices. (not investment advice)</p>
