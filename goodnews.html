          <p>A judge issued a temporary restraining order against the Trump administration's plan to strip Harvard University of its ability to enroll foreign students, following a lawsuit filed by Harvard alleging the move was a blatant violation of the law and free speech rights. The Trump administration claimed Harvard hadn't done enough to combat antisemitism, which Harvard denied. The order pauses the Department of Homeland Security's move to revoke Harvard's access to the Student and Exchange Visitor Program, a database managing foreign students, with a hearing set for May 29 in Boston. The article underscores the uncertainty faced by international students and the potential financial impact on Harvard if foreign enrollment were restricted.</p>

          <p>President Trump announced a "planned partnership" between U.S. Steel and Japan-based Nippon Steel, stating that U.S. Steel would remain in America with its headquarters in Pittsburgh. Trump claimed the partnership would create at least 70,000 jobs and add $14 billion to the U.S. economy. Nippon Steel's bid to buy U.S. Steel had previously been blocked by former President Biden, but under Trump, it was subject to another national security review. Shares of U.S. Steel jumped 21% following the announcement, although details of the deal and ownership structure remained unclear.</p>

          <p>President Trump signed four executive orders focused on accelerating the construction of nuclear power plants in the United States, including a new generation of small, advanced reactors. One order directs the Nuclear Regulatory Commission to streamline its rules and approve applications for new reactors within 18 months, while another encourages the Energy and Defense departments to explore siting reactors on federal lands and military bases. The administration also set a goal of quadrupling the nation‚Äôs fleet of nuclear power plants by 2050. These actions aim to address a declared "national energy emergency" and reflect bipartisan support for nuclear power as a clean energy source.</p>

          <p>A U.S. judge overturned President Trump's executive order targeting Jenner & Block, a law firm employing a lawyer who investigated him. The order had suspended security clearances for the firm's lawyers and restricted their access to government buildings and federal contracting work. Trump accused the firm of undermining justice by participating in politically driven legal actions, specifically criticizing their hiring of Andrew Weissmann, who worked on the Mueller investigation. The judge ruled that Trump's directive violated core rights under the U.S. Constitution, mirroring a previous ruling against a similar executive order.</p>

          <p>Billy Joel canceled his upcoming concerts due to normal pressure hydrocephalus (N.P.H.), a brain disorder affecting hearing, vision, and balance. N.P.H. occurs when excess cerebrospinal fluid accumulates in the brain, causing difficulty walking, bladder control issues, and memory problems. Treatment typically involves a surgery called ventricular shunting, which bypasses the blocked channel and lets fluid drain. The prognosis depends on when the disease is diagnosed, with early diagnosis leading to better outcomes.</p>

          <p>President Trump signed executive orders aimed at overhauling the Nuclear Regulatory Commission and accelerating the deployment of new nuclear power reactors in the U.S. The orders call for a "total and complete reform" of the NRC, requiring decisions on nuclear reactor licenses within 18 months. The administration also aims to boost uranium mining and expand domestic uranium enrichment capacity. The changes are intended to streamline regulations and promote the development of small, advanced reactors, while also supporting larger nuclear plants.</p>

          <p>President Donald Trump cleared the merger of U.S. Steel and Nippon Steel, reversing a previous decision to block the deal on national security grounds. Trump stated that the partnership would create 70,000 jobs and add $14 billion to the U.S. economy, with U.S. Steel's headquarters remaining in Pittsburgh. Shares of U.S. Steel surged following the announcement. President Joe Biden previously blocked the acquisition, citing concerns over supply chain security.</p>
