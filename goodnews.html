          <p>This article examines the ongoing discourse about declining literacy among American youth, differentiating between concerns at the K-12 and college levels. It notes that while every generation worries about the next, recent data from the National Assessment of Educational Progress (NAEP) does show a decline in reading scores for younger students. However, claims about college students' inability to read are more anecdotal, lacking hard comparative data. The piece concludes that while panic may be overstated, there is evidence of real challenges in literacy education that warrant serious attention.</p>

          <p>San Francisco Giants catcher Patrick Bailey achieved a rare feat in baseball history by hitting a walk-off, inside-the-park home run to defeat the Philadelphia Phillies. With the Giants trailing 3-1 in the ninth inning, Bailey's hit drove in three runs for a dramatic 4-3 victory. This was the first time a catcher has hit a walk-off inside-the-park home run since 1926. The event was part of a historic day in MLB, as it also marked the first time a leadoff inside-the-park home run and a walk-off inside-the-park home run occurred on the same day.</p>

          <p>Chipmaker Nvidia has made history by becoming the first company ever to surpass a $4 trillion market valuation. The milestone was reached as the company's stock continued to climb, driven by immense investor confidence in its role as the primary hardware supplier for the generative AI boom. Nvidia's value has soared, surpassing other tech giants like Microsoft and Apple, and its growth has been exponential over the last few years. This achievement comes despite ongoing geopolitical tensions and U.S. export restrictions that have impacted its sales to the significant Chinese market. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>Freddie, a 5-year-old beagle working for U.S. Customs and Border Protection, is returning to his post at Dulles International Airport two weeks after being intentionally kicked by a traveler. The dog was screening luggage when the incident occurred, leading to the arrest of a 70-year-old man who later pleaded guilty to assaulting a police animal. Freddie, a rescue dog trained to detect prohibited agricultural items, has successfully sniffed out thousands of pounds of illegal products during his service. His handler noted that the beagle has recovered well and views his important job as a fun game.</p>

          <p>New analysis of lunar samples returned by China's Chang'e-6 mission suggests a massive asteroid impact over four billion years ago significantly altered the moon's mantle on its far side. The collision created the vast South Pole-Aitken basin and appears to have stripped the deep interior of key chemical elements. The volcanic rocks later formed in this region are the most chemically depleted lunar samples ever studied. These findings, published in the journal Nature, come from the first-ever mission to successfully return materials from the far side of the moon.</p>

          <p>Dutch art detective Arthur Brand has recovered a priceless collection of stolen historical documents, including UNESCO-listed archives from the 17th-century Dutch East India Company (VOC). The documents, which offer a glimpse into global trade and diplomacy during the Dutch "Golden Age," were stolen from the National Archives in The Hague in 2015. The trove was discovered by an individual clearing out an attic, who had received the box of manuscripts as collateral for a loan. Brand considers the recovery one of the most significant of his career.</p>

          <p>The Transportation Security Administration (TSA) has officially ended its long-standing requirement for passengers to remove their shoes at airport security checkpoints. Homeland Security Secretary Kristi Noem announced that, effective immediately, all travelers at domestic airports can keep their footwear on during screening. The "shoes-off" policy was instituted in 2006 following an attempted shoe-bombing incident. The change is expected to streamline the security process and reduce wait times for all travelers, not just those enrolled in programs like TSA PreCheck.</p>
