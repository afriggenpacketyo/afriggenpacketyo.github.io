Bluesky stated that the suspension was due to automated systems flagging the account as a potential impersonation attempt, as there had been previous attempts to impersonate Vance. The account was reinstated within 20 minutes and verified. Vance's initial posts included a screenshot of Justice Clarence Thomas‚Äôs concurring opinion on a Tennessee law banning sex change surgeries on minors, sparking debate and mockery from conservatives who viewed the suspension as evidence of censorship.</p>

          <p>A New Yorker known as "Streeter" makes over six figures annually by reporting idling trucks and buses through the city's Citizens Air Complaint Program. This program allows citizens to report vehicles idling for more than three minutes, a violation of New York City law, and receive 25% of the fines, which range from $350 to $600. George Pakenham, who helped create the law, emphasizes that it addresses a public health issue, reducing air pollution. Trucking Association of New York lobbyist Zach Miller argues that truck drivers face challenges that make it difficult to simply shut off their engines, but Pakenham maintains the importance of reducing vehicle idling for public health.</p>

          <p>The Buss family is reportedly selling a majority ownership stake of the Los Angeles Lakers to Mark Walter, chairman of the Los Angeles Dodgers, in a deal valuing the team at $10 billion. Walter's TWG Global group's acquisition marks the richest transaction in sports history, with Jeanie Buss remaining as Lakers governor. Since Walter's acquisition of the Dodgers in 2012, the team has consistently made the playoffs, winning multiple division titles and World Series championships, contrasting with the Lakers' more sporadic success. The move is expected to bring significant investment in infrastructure, coaching, and scouting, potentially reshaping the team's approach to player acquisition and long-term strategy.</p>
