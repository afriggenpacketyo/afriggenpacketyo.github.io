          <p>The United States and Australia have signed a significant agreement to bolster supplies of rare earths and critical minerals, directly addressing China's dominant position in the market. Australian Prime Minister Anthony Albanese announced the deal supports an $8.5 billion pipeline of "ready-to-go" projects aimed at expanding Australia's mining and processing capabilities. This includes an initial $1 billion investment from both countries over the next six months. The agreement also received a renewed commitment from President Trump for the Aukus submarine deal, previously under review.</p>

          <p>Shares of major Australian critical metals and rare earths companies experienced a significant surge following the announcement of an $8.5 billion minerals deal between the U.S. and Australia. Companies like Lynas Rare Earths, Iluka Resources, and Pilbara Minerals saw substantial gains, with some smaller miners skyrocketing. This agreement, signed by President Trump and Prime Minister Albanese, aims to boost the supply of essential materials used in defense and energy, diversifying global supply chains away from China's dominance. The Export-Import Bank of the United States is also preparing to offer over $2.2 billion in financing for these projects. (not investment advice)</p>

This compact aimed to grant funding priority to institutions supporting a conservative agenda, including reforms to admissions, hiring, and gender definitions. University President Suresh Garimella stated that foundational principles like academic freedom and institutional independence must be preserved. Six other universities, including Brown, Dartmouth, and MIT, have also rejected the proposal, citing concerns over academic freedom and merit-based research funding.</p>

          <p>Despite a seemingly friendly meeting between Australian Prime Minister Anthony Albanese and US President Donald Trump, Australia is experiencing growing doubts about the reliability of its long-standing alliance with the United States. Trump's administration has previously imposed tariffs on Australian goods and reviewed the Aukus defense pact, causing unease in Canberra. While the recent meeting secured a commitment to Aukus and a critical minerals deal, the unpredictable nature of Trump's policies has fueled distrust. Many Australians believe the alliance is more crucial than ever due to China's increasing regional presence, despite declining confidence in US leadership.</p>

          <h2>Explainer: Understanding the Aukus Submarine Deal Between Australia, UK, and US</h2>

          <p>The Aukus security pact is a multi-billion dollar submarine deal between Australia, the UK, and the US, central to Australia's defense capabilities and regional military standing. The deal, worth £176 billion over 30 years, involves Australia acquiring nuclear-powered Virginia-class submarines from the US and later co-designing a new model with the UK. President Trump recently reaffirmed the deal is "full steam ahead" after a review. Beyond submarines, Aukus facilitates collaboration on advanced military technologies like hypersonic missiles and AI, primarily aimed at countering China's growing presence and influence in the Indo-Pacific region.</p>

          <p>Former President Joe Biden has completed a round of radiation therapy for an aggressive, high-risk form of prostate cancer that had metastasized to his bones. His daughter, Ashley Biden, shared an Instagram story showing him ringing a bell at the University of Pennsylvania’s Radiation Oncology clinic, a symbol of completing a phase of cancer treatment. Biden, 82, also underwent surgery in September to remove skin cancer lesions. Concerns about his health were prominent during his 2024 campaign, which he withdrew from three months before the election.</p>

          <h2>New Study Shows Significant Drop in Childhood Peanut Allergies Due to Early Exposure Guidelines</h2>
          <div class="timestamp">2025-10-20 19:28:32 EDT</div>
        </div>
        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>A new study published in the journal Pediatrics reveals an estimated 40,000 children avoided peanut allergy diagnoses following updated guidelines recommending early exposure to the allergen. Peanut allergy rates in children under three dropped by approximately 43% after the expanded recommendations in 2017, with overall food allergies decreasing by 36%. This dramatic reduction follows a watershed 2015 study that found feeding peanut products to babies significantly reduced allergy development. The findings highlight the effectiveness of the "eat early, eat often" approach, despite only a minority of pediatricians fully adopting the new guidance, underscoring the need for broader policy changes.</p>

          <p>President Donald Trump's repeated calls to deploy the National Guard to San Francisco are casting a shadow over the city's post-pandemic resurgence, largely fueled by the artificial intelligence boom. San Francisco has seen significant improvements in crime rates, with homicides at a 70-year low and car break-ins at a 22-year low. The city's economic momentum, including record venture capital funding for AI, contrasts with Trump's portrayal of a city in need of federal intervention. Salesforce CEO Marc Benioff initially supported the idea but later retracted his stance after local criticism, while Mayor Daniel Lurie asserts federal troops are unnecessary given local law enforcement efforts.</p>

          <p>Amazon Web Services (AWS), a leading cloud infrastructure provider, has reported that all its services returned to normal operations after a daylong outage significantly impacted numerous major websites and online applications. The disruption, originating in AWS's US-East-1 region, caused "increased error rates" and affected services like Venmo, Microsoft Outlook, Zoom, and Amazon's own platforms. While the company cited an "operational issue" and later confirmed a DNS problem with its DynamoDB database service, it assured users that data appeared safe. This incident underscores the internet's heavy reliance on a few major cloud providers, highlighting the widespread impact when such critical infrastructure experiences issues.</p>

          <p>The recent "No Kings" protests, drawing millions across the U.S., underscore significant public opposition to President Trump's authoritarian tendencies and policies.

The slogan "No Kings" resonates broadly, uniting diverse opponents and representing a fundamental constitutional view. While not immediately altering political outcomes, these mass movements aim to maintain momentum through future elections to restrain Trump and remove his allies from office.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>CNBC's Jim Cramer advised investors to hold, not trade, Apple stock, highlighting its recent rally to a record high, which also boosted the broader market. Cramer attributed Apple's strong performance to its unmatched product cycle, exemplified by robust demand for the iPhone 17 lineup and features like improved selfie technology. Analysts foresee double-digit growth in Apple's services and a multi-year phone cycle, reinforced by pricing stability and the vast installed base of iPhones. Cramer suggested Apple could monetize artificial intelligence by charging chatbot developers for iPhone integration, generating substantial margins without significant internal investment.
