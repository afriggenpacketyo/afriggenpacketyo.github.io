          <p>Japan's stock market saw a significant rally after Prime Minister Shigeru Ishiba announced his resignation over the weekend, with the Nikkei 225 index rising 1.5% and the Topix index hitting a record high. Investors are reportedly optimistic about potential successors, particularly Takaichi Sanae, who is viewed as a pro-growth candidate favoring deregulation. This market enthusiasm comes amid broader economic uncertainty, as the Japanese yen weakened against the dollar and government bond yields continued to climb. The political transition introduces a period of extended uncertainty heading into the last quarter of the year. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>The board of Tottenham Hotspur has confirmed that the club is not for sale, announcing that its owner, ENIC Sports & Developments Holdings Ltd, has unequivocally rejected two preliminary buyout offers. This statement follows the recent departure of executive chairman Daniel Levy, which had fueled speculation about a potential takeover. The rejected expressions of interest came from two separate consortiums, one led by Amanda Staveley and another by Dr Roger Kennedy and Wing-Fai Ng. ENIC, which holds a nearly 87% stake in the Premier League club, reiterated it has no intention of selling its interest.</p>

Alcaraz's victory is the culmination of an impressive season, having reached the final in his last eight tournaments and extending his winning streak to 13 matches.

          <p>European stock markets are projected to open higher, with investors closely watching a critical confidence vote in France that could oust Prime Minister Francois Bayrou. Bayrou initiated the vote amid political disputes over approximately 44 billion euros in proposed budget cuts aimed at reducing the national deficit. If he loses, President Emmanuel Macron will need to appoint the country's fifth prime minister in under two years, adding to political uncertainty. Meanwhile, U.S. stock futures remain steady as markets await key inflation data later in the week. (not investment advice)</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Researchers in South Korea have developed innovative bifacial thin-film solar cells capable of generating electricity from both sides with record-breaking efficiency. The new cells, created at the Daegu Gyeongbuk Institute of Science & Technology, are produced at lower temperatures, making them cheaper and easier to manufacture. They achieved 15.3% efficiency from the front and 8.44% from the back, representing one of the best results ever for this type of technology. This breakthrough could revolutionize solar energy by making it more affordable and allowing for integration into windows, building facades, and other transparent surfaces.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>A social media debate over whether Wayne Rooney or Michael Owen was the superior footballer at age 17 has drawn comments from both former England strikers. Owen argued in his own favor, pointing out that he won two Premier League Golden Boots and scored 18 goals in a season as a teenager, while Rooney scored six. Rooney responded diplomatically, stating he looked up to Owen and that they were very different players, so he would not judge himself against his former teammate. While injuries curtailed Owen's career, Rooney went on to become Manchester United's and, for a time, England's all-time leading goal scorer.</p>

          <p>A popular online discussion has compiled a list of significant historical facts that are frequently overlooked or glossed over in standard school education. Among the topics shared by users were the 1921 Tulsa Race Massacre, the full extent of the Opium Wars, and the significant role of Black cowboys in the American West. Other submissions pointed to the internment of German Americans during both World Wars and the fact that federal highways were often purposefully built through affluent Black neighborhoods. The conversation underscores a growing awareness of the need for a more comprehensive and nuanced understanding of history.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>A collaborative study between Chinese and American scientists has revealed that Mars possesses a solid inner core, a feature previously unconfirmed. By analyzing seismic data from NASA's InSight lander, the research team determined the solid core has a radius of about 600km, proportionally similar to Earth's. This discovery is significant because most bodies in the solar system have not cooled sufficiently to form a solid inner core from their liquid metal centers. The finding places Mars alongside Earth and the Moon as one of the few celestial bodies known to have this feature, potentially reviving theories about Mars' geological history.</p>
