          <p>Emily Thornberry has withdrawn from the race to become the next deputy leader of the UK's Labour Party, citing insufficient nominations from fellow Members of Parliament. Her exit leaves four candidates competing to replace Angela Rayner, with Education Secretary Bridget Phillipson currently the frontrunner. The contest requires candidates to secure 80 MP nominations to proceed to the next stage. The ongoing race is seen by some as a potential distraction for Prime Minister Sir Keir Starmer's government.</p>

          <p>Japan's Nikkei 225 stock index achieved a new record high, driven by optimism over potential U.S. Federal Reserve rate cuts and a significant surge in SoftBank Group's stock. SoftBank's shares jumped over 10% following a report of a major cloud-computing deal between Oracle and OpenAI, as SoftBank is linked to both through the "Stargate" AI initiative. While the Nikkei saw strong gains, other Asian markets had mixed results, with South Korea's Kospi also reaching a record high while Hong Kong's Hang Seng Index fell slightly.

          <p>A new Morgan Stanley report suggests that U.S. investor interest in Chinese stocks has reached its highest point in five years, with over 90% of surveyed investors expressing a desire to increase their exposure. This renewed interest extends beyond U.S.-listed Chinese companies to the onshore A-share market. The shift is attributed to China's leadership in certain tech sectors, government efforts to stabilize the economy, and a growing demand for diversification away from U.S. assets. The report concludes that this relocation of capital back to China is only just beginning. (not investment advice)</p>

          <h2>China's Rocket Force Blacklists Nearly 200 Suppliers and Evaluators Amid Corruption Probe</h2>

          <p>China's People's Liberation Army Rocket Force has banned 74 bid evaluation experts and 116 suppliers from its procurement projects following a major corruption investigation. The bans, announced on a military procurement network, are part of a broader anti-corruption campaign within the military's equipment sector. The Rocket Force, established in 2015, is a critical branch responsible for China's strategic nuclear missile arsenal. This crackdown reflects President Xi Jinping's ongoing efforts to enforce discipline and root out corruption within the armed forces.</p>

          <p>The Los Angeles Dodgers defeated the Colorado Rockies 9-0, completing a series sweep and extending their lead in the National League West division to three games. Mookie Betts led the offense with a four-hit, five-RBI performance that included a grand slam, while pitcher Blake Snell delivered six scoreless innings with 11 strikeouts. However, the victory was tempered by a late scratch of starting catcher Will Smith, who experienced swelling in his hand from a recent bone bruise. The team welcomed back infielder Tommy Edman from the injured list but continues to manage a series of injuries.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Everton FC has undergone a significant revival, moving from a relegation battle eight months ago to fifth in the Premier League. This turnaround is attributed to a record summer transfer window with a net spend of £97 million on nine new players, their highest ever. The club's improved financial situation is a result of minimal spending in previous years, a transformative takeover by the Friedkin Group that managed club debts, and the future revenue potential of their new, larger stadium. The strategic recruitment aims to correct past mistakes and build a competitive squad.</p>

          <p>NBA Commissioner Adam Silver has stated that the league requires clear evidence of wrongdoing before it will discipline the Los Angeles Clippers or owner Steve Ballmer over allegations of salary cap circumvention. The investigation centers on claims that an endorsement deal for star player Kawhi Leonard with a firm called Aspiration was orchestrated by the team as a side payment. Silver emphasized that the burden of proof is on the league and that he would be reluctant to act on a "mere appearance of impropriety." The investigation is being handled by an external law firm specializing in such probes.</p>

          <p>High-end luxury brands like Louis Vuitton and Prada are expanding into less expensive product categories, such as cosmetics and accessories, to attract a broader consumer base during a sector-wide slowdown. Louis Vuitton recently launched a beauty collection with lipsticks priced at $160, aiming to engage aspirational shoppers without devaluing its core high-ticket items. This strategy, sometimes called "treatonomics," banks on consumers splurging on small luxuries even as they cut back on major purchases. The goal is to build brand loyalty with younger consumers who may eventually graduate to more expensive products.</p>

A surprisingly weak U.S. producer price index reading further fueled optimism for a policy shift from the Fed.

          <p>China has invested nearly 450 billion yuan (US$63.2 billion) in a five-year strategic exploration program, resulting in significant new discoveries of oil, natural gas, copper, lithium, and uranium. Officials announced that over 500 large and medium-sized deposits have been identified since 2021, including 10 large oilfields and 19 major gas fields. These discoveries are part of China's broader strategy to enhance its energy security, dominate critical mineral supply chains, and reduce its reliance on foreign imports amid growing geopolitical tensions and technological demand.</p>

          <p>Prince Harry met with his father, King Charles, for a private tea at Clarence House, marking their first face-to-face meeting since February 2024. The roughly 50-minute reunion is being viewed as a small but potentially significant step toward reconciliation after years of public family tensions. In recent months, Prince Harry has publicly expressed a desire to reconcile, and the meeting's arrangement was kept confidential by both sides, suggesting a new level of cooperation. While a full family reconciliation, particularly with his brother Prince William, appears distant, the meeting itself is seen as a positive development.</p>

        </div>
        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>A real estate analysis by Redfin suggests that San Francisco's housing costs have returned to a "normal" level, defined as the mortgage payment-to-income ratio from July 2018. This normalization is due to a combination of slowing home-price growth and rapidly rising wages for high-earning tech workers in the city. While this indicates a return to a pre-pandemic equilibrium, it does not mean the city has become affordable, as San Francisco households still spend a much larger share of their income on housing than the national average. The trend also does not reflect the reality for renters, who face rising costs. (not investment advice)</p>
