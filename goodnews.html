          <p>The Asthma and Allergy Foundation of America's annual report identifies Wichita, Kansas, as the most challenging city for seasonal allergies for the third consecutive year, considering tree, grass, and weed pollen counts, allergy medicine use, and allergist availability. Dr. Purvi Parikh recommends starting allergy medications early, such as 24-hour antihistamines, eye drops, and nasal sprays, and also advises washing clothes, showering after outdoor activities, and washing bedsheets weekly to minimize allergen exposure. The article also suggests staying indoors during peak pollen times in the morning and late afternoon, and consulting a doctor if symptoms persist or breathing issues arise, as colds, viruses, and allergies share similar symptoms.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>While Chinese electric vehicle exports to the UK have decreased, exports of plug-in hybrid vehicles have experienced a significant surge, nearly 600% in the first quarter of the year. This trend is driven by factors such as affordability and the UK's standard 10% import tariff on non-EU rivals, in contrast to the higher tariffs imposed by the European Union. The UK has become China's second-largest export destination for EVs and the fifth-largest for hybrid electric vehicles. The article highlights the growing acceptance of Chinese car brands among British consumers.</p>

        </div>
        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Dr. Mathilde Ross, a senior staff psychiatrist, argues that the pursuit of perfect motherhood is harmful and unrealistic, emphasizing that flaws are essential for children to learn acceptance and resilience. Mothers often receive messages implying they aren't doing enough, partly due to historical biases in psychiatry that blamed mothers for children's issues. Ross encourages mothers to cut themselves some slack and recognize that their imperfections contribute to their children's development of healthy relationships and self-acceptance. The article concludes that mothers are already good enough.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>The average 30-year mortgage rate in the United States remained steady at 6.76%, close to its highest levels this year but below the rate from a year ago. Mortgage rates are influenced by factors including global demand for Treasury bonds, Federal Reserve policy decisions, and investor expectations about the economy and inflation. Elevated mortgage rates and rising home prices continue to pose affordability challenges for potential homebuyers, contributing to a lackluster spring home-buying season. Sales of previously occupied homes in the US have declined, marking the largest monthly drop since November 2022.</p>

She was detained for over six weeks after co-authoring an op-ed critical of Tufts' response to the war in Gaza. Ozturk's lawyers argue her arrest was unlawful, designed to punish her for exercising her First Amendment rights.
