        </div>
        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Analysts estimate that the Social Security cost-of-living adjustment (COLA) for 2026 could be between 2.7% and 2.8%, based on the latest inflation data. This would provide a modest increase to the monthly benefits received by millions of American retirees, potentially raising the average benefit by about $54 per month. The projection is slightly higher than the 2.5% COLA implemented in 2025 but remains in line with the 20-year average. The official COLA announcement from the Social Security Administration is expected in October after the final month of third-quarter inflation data is calculated. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>Shares of real estate company Opendoor skyrocketed by 50% after it announced the appointment of Shopify executive Kaz Nejatian as its new CEO and co-founder Keith Rabois as chairman. The leadership change follows the resignation of former CEO Carrie Wheeler, who stepped down amid pressure from investors critical of the company's direction. The stock, which had traded below $1 earlier this year and faced delisting, has seen a remarkable turnaround, rising over 400% year-to-date. This surge reflects renewed investor confidence in the company's strategy under its new leadership team. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>Vietnam is advancing a major transportation shift aimed at curbing severe air pollution by banning gasoline-powered motorcycles in urban centers and promoting electric alternatives. Prime Minister Pham Minh Chinh announced a plan to phase out gas motorbikes in Hanoi's central districts by 2026, with similar policies being considered for Ho Chi Minh City. This government push is driven by both environmental concerns, as Hanoi was recently named the world's most polluted metropolis, and industrial strategy to support domestic electric vehicle manufacturers like VinFast. While the policy addresses a critical public health issue, it also presents economic challenges for millions of commuters and informal workers.</p>

          <p>President Donald Trump is reportedly considering a trip to China to engage in direct negotiations aimed at resolving the ongoing trade war between the two economic superpowers. The potential visit could occur either before or after the upcoming Asia-Pacific Economic Cooperation (APEC) summit in South Korea. This diplomatic effort follows the imposition of significant tariffs on Chinese goods by the White House, which is also urging European allies to implement similar measures. According to analysts, preliminary meetings between officials are focused on managing expectations and preparing the groundwork for a potential high-stakes meeting between President Trump and Chinese President Xi Jinping.</p>

Opponents are challenging him on whether he supports controversial DSA platform points, such as closing jails and defunding the police. In response, Mamdani is attempting to distinguish his personal platform from that of the broader DSA organization, creating a delicate balancing act as he campaigns in a city with diverse political views. This situation highlights the growing pains and ideological tensions as democratic socialist candidates gain more mainstream prominence within the Democratic Party.</p>

          <p>Australia's government has committed $1.1 billion to construct dozens of large, autonomous underwater attack drones known as "Ghost Sharks." The stealthy, long-range vehicles are being developed locally by Anduril Australia, with the first delivery to the Royal Australian Navy scheduled for January of next year. Defense Minister Richard Marles stated the program places Australia at the forefront of autonomous underwater military technology, significantly enhancing its undersea warfare capabilities. These drones are designed to complement the nation's future fleet of nuclear-powered submarines acquired through the AUKUS partnership and will perform intelligence, surveillance, and strike operations.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>The European Central Bank has decided to keep its key interest rate unchanged at 2%, citing persistent economic uncertainty stemming from U.S. tariff policies. Although inflation in the eurozone is near the bank's 2% target, concerns remain about the impact of trade disputes on sluggish economic growth. ECB President Christine Lagarde noted that while recent trade agreements have reduced some uncertainty, the overall environment remains volatile. The central bank emphasized a data-dependent, meeting-by-meeting approach, offering little forward guidance on future rate cuts and signaling a cautious stance until the economic outlook becomes clearer.

          <p>The Thai government has lifted a long-standing ban and will now permit long-term refugees from Myanmar residing in border camps to legally work in the country. This policy shift affects around 80,000 refugees, some of whom have lived in the camps since the 1980s, and comes after the U.S. cut humanitarian food aid programs. The decision is intended to allow refugees to become self-sufficient and support their families, a move praised by the UN Refugee Agency as a potential "regional benchmark." The new policy may also help address labor shortages in Thailand, particularly in so-called "3D" jobs that are considered dirty, difficult, or dangerous.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>A recent Goldman Sachs survey reveals that family offices, the investment firms for the ultra-wealthy, are shifting their portfolio strategies by increasing allocations to public stocks and decreasing investments in private equity. The average allocation to public equities rose to 31%, while private equity fell to 21%, the largest change among all asset classes surveyed. This move towards more liquid assets comes despite concerns about geopolitical risks and inflation. The report suggests that while family offices remain committed to private markets for long-term growth, they are also positioning themselves to be more opportunistic in public markets during periods of dislocation.

          <p>Liu Jun, a prominent mathematician from Harvard University, has clarified that his decision to leave the U.S. and return to China was driven by personal and family reasons, not political protest or professional dissatisfaction. In an email to the South China Morning Post, Liu explained that his move to Tsinghua University is rooted in a deep connection to the campus where he was born and a desire to be with family. His departure is part of a broader trend of high-profile academics of Chinese descent leaving Western institutions, a phenomenon often linked to geopolitical tensions, but Liu insists his motivations are unrelated to the political climate.</p>

          <p>According to new U.S. Census Bureau data, the median household income in America rose to $83,730 in 2024, a 1.3% increase from the previous year. While the Census Bureau does not consider this change to be statistically significant, economists note that it is still an economically meaningful gain for many families as incomes outpaced inflation. The report also highlighted disparities in income growth, with the top 10% of earners seeing a 4.2% increase, while the bottom 10% saw only a 2.2% rise. Additionally, the gender wage gap among full-time workers widened for the second consecutive year. (not investment advice)</p>
