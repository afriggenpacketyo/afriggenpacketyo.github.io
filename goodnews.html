          <p>Apollo, a U.S. asset management firm, is set to loan ¬£4.5 billion to the Hinkley Point C nuclear project in the UK, marking a significant private capital investment in a project of national interest. The unsecured lending to EDF, the majority owner, is expected to have an interest rate below 7%, although the funds are believed to be specifically for Hinkley Point C. The project, which aims to construct two nuclear reactors, has faced delays and budget increases, especially after China General Nuclear Power Corp halted funding amid government tensions. The first reactor is anticipated to be operational by 2029, powering approximately six million homes and contributing to the UK's nuclear energy goals. (not investment advice)</p>

The company's fourth-quarter net income was $303.8 million, or $2.58 per share, with net sales rising 10.6% to $3.3 billion, partially driven by the acquisition of Chuy's Tex Mex restaurants. Same-store sales increased by 4.6%, with Olive Garden and LongHorn showing strong performance, while the fine dining segment experienced a decline. Darden's board also authorized a $1 billion share repurchase program, signaling confidence in the company's financial health and future prospects. (not investment advice)</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Researchers at the University of Edinburgh have found major differences in the blood of individuals with ME, also known as chronic fatigue syndrome, compared to healthy individuals, suggesting the condition is biological rather than psychological. The study, using data from the UK Biobank, compared 1,455 ME/CFS patients with 131,000 healthy individuals and identified consistent blood differences associated with chronic inflammation, insulin resistance, and liver disease. This finding challenges the long-held belief that ME/CFS is primarily psychological and supports the development of a diagnostic blood test, and the research also indicated that ME is a "female bias" condition.</p>
