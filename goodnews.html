          <div class="timestamp">2025-05-17 18:33:25 EDT</div>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Federal courts are increasingly pushing back against the Trump administration's aggressive deportation policies, insisting on due process for immigrants facing removal. The Supreme Court recently criticized the administration for providing inadequate warning to Venezuelan immigrants facing deportation under an 18th-century wartime law. This article discusses several cases where courts have intervened to ensure immigrants have the opportunity to challenge their deportations, particularly when Trump officials invoke novel powers to remove them. The courts' stance underscores the constitutional principle that all 'persons' are entitled to due process before being deprived of life, liberty, or property.</p>

          <p>Prime Minister Sir Keir Starmer has signaled that a youth mobility scheme could be part of a new deal with the EU, allowing young people to work abroad for up to two years. Starmer insisted this would not be a return to pre-Brexit freedom of movement, describing it as a 'reciprocal' arrangement. Kemi Badenoch and Reform UK have criticized the possible scheme, describing it as 'free movement through the back door'. An agreement is expected to be announced at a summit on Monday, although details about eligibility and numbers remain unspecified.</p>

          <p>Paleontologists have discovered the fossilized remains of Mosura fentoni, a 500-million-year-old, three-eyed predator, in the Burgess Shale of the Canadian Rockies. The creature, nicknamed the 'sea moth,' was about the length of an index finger, with a circular mouth lined with teeth and claws extending from its head. The discovery provides new insights into animal life during the Cambrian period and reveals that the Mosura was more complex than previously understood.
