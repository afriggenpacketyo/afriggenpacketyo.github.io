          <p>Following the sudden departure of executive chairman Daniel Levy, Tottenham Hotspur has elevated Vinai Venkatesham to the role of chief executive, effectively making him the club's most senior executive. Venkatesham, who previously spent 14 years at rival club Arsenal, is known for his role in appointing manager Mikel Arteta and for his inclusive and empathetic leadership style. His legacy at Arsenal also includes significant commercial growth and a commitment to the women's team. His appointment signals a potential shift in Tottenham's boardroom dynamics, moving away from Levy's famously tough negotiation tactics toward a more collaborative approach to management and transfers.</p>

          <p>A Massachusetts toddler named Jonny Terrell has entered remission after a harrowing battle with malignant rhabdoid tumor, a rare and highly aggressive cancer. His mother, Emily Robichau, knew something was wrong when her son experienced a constant stream of illnesses leading up to his first birthday. Her persistence led to the discovery of a grapefruit-sized tumor in his liver, a diagnosis that carries a grim prognosis with only about a 10% survival rate. Doctors at Massachusetts General Hospital developed an individualized treatment plan involving intensive chemotherapy, surgery, and radiation, which ultimately proved successful. The family is now celebrating his recovery and transitioning to a new normal.</p>

          <p>Chinese researchers claim to have developed an AI-enhanced radar system that is virtually impossible to jam, according to a recent peer-reviewed paper. In a landmark test flight, the artificial intelligence-powered system maintained a target lock over 99% of the time, a significant improvement over conventional radar which lost contact in approximately a quarter of the engagement time. The project's lead scientist stated that this technological leap could lead to a "paradigm shift in radar design philosophy." This development, originating from China's top military radar institute, represents a potentially major advancement in electronic warfare capabilities and defense technology.</p>

          <p>Susan Stamberg, a pioneering voice at NPR and the first woman to anchor a national nightly news broadcast in the United States, is retiring after a career spanning more than five decades. As a co-host of "All Things Considered" starting in 1972, her curious, sharp, and personable style helped define the network's sound and distinguish it from the more somber, male-dominated broadcasts of the era.

          <h2>Recent Breakthroughs in Dementia Research Offer New Hope for Prevention and Early Detection</h2>

          <p>Researchers are expressing significant optimism about recent progress in the fight against dementia, citing major advances in prevention, diagnosis, and treatment. A key development is the U.S. POINTER Study, which demonstrated that a regimen of physical activity, healthy diet, brain exercises, and social engagement can improve cognitive function in at-risk individuals. Additionally, the FDA's approval of a new blood test offers a simpler, earlier method for diagnosing Alzheimer's disease by detecting key biomarkers. Experts believe these breakthroughs could empower patients and doctors to delay or prevent the progression of the disease through both lifestyle changes and medical intervention, marking a pivotal moment in dementia care.</p>

          <p>Ethereum is experiencing a surge in institutional adoption, positioning it as a potentially strong long-term asset in the cryptocurrency market. Following a trend set by corporate investments in Bitcoin, companies are increasingly adding Ethereum to their treasuries, and inflows into spot Ethereum ETFs have grown substantially, reaching over $9 billion in July and August alone. While the platform faces competition from faster, lower-fee blockchains like Solana and Tron, its dominance in decentralized finance (DeFi) and stablecoins remains a key strength. Despite its inherent volatility, the growing acceptance by major financial players suggests a maturing market for the world's second-largest cryptocurrency. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>The BBC has confirmed that chef and television host Matt Tebbutt will join the judging panel for the next series of "MasterChef: The Professionals." He will replace Gregg Wallace, who was dismissed in July after an independent inquiry upheld numerous allegations of misconduct, including inappropriate comments and unwelcome physical contact. Tebbutt, known for hosting "Saturday Kitchen," will work alongside established judges Marcus Wareing and Monica Galetti. The appointment marks a significant change for the popular cooking competition as it moves forward from the controversy that led to the departure of both Wallace and his co-host on the main series, John Torode.</p>

          <p>China is developing a planetary defense mission to test its ability to alter the orbit of an asteroid, a top space program official has announced. The mission, which could launch as early as this year, would target a small asteroid millions of kilometers from Earth with the goal of demonstrating a "kinetic impact" technique. The plan involves sending both an impactor spacecraft to collide with the asteroid and an observer spacecraft to monitor the results of the collision. If successful, China would become only the second nation, after the United States, to demonstrate the capability to defend the planet from potentially hazardous near-Earth objects.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>With the price of gold hitting new records and surpassing $3,600 an ounce, investors are increasingly looking to the precious metal as a safe-haven asset amid economic uncertainty. Financial experts suggest that the most efficient way for individuals to gain exposure to gold is not by purchasing physical bars or coins, but through exchange-traded funds (ETFs) that track the price of bullion. These ETFs, such as SPDR Gold Shares (GLD), are noted for their liquidity, low costs, and tax efficiency compared to owning physical gold. Despite the current rally, advisors generally recommend that gold should constitute only a small portion, typically less than 3%, of a well-diversified investment portfolio.

          <p>Ten years after its Broadway debut, the cultural phenomenon "Hamilton" is being reassessed as a filmed version of the original production arrives in movie theaters. The article explores how the musical, once seen as a symbol of the hopeful, progressive Obama era, feels different in the political climate of 2025. Initially celebrated for its diverse casting and hip-hop storytelling of America's founding, the show later faced criticism for glossing over the darker aspects of the historical figures it portrays. The analysis suggests that while the show's optimistic vision of America may feel dated to some, its underlying themes of political polarization and fragility remain profoundly relevant.</p>

          <p>Carlo Acutis, an Italian teenager who died of leukemia in 2006, is set to be canonized as the Catholic Church's first Millennial saint, presenting a unique figure for the modern faith. Known for his love of video games and his skills in web design, the Church has highlighted his "normality" as an example for young people in the digital age. However, Acutis was also deeply devout, limiting his gaming to one hour a week and creating a website dedicated to Eucharistic miracles. This blend of a contemporary, tech-savvy life with a profound, almost mystical faith appeals to different factions within Catholicism, reflecting the Church's ongoing effort to navigate its place in the 21st century.</p>

Anisimova is looking to overcome the memory of a crushing 6-0, 6-0 loss in her first major final at Wimbledon just two months ago. The final will test the mental fortitude of both powerful ball-strikers, as Sabalenka aims to secure a Grand Slam title in a dominant year and Anisimova seeks to prove her resilience after a devastating setback.</p>

The long-overdue recognition comes amid contemporary debates about how American history is taught and remembered.

          <p>Ford is developing a new, more affordable electric pickup truck slated for a 2027 release, which will be built using an innovative manufacturing process designed to slash costs. The vehicle will feature a battery that is one-third smaller than those in current competitor models but is engineered to deliver a similar range. By redesigning the assembly process into a modular "tree" model, Ford claims it can significantly reduce the number of parts, welds, and fasteners required, aiming for a target price point of around $30,000. This strategy is part of the company's ambitious plan to make its electric vehicle division profitable after years of heavy investment in research and development.</p>
