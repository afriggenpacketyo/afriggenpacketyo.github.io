          <h2>Shingles Vaccine Linked to Lowered Heart Disease Risk in New Study</h2>
          <div class="timestamp">2025-05-05 19:05:08 EDT</div>
        </div>
        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>A recent study published in the European Heart Journal suggests that the shingles vaccine may offer protection against cardiovascular events such as stroke, heart failure, and coronary heart disease for up to eight years. The research, involving over one million people aged 50 or older, found a 23% lower risk of such events in those who received the vaccine, with the protective effect being more pronounced in men, individuals under 60, and those with unhealthy lifestyle habits. Researchers suggest that preventing shingles through vaccination may reduce blood vessel damage, inflammation, and clot formation, which can contribute to heart disease, while also noting that further research is needed on recombinant vaccines like Shingrix to confirm similar benefits. The CDC recommends the two-dose shingles vaccine starting at age 50, given the increased risk of shingles with age.</p>

          <p>Sir David Attenborough, nearing his 99th birthday, is releasing a new film titled Ocean, which he believes is crucial for saving biodiversity and combating climate change, arguing that the ocean is humanity's greatest ally against climate catastrophe. The film documents the decline in ocean life during Attenborough's lifetime, showing the damage caused by bottom trawling and its contribution to carbon dioxide emissions. Despite the grim reality, Attenborough remains optimistic, highlighting the ocean's remarkable ability to recover, citing the recovery of whale populations after the ban on commercial whaling. He hopes the film will inspire leaders to take action at an upcoming UN conference to protect a third of the world's oceans, emphasizing that a healthier ocean ecosystem can trap more carbon dioxide.</p>

          <p>China's e-commerce giants, including Alibaba, JD.com, and Meituan, are engaged in a new battle centered on "instant commerce," which combines online shopping with extremely fast delivery. This service offers consumers in major cities the convenience of receiving a wide range of products, from fast fashion to everyday items, within an hour, often subsidized to be very affordable. China's advanced transport and warehousing infrastructure, along with powerful algorithms and a large delivery workforce, make this possible, but investors are concerned about the intensified competition and the potential for a zero-sum fight among platforms. The article notes that the working conditions of delivery couriers, who are part of China's gig economy, have raised concerns about insufficient social security and long working hours.</p>

          <p>Former Governor Andrew Cuomo is facing scrutiny for potentially violating New York City campaign finance rules by using his campaign website to provide strategic information to a super PAC supporting his mayoral bid. This practice, known as red-boxing, is aimed at circumventing rules that prohibit direct coordination between candidates and super PACs. Cuomo's website included polling data, pre-edited video clips, and instructions for targeted advertising, some of which appeared in the super PAC's ads. The New York City Campaign Finance Board has warned campaigns about the new rules against red-boxing, and a formal investigation has been requested by one of Cuomo's opponents.</p>

          <p>President Donald Trump falsely claimed that gasoline prices have fallen below $2 per gallon, in his push to convince the Federal Reserve to lower interest rates. In reality, U.S. drivers were paying $3.165 per gallon on average, according to AAA, which is an increase since Trump took office. Trump administration officials pointed to RBOB gasoline futures, which did touch $1.98 per gallon, but this contract does not reflect what drivers are currently paying at the pump.
