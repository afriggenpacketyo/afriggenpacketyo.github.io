        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Collaborative design software company Figma has filed for an initial public offering, planning to trade on the New York Stock Exchange. This move comes after a planned $20 billion acquisition by Adobe was terminated due to regulatory issues, resulting in a $1 billion fee paid to Figma. The company has shown strong growth, with a 46% revenue increase in the first quarter and a growing base of high-value customers. The IPO is seen as a positive sign for the tech market, which has seen renewed activity after a prolonged slump.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>France has enacted a new law that significantly expands its ban on smoking to include most public areas like beaches, parks, and spaces near schools and libraries. The move aims to "denormalize" smoking, particularly among young people, and combat the high rate of tobacco-related deaths in the country. Violators of the new rules face fines starting at 135 euros, though an initial grace period is expected. While smoking has been illegal in indoor venues like restaurants since 2008, caf√© terraces remain one of the last public refuges for smokers.</p>

          <p>India's cricket team defeated England by 24 runs in their T20 match, establishing a 2-0 lead in the five-match series. After a difficult start, India recovered to set a competitive score of 181-4, thanks to strong performances from Jemimah Rodrigues and Amanjot Kaur. England's batting response faltered early, and despite a notable effort from Tammy Beaumont, they were unable to chase the target, finishing at 157-7.

          <p>The announcement that Republican Senator Thom Tillis will not seek reelection has intensified the political landscape for North Carolina's 2026 Senate race. His decision opens the door for new candidates from both parties in what is expected to be a key battleground state. On the Republican side, names being floated include Lara Trump, the former president's daughter-in-law, who has received his endorsement. For the Democrats, popular former Governor Roy Cooper is strongly considering a run, setting up a potentially high-profile and fiercely contested election.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>The dating app Tinder is now requiring all of its users in California to undergo a mandatory face verification process. The feature, called Face Check, prompts users to record a video selfie, which is then used to confirm their identity against their profile photos. This initiative is part of a broader effort by Tinder's parent company, Match Group, to enhance user safety, build trust, and combat the rising issue of romance scams and fraudulent accounts. While voluntary verification has been available, this mandatory rollout aims to stop bad actors who typically avoid such measures.</p>

          <p>Oklahoma City Thunder star Shai Gilgeous-Alexander has signed a four-year, $285 million contract extension, giving him the richest average annual salary in NBA history at $71.25 million. This article analyzes how his mega-deal compares to top contracts across other major American sports. While MLB players like Shohei Ohtani and Juan Soto have larger total contract values due to longer terms, NBA players consistently earn higher average annual salaries because of smaller roster sizes. The highest-paid NFL players are exclusively quarterbacks, with top deals also reaching over $50 million per year. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>Stocks for clean energy companies, including NextEra Energy and AES, saw a significant jump after a proposed tax on solar and wind projects was removed from the final Senate version of the Republican spending bill. The tax would have applied to projects using components from foreign entities like China and could have cost the industry up to $7 billion. While the removal of the tax was a relief to the industry, the bill still phases out key investment tax credits for renewables. Industry groups maintain that the overall legislation remains harmful to America's clean energy goals. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>A bankruptcy judge has approved the sale of the genetic testing company 23andMe to a nonprofit organization led by its co-founder, Anne Wojcicki, for $305 million. The company's financial collapse had raised significant privacy concerns over the fate of its 13 million customers' genetic data. The judge noted that the sale to Wojcicki's nonprofit was a better outcome for privacy, as she is committed to honoring customer rights to delete their data. The sale provides a potential path forward for the once-billion-dollar company, which struggled with growth and a 2023 data breach.</p>
