          <p>The Trump administration held a summit with leaders from Gabon, Guinea-Bissau, Liberia, Mauritania, and Senegal, framing the event as a significant commercial opportunity. The meetings focused on President Trump's "trade, not aid" approach to the continent, with discussions centered on U.S. investment, access to natural resources like rare earth minerals, and potential tariff negotiations. The African leaders praised Trump, with some encouraging U.S. investment to counter growing influence from China and Russia. The article suggests this reflects a strategic shift in U.S. policy toward Africa, prioritizing economic and security interests, such as maritime security and migration control.</p>

          <p>Shares of cereal manufacturer WK Kellogg experienced a dramatic surge following reports that Italian confectioner Ferrero is nearing a deal to acquire the company for approximately $3 billion. The potential acquisition would bring iconic brands like Froot Loops and Frosted Flakes under the ownership of the company famous for Nutella and Ferrero Rocher. This move is part of a larger trend of consolidation in the packaged foods industry, as traditional cereal companies face declining sales due to consumer shifts toward healthier breakfast options and private-label brands. The deal could be finalized as soon as this week. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>Bitcoin's price surged to a new all-time high of over $112,000, buoyed by a strong rally in the technology sector, particularly Nvidia's recent market performance. Despite significant inflows into bitcoin exchange-traded funds, the cryptocurrency had been trading in a narrow range for weeks before this recent breakout. The rally demonstrates bitcoin's nature as a risk asset, often moving in tandem with growth-oriented stocks when market sentiment is positive. Investors remain optimistic about further gains, anticipating increased corporate adoption and potential progress on cryptocurrency legislation in the U.S. Congress. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>The price of gold has recently experienced a slight downturn, dropping about 4% from its mid-June high, which presents a potential entry point for investors. While the dip is modest, it comes after a period of significant gains that saw the precious metal surpass the $3,000 per ounce milestone. Experts suggest this price decline is likely to be temporary, with factors like inflation reports and Federal Reserve meetings potentially driving prices back up. The article argues that waiting could risk missing out, as the next price surge might push gold to new highs, making it less accessible. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>Chipmaking giant Nvidia achieved a historic milestone as its market capitalization briefly exceeded $4 trillion during Wednesday's trading, a first for any company. The surge was driven by immense investor demand for the company's hardware, which is fundamental to the booming generative artificial intelligence industry. Although the stock closed slightly lower, leaving the company's value just under the $4 trillion mark, it remains the world's most valuable company, having surpassed Microsoft and Apple. This rapid growth underscores Nvidia's dominant position in the AI sector, despite geopolitical tensions and U.S. export restrictions impacting sales to China. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>The Bank of England has recommended relaxing the cap on riskier mortgage lending, a move that could provide greater access to homeownership for first-time buyers in the UK. The proposal would allow individual banks to issue a higher percentage of their new mortgages to borrowers with large loan-to-income ratios. Major lenders have welcomed the potential change, stating it could help people struggling with high rents and strict affordability tests. While this could stimulate the housing market, the Bank also noted that millions of existing mortgage holders face significant increases in their monthly payments. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>The U.S. Supreme Court has declined to lift a lower court's block on a controversial Florida law that criminalizes the entry of undocumented immigrants into the state. This decision keeps the law on hold while legal challenges, which argue it unconstitutionally encroaches on the federal government's exclusive authority over immigration, proceed. The law, signed by Governor Ron DeSantis, imposes mandatory prison sentences and was challenged by the ACLU and other advocacy groups. The Supreme Court's action is a significant setback for Florida and other states that have recently passed similar hardline immigration measures.</p>
