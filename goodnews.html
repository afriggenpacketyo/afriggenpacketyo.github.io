          <p>A long-standing succession dispute within Rupert Murdoch's media empire has concluded, with his son Lachlan set to take control. The agreement finalizes the leadership transition, ensuring the conservative direction of properties like Fox News and The Wall Street Journal. The deal resolves all litigation over the family trust by creating a new trust for Lachlan, while his more moderate siblings will sell their shares and cease to have influence over the company's editorial direction. This resolution ends a real-life family drama that famously inspired the television show "Succession."</p>

          <p>England's cricket captain, Ben Stokes, has returned to training with his county side Durham after recovering from a shoulder injury, providing a significant boost ahead of the upcoming Ashes series in Australia. Durham's head coach confirmed that Stokes has started batting again, though his return to bowling will be a more gradual process. The update is positive news for England's chances in the high-profile series, as Stokes is considered a crucial all-rounder for the team. Additionally, fast bowler Mark Wood is also nearing a return to play after knee surgery.</p>

          <p>In a recent interview, Supreme Court Justice Amy Coney Barrett countered perceptions of the court as a partisan institution, stating that justices "wear black, not red or blue." Promoting her new book, she emphasized that the court's decisions are based on legal interpretation and constitutional principles, not political affiliations. Barrett addressed misconceptions about rulings like the Dobbs decision, clarifying it returned the issue of abortion to the political process rather than outlawing it. She stressed that the court must rule on the law, even when its decisions are unpopular, to maintain its integrity.</p>

          <p>China has demonstrated a remarkable ability to reduce pollution while continuing its industrial expansion, a process described as "industrialisation-driven decarbonisation." Research indicates a significant drop in PM2.5 air pollution levels and major improvements in water quality over the past decade. This success is attributed to massive investments in green infrastructure, the deployment of advanced technology, and real-time environmental monitoring. The progress, comparable to what the United States achieved over three decades, showcases a model where economic growth and environmental protection can occur simultaneously.</p>

          <p>Staff at Angel Island State Park recently filmed a coyote swimming across the Raccoon Strait, a deep channel separating the island from mainland Marin County. This sighting offers a fascinating look into how a "budding population" of coyotes, first observed on the island in 2017, likely arrived. Researchers believe the animals, which are strong swimmers, paddled about a mile through strong currents to establish a new predator niche on the island. The growing population, now estimated at 14 to 17 related individuals, is part of a broader expansion of coyotes across the Bay Area.</p>

          <p>A Los Angeles Superior Court judge has upheld the city's decision to designate Marilyn Monroe's former Brentwood home as a historic cultural monument, effectively saving it from demolition for a second time. The homeowners had challenged the landmark status, arguing they had the right to raze the property, which they purchased in 2023. The house, the only one Monroe ever owned herself and where she died in 1962, has been the subject of a preservation battle between the owners and Monroe's fans and historians. This ruling appears to be a final victory for those seeking to protect the iconic property.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Despite the Federal Reserve being widely expected to cut interest rates in September, financial experts suggest that high-yield savings accounts remain a worthwhile option for many savers. Although returns are no longer at their recent peaks, they are still exponentially higher than those offered by traditional savings accounts. Any initial rate cuts are expected to be gradual, meaning the impact on earnings will not be immediate. Furthermore, these accounts provide continued liquidity and access to funds, which is valuable in an unpredictable economic climate. (not investment advice)</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>As the average rate for a 30-year fixed mortgage approaches a one-year low, financial experts advise that prospective homebuyers can take steps to secure even better terms. Key strategies include improving one's credit score, as higher scores qualify for lower interest rates. Making a larger down payment, ideally 20% or more, can also lead to more favorable loan terms and eliminate the need for private mortgage insurance. Additionally, borrowers should consider alternatives to a 30-year fixed loan, such as an adjustable-rate mortgage (ARM), which often has a lower initial interest rate. (not investment advice)</p>
