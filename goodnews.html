          <p>This NPR segment covers two distinct global stories: the death of the legendary Bolshoi Ballet choreographer Yuri Grigorovich, and Nepal's first-ever monkey census. Grigorovich, who served as the Bolshoi Ballet's artistic director for three decades during the Soviet era, is remembered for his wildly popular productions that also projected soft power overseas. In Nepal, the government is undertaking a monkey census to address the ongoing issue of monkeys stealing food from people's property. The census aims to provide a clearer understanding of the extent of the problem and inform future mitigation strategies.</p>

          <p>Zscaler shares experienced a significant increase after the company announced better-than-expected results for its third fiscal quarter, primarily fueled by artificial intelligence and the increasing adoption of its zero-trust security platform. CEO Jay Chaudhry stated that the proliferation of AI is driving the need for AI security. The company's revenues increased by 23% to $678 million, surpassing estimates, and adjusted earnings per share also exceeded expectations. Zscaler's performance is a positive indicator for the cybersecurity industry, which has faced challenges in a volatile macroeconomic environment.</p>

          <p>Amy Jones and Tammy Beaumont each scored centuries, setting up a 108-run victory for England against the West Indies in a recent cricket match. New coach Jon Lewis emphasized a clearer gameplan and a move away from inspiring and entertaining, which was put into practice by the batters. Jones and Beaumont adjusted to the slow bowling attack and ensured they had wickets in hand before accelerating in the final 20 overs. England's opening stand was their fifth-highest partnership in women's ODI history and their highest against the West Indies in the format.</p>

          <p>Tesla shares experienced a rally in May, despite recent sales figures in China and Europe, as CEO Elon Musk pledged to dedicate more focus to his businesses rather than politics. The stock gained over 22% for the month, although it remains down 14% for the year. The increase coincided with the end of Musk's tenure as a "special government employee" at the helm of the Department of Government Efficiency. Musk indicated that he would continue to advise the president and remain available for assistance if needed.</p>

          <p>The remains of 19 Black New Orleanians, whose skulls were dismembered and shipped to Germany in the late 1800s for racist research, have been repatriated for memorialization and burial. The research, which sought to prove the debunked theory that Black people's brains were smaller, was conducted on individuals who died at New Orleans' charity hospital. Leipzig University contacted the city of New Orleans to inform it of the 19 skulls. The city formed a cultural repatriation committee, led by historian Eva Baham, which includes representatives from Dillard University, the city of New Orleans, the University medical center and other community partners.</p>

          <p>Jim Cramer discusses the stock market's resilience despite President Trump's erratic trade policies and tariff announcements. While Trump's trade-related statements and actions have caused confusion, the market has focused on positive signs in the U.S. economy, such as job growth and slowing inflation. Cramer highlights that investors are closely watching signs of resilience in the U.S. economy instead. He suggests that investors are focusing on the health of the consumer and that the companies are adapting to mitigate the impact of tariffs. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>President Donald Trump will hold a rally at a U.S. Steel plant near Pittsburgh, a week after signaling that he had cleared a controversial merger with Japan's Nippon Steel. Investors and union members will listen for answers from the president on what shape the deal he announced between U.S. Steel and Nippon will take. Trump described the deal as a "partnership" in a May 23 post on his social media platform Truth Social. The president said U.S. Steel's headquarters would remain in Pittsburgh and Nippon would invest $14 billion over 14 months in the more than 120-year-old American industrial icon.</p>
