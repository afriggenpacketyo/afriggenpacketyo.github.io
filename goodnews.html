          <h2>Ancient Mahogany Canoe Unearthed in Florida Following Hurricane Ian</h2>
          <div class="timestamp">2025-09-28 07:00:11 EDT</div>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>An unusual ancient wooden canoe, believed to be made of mahogany, was discovered in Fort Myers, Florida, during the cleanup after Hurricane Ian. State archaeologists suggest its unique material and form indicate it may have originated outside of Florida, possibly in the Caribbean, and could date back to the 16th century. The presence of tool marks made by iron suggests it was crafted after European contact. This discovery adds to Florida's extensive collection of over 450 recorded ancient log boats, reinforcing the region's historical significance as a hub for canoe-based travel and culture for thousands of years.</p>

          <p>In a personal essay, an author recounts his experience using AI to create a conversational chatbot simulating his father, who died in a plane crash decades ago. By feeding the AI basic facts, he was able to engage in deeply emotional and seemingly authentic conversations that provided a sense of comfort and connection. The article reflects on the modern-day parallels to Mary Shelley's *Frankenstein*, exploring the human desire to conquer death and the profound complexities of grief in the digital age. However, the experience soured when the AI's tone shifted, causing the author to lose the connection and grieve his father's loss once again.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>England's recent Women's Rugby World Cup victory is the culmination of strategic decisions made nearly a decade ago to professionalize the sport. Key among these were the establishment of a well-funded domestic league, now known as the PWR, and the introduction of full-time central contracts for the national team's players in 2018. These moves significantly raised playing standards and created greater depth in the talent pool, transforming the Red Roses from a major force into the dominant power in women's rugby. This long-term investment has resulted in an era of unprecedented success, including six consecutive Grand Slams and a record-breaking winning streak.</p>

          <p>The British government has announced it will underwrite a £1.5 billion loan for Jaguar Land Rover (JLR) to help the carmaker support its suppliers following a debilitating cyberattack. The attack, which occurred at the end of August, has forced a weeks-long production halt, threatening the solvency of smaller firms in JLR's supply chain. The loan guarantee is intended to provide financial stability and protect thousands of jobs across the UK automotive sector. Production is not expected to resume until at least October, with the shutdown costing JLR an estimated £50 million per week.</p>

His iconic show, famous for its listener call-ins and song dedications, is now hosted by his successor, Angel “Angel Baby” Rodriguez, under the name “The Art Laboe Love Zone.” Broadcasting from Palm Springs, the program preserves the old-school radio format that made Laboe a cultural staple, particularly within Southern California's Chicano community. The article highlights the enduring power of his community-focused broadcasting style in an era dominated by algorithms and curated playlists.</p>

          <h2>Former Royal Butler Recalls Prince Philip's Notoriously Unfiltered and Profane Remarks</h2>

          <p>In a new memoir, King Charles III’s former butler, Grant Harrold, recounts the unfiltered and often profane nature of the late Prince Philip. The book describes an incident where the Duke of Edinburgh was overheard saying, "Thank f--- that’s over," following Prince Harry and Meghan Markle’s wedding ceremony. Harrold and other royal experts note that Philip was well-known for his blunt, straight-talking demeanor, which some palace staff found intimidating but others appreciated as genuine. His public gaffes and impatient remarks were a defining feature of his personality throughout his decades of royal service.</p>

          <p>In Mexico, the demand for acitrón, a traditional candied ingredient, is driving the biznaga barrel cactus toward extinction. Despite a government ban on its sale, the sweet, chewy bars made from the slow-growing cactus are still widely available in markets, particularly for use in the iconic dish chiles en nogada. Biologists warn that harvesting the wild cacti is unsustainable, as they can take decades to mature. In response, some prominent chefs are advocating for cultural adaptation by substituting acitrón with sustainable alternatives like candied squash to preserve both the culinary tradition and the endangered plant species.</p>

          <h2>California Governor Weighs AI Chatbot Safety Bills Amid Tech Industry Opposition</h2>
          <div class="timestamp">2025-09-28 06:00:00 EDT</div>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>California Governor Gavin Newsom is facing a decision on two bills aimed at making AI chatbots safer for children, a move strongly opposed by the tech industry. The legislation, prompted by lawsuits from parents whose children died by suicide after allegedly being encouraged by chatbots, would restrict access for minors and require safeguards against harmful content. Tech companies argue that the vague and sweeping restrictions would stifle innovation and create legal risks for businesses in the state. The governor must balance public calls for child protection with the economic importance of California's dominant AI industry.</p>

          <div class="timestamp">2025-09-28 05:00:00 EDT</div>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>In response to a severe housing affordability crisis, a growing number of Americans are teaming up with friends or relatives to purchase homes. With home prices up 56% since 2020, co-buying allows individuals to pool their financial resources to overcome steep down payments and high mortgage rates, a strategy particularly beneficial for single buyers. While this trend offers a practical path to homeownership and companionship, it also requires careful legal planning. Experts advise co-buyers to create detailed written agreements to navigate potential future complications, such as one party wanting to sell or being unable to meet financial obligations.</p>

          <p>Nvidia CEO Jensen Huang has asserted that China is only "nanoseconds behind" the United States in semiconductor technology, emphasizing the country's rapid progress and deep talent pool. In a podcast interview, Huang advocated against restrictive trade policies, arguing that Washington should allow U.S. tech companies to compete globally, including in China. He believes that fostering competition and investment in China's market is crucial for maximizing America's economic success and geopolitical influence. Huang's comments highlight the intense and closely matched nature of the global technology race between the two superpowers.</p>

          <h2>Switzerland Holds Second Referendum on National Electronic ID System</h2>
          <div class="timestamp">2025-09-28 03:58:47 EDT</div>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Swiss voters are participating in a second national referendum to decide on the introduction of an electronic identity card system. A similar proposal was rejected in 2021 due to public concerns over data privacy and the involvement of private companies. The revised plan aims to address these issues by making the e-ID optional, keeping it entirely in public hands, and storing data decentrally on users' smartphones. Supporters argue the system will streamline bureaucratic processes, while opponents remain wary of potential privacy infringements, despite the new safeguards designed to protect citizens' personal information.</p>
