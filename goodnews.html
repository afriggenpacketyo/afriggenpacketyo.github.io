        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) has revised its COVID-19 vaccine recommendations, stating that healthy children "may receive" the vaccine, replacing the previous broad recommendation for universal vaccination. This change follows an announcement by Health and Human Services Secretary Robert F. Kennedy Jr., and reflects a shift towards shared clinical decision-making. While insurance companies are still required to cover the shots, the CDC now recommends the vaccine primarily for immunocompromised children and adults. The agency's updated guidance also removes the recommendation for universal vaccination during pregnancy, citing a lack of high-quality safety data, although some agency pages still advise vaccination for pregnant women due to their higher risk of severe disease.</p>

          <p>A review of the film 'Bring Her Back' discusses the current trend in horror movies to focus on psychological and philosophical themes rather than pure scares. While the film features Sally Hawkins in a strong performance as a foster mother with ulterior motives, it ultimately struggles to balance highbrow storytelling with visceral horror elements. The reviewer notes that the film is more successful in portraying the lead character's personal story of loss than in exploring the abuse faced by the children. The movie serves as an adequate example of a horror movie, but is not as good as it could be.</p>
