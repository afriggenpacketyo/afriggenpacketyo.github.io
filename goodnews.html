          <p>Nvidia's stock is on track for its sixth consecutive day of gains, reaching a new record high amid broad strength in the semiconductor sector. Concurrently, asset management firm BlackRock received a significant endorsement from Bank of America, which raised its price target and expressed confidence in the company's future net flows and strategic positioning. Analysts believe BlackRock is well-positioned to capitalize on growth in alternative assets and the increasing demand for power driven by AI infrastructure. These developments reflect positive investor sentiment in key technology and financial sectors. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>A team from Purdue University is planning an expedition to a remote Pacific island to investigate an underwater object they believe could be Amelia Earhart's lost Electra 10E plane. The "Taraia Object," identified in satellite imagery of a lagoon on Nikumaroro, has been visible in photos since 1938, a year after Earhart's disappearance. This theory posits that Earhart landed on the island and was marooned, and the expedition aims to find "smoking-gun proof" by dredging and examining the object. If confirmed, the university hopes to recover the aircraft, which it originally funded for her historic flight.</p>

          <p>The remains of U.S. Navy Fireman 1st Class Edward D. Bowden, who was killed during the 1941 attack on Pearl Harbor, have been officially identified. Bowden was 29 and serving aboard the USS California when it was sunk by Japanese forces, resulting in the deaths of over 100 crewmen. His remains were among those deemed unidentifiable for decades and were buried at the National Memorial Cemetery of the Pacific. Through modern DNA analysis and other scientific methods, the Defense POW/MIA Accounting Agency successfully made the identification, bringing long-awaited closure to his family.</p>

The article breaks down the financial implications for both new buyers and existing homeowners considering a refinance.

          <p>Fair Isaac, the company behind the FICO credit score, has seen its stock price jump over 20% after announcing a new direct-to-lender pricing model. The change will allow mortgage lenders to license FICO scores directly, bypassing credit bureaus and eliminating what the company calls unnecessary mark-ups. This move is expected to disrupt the current distribution model and has caused the stock prices of major credit bureaus like Experian, TransUnion, and Equifax to fall. The new plan aims to provide more choice and better economics for lenders who rely on the scores for mortgage decisions. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>Tesla announced it delivered 497,099 vehicles in the third quarter, a 7% increase compared to the same period last year, though its stock price dipped following the news. The rise in sales is partially attributed to a rush by U.S. buyers to take advantage of a key federal tax credit for electric vehicles that expired at the end of September. While deliveries were up year-over-year, production saw a slight decline. The results come amid a challenging sales environment for Tesla in Europe but reflect a short-term boost in its domestic market. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>Warren Buffett's Berkshire Hathaway has agreed to purchase OxyChem, the petrochemical subsidiary of Occidental Petroleum, in a $9.7 billion all-cash deal. This transaction is Berkshire's largest acquisition since 2022 and comes as the conglomerate holds a near-record cash pile. Occidental, in which Berkshire already holds a significant stake, plans to use the proceeds to pay down debt, a move its CEO says will enable the company to restart its stock buyback program. The deal deepens the financial ties between the two companies, which began with Berkshire's $10 billion investment in 2019. (not investment advice)</p>
