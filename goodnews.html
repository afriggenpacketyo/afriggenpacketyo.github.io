          <p>The Fletcher Street Urban Riding Club, a non-profit in Philadelphia, is providing local children with free opportunities to learn horseback riding and care. Founded in 2004 by 86-year-old Ellis Ferrell Jr., the club aims to teach valuable life lessons, build confidence, and help youth overcome personal challenges and fears. Participants describe the experience as therapeutic and transformative, with many alumni going on to successful careers, including one who will be the first in the club to attend college. As the neighborhood gentrifies, the club faces an uncertain future but remains committed to its mission of serving the community's next generation.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Propelled by the surging demand for generative artificial intelligence hardware, chipmaker Nvidia saw its market capitalization surpass the $4 trillion threshold for the first time. This milestone makes it the most valuable publicly traded company in the world, eclipsing giants like Microsoft and Apple. The company's value has grown exponentially, reflecting its dominant position in producing the graphics processing units (GPUs) essential for powering large language models. This achievement comes despite ongoing geopolitical tensions and U.S. export restrictions that have impacted sales to the significant Chinese market. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>The first 24 hours of Amazon's Prime Day event generated a record-breaking $7.9 billion in U.S. online sales, a 9.9% increase from the previous year, according to Adobe Analytics. This figure marks the single largest e-commerce day of the year so far, surpassing even last year's Thanksgiving holiday sales. The major sales event has prompted competing promotions from other large retailers like Walmart and Target, contributing to the overall spending surge. The strong performance comes amid consumer uncertainty surrounding President Trump's tariff policies, which some retailers feared could impact prices and demand. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>Police in Scotland have confirmed they are making preparations for a potential visit by U.S. President Donald Trump to his golf resort in Aberdeenshire later this month. The visit is expected to be for the opening of a new course at the resort, and it is understood that no private meeting with King Charles is planned. This would be Trump's first visit to Scotland since his 2018 presidential trip, which was met with major protests and required a significant security operation. The Scottish government stated it is coordinating with UK authorities to support the police preparations for the high-profile visit.</p>

Freddie, a rescue dog, is part of a team of beagles used in airports to detect illicit food items that could pose a threat to U.S. agriculture.</p>

          <p>Initial analysis of the first-ever samples returned from the far side of the moon reveals new insights into its geological history. According to Chinese scientists studying the materials from the Chang'e-6 mission, the rocks suggest a massive asteroid impact over four billion years ago fundamentally altered the lunar mantle deep below the surface. The collision created the vast South Pole-Aitken basin and resulted in volcanic rock that is chemically different from any samples previously collected from the moon's near side. These findings, published in the journal Nature, provide a unique window into the moon's violent past.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>New research from the University of Essex suggests that specific types of verbal instructions can provide an immediate boost to an athlete's running speed. The study, conducted with young soccer players, found that using external focus cues or simple analogies was significantly more effective than technical instructions. For example, telling a player to "push the ground away" or "accelerate like a Ferrari" resulted in a 3% improvement in sprint times. Researchers concluded that focusing on the environment or an evocative image, rather than on body movements, allows for more natural and powerful performance.</p>
