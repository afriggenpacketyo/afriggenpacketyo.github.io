          <p>Ric Edelman, founder of Edelman Financial Engines, argues that the U.S. is failing to adequately educate young people about personal finance. He cautions against get-rich-quick schemes prevalent on new investing websites, which he sees as promoting financial gambling. Edelman stresses the importance of credible financial information sources, noting the risks of relying on platforms like TikTok for financial education. He highlights the lack of mandated personal finance courses in high schools as a significant problem, but also points to the increasing number of states now requiring such courses, offering hope for future generations.</p>
