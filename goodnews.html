          <h2>Allergy Capitals in the US Identified, Along with Tips for Managing Symptoms</h2>
          <div class="timestamp">2025-05-11 05:00:14 EDT</div>
        </div>
        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>The Asthma and Allergy Foundation of America has released its annual report, naming Wichita, Kansas, as the top allergy capital for the third consecutive year. The report considers tree, grass, and weed pollen counts, over-the-counter allergy medicine use, and allergist availability. Dr. Purvi Parikh recommends starting medications early, washing clothes after being outdoors, paying attention to timing by staying indoors during high pollen count times, and seeking care if symptoms persist or worsen. The article notes that allergy symptoms can mimic those of colds and viruses, emphasizing the importance of consulting a doctor for proper diagnosis.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>While overall electric vehicle exports from China to the UK have decreased, exports of plug-in hybrid vehicles have experienced a significant surge. In the first quarter of this year, plug-in hybrid exports rose nearly 600%, with March alone showing an increase of 1,849% year-on-year. The UK has become a key destination for Chinese EVs, second only to the EU, due to a standard 10% import tariff, unlike the higher tariffs imposed by the EU. One Londoner cited affordability as the reason for choosing a Chinese MG electric vehicle over a Tesla.</p>

          <h2>A Psychiatrist Argues for Cutting Mothers Some Slack</h2>
          <div class="timestamp">2025-05-11 04:17:55 EDT</div>
        </div>
        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>In this New York Times article, Mathilde Ross, a psychiatrist, argues against the pressure on mothers to be perfect, highlighting that flaws are essential for children to learn acceptance. She suggests that mothers often receive messages implying they are not doing enough, partly stemming from historical biases within psychiatry that unfairly blamed mothers for their children's problems. Ross encourages mothers to admit imperfections and offers a quiz to demonstrate that being imperfect is normal and acceptable. Ultimately, she advocates for giving mothers slack and recognizing that being "good enough" is indeed enough.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>The average 30-year mortgage rate in the United States remains steady at 6.76%, close to its highest levels this year, influenced by factors such as global demand for Treasury bonds and Federal Reserve policy decisions. Rates for 15-year fixed-rate mortgages decreased slightly to 5.89%. Recent fluctuations in mortgage rates mirror the volatility in the 10-year Treasury yield, which lenders use to price mortgage loans. Elevated mortgage rates and rising home prices continue to pose affordability challenges for potential homebuyers, contributing to a sluggish spring home-buying season as sales of previously occupied homes decline.</p>

          <h2>Chinese Energy Investments in Africa Increasingly Focused on Renewables</h2>
          <div class="timestamp">2025-05-11 02:00:21 EDT</div>
        </div>
        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Chinese energy investments in Africa are increasingly directed towards renewable projects, with solar and wind power now accounting for 59% of its energy projects on the continent. From 2010 to 2024, China's energy sector investment and construction activity in Africa totaled US$66 billion, with the continent becoming a key market for Chinese solar and wind technology. This shift aligns with global trends as China moves away from funding new coal-fired power plants overseas. Africa's rising energy demand and China's dominance in solar panel production are expected to continue driving this trend.</p>
