          <h2>Chinese Farmer Realizes Childhood Dream by Building Homemade Submarine</h2>
          <div class="timestamp">2025-07-18 00:00:11 EDT</div>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>A farmer in China's Anhui province has captured local attention by inventing and building his own seven-meter submarine. Inspired by a television program, the man, who had a lifelong fascination with invention, secretly constructed the vessel using 5,000 yuan (US$700) for steel plates, a battery, and an engine. This project fulfilled a long-held dream of creating machines that were previously beyond his reach in his rural village. The submarine now successfully navigates the local river, a testament to his ingenuity and determination.</p>

          <h2>Japan's Core Inflation Eases in June Amid Declining Rice Prices</h2>
          <div class="timestamp">2025-07-17 23:13:45 EDT</div>
        </div>
        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Japan's core inflation rate, which excludes fresh food, slowed to 3.3% in June, down from a 29-month high, aligning with economists' expectations. The moderation was largely driven by an easing in rice prices after the government released stockpiles, though inflation has remained above the Bank of Japan's 2% target for 39 consecutive months. Despite the cooling headline number, economists note that underlying inflationary pressures persist, and the economic outlook is complicated by potential U.S. tariffs and political uncertainty ahead of an upcoming election.

          <h2>German Chancellor Acknowledges Europe's Past 'Free-Riding' on U.S. Defense</h2>
          <div class="timestamp">2025-07-17 22:29:11 EDT</div>
        </div>
        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>German Chancellor Friedrich Merz has conceded that Europe has historically done too little to fund its own security, effectively "free-riding" on U.S. defense commitments. Speaking to the BBC, Merz stated that European nations now understand the need to increase their own contributions and are taking action. This acknowledgment comes as Germany boosts its defense spending in response to the threat from Russia and navigates trade relations with the U.S. under the Trump administration. Merz emphasized a new triangular alliance between Germany, the UK, and France to bolster European security and economic growth.</p>

          <p>During the first round of The Open Championship, professional golfer Jon Rahm audibly scolded a fan after a poor tee shot on the 10th hole. Rahm claimed that someone in the gallery whistled during his backswing, which he called distracting and poorly timed. The two-time major champion appeared visibly frustrated by the incident, though he later downplayed its effect on his swing. He acknowledged that the noise was likely unintentional but used the moment to release tension during a difficult, windy, and rainy part of the course.</p>

          <p>Homeland Security Secretary Kristi Noem has indicated that the Transportation Security Administration (TSA) may soon alter its long-standing rules regarding liquids in carry-on luggage. Speaking at a conference, Noem said she is questioning "everything TSA does" and that the size limits for liquids could be the "next big announcement." This follows the recent policy change that eliminated the need for passengers to remove shoes during security screening. The potential change is linked to the deployment of new CT scanners at airports, which provide more detailed 3-D images of bag contents.</p>

          <p>Members of the U.S. Congress set aside their political differences for the annual Congressional Women's Softball Game, a charity event that raises money for the Young Survival Coalition. Unlike the partisan men's game, the women's event features a single "Team Congress" composed of both Democrats and Republicans playing against a team of journalists. The game was co-founded in 2009 by Democratic Rep. Debbie Wasserman Schultz, a breast cancer survivor herself. The event highlights a rare moment of bipartisanship and has successfully raised nearly $5 million for young adults affected by breast cancer.</p>

          <p>A 16-year-old from Colchester, Essex, has fully immersed himself in the culture and style of the 1940s, an era he fell in love with after learning about the World Wars. The teenager, named Lincoln, dresses exclusively in period clothing, listens to music from the time, and even rides a 1939 bicycle. He works at a 1940s-themed tea room and antiques shop, where his passion and knowledge are adored by customers. He feels it is important to honor the sacrifices of that generation and finds beauty in the elegance and sense of community from the wartime period.</p>

          <p>A precious ice core, potentially over 1.5 million years old, has arrived at the British Antarctic Survey in the UK for analysis. Drilled from deep within the Antarctic ice sheet, this is the oldest ice ever retrieved and contains frozen air bubbles, dust, and ash from an unknown period of Earth's history. Scientists will carefully melt the core to study its composition, hoping to unlock vital information about past climate cycles and tipping points. The research could revolutionize our understanding of climate change, particularly a mysterious shift in glacial cycles that occurred around one million years ago.</p>

          <h2>Stricter Affordability Checks for 'Buy Now, Pay Later' Services to be Implemented in the UK</h2>
          <div class="timestamp">2025-07-17 20:14:16 EDT</div>
        </div>
        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>New UK regulations coming into force next July will require "buy now, pay later" (BNPL) providers like Klarna and Clearpay to conduct stricter affordability checks on shoppers. The move, aimed at protecting consumers from accumulating excessive debt, means some users may be denied this form of credit. The Financial Conduct Authority (FCA) will oversee the currently unregulated sector, ensuring clearer information, faster refunds, and access to the Financial Ombudsman. While providers' profits may decrease, regulators estimate the rules will save consumers £1.8 billion over 10 years by preventing unaffordable borrowing. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>The White House has announced that President Donald Trump, 79, has been diagnosed with chronic venous insufficiency, a common and benign vein condition. The disclosure followed public speculation after photographs showed the president with swollen legs and a bruised hand. A physician's note stated the condition occurs when leg veins struggle to pump blood back to the heart and confirmed there was no evidence of more serious issues like deep vein thrombosis. The White House physician affirmed that the president remains in "excellent health," while attributing his bruised hand to frequent handshaking combined with aspirin use.</p>
