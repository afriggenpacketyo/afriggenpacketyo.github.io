          <p>Huawei Technologies is actively reinforcing its position as a key global provider of AI and 5G infrastructure, especially as the telecoms sector experiences market stagnation. At the Mobile World Congress in Shanghai, Huawei's deputy chairman, Eric Xu Zhijun, outlined strategies for industry growth, including targeting new user groups, enhancing high-definition video supply, enabling intelligent vehicles via 5G, and expanding fiber-to-the-room for small business digitalization. Xu emphasized the importance of collaboration with global carriers to achieve sustainable growth, but he did not address the geopolitical challenges Huawei has faced since U.S. sanctions were imposed in 2019. Despite these challenges, Huawei remains focused on expanding its influence in the global tech market.</p>

          <p>A New Yorker known as "Streeter" has turned reporting idling vehicles into a full-time job, earning over six figures annually. New York City law prohibits trucks and non-city buses from idling for more than three minutes, but enforcement is lax. Under the Citizens Air Complaint Program, individuals can report idling vehicles and receive 25% of the fines, which range from $350 to $600. While some truck drivers view the program as a "bounty hunter" scheme, proponents argue it addresses a significant public health issue by reducing air pollution. George Pakenham, who helped create the law, emphasizes the health benefits of reducing vehicle idling.</p>

          <p>The Los Angeles Zoo has successfully hatched ten condor chicks, contributing to the restoration of California's condor population. These chicks will eventually be released into the wild to increase the genetic diversity of the condor population. The zoo uses a double-brooding method, where two chicks are raised simultaneously by surrogate condors, a technique pioneered by the Los Angeles Zoo. This initiative is part of the California Condor Recovery Program, which has helped increase the condor population from just 22 individuals four decades ago to 561 as of 2024, though the species remains critically endangered.</p>
