          <p>Amazon CEO Andy Jassy is actively working to dismantle bureaucracy within the company, aiming to restore a startup-like culture to accelerate innovation. He announced a "no bureaucracy email alias" which has already led to changes in 455 processes based on employee feedback. This initiative is part of Jassy's broader strategy to cut costs and increase efficiency, including significant layoffs and efforts to boost worker-to-manager ratios since he took over in 2021. The goal is to operate like the "world's largest startup" despite Amazon's massive global presence and diverse business operations.</p>

This election follows a period of political violence, including Hortman's death and another activist's assassination, raising voter concerns about the charged atmosphere.

          <p>Japan's exports saw a smaller-than-expected contraction of 0.1% year-on-year in August, marking the fourth consecutive month of decline but a softer fall than July's 2.6%. This was largely due to a rebound in shipments to Asia and a sharp jump to Western Europe, offsetting a steeper drop in exports to the U.S. Economists had predicted a 1.9% contraction, making the actual figures "less impressive than they look" according to some analysts due to weakening new export orders. The data precedes the Bank of Japan's rate decision and reflects ongoing challenges from U.S. tariffs and political uncertainty. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>A Metro train derailed at the 7th Street/Metro Center Station in downtown Los Angeles, causing significant disruptions to evening commute light rail service. Fortunately, the train remained upright, and no injuries were reported from the incident, which occurred before 3:30 p.m. The derailment led to major delays on the A and E Lines, with service halted or rerouted at several key stations. Authorities have not provided an estimated time for service restoration, as the disabled train needs to be moved before normal operations can resume.</p>

While Shanghai boasts extensive AI infrastructure and government backing, Hong Kong's "one country, two systems" framework offers unique advantages. Its independent judiciary and legal system could reassure international skeptics and foster broader participation, crucial for navigating escalating US-China tech tensions. This strategic choice would position Hong Kong at the heart of China's AI diplomacy, influencing global AI standards and reflecting a nuanced approach to international technological engagement.</p>

The 5,000-square-foot homes, part of a 1998-approved development, faced a moratorium and demolition order in 2003 after developers failed to complete an environmental impact assessment. Subsequent owners attempted to restart construction without permits, leading to criminal charges against Shahram and Ester Ghalili. The owners pleaded guilty and are now required to demolish the structures by August 2026, finally resolving a long-standing community issue.</p>

          <p>New data reveals that one in four driving tests in Great Britain are now conducted in automatic cars, a significant increase from 6.12% a decade ago. This trend is primarily driven by the UK's impending 2030 ban on new petrol and diesel car sales, pushing drivers towards electric vehicles which typically have automatic transmissions. Industry experts note that learning in automatics simplifies the test and aligns with a future electric car market. While a manual license still offers broader driving privileges, the shift reflects changing driver attitudes and the evolving automotive landscape.</p>

          <p>Strong winds across Washington state have stirred up volcanic ash from Mount St. Helens' 1980 eruption, causing hazy conditions and reduced air quality. This phenomenon, known as ash resuspension, occurs when dry, loose ash is lifted into the air by gusty winds, exacerbated by severe drought conditions. Commercial pilots have reported the resuspended ash, which is hazardous to aircraft and human health. Authorities, including the USGS and NWS, have clarified that this is not a new eruption, and the volcano's alert level remains "Normal."</p>

This change has resulted in four clean sheets in five games this season, a stark contrast to the previous season's single clean sheet at the same stage. While their Champions League opener against Villarreal saw only one shot on target, their defensive performance was excellent, with Micky van de Ven particularly effective.

The Cygnus, launched via SpaceX Falcon 9, was originally scheduled for capture Wednesday morning. Flight controllers are now working to resolve the problem and develop an alternative "burn plan," pushing back the arrival date.
