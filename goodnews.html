          <p>Georgia's State Security Service has arrested three Chinese citizens in the capital, Tbilisi, for attempting to illegally purchase two kilograms of uranium for $400,000. The authorities stated that the suspects intended to transport the nuclear material to China via Russia. The operation was reportedly coordinated by other group members from China, with one individual already in Georgia recruiting experts to locate uranium within the country. The security service released video footage of the detention but did not disclose the identities of the suspects or the exact date of the arrests.</p>

          <p>Senior administration officials indicate that President Donald Trump is likely to name the new, privately funded $300 million White House ballroom after himself, with staff already referring to it as "The President Donald J. Trump Ballroom." The 90,000-square-foot addition, which required the demolition of the entire East Wing, has reportedly raised $350 million in donations, $50 million more than its current construction cost. When asked, the president has remained noncommittal about the name publicly but is known for branding his construction projects with his own name.</p>

          <p>A recent Charles Schwab survey found that 45% of investors are interested in alternative investments such as private equity and real estate, reflecting a growing desire to supplement traditional stock and bond portfolios. Financial advisors suggest that exchange-traded funds (ETFs) can offer a more accessible and liquid way for everyday investors to gain exposure to these typically complex assets. While younger investors in particular are showing disillusionment with conventional holdings, experts still recommend limiting alternatives to a small portion of a portfolio, emphasizing that a long-term strategy with traditional assets remains a reliable path to wealth.

Evans' silver medal marks a historic achievement, as she becomes the first Welsh gymnast to win an individual medal at the world championships. Their success came just a day after their male counterparts, Jake Jarman and Luke Whitehouse, secured a one-two finish in the men's floor final.

          <p>President Trump reversed his decision to deploy federal agents to San Francisco following a direct phone call with Mayor Daniel Lurie. The sudden reversal was reportedly influenced by lobbying from prominent tech billionaires, including Jensen Huang of Nvidia and Marc Benioff of Salesforce. While the de-escalation was welcomed, the incident has raised concerns about the president's capricious decision-making process, where a major domestic deployment appears to be based on personal appeals from wealthy friends rather than established policy. The president stated he would give the city a "shot" to handle its issues before reconsidering.</p>

          <h2>New California Law Permits Year-Round Hunting of Invasive Mute Swans</h2>

          <p>California will allow the year-round hunting of non-native mute swans starting January 1, after Governor Gavin Newsom signed a new bill into law. Wildlife officials argue the measure is necessary to protect the state's fragile wetlands, as the large, aggressive birds consume vast amounts of vegetation and displace native waterfowl. The bill, sponsored by the California Waterfowl Association, classifies mute swans as an invasive species alongside starlings and English sparrows. However, the move has been condemned as inhumane by animal advocacy groups who see it as a ploy to expand hunting opportunities.</p>

          <p>Negotiating teams from Afghanistan and Pakistan are set to meet in Istanbul to strengthen a fragile ceasefire along their shared border. The talks follow several weeks of deadly clashes, which began after Afghanistan's Taliban rulers blamed Pakistan for explosions in Kabul and launched cross-border attacks, prompting retaliatory strikes from Islamabad. A second truce, mediated by Qatar and Turkey, is currently holding. The negotiations aim to establish clear mechanisms to maintain peace, with Pakistan focused on addressing terrorism threats it claims emanate from Afghan soil.</p>

The trip includes stops in Malaysia, Japan, and South Korea, where he will attend the APEC summit and hold high-stakes trade talks with Chinese President Xi Jinping. While U.S. officials have stated no meeting with Kim is currently planned, the possibility adds another layer of significance to the visit. Trump and Kim met three times during the president's first term but failed to reach a denuclearization agreement.</p>

          <p>Conservationists are celebrating after trail cameras in Borneo's Tanjung Puting National Park captured the first-ever footage of a female Bornean clouded leopard with two cubs. This documentation is a significant milestone for the threatened species, as these elusive cats have a low reproduction rate and require undisturbed rainforest to thrive. The presence of a breeding female successfully raising two offspring provides crucial evidence that the national park's protection efforts are creating a viable habitat. The discovery offers a hopeful sign for the future of one of the world's rarest felines.</p>

          <p>According to a Goldman Sachs report, major Chinese companies are strategically shifting their export focus away from the United States and toward less-developed markets, particularly in Southeast Asia. Since 2018, Chinese exports to non-U.S. markets have grown at a compound annual rate of 7.5%, while exports to the U.S. have slightly declined. This trend allows Chinese firms to leverage their low-cost advantages while simultaneously moving up the value-added chain with higher-end products. The diversification helps build new supply chains and boosts profit margins in response to ongoing trade tensions with Washington.</p>

          <p>October marks the peak of tarantula mating season in California, a time when male spiders embark on a perilous journey from their burrows in search of a mate. This annual migration, often triggered by the first autumn rains, provides the best opportunity for hikers and nature enthusiasts to spot the large, hairy arachnids. The quest is fraught with danger for the males, as female tarantulas are known to be aggressive and may eat their suitors before or after mating. Despite their intimidating appearance and venomous fangs, local experts say the spiders are not a threat to humans.</p>

The $175 million project, led by an owner of the Palm Springs Surf Club, will feature a 2.2-acre lagoon on a former aerospace campus. This development is part of a growing trend to make surfing more accessible in controlled environments, appealing to both beginners and experienced surfers. The park will join a burgeoning sports and entertainment hub in the area that already includes a Topgolf complex.</p>

The game is also set to be the first El Clásico to feature two English players on opposing sides, with Barcelona's in-form forward Marcus Rashford expected to play.
