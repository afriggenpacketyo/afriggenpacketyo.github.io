          <p>In observance of the UN's International Day of the Girl, a collection of photographs by photojournalist Danielle Villasana celebrates the persistence and spirit of girls and young women around the world. The images, captured over the last decade, depict girls in various challenging circumstances, from migrating across borders to overcoming gender-based violence. The project aims to showcase their resilience and limitless potential, serving as a reminder of the importance of providing support, education, and resources to empower them. Villasana hopes her work sends a message that women and girls, when given the opportunity, are unstoppable.</p>

          <p>As part of a U.S.-proposed ceasefire deal, Hamas is pushing for Israel to release prominent Palestinian prisoners, including Marwan Barghouti and Ahmad Saadat. Israel's initial list of 250 prisoners to be freed excluded these high-profile figures, who are seen by many Palestinians as symbols of resistance. The disagreement could potentially complicate the timeline for the exchange, which involves the release of 20 Israeli hostages from Gaza. The deal represents the first phase of a broader plan to end the two-year war, which also includes the return of deceased hostages' bodies.</p>

          <p>CNBC's Jim Cramer highlighted Agnico Eagle Mines as a favored stock, noting its significant potential for profit as gold prices surge to historic highs above $4,000 an ounce. Cramer pointed out that while holding gold has been a good hedge, owning certain gold mining stocks like Agnico Eagle has yielded much higher returns, with the company's stock up 117% year-to-date. He emphasized that the company is well-positioned with several low-cost mines set to come online, which could lead to substantial earnings as long as gold prices remain elevated.

          <p>Plaid Cymru, a political party in Wales, has announced a plan to offer trainee teachers up to £30,000 in payments to encourage them to remain and work in the country if the party wins the next Senedd election. The proposal aims to address a teacher recruitment crisis by matching financial incentives offered in England, particularly for those in priority subjects like math and science, and those who can teach in the Welsh language. The policy would require recipients to work in Wales for five years after qualifying, with the party estimating the cost at around £6-7 million.</p>

Irenic's move comes as Atkore faces significant challenges, including a sharp decline in revenue and EBITDA after a pandemic-era surge, increased competition, and the recent unexpected retirement of its CEO. The activist firm argues that with the company at a critical inflection point, the board must evaluate whether remaining independent or pursuing a sale to a private equity firm would provide better value for shareholders.

        </div>
        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Regret is an unavoidable emotional consequence of having free will, but it doesn't have to be a purely negative experience. Instead of wallowing in past mistakes with thoughts of "what if," it's possible to use regret as a tool for present-day self-discovery. By allowing oneself to feel the sadness, disappointment, or guilt associated with a past decision, one can gain valuable insights. This process can transform regret from a refusal to accept the past into a learning opportunity that informs future choices and a better understanding of oneself.</p>

          <p>The world is projected to produce a record amount of grain this year, a testament to decades of agricultural progress that has made widespread famines far rarer than in the past. Advances like the Green Revolution, synthetic fertilizers, and improved irrigation have tripled cereal yields since the 1960s, creating a global food system of abundance. However, challenges remain, as billions still cannot afford a healthy diet, and modern famines, like those in Gaza and Sudan, are now primarily caused by political failures and conflict rather than crop failures. Climate change also poses a significant future threat to this progress.</p>
