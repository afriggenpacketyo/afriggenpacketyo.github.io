          <p>The article explores the contentious question of whether the current boom in artificial intelligence investments signifies an economic bubble. While some experts, like former Intel CEO Pat Gelsinger, believe it is a bubble that will last for years due to disruptive technology, others, such as BlackRock CEO Larry Fink, see it as necessary capital expenditure for the U.S. to maintain AI leadership. Concerns are raised about the vast gap between investment levels and credible future profit expectations, particularly with companies like OpenAI.
