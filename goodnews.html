          <div class="timestamp">2025-07-01 14:36:49 EDT</div>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>With average home equity rising, homeowners have a significant financial resource available that can be tapped at lower interest rates than other forms of credit. This article outlines five strategic ways to use $100,000 in home equity, such as consolidating high-interest debt like credit cards to save on interest payments. Other recommended uses include funding strategic home renovations that boost resale value, investing in a diversified portfolio, or financing a small business or educational advancement. While leveraging home equity can be a powerful financial tool, it is a secured debt against one's property, requiring careful consideration of the risks involved. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>The spending package passed by Senate Republicans includes a provision to increase the maximum child tax credit from its current $2,000 to $2,200 per child, starting in 2025. The proposal would also index the credit to inflation in subsequent years. This differs from the House version of the bill, which would raise the credit to $2,500 but only temporarily through 2028. Policy experts note that while this increase would benefit many families, the structure of the credit means that millions of children in the lowest-income families would still be unable to receive the full benefit because it is only partially refundable.

          <p>A new analysis by SmartAsset has ranked U.S. cities to identify the best job markets, considering factors like unemployment, income growth, and work-life balance. Bend, Oregon, claimed the top spot due to its low unemployment rate and a significant 44% growth in median income from 2020 to 2023. The report also highlights cities excelling in specific areas, such as Santa Clara, California, for the highest rate of employer-sponsored health insurance. For work-life balance, cities like Wichita Falls, Texas, offer some of the shortest commutes, while Frisco, Texas, leads in the percentage of remote workers, making it an attractive location.</p>

          <p>A federal judge in Rhode Island has issued a preliminary injunction, blocking the Department of Health and Human Services (HHS) from proceeding with its planned mass layoffs and agency restructuring. The ruling came in response to a lawsuit from 19 Democratic attorneys general, who argued the plan would cause irreversible harm to public health services. The judge found there was "no rational basis" for the reorganization, which would have eliminated some 10,000 jobs and overhauled agencies like the CDC and FDA. This decision puts a halt to a key part of HHS Secretary Robert F. Kennedy Jr.'s agenda to streamline the department.</p>

          <p>The stock market experienced a significant rotation on Tuesday, with many of the year's top-performing momentum stocks selling off while undervalued and lagging names saw a notable rise. Major industrial winners like GE Vernova declined, whereas out-of-favor stocks such as Honeywell and DuPont gained. This shift also affected sectors, with technology and communication services underperforming while some health-care stocks bounced back. It remains uncertain whether this rotation signals a lasting change in market leadership or is merely a temporary fluctuation, but it serves as a reminder of the importance of diversification and not abandoning undervalued assets.

The band, known for its DIY work ethic and energetic sound, rallied around Cisneros, continuing to write music and support her through her recovery.

The proposal, which varies slightly between the House and Senate versions, would allow workers like waiters and bartenders to deduct up to a certain amount of their tip income. While the White House promotes this as a benefit for the working class, critics argue it will not help the lowest-wage workers, many of whom already have no federal income tax liability. The tax break would be temporary, extending only through 2028 under the current bill. (not investment advice)</p>

The chain implemented the temporary fee in February when an avian flu outbreak caused a severe spike in egg prices across the nation. The removal of the surcharge reflects the recent normalization of wholesale and retail egg prices, which had reached record highs. This development provides some relief to breakfast lovers at the popular 24-hour diner chain, which serves hundreds of millions of eggs annually and is a cultural fixture in the southeastern U.S.</p>

This article examines the pros and cons of pursuing this option in July 2025 for those with significant debt and demonstrated financial hardship. While it can provide essential relief and financial freedom, the process can take several years and negatively impact one's credit score.

          <p>California has passed a major overhaul of its landmark environmental law, the California Environmental Quality Act (CEQA), in an effort to address the state's severe housing and homelessness crises. Governor Gavin Newsom signed the changes, which will exempt most new housing projects built within existing urban areas from the law's strict and often lengthy review process. Proponents argue the reform is a critical step to remove bureaucratic roadblocks that have long been weaponized to block desperately needed housing. However, some environmental and social justice groups have opposed the changes, fearing they will undermine public participation and environmental protections.</p>

This record heat follows what the Met Office has provisionally declared as the warmest June on record for England. Forecasters expect temperatures to cool down on Wednesday, though amber heat health alerts remain in place for several English regions.
