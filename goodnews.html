          <p>Eutelsat shares experienced a significant surge after the European satellite operator announced a 1.35-billion-euro capital raise, primarily supported by the French state. The company's stock concluded the trading day with a 31% increase. This capital infusion, alongside a debt refinancing plan, is intended to bolster Eutelsat's investment in its Low Earth Orbit capabilities, concentrating on business-to-business and business-to-government operations. The French state is set to become Eutelsat's largest shareholder, holding 29.99% of capital and voting rights, with India's Bharti Space Limited following at 18.7%. </p>

          <p>The House of Commons passed a bill that would allow terminally ill adults in England and Wales to choose to end their lives, following hours of debate and protests outside Parliament. The bill, which passed by 23 votes, will now be reviewed by the House of Lords. The bill stipulates that adults over 18 with less than six months to live can receive assistance to end their lives, subject to a series of safeguarding checks, including approval from two doctors and a panel including a social worker, legal figure, and psychiatrist. Supporters argue for the right to choose, while opponents fear manipulation of vulnerable individuals. </p>

In South Carolina, a beachgoer sustained serious leg injuries from a suspected shark bite and was airlifted to a hospital in Savannah for treatment. Days earlier, in Florida, a 9-year-old girl was bitten on the hand while snorkeling, resulting in severe injuries that required artery grafts, bone reconstruction, and nerve repair; doctors were able to save her hand due to the clean nature of the bite.

          <p>Tesla has secured its first agreement to construct a grid-scale battery power plant in China, a project poised to be the largest of its kind in the country. This initiative aims to support electricity grids by balancing supply and demand, especially crucial with the rise of intermittent energy sources like solar and wind. The project, valued at 4 billion yuan, involves Tesla, the Shanghai local government, and China Kangfu International Leasing. Tesla's Shanghai factory has already produced over 100 Megapacks, each capable of providing up to 1 megawatt of power for four hours, during the first quarter of this year. </p>

          <p>Silver prices are experiencing a surge, prompting investors to consider it as a potentially attractive investment option. The price of silver has risen from $28.92 per ounce to $37.12 per ounce since January, marking a 28% increase. This rise is driven by strong industrial demand, particularly in the production of solar panels. While a diversified portfolio should ideally include a mix of precious metals, silver's lower entry price point and ability to hedge against inflation make it an appealing choice for investors seeking affordable diversification.

Kroger is responding to the shift by simplifying promotions, reducing prices on over 2,000 products, and emphasizing its private label brands.

          <p>In her upcoming memoir, "Far From Home: An Alaskan Senator Faces the Extreme Climate of Washington, D.C.," Senator Lisa Murkowski reflects on her career and the importance of consensus-building in an increasingly partisan political landscape. Murkowski emphasizes the need for elected officials to prioritize the needs of their constituents and to remain independent in their decision-making, citing her 2010 write-in campaign victory as a turning point in her approach to the Senate. She expresses concern over the shrinking number of pro-institution problem solvers in Congress and encourages citizens to get involved in their communities and to elect leaders who are willing to work together to solve problems. The book highlights the challenges and rewards of being a consensus-building senator in a polarized Washington. </p>

          <p>Federal Reserve Governor Christopher Waller suggested the central bank could cut interest rates as early as July, sparking a short-lived rally in stocks. Waller's argument centers around the notion that import taxes will result in a one-time increase in the price level of imported goods and not provide a re-accelerant for inflation. However, the rapid appreciation in energy costs does have the potential to have a more lasting impact on inflation, especially if the U.S. were to become more directly involved in the war between Israel and Iran. The U.S. has stressed the importance of STEM education, coding skills and software programming over the last many years just as AI tools were rendering those degrees rapidly obsolete.

          <p>Darden Restaurants beat Wall Street's earnings and revenue estimates, while the Olive Garden parent predicted solid growth for fiscal 2026. The company reported fiscal fourth-quarter net income of $303.8 million, or $2.58 per share. For the full fiscal 2026, Darden gave a forecast for revenue growth of 7% to 8%. Despite signs of consumers pulling back on spending, Darden Restaurants CEO Rick Cardenas said during a call Friday with analysts that consumers are continuing to spend on casual dining.

          <h2>Labour Party Plans to Shift Council Funding Towards Poorer Areas in England</h2>
          <div class="timestamp">2025-06-20 11:03:07 EDT</div>
        </div>
        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>The Labour Party intends to redistribute government funding to more deprived areas of England by overhauling existing funding rules. The changes aim to address the higher demand for council services and weaker council tax bases in poorer regions. The new system, set to be phased in over three years from 2026, would redirect more central government funding towards authorities with a higher share of properties in lower council tax bands. While ministers argue this will help communities in need, rural councils have raised concerns about potential losses. </p>

          <p>Major adult websites, including Pornhub, YouPorn, and RedTube, have resumed operations in France after a court suspended a decision requiring EU-based pornographic platforms to verify users' ages. The French government had introduced requirements for age verification using methods like credit card details or ID documents to prevent minors from accessing pornography. However, the Paris administrative tribunal suspended the decree while investigating its compatibility with EU legislation. The platforms' owner, Aylo, argues that the age verification requirement poses an unacceptable security risk to users' data. </p>

          <h2>What the Fed's Stress Test Means for Wells Fargo, Goldman, Capital One</h2>
          <div class="timestamp">2025-06-20 10:55:29 EDT</div>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>The Federal Reserve will release its annual stress test results next Friday, a high-stakes assessment for Wall Street's largest banks. Analysts are hopeful that regulators will lower stress capital buffers for many top banks due to less onerous scenarios in this year's test. A solid report card could pave the way for increased share buybacks, higher dividends, more loan growth and new investments for Club holdings Wells Fargo, Goldman Sachs and Capital One. Wells Fargo is expected to be a standout due to improved exposure to commercial real estate. (not investment advice)</p>
