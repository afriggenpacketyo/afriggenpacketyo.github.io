          <h2>Proposed "Safer Beauty Bill Package" Aims to Ban Toxic Chemicals in US Products</h2>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>A new "Safer Beauty Bill Package" has been introduced by Democratic lawmakers to overhaul the outdated federal oversight of personal care and beauty products in the U.S. The article highlights that many products contain toxic ingredients like formaldehyde and lead, linked to serious health issues, with women of color disproportionately affected due to higher product usage. The proposed legislation seeks to ban the most hazardous chemicals, increase ingredient transparency, and fund research for safer alternatives. This package aims to close gaps left by previous acts and align U.S. standards closer to those in the European Union, ensuring consumer safety regardless of location or workplace.</p>

          <p>Manchester United forward Marcus Rashford is in Barcelona to finalize a season-long loan move to the Spanish club, with an option to buy. The 27-year-old, who sought a new challenge after being dropped by United's head coach Ruben Amorim, is expected to complete a medical early this week. This marks Rashford's second consecutive loan spell, following a stint with Aston Villa last season. The article notes that joining Barcelona has been Rashford's preferred option, and he aims to join their pre-season tour, potentially facing former teammate Jesse Lingard.</p>

          <p>The Bombay High Court has acquitted all 12 individuals accused in the 2006 Mumbai train blasts case, quashing an earlier ruling that sentenced five to death and seven to life imprisonment. The two-judge panel concluded that the prosecution "utterly failed to prove the case against the accused," leading to the release of individuals who had spent nearly two decades in prison. This judgment highlights concerns about India's overburdened judiciary and the reliability of witness testimony in complex cases. The article notes that the court found nearly all state witnesses unreliable and crucial evidence immaterial to clearly tie the accused to the attacks.</p>

          <p>This article explains how venture capitalists (VCs) employ the "power law" principle, where a small number of investments generate the vast majority of returns, to guide their decisions. VCs actively seek startups with "outsized-outcome potential" that can become "category-defining companies" like Spotify or Revolut, aiming for massive winners that outweigh all other losses. The piece highlights that founders must effectively pitch how their product can expand over time and demonstrate exceptional ambition and specific skills. This strategy is particularly relevant in Europe, where fundraising lags behind the U.S., emphasizing the need for visionary storytelling. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>U.S. imports of rare-earth permanent magnets from China surged by 660% in June, following a preliminary Sino-U.S. trade deal that eased export controls.

While the import surge is beneficial, addressing the supply chain vulnerability remains a long-term challenge.

          <p>A comprehensive review of the water industry in England and Wales has proposed 88 recommendations, including the abolition of the current regulator Ofwat and the introduction of stronger environmental regulation. The article highlights that these reforms are a response to widespread criticism over leaking pipes and sewage spills, aiming to address years of underinvestment. While acknowledging that higher bills will be necessary to fund the over £100 billion in upgrades, the proposals seek to ensure more consistent future investment and prevent dramatic price spikes. The report draws parallels with the telecoms regulator Ofcom, suggesting a shift towards prioritizing continuous infrastructure development over simply keeping bills low.</p>
