          <p>Homeland Security Secretary Kristi Noem visited Israel to affirm continued U.S. support despite recent policy disagreements between President Trump and Prime Minister Netanyahu regarding Iran, Yemen, and the war in Gaza. Noem met with Netanyahu and Foreign Minister Saar, attending a ceremony commemorating Israeli Embassy aides killed in a Washington shooting, conveying Trump's condolences and solidarity. Israeli leaders highlighted the visit as evidence of strong U.S.-Israel relations, while Noem expressed unwavering support for Netanyahu and his handling of the war. She also met with National Security Minister Ben-Gvir, who thanked her for American support and Trump's plan to displace Gaza residents during rebuilding efforts. Optimism is slightly tempered given the context of ongoing conflict and political disagreements.</p>

          <p>President Trump delayed tariffs on the European Union by over a month, prompting a renewed push for a trade deal between the U.S. and the E.U., with officials from both sides expressing optimism. Despite ongoing discussions, differences in priorities remain, including U.S. demands for changes to European consumption tax systems and digital regulations. The E.U. hopes to reduce tariffs implemented in April and has suggested cutting tariffs on industrial goods to zero, while preparing retaliatory tariffs on American imports. The goal is to reach a solution before July 9, but challenges persist in aligning demands and offers.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Analysts are urging investors to brace for ongoing market turbulence, as President Trump's decision to postpone implementing 50% tariffs on the European Union does not eliminate the possibility of a trade conflict. Despite the delay until July 9, the EU and US still face significant hurdles in reaching a trade agreement, with uncertain political will and differing objectives. Experts suggest the EU is unlikely to succumb to Trump's shock tactics, while the U.S. administration's exact demands remain unclear, making negotiations challenging. Market watchers caution that sectors like tech and industrials could face volatility, as the delay may only be a temporary reprieve before a larger tariff showdown.</p>

The B-24 bomber was shot down off New Guinea, and for decades, the remains of the 11 crew members were considered non-recoverable. Family members, led by Scott Althaus, conducted a years-long investigation to locate the crash site, leading to a recovery mission by Project Recover and the Defense POW/MIA Accounting Agency.

A mainstay of Harlem's Democratic old guard, Rangel was first elected to Congress in 1970, and went on to serve in the House longer than any other New Yorker but one. Rangel was the last surviving member of the venerable group of Harlem elder statesmen known as the Gang of Four. Although he ventured politically beyond Harlem only once, unsuccessfully seeking the Democratic nomination for City Council president in 1969, he won re-election with monster margins in a district where, by 2010, only about one in three residents was Black.</p>

          <h2>King Charles' Visit to Canada Underlines Sovereignty Amid Trump's Remarks</h2>

          <p>King Charles III and Queen Camilla arrived in Canada for a two-day visit, widely seen as a move to bolster the country's sovereignty in the face of threats by President Trump to turn the United States' northern neighbor into the 51st state. Prime Minister Mark Carney, elected on an anti-Trump platform, met the royal couple at the airport in Ottawa. On Tuesday, King Charles will read a speech from the throne to open a new session of Canada's parliament, the first time a monarch has done that since 1977. The speech is expected to robustly defend Canada's sovereignty and to reject claims it should be taken over by the US.</p>

The announcement follows ongoing tensions between the administration and Harvard over academic freedom and federal funding. Harvard is battling the White House in federal court in Boston to secure the reinstatement of grants and contracts that the government has frozen or withdrawn, amounting to more than $3 billion. The message was accompanied by yet another post accusing Harvard of being slow to respond to the administration‚Äôs requests for information on ‚Äúforeign student lists.‚Äù</p>
