          <p>President Trump and California Governor Newsom are in a public dispute over the handling of protests in Los Angeles related to federal immigration enforcement. Trump suggested arresting Newsom, prompting the governor to accuse the president of authoritarianism. Homan clarified his earlier remarks, stating that while no one is above the law, there was no specific discussion about arresting Newsom. The conflict escalated after Trump deployed the National Guard to California, despite Newsom's objections, highlighting the growing tensions between the federal and state governments. The situation underscores the deep divisions over immigration policy and law enforcement strategies. The optimism score is based on the fact that the conflict is between politicians and not about any physical harm to any sentient creature with a nervous system.</p>

          <p>California's Attorney General Rob Bonta announced the state will file a lawsuit against the Trump administration for unlawfully federalizing the state's National Guard. The lawsuit claims the administration bypassed Governor Newsom, infringing on state sovereignty and escalating tensions over immigration protests in Los Angeles. Bonta argues there was no justification for federal intervention, as local law enforcement was managing the situation effectively. Newsom has criticized the president's actions as illegal and immoral, further intensifying the conflict between the state and federal government. The legal challenge underscores the ongoing battle over immigration enforcement and states' rights.</p>

          <p>UN Secretary-General Antonio Guterres cautioned against the perils facing the world's oceans, including mining, plastic waste, and rising sea temperatures, at the UN Ocean Conference in Nice, France. He emphasized the need for countries to ratify the High Seas Treaty, which would allow for the establishment of protected marine areas in international waters. French President Macron announced that 50 countries had ratified the treaty, with 15 more promising to do so, but criticized the US's absence from the conference and its stance on deep-sea mining. Guterres warned against letting the ocean floor become a "wild west" and called for a moratorium on deep-sea mining, highlighting the need for investment in ocean health.

        </div>
        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>A New York judge dismissed Justin Baldoni's $400 million defamation lawsuit against Blake Lively, his former co-star in "It Ends With Us." Lively had previously sued Baldoni, alleging sexual harassment on set and retaliation for reporting the complaints. Baldoni's lawsuit claimed Lively and others aimed to ruin his career by promoting a false narrative of sexual assault and interfering with contracts. The judge ruled that Baldoni failed to prove extortion or defamation, citing Lively's statements as privileged under legal proceedings and the New York Times did not act with actual malice. Lively's lawyers celebrated the decision as a complete victory, while Baldoni has been given until June 23 to amend and refile his allegations related to interference with contracts.</p>

          <p>Warner Bros. Discovery is splitting into two companies, raising questions about the future of TNT Sports. The split will separate Warner Bros.
