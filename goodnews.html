          <p>Newark Liberty International Airport experienced another brief air traffic control outage, lasting approximately 90 seconds, due to a telecommunications issue impacting communications and radar display at the Philadelphia TRACON Area C facility. This incident occurred less than 24 hours after Transportation Secretary Sean Duffy announced plans to overhaul the U.S. air traffic control system, which has been plagued by outdated equipment. United Airlines CEO Scott Kirby stated that Newark airport cannot handle the current flight schedule due to FAA staffing issues, leading to further flight reductions. The FAA maintains that Newark airspace remains safe, but the repeated outages have caused significant disruptions for travelers.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Real estate analysts are observing a 'striking' trend of lower turnover among apartment renters, with some of the largest landlords reporting turnover rates as low as 30% compared to the typical 50%. This phenomenon is attributed to an unaffordable for-sale market, limited rental supply on the coasts, economic anxieties, moving costs, and a shift towards suburban apartments. The reduced turnover allows landlords to secure better pricing on renewals and improves cash flow due to lower turnover costs. The article suggests that the rebounds of San Francisco and Seattle, driven by AI and tech companies, are also influencing this trend.</p>

While open to the idea, he suggested Republicans should "probably" oppose it, reflecting the complexities of tax policy and political strategy.

          <p>A Soviet-era spacecraft, Kosmos 482, launched in 1972, is predicted to plunge back to Earth, posing a small risk of impact.
