        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>President Trump signed an order to enact parts of a trade agreement between the UK and the US, reducing tariffs on UK cars exported to the US. The agreement, reached last month, aims to protect British businesses from the impact of Trump's tariffs, although a 10% levy remains on most UK goods, including cars, and does not eliminate charges on steel imports. The UK has been granted a tariff-free quota of 1.4 billion liters of US ethanol, potentially impacting UK bioethanol producers, and the UK will scrap a 20% tariff on US beef imports, raising the quota to 13,000 tonnes, while maintaining food safety standards. This move is seen as a sign of strength between the two nations and a reassurance to the UK car manufacturing sector.</p>

          <p>A 10-year-old boy was rescued after drifting at sea for five hours on a paddleboard when typhoon Wutip struck Hainan province in southern China. The boy had been playing with friends when he became stranded and drifted away from the shore due to the typhoon's strong winds and currents. Emergency services were alerted, and a search and rescue operation was launched, eventually locating the boy and bringing him safely back to shore. The incident serves as a reminder of the dangers of engaging in water activities during severe weather conditions.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>The US Supreme Court rejected an attempt to revive a copyright trial concerning Ed Sheeran's hit song "Thinking Out Loud," bringing an end to a decade-long legal battle. Structured Asset Sales (SAS) claimed Sheeran's song copied Marvin Gaye's "Let's Get It On," in which it holds a copyright interest, but the court sided with earlier rulings in Sheeran's favor. Amy Wadge, who co-wrote "Thinking Out Loud" with Sheeran, expressed immense relief, stating that the copyright trials had been a constant source of stress. The case centered on similarities in chord patterns, but the court agreed the progression was too commonplace to be legally protected.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>President Donald Trump's actions in the Middle East, particularly his approach to the Iran-Israel conflict, have dominated international events, showcasing what some analysts describe as "masterful ambiguity." According to analysts in Israel, Trump gave Prime Minister Netanyahu tacit approval to strike Iran after Iran failed to negotiate over its nuclear weapons program within a 60-day window. Trump has maintained a strategic ambiguity regarding his role, offering to mediate peace while warning enemies against harming Americans. This approach is compared to the "masterful inactivity" of Sir John Lawrence, a British governor general and Viceroy of India.</p>

          <p>Medicaid's popularity is increasing, with 83% of the public holding favorable views, even as Republicans aim to cut its funding by $800 billion. A KFF poll indicates that support for Medicaid has risen, particularly among Republicans, even as many hear about potential cuts in the news. The proposed cuts are part of the "One Big Beautiful Bill Act," which is less popular than Medicaid, with two in three Americans holding unfavorable views. The bill's potential impact on hospital funding and the number of uninsured individuals is a significant concern.</p>

The private sector, accounting for a significant portion of China's GDP and employment, faced challenges during strict pandemic restrictions and regulatory crackdowns. Beijing's support for the private sector signals a shift towards internal economic momentum amid intensifying economic rivalry with the United States.</p>
