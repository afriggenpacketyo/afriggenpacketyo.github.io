          <p>The Republican National Committee (RNC) currently possesses nearly five times more cash on hand than the Democratic National Committee (DNC), marking the widest disparity between the two parties since at least July 2020. The RNC reported $72 million on hand at the end of May, while the DNC had only $15 million, raising concerns among some Democrats about the party's direction and fundraising capabilities. Despite the fundraising gap, the DNC highlights a surge in grassroots support, claiming to have raised roughly $40 million in individual donations since February, a record for that period. This financial disparity comes after Elon Musk's significant contributions to Republican campaigns in the 2024 election cycle, although he plans to reduce his political spending in the future.

          <p>Tampa Bay Rays pitcher Hunter Bigge was released from the hospital after undergoing surgery for multiple facial fractures sustained when he was struck by a 105 mph foul ball during a game against the Baltimore Orioles. Bigge even visited the stadium during the Rays' game against the Detroit Tigers, signaling a positive recovery. The incident, described as "terrifying" by players and managers, occurred in the top of the seventh inning when a ball off the bat of Orioles catcher Adley Rutschman hit Bigge in the dugout. Despite the severity of the injury, Bigge remained conscious and gave a thumbs-up to fans before being taken to the hospital.</p>

          <p>Weaver Nut Company, Inc. has issued a recall for multiple batches of chocolate nonpareils sold across the U.S. due to the potential presence of undeclared milk allergens.

The FDA warns that individuals with milk allergies or sensitivities could face serious or life-threatening reactions if they consume the recalled products.

Jobe's goal came 45 minutes into the game, just 15 minutes longer than it took Jude to score on his debut for the same team years earlier. The 19-year-old's goal showcased anticipation, poise, agility, and ruthlessness, mirroring qualities that made Jude a successful player for Dortmund before his move to Real Madrid. Jobe's performance indicates his potential to follow in his brother's footsteps.</p>

          <p>The Senate parliamentarian advised that a Republican proposal to shift some food stamp costs from the federal government to states would violate Senate rules, dealing a blow to Trump's tax and spending cut bill. This loss is expected to impact Republican savings efforts, as they were counting on potential savings from the Supplemental Nutrition Assistance Program (SNAP) to offset tax breaks. The parliamentarian did allow a provision imposing new work requirements for older Americans to receive food stamp aid to stand for now. Senator Amy Klobuchar stated that the ruling prevents Senate Republicans from shifting nutrition assistance costs to states, which would have led to major cuts.</p>
