          <p>Google has appointed Koray Kavukcuoglu, previously Google DeepMind's CTO, as its new chief AI architect, reporting directly to CEO Sundar Pichai. Kavukcuoglu will be responsible for accelerating the integration of Google's AI models into its products, aiming for seamless integration, faster iteration, and greater efficiency. This move comes as Google faces increasing pressure to monetize its AI technology, particularly from the DeepMind unit, amid intense competition from other tech giants like Meta, Microsoft, and OpenAI. Google plans to invest $75 billion in AI infrastructure this year while also cutting costs in other areas, such as offering buyouts to employees in Search and Ads. The company recently unveiled new AI products at its annual I/O conference, including a subscription plan with early access to AI tools and partnerships for its Android XR operating system. </p>

          <p>Harvey Weinstein was found guilty of criminal sexual assault against Miriam Haley in his New York retrial, while the jury acquitted him on a separate count involving Kaja Sokola and remained deadlocked on a rape charge related to Jessica Mann. The split verdict followed days of tense deliberations, with the jury indicating internal discord and apparent threats. Weinstein, who did not testify, has maintained that all encounters were consensual, while prosecutors argued he used his power to sexually abuse young women. The trial involved accusations from Haley, Mann, and Sokola, with the defense portraying the encounters as consensual relationships in exchange for work opportunities, a claim Ms. Haley found insulting. The verdict provides hope to Haley that there is new awareness around sexual violence and that the myth of the perfect victim is fading. The 73-year-old still faces a 16-year sentence for sex crimes in California, meaning he was already expected to spend the rest of his life in prison regardless of the retrial's outcome. </p>

          <p>A recent survey indicates that 45% of American homeowners have regrets about buying their current home, primarily due to unexpected maintenance costs and hidden fees. The survey reveals that homeowners spend an average of over $18,000 annually on non-mortgage home expenses, with costs reaching around $29,000 in states like Hawaii and California. Experts recommend thorough home inspections to identify potential defects and budgeting for ongoing maintenance to avoid costly surprises. The article emphasizes the importance of factoring in all homeownership costs before purchasing a property to avoid financial strain.</p>

          <p>A second-grade class is rallying to support the African Meeting House in Boston after the museum faced significant federal grant cuts of $500,000. The African Meeting House, built in 1806, is the oldest Black church in America and a vital historical site, having served as a gathering place for the 54th Regiment during the Civil War and a platform for leaders like Frederick Douglass. The funding cut jeopardizes staffing positions and programs, but the Advent School's second-grade class, inspired by a field trip to the Meeting House, is raising awareness and funds through letter-writing and advocacy at the State House. The museum has already raised $100,000 in community donations, with the curator expressing gratitude for the students' efforts in preserving the legacy of the space for future generations. The students' activism demonstrates the enduring impact of the Meeting House and the importance of preserving its history.</p>

          <p>Miriam Haley, a victim of Harvey Weinstein, decided to testify again in his New York retrial to stand up for herself and the truth after a previous conviction was overturned. Haley testified about the sexual assault she endured in 2006, recounting the details of the incident in Weinstein's apartment. She spent four days on the stand, facing cross-examination from Weinstein's attorney, Jennifer Bonjean, who questioned her about the events of that night. Haley felt the cross-examination was offensive and disrespectful, but she remained determined to share her story and seek justice. Her testimony contributed to Weinstein being found guilty of sexually assaulting her, although he was acquitted on another charge, providing hope for a new awareness around sexual violence.</p>

          <p>Gold has risen to become the world's second-largest reserve asset, driven by central banks' increasing appetite for the precious metal as a hedge against inflation and to diversify their holdings. Central banks' gold stockpiles are close to levels last seen in the 1960s, with China, India, and Turkey being major buyers. The ECB said survey data had found gold was increasingly attractive to emerging and developing countries that were concerned about sanctions and the potential erosion of the role of major currencies in the international monetary system. However, there are signs that central bank purchases may cool in the months ahead, according to analysts, with the rate of central bank gold purchases falling 33% quarter-on-quarter in the first three months of the year.

          <p>Electric vehicle sales in Europe are experiencing a strong rebound in 2025, with registrations surging by 20% from January to April, driven primarily by corporate sales and EU regulations. While public enthusiasm for EVs remains stagnant, a mandate requiring automakers to cut fleet-wide CO2 emissions has spurred corporate buyers to accelerate fleet electrification. However, challenges remain, including consumer skepticism about EVs, the need for expanded charging infrastructure, and increased competition from Chinese brands. Tesla's sales have plummeted, partly due to backlash against CEO Elon Musk's political involvement, while Chinese automakers are gaining ground thanks to heavy state subsidies, underscoring the fast-changing dynamics of the European auto market.</p>

          <h2>Spending Review Outlines Funding for Schools, Transport, and NHS</h2>

          <p>The UK government's Spending Review outlines departmental budgets for the next three years, with NHS funding increasing by 3% annually and more money allocated for defense and housing. The education sector will see one of the largest funding boosts, with money for schools and training. Transport upgrades will receive increased capital expenditure, including new rail lines and a freeze on bus fares, but these plans are not expected to materialize until the 2030s at the earliest. The review also includes significant investment in social housing and reforms to the probation service, reflecting the severity of the prison capacity crisis.</p>

Huang emphasized that the increasing use of AI on devices will drive more AI usage in data centers, benefiting Nvidia's business model. He stated that supply shortages that plagued the company during the early years of the generative AI boom have been largely addressed. Huang also highlighted Nvidia's diversification of revenue streams with "sovereign AI" projects in Europe and the Middle East, in addition to U.S. cloud computing giants. (not investment advice)</p>

          <h2>Social Security Cost-of-Living Adjustment May Reach 2.5% in 2026</h2>

          <p>Social Security beneficiaries may receive a 2.5% boost to their benefits in 2026, according to new estimates from The Senior Citizens League and Mary Johnson, an independent Social Security and Medicare policy analyst. The COLA for the following year is calculated based on third-quarter inflation data. The COLA may move higher if President Donald Trump's tariff policies prompt inflation and consumer prices to increase, according to Johnson. The official change is typically announced by the Social Security Administration in October, but the new estimate for the Social Security COLA for 2026 is subject to change.
