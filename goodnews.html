          <p>President Trump underwent a "routine yearly checkup" at Walter Reed National Military Medical Center, just six months after his annual physical. His physician, Capt. Sean Barbabella, stated that Trump "successfully completed a scheduled follow-up evaluation," which included advanced imaging and laboratory testing. The memo confirmed "excellent overall health," noting exceptional metabolic, hematologic, and cardiac parameters, and a cardiac age approximately 14 years younger than his chronological age. Trump also received his annual flu and an updated COVID-19 booster vaccinations during the visit. This evaluation followed previous concerns about swollen ankles and a bruised hand, revealing chronic venous insufficiency in his last full exam.</p>

          <p>Senior U.S. officials have provided a detailed timeline of the months-long negotiations that culminated in the Israel-Hamas ceasefire, the initial phase of President Trump's 20-point peace plan. The process began in August 2025 with Hamas accepting a new ceasefire proposal, which evolved through intensive diplomatic efforts involving Qatar, Egypt, Turkey, and key Trump advisors like Jared Kushner and Steve Witkoff. Significant breakthroughs included Israel's apology to Qatar for an airstrike and consensus on releasing 20 Israeli hostages in exchange for Palestinian prisoners. This complex negotiation, often spanning "20 straight hours," was ultimately announced by President Trump, marking a crucial step towards de-escalation in Gaza.</p>

Machado, known as Venezuela's "Iron Lady," has challenged authoritarian leaders for over two decades and has been living in hiding due to threats. She sees the award as a significant recognition for her people's struggle for freedom. The Trump administration has also recently pressured Maduro's regime, deploying warships and conducting military strikes on alleged drug boats. Machado conveyed her gratitude to President Trump, emphasizing her society's commitment to prevailing in their pursuit of liberty.</p>

          <p>California has officially named the giant garter snake as its new state snake, a move hoped to boost conservation efforts for the endangered species. This semi-aquatic serpent, historically thriving in Central Valley wetlands, faces extinction due to droughts and habitat destruction, as agricultural land shifts from rice production to orchards. The species has survived by inhabiting artificial waterways like irrigation canals, but these are also changing. Conservationists, like Michael Starkey of Save the Snakes, hope the increased public profile will inspire action, drawing parallels to Hawaii's Nēnē goose, which rebounded after becoming a state bird. The article questions whether this recognition comes in time to prevent a fate similar to California's extinct grizzly bear.</p>

          <p>Pharmaceutical giant AstraZeneca has struck a deal with the Trump administration to offer discounted prescription drug prices to Medicaid patients, adopting "most-favored-nation" rates. This means prices will not exceed the lowest rates offered in other high-income countries. AstraZeneca will also list primary care medications on the upcoming government website, TrumpRx, and offer discounts of up to 80% for eligible patients with chronic diseases. This agreement follows a similar deal with Pfizer, as the administration pressures drugmakers to lower costs or face tariffs. Experts, however, caution that the impact on Medicaid patients may be limited due to existing protections, and TrumpRx's broader effect on insured individuals remains unclear.

          <p>An Oklahoma City high school girls basketball team, the Academy of Classical Christian Studies, made an unprecedented decision to return its division championship trophy after their coach discovered a scoring error. Coach Brendan King, reviewing game tape, realized his team had actually lost the title game 43-42, despite initially being awarded a 44-43 victory. Despite league rules preventing score changes post-game, the team unanimously agreed to appeal their own win, prioritizing integrity. The league honored their request, and the trophy was awarded to Apache High, whose coach praised the act as a testament to good sportsmanship and human decency.</p>

          <p>Quaker, a 15-year-old military horse from the Household Cavalry Mounted Regiment, has retired to a sanctuary following injuries sustained during a dramatic runaway incident in central London. Quaker was one of five horses spooked by construction work, leading them to bolt through the city, colliding with vehicles and causing injuries. He suffered bleeding and a small bone break, requiring surgery. While four other horses involved in the incident have since returned to duty, Quaker's recovery and long-term welfare dictated his permanent retirement to the Horse Trust sanctuary in Buckinghamshire. His rider, who broke his back, has also recovered and is back to riding.</p>

          <p>China, in a collaborative effort with the United States and Thailand, has announced a record-breaking seizure of nearly 5,000 kilograms (11,000 pounds) of methamphetamine near the disputed Scarborough Shoal in the South China Sea. The joint operation, which took place in February but was only recently disclosed, involved the Chinese anti-drug agency and Coast Guard, acting on intelligence from the US Drug Enforcement Administration and Royal Thai Police. Seven suspects were arrested in what is considered the largest single maritime drug seizure in the Asia-Pacific region in recent years.

The updated documents will also showcase natural landscapes from all four UK nations, including Ben Nevis and the Giant's Causeway. This change aligns with the gradual introduction of the King's insignia on various national items since his ascension in 2022, though passports have been issued in his name since 2023. Existing passports with Queen Elizabeth II's coat of arms will remain valid until expiry. The new passports will also incorporate enhanced anti-forgery security features, ensuring they remain among the world's most secure.</p>

          <p>Apple is in advanced discussions to acquire key talent and technology from computer vision startup Prompt AI, according to CNBC. Prompt AI, an 11-person company, informed employees of the pending transaction, noting that those not joining Apple would receive reduced salaries. The startup, which raised $5 million in seed funding, developed the Seemour app for sophisticated home security camera capabilities, but its business model proved unviable. This "acqui-hire" reflects a trend among tech giants to bolster AI R&D while navigating regulatory concerns. Prompt's technology and talent are expected to integrate into Apple's HomeKit smart home division, potentially enhancing its computer vision capabilities. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>The article delves into the psychological appeal of the hit BBC show "The Traitors," which centers on lying and deception, likening it to aspects of everyday life. Psychologists suggest our fascination stems from the inherent human tendency to deceive from a young age, and the challenge of discerning truth from falsehood. The celebrity edition, featuring figures like Alan Carr and Paloma Faith, adds another layer of intrigue as viewers project pre-existing personas onto the stars. The show is seen as a social experiment, exposing how quickly loyalty can collapse under pressure and how self-interest often surfaces when incentives change, mirroring broader societal dynamics.</p>

He noted the start of Salesforce's annual conference and anticipates clarity on President Trump's new tariffs on China, which previously triggered a stock decline. Cramer offered optimistic predictions for several banks, suggesting strong performance, and pointed to trucking and airline reports as indicators of the economy, especially given the lack of government economic data due to the shutdown.

          <p>This article analyzes President Trump's unconventional role in brokering the initial Israel-Hamas peace deal, leveraging strong ties with Israel and Arab nations. Trump's emissaries, including Jared Kushner and Steve Witkoff, navigated intense negotiations, even addressing Israeli minister Itamar Ben-Gvir's frustrations. The 20-point plan combined a cessation of fighting with a vision for postwar Gaza, including amnesty for some Hamas members and an international stabilization force. Trump's perceived unpredictability and direct pressure on Netanyahu, coupled with an "exhaustion factor" on both sides, are cited as key to achieving this breakthrough, which aims to make Gaza "a functional place" after years of conflict.</p>
