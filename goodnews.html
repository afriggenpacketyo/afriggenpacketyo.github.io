          <p>Former President Trump withdrew Jared Isaacman's nomination to lead NASA, citing a review of prior associations. Isaacman, a private astronaut with ties to Elon Musk's SpaceX, was initially tapped to head the agency. Trump stated he would announce a new nominee aligned with his "America First" agenda for space exploration, particularly focusing on planting the American flag on Mars. Musk expressed his support for Isaacman, describing him as competent and good-hearted, while Isaacman himself had previously voiced his commitment to advancing humanity's spacefaring capabilities under Trump's leadership.</p>

          <p>Following the death of actor George Wendt, an incident from John Boehner's first congressional race in 1990 has resurfaced, linking the Cheers star to Ohio politics. Wendt, during an appearance on The Arsenio Hall Show, mistakenly conflated Boehner with another candidate embroiled in a scandal, making defamatory statements on national television. Boehner's team responded, accusing Wendt of being misinformed, but Boehner ultimately won the election despite the gaffe. Boehner later stated that Wendt apologized for the incident and that they had a great conversation, remembering him fondly as Norm.</p>

          <p>Approximately 14 million bees escaped after a tractor-trailer carrying them overturned in Whatcom County, Washington. Authorities initially reported 250 million bees escaped but corrected the number after consulting with a beekeeper. The public was advised to avoid the area, while beekeepers worked to recover the hives and save as many bees as possible. The road was closed for about 24 hours to allow the bees to re-hive and find their queen bee, and hive boxes from the overturned truck were recovered, restored, and returned to use.</p>

This adaptability reassures swing voters that anything extreme is provisional, as he tests limits but is generally willing to pull back. Trump's recent adjustments on China tariffs, separation from Elon Musk, and complaints about Vladimir Putin have helped his poll numbers recover. This pattern of checking himself and being checked by others is what an important group of voters expect from his presidency.</p>
