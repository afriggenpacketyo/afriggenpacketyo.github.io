          <p>Amazon founder Jeff Bezos plans to sell up to 25 million shares in the company over the next year, valued at approximately $4.8 billion. The sales are part of a trading plan adopted on March 4.

Bezos previously sold about $13.5 billion worth of Amazon shares last year. He is spending more time on Blue Origin and his climate fund since stepping down as CEO.</p>

          <p>Wall Street has recovered from April‚Äôs sharp sell-off, buoyed by hope for trade talks between the U.S. and China. The S&P 500 rose 1.6 percent, erasing losses from the days after President Trump‚Äôs rollout of tariffs. This boost followed a stronger-than-expected report on hiring. China's commerce ministry indicated it was considering holding talks with the Trump administration, but only if Washington cancels its tariffs first. Despite the recent recovery, the S&P 500 remains more than 7 percent below its recent high in mid-February.</p>

          <p>The U.S. government's remedies trial in the Google antitrust case regarding its advertising tech is scheduled to begin on Sept. 22, according to civil hearing minutes. Last month, a judge said Google was liable for 'willfully acquiring and maintaining monopoly power' in online advertising markets. This followed an August ruling that Google has held a monopoly in its core market of internet search. Google is defending itself from antitrust allegations while staying ahead of increasing competition in the generative AI market.</p>

          <p>Jonathan Eig, author of "King: A Life," reflects on the relevance of Martin Luther King Jr.'s "Letter From Birmingham Jail" in the current political climate. He argues that Dr. King's message of love and action is needed to combat cruelty and injustice. Dr. King believed that most government leaders and ordinary Americans would choose mercy over meanness if they saw the meanness for themselves. Eig suggests that Dr. King's letter from the Birmingham jail is a tribute to democracy and a plea for the renewal of the contract that binds us.</p>

          <p>If you are being sued over an old debt, you may be able to solve the issue by offering to settle for less than what's owed. You can negotiate a settlement directly with the creditor or debt collector, working with a debt settlement company, checking for legal defenses or procedural errors, or hiring a debt defense attorney. Creditors and debt collectors are often open to settling for less than the full balance, especially if they think you might not have the means to repay in full or if they want to avoid the cost of litigation.</p>
