        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>A U.S. appeals court has largely upheld a lower court's order restricting indiscriminate immigration raids in the Los Angeles area. The ruling found that federal agents appeared to be targeting individuals based on factors like race and speaking Spanish, which violates constitutional protections against unreasonable seizures. The decision requires officials from ICE and CBP to have reasonable suspicion before detaining someone, and prohibits basing arrests solely on race, language, location, or occupation. This legal battle stems from controversial sweeps by the Trump administration that sparked widespread fear and protests within the region's large Latino community.</p>

          <p>A Fox News producer provides a behind-the-scenes account of the network's seven-year-long documentary series investigating the 1975 disappearance of Teamsters boss Jimmy Hoffa. The article details the extensive efforts led by correspondent Eric Shawn, which involved pursuing leads from Detroit to New Jersey, interviewing key figures, and prompting an FBI dig. The narrative highlights the journalistic persistence in dismantling long-held theories and the emotional weight of the case, culminating in a recent interview with Hoffa's son, James P.

          <p>Activist investment firm Elliott Management has taken a significant stake in Equinix, a major data center operator. The move follows a drop in Equinix's stock price after it announced higher-than-expected capital expenditures and a downgraded forecast for adjusted funds from operations (AFFO). Elliott, known for its expertise in the tech and data center sectors, is expected to push for strategic changes to improve market communication and operational efficiency. The firm sees long-term value in Equinix's expansion plans, which are driven by the growth of AI and hyperscaler demand. (not investment advice)</p>

        </div>
        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>According to travel experts, the primary reason to purchase an early boarding upgrade on a flight is to secure overhead bin space for a carry-on suitcase. With airlines like Southwest now moving towards assigned seating, the value of such upgrades is a common question for travelers. While elite status or premium fare classes often include priority boarding, it can also be bought as an add-on. Experts suggest that for those who don't want to risk having to check their bag at the gate, paying the extra fee can be worthwhile, but it is not essential for all passengers.</p>

The complex surgery involves removing the cancerous bladder and constructing a new one from a segment of the patient's small intestine. Because the new organ is made from the patient's own tissue, it is not rejected by the immune system. Sanders has been open about his recovery, helping to destigmatize the side effects like incontinence and raising awareness for bladder cancer, which will affect an estimated 85,000 people in the U.S. this year.</p>

          <h2>Analysis: Russia Remains Officially Silent on Trump's Nuclear Submarine Deployment</h2>

          <p>Russia's official government channels have remained notably quiet following President Trump's announcement that he ordered nuclear submarines to move closer to Russia in response to social media posts by a former Russian president. Russian news outlets and military commentators have largely dismissed the move as a "temper tantrum" or "meaningless blather," suggesting Moscow does not feel a need to escalate. This muted reaction indicates that Russian authorities may not be taking the threat seriously, viewing it as part of Trump's unpredictable political style rather than a genuine military escalation.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>The American-made animated Netflix film "K-pop Demon Hunters" has become a massive success in South Korea, largely due to its meticulous attention to cultural detail. The movie, which follows a fictional K-pop girl group that fights evil, is being praised by South Korean audiences and critics for its accurate portrayal of local folklore, pop culture references, and even everyday mannerisms. This popularity signals a shift where foreign productions about Korean culture are being embraced locally when they demonstrate a deep and respectful understanding of the subject matter, blurring the lines of what constitutes a "K-wave" export.</p>

          <p>Baristas at four Blue Bottle coffee shops in the San Francisco Bay Area have voted decisively to unionize, joining a growing movement of organized labor in the coffee industry. The workers will join the Blue Bottle Independent Union, which previously organized stores in the Boston area. Key motivations for the union drive include the desire for higher wages to cope with the high cost of living, improved benefits, and the return of perks lost after Nestlé acquired the company. This victory represents another significant step for barista-led organizing efforts across the United States.</p>

          <p>A growing trend is seeing young professionals who work in Hong Kong choose to live across the border in the mainland city of Shenzhen to save on living expenses. These cross-border commuters endure long daily journeys, often over 90 minutes each way, in exchange for more affordable and spacious housing than what is available in Hong Kong. The phenomenon, widely discussed on Chinese social media, highlights the significant cost-of-living disparity between the two major cities. For many, the trade-off of a lengthy commute is a practical solution to the financial pressures of living in one of the world's most expensive cities.</p>

          <p>As part of its global strategy to enhance food security, China is investing $350 million in Angola's agricultural sector through two state-owned firms. The deals involve developing tens of thousands of hectares of land for large-scale grain production, primarily corn and soybeans. A significant portion of the output, around 60 percent from one project, is slated for direct shipment to China. This investment reflects Beijing's broader push to secure food supplies by cultivating land abroad, particularly in African nations, to meet its domestic demand.</p>
