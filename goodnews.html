          <h2>Age Discrimination Concerns Rise for Chinese Tech Workers Over 35</h2>
          <div class="timestamp">2025-05-03 21:00:19 EDT</div>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>A growing number of tech workers in China are expressing concerns about age discrimination, particularly the 'curse of 35,' where employees over that age are at risk of layoffs. This trend has gained traction on social media and is reflected in online job listings, including civil service positions, that explicitly state age limits of 35 or younger. The phenomenon highlights a tightening job market and the perception that older workers are less valuable in the rapidly evolving tech industry. The reasons behind this perception and the sectors most affected remain a topic of discussion.</p>

Despite the weather, attendees embraced the tradition of wearing hats, adding a touch of sartorial splendor to the event.

          <p>As Democrats seek to regain political ground, some in California are suggesting mandatory retirement ages for elected officials. The debate, spurred by concerns over leaders remaining in power past their prime, has been initiated by San Francisco Democrats. The resolution, to be considered by the statewide party, acknowledges the contributions of experienced leaders like Dianne Feinstein and Nancy Pelosi, but also raises concerns about age-related decline and its impact on decision-making. Eric Kingsbury, a San Francisco Democrat, cited President Biden's age as a catalyst for the proposal, aiming to encourage younger candidates and ensure effective leadership. The proposal faces opposition, with some arguing it's ageist and discriminatory, while others point to the need for fresh perspectives in politics.</p>

He contrasts this secretive process with the more open methods used by UK political parties, arguing that the ancient ritual in the Sistine Chapel is a more effective way of finding the right leader. While acknowledging the exclusion of women as strange, Harris emphasizes the importance of female voices within the process, as depicted in his novel.</p>

          <p>Mexican President Claudia Sheinbaum stated that she rejected an offer from U.S. President Donald Trump to send American troops into Mexico to combat drug trafficking. Sheinbaum affirmed her commitment to protecting Mexico's sovereignty and emphasized the importance of collaboration within each country's respective territory. This response followed reports of a tense phone call in which Trump reportedly pressured her to accept a greater role for the U.S. military in addressing drug cartels. The decision highlights the delicate balance Sheinbaum is trying to achieve with the U.S. while maintaining her country's independence.</p>
