          <p>Friday's newspaper front pages are dominated by two main stories. Several papers feature the man charged in connection with the Liverpool victory parade incident, with titles like 'Face of Liverpool horror'. The Guardian also highlights Britain's potential ¬£1.6 billion trade agreement with Gulf states, noting concerns from rights groups about human rights and environmental provisions. Other papers cover Attorney General Lord Hermer's comparison of politicians' threats to abandon international law to 1930s Nazi Germany, as well as Kemi Badenoch's criticism of Nigel Farage and Keir Starmer's welfare policies. The Daily Express reports on a new blood test for cancer being rolled out by the NHS.</p>

          <p>The Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) has formally dropped its lawsuit against Binance and founder Changpeng Zhao, signaling a potential shift in regulatory approach. This move comes as the Trump administration aims to demonstrate its support for the cryptocurrency industry. The Justice Department has also reportedly shut down its crypto enforcement team, and the Commodity Futures Trading Commission is expected to be led by a venture capitalist with ties to crypto. Binance is also deepening its footprint in Pakistan, where WLF co-founder Zack Witkoff, the son of U.S. Middle East envoy Steve Witkoff, recently struck a deal with the government.</p>

          <p>After a challenging spring marked by toxic algae blooms that sickened sea lions and posed risks to beachgoers, experts are reporting that the worst of the poisoning is over. The Marine Mammal Care Center in San Pedro has not seen any new patients with domoic acid poisoning or signs of Pseudo-nitzschia algae. This year's bloom was the longest, most toxic, and deadliest the center has experienced, treating over 400 marine animals.

          <p>Director Ryan Coogler attended a special screening of his film 'Sinners' in Clarksdale, Mississippi, the town where the movie is set. The screening was made possible by a community petition, as the town lacks a movie theater. Coogler, along with composer Ludwig G√∂ransson and actor Miles Caton, engaged with the expressive crowd, which responded enthusiastically to the film. The film is set in 1930s Clarksdale and is about two brothers coming home to Mississippi to launch a juke joint, while also being a supernatural vampire flick that blends elements of drama, action and music.</p>
