          <p>The Food and Drug Administration has revised its guidance for the next round of COVID-19 vaccines, restricting their availability to specific high-risk groups. Unlike previous rollouts where vaccines were accessible to anyone aged six months and older, the updated shots will now be limited to individuals aged 65 or older and those with underlying health conditions that put them at risk for serious complications. This policy shift marks a significant change in the nation's public health strategy for managing the virus, moving from broad availability to a more targeted approach.</p>

          <p>Shares of the buy-now, pay-later company Affirm surged by 10% after it reported fiscal fourth-quarter results that surpassed Wall Street's expectations. The company posted earnings of 20 cents per share on revenue of $876 million, a 33% increase from the previous year, and offered optimistic guidance for the upcoming fiscal year. CEO Max Levchin highlighted strong consumer transaction frequency and overall business momentum, driven by key partnerships with major retailers like Shopify and Amazon, which helped offset the recent loss of Walmart as a client.

          <p>Alibaba's U.S.-listed shares jumped nearly 13% after the company reported better-than-expected net income for its fiscal first quarter, largely driven by accelerated growth in its cloud computing unit. Revenue from the cloud division grew 26% year-over-year, fueled by strong demand for AI-related products, which have seen triple-digit growth for eight consecutive quarters. While the company's overall revenue slightly missed forecasts due to heavy investment in China's competitive e-commerce market, investors responded positively to the robust performance and strategic focus on artificial intelligence.

          <p>A California administrative law judge has ruled that a homeowner whose house was destroyed in a fire can investigate State Farm's claims-handling practices as part of the insurer's rate increase hearing. The decision is a victory for policyholders who have criticized the company's response to recent firestorms, alleging payment delays and underpayments. This ruling allows for scrutiny of the insurer's conduct to be directly linked to its request for an 11% rate hike, a move opposed by consumer advocacy groups. The hearing is now scheduled for December.</p>

          <p>Manchester United has reportedly accepted a bid from Spanish club Real Betis for winger Antony, who is now expected to travel for a medical examination. The 25-year-old Brazilian had a successful loan spell with Betis last season, helping the team secure a European competition spot. His permanent departure marks the end of a disappointing period at Manchester United, where he failed to live up to expectations following his £81.3 million transfer from Ajax in 2022. The move is part of a broader squad overhaul at the English club.</p>

          <p>Seattle police have arrested a 29-year-old man in connection with the June home invasion and robbery at the residence of rapper Macklemore. The suspect was apprehended after an investigation into several high-profile burglaries targeting celebrities led law enforcement to a south Seattle jewelry store where stolen items were discovered. During the robbery, two men entered the home through an unlocked door and used bear spray on the rapper's nanny before stealing thousands of dollars worth of personal items. The suspect is expected to face criminal charges soon.</p>

          <p>A Texas man, Al DiStefano, has been reunited with his Fordham University class ring 56 years after he lost it in the water off a dock on Long Island in 1969. The ring was discovered this summer by an electrician using a metal detector on a nearby beach. After finding the ring, the man located a 1969 Fordham graduate online, who then used a class Facebook page to track down DiStefano in Texas. DiStefano called the return of his long-lost ring, engraved with his name, a "miracle."</p>

          <p>The U.S. stock market finished August on a high note, with the S&P 500 gaining approximately 2% to mark its fourth consecutive month of advances. However, the final week of the month saw a slight retreat, ending a four-week winning streak, as investors took profits ahead of the Labor Day weekend. Key market events during the month included a closely watched earnings report from Nvidia, which initially caused some stock volatility, and the release of the Federal Reserve's preferred inflation gauge, which showed persistent price pressures.

          <p>Paleontologists have identified a new species of dinosaur, Spicomellus, which is now the oldest known ankylosaur, having lived 165 million years ago. Fossils discovered in Morocco reveal that this herbivorous dinosaur had a unique and elaborate defense system, with long bony spikes fused directly onto its rib bones—a feature never before seen in any vertebrate, living or extinct. Researchers have described the creature as one of the "strangest" dinosaurs ever found, suggesting it resembled a "punk rocker." The discovery is prompting a reassessment of the evolutionary history of these tank-like dinosaurs.</p>

          <p>Patrick Braxton, the first Black mayor of Newbern, Alabama, won reelection in a landslide, securing a decisive victory four years after the town's previous white leadership allegedly locked him out of the town hall and prevented him from serving. The election was the town's first in at least six decades, held as part of a federal settlement after Black residents sued over the town's practice of "hand-me-down governance." Braxton's win is seen as a major turning point for the small town, restoring democratic processes and ensuring representation for its majority-Black population.</p>
