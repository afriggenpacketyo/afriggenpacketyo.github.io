          <p>Shohei Ohtani, the Los Angeles Dodgers' two-way star, continues to make strides in his pitching comeback, striking out six batters in three simulated innings during a recent practice. Ohtani has been sidelined from the mound since undergoing right elbow surgery in September 2023 while playing for the Los Angeles Angels, however his recent practice at Petco Park showcased his command and variety of pitches, with his fastest pitch reaching 96 miles per hour. Dodgers manager Dave Roberts expressed optimism, suggesting there's a possibility Ohtani could return as a pitcher before the All-Star break, with pitching coach Mark Prior praising Ohtani's control and ability to execute any pitch he desired. This progress marks a significant step towards Ohtani's return to the mound, a highly anticipated event for Dodgers fans and baseball enthusiasts alike. </p>

The country, along with other European nations, is investing in infrastructure to facilitate increased imports of liquefied natural gas (LNG).
