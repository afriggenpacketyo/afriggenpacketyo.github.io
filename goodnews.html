        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>According to an expert from the World Gold Council, cryptocurrencies like Bitcoin do not pose a threat to gold's role as a safe-haven investment. The expert noted that cryptocurrencies tend to move with equities, unlike gold, which acts as a hedge during market volatility. The expert added that long-term demand for gold is supported by concerns over US dollar assets, trade tensions, and the economic impact of tariffs. The comments were made amidst growing market interest in digital currencies and a rise in gold prices due to Middle East tensions and a weakening US dollar. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>The U.S. 9th Circuit Court of Appeals issued a stay on a lower court's order that would have required President Trump to return control of the California National Guard to Governor Gavin Newsom. The appeals court set a hearing for June 17, meaning the National Guard will remain federalized through the weekend. The initial order stemmed from a lawsuit filed by Newsom challenging Trump's deployment of the National Guard in response to protests over immigration raids in Los Angeles. The Trump administration argued the mobilization was legal under Section 12406 of Title 10 of the U.S. Code on Armed Forces.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>The average age of mothers giving birth in the U.S. has climbed to nearly 30 years old in 2023, according to a new report from the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention. The average age of all mothers increased from 28.7 in 2016 to 29.6 in 2023, while the average age for first-time mothers also rose from 26.6 to 27.5. Experts attribute this shift to changes in social expectations, advancements in fertility technology, and the increasing cost of raising children. The report also noted a continuing decline in teen pregnancies.</p>

          <p>The average age of first-time mothers in the United States has increased to 27.5 years in 2023, reflecting a broader trend of women delaying childbearing. The CDC data indicates a shift in social expectations and values, along with improvements in fertility technology. Economic factors and career aspirations also contribute to the decision to postpone motherhood. A corresponding decline in teen pregnancies suggests increased awareness and responsible decision-making among younger generations.</p>

          <p>A federal appeals court has temporarily blocked a judge's ruling that prevented the Trump administration from deploying the California National Guard in Los Angeles. The Ninth Circuit Court of Appeals granted an administrative stay while it considers the administration's appeal, scheduling a hearing for June 17. The initial ruling had found that California officials were likely to succeed in their challenge to the president's decision to federalize the National Guard in response to protests, arguing that Trump had overstepped his authority. The Justice Department swiftly appealed the order, leading to the appeals court's intervention.</p>
