          <p>This article discusses the potential earnings from opening a $10,000 18-month Certificate of Deposit (CD) in June, considering the current interest rate environment. While interest rates have decreased since 2024, CDs still offer a reliable return compared to variable-rate savings accounts. The article provides examples of potential earnings at different interest rates, emphasizing the importance of shopping around for the best rates and locking them in before further declines (not investment advice).</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Law enforcement agencies across 28 states have arrested hundreds of individuals as part of a national effort to curb rising rates of organized retail theft. The initiative, led by the Cook County regional organized crime taskforce in Illinois, involved over 100 law enforcement agencies and more than 30 major retailers, including Target, Macy‚Äôs, and Walgreens. Organized retail crime involves coordinated theft operations, often reselling stolen goods for profit, and has become increasingly sophisticated in recent years. The crackdown aims to deter such conduct through prosecution and serious enforcement.</p>

          <p>Sean Penn and Dustin Lance Black have condemned the Trump administration's decision to remove Harvey Milk's name from a navy ship, calling it a divisive and petty move. The decision, reportedly timed for Pride month, is part of an effort to reestablish a "warrior culture" within the military. Penn and Black emphasized Milk's significance as a civil rights icon and urged the LGBTQ+ community to remain vigilant and united in the face of such actions, highlighting the ongoing need to protect marginalized communities.</p>
