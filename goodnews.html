          <p>President Trump has announced a major trade deal with Japan, which he stated includes a 15% tariff on Japanese imports and a commitment from Japan to invest $550 billion in the United States. The agreement would also reportedly open Japan's markets to more American products, including vehicles and agricultural goods. As of the announcement, the Japanese government had not publicly confirmed the details of the deal. This development marks a significant step in the administration's ongoing trade negotiations with the key Asian ally.</p>

          <p>Capital One's stock value increased following its latest earnings report, despite complex financial results due to its recent acquisition of Discover. Investors appear optimistic about the long-term strategic benefits of the deal, which positions Capital One as one of only two major U.S. banks with its own payment network. While the integration has incurred significant one-time costs, the company reported improving credit trends in its core business. Management expressed confidence that the acquisition will create substantial long-term value, even with higher-than-expected integration costs. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>President Trump has indicated he is considering the elimination of the federal capital gains tax on profits from the sale of a primary residence. The proposal, introduced by Rep. Marjorie Taylor Greene, would remove a tax that currently applies to gains over $250,000 for single filers and $500,000 for joint filers. Proponents argue the change would unlock housing inventory by encouraging older homeowners to sell, while critics contend it would primarily benefit wealthy individuals. The move would represent a major shift in U.S. housing tax policy for the first time in decades. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>A new student loan repayment option, the "Repayment Assistance Plan" (RAP), has been created as part of a major legislative package signed into law by President Trump. This new income-driven plan, available from July 2026, will calculate payments based on a borrower's adjusted gross income, with monthly bills ranging from 1% to 10% of earnings. It also offers a 30-year path to loan forgiveness and a small monthly bill reduction for borrowers with dependents. As other repayment plans are phased out, RAP may become the primary affordable option for future borrowers. (not investment advice)</p>
