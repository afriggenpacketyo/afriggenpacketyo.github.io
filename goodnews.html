          <p>In a recent interview, supermodel Christie Brinkley candidly discussed her history of four failed marriages, admitting she is a "fool for love" and too trusting. She reflected on the reasons behind each divorce, citing issues such as her ex-husbands' priorities involving alcohol, money, or other women, and her own desire for freedom in her first marriage. Despite the heartbreaks and feeling unloved in those relationships, Brinkley maintains she has made peace with her past and is content with her current life. She remains open to finding a new partner, expressing a desire to share her happiness with someone special.</p>

          <div class="timestamp">2025-07-05 04:00:13 EDT</div>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Chinese state-owned company Sinopec has launched a significant floating solar power station in the coastal waters of Qingdao, marking a breakthrough for the industry. This project, combined with a similar one launched in May, constitutes the largest initiative of its kind by the company and is expected to generate 16.7 million kilowatt-hours of electricity annually. The installation spans approximately 60,000 square meters and leverages the ocean's surface for energy generation. This method reportedly boosts efficiency by 5 to 8 percent due to the natural cooling effect of the water on the solar panels.</p>

          <h2>Japan Secures Comeback Victory Over Wales in Grueling Rugby Test Match</h2>
          <div class="timestamp">2025-07-05 03:19:25 EDT</div>
        </div>
        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Japan's national rugby team achieved a stunning comeback victory against Wales, winning 24-19 in a test match played under extremely hot and humid conditions in Kitakyushu. Despite Wales holding a 19-7 lead at halftime, they struggled to maintain their performance in the second half, ultimately succumbing to a late try by Japan's Halatoa Vailea. The defeat marks Wales' 18th consecutive loss, causing them to fall to an all-time low of 14th in the world rankings. The grueling two-hour match highlighted the impact of the severe weather, which necessitated extended water breaks for player safety.</p>

          <p>England and Wales face a formidable challenge in the Women's Euro 2025, having been drawn into what experts and coaches are calling the tournament's "toughest group." Group D also includes European powerhouses France and the Netherlands, meaning three of the four teams are ranked in the world's top 11. Defending champions England and 2017 winners the Netherlands both bring strong tournament records, while France is on an impressive eight-game winning streak. As debutantes and the lowest-ranked team, Wales enters as the clear underdog, though they aim to leverage this status to their advantage.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>For the first time in over 100 years, Paris has opened designated sections of the Seine River to public swimmers. The initiative, a legacy of the Paris 2024 Olympics, saw the creation of three supervised outdoor pool zones complete with amenities like changing rooms and lifeguards. Swimming in the river was banned in 1923 due to severe pollution, but a massive €1.4 billion cleanup project was undertaken to improve water quality for the Olympic events and for public use. Authorities will continuously monitor water quality and assess swimmers' abilities due to the river's strong currents and depth.</p>

          <p>Scotland's rugby team secured a narrow 29-26 victory against the Maori All Blacks in a thrilling opening match of their summer tour in New Zealand. Both teams scored four tries, but a crucial first-half penalty by Adam Hastings ultimately made the difference for the tourists. Despite being outmatched in possession and territory, Scotland's clinical attack and a formidable defensive effort in the final moments allowed them to clinch the win. The match, played in Whangarei, was Scotland's first tour in New Zealand in 25 years and proved to be a stern test for the largely second-string squad.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Researchers in China have made a significant advance in regenerative medicine by identifying a "genetic switch" that restored damaged ear tissue, including cartilage, in mice. The study, published in the journal *Science*, found that the inability to regenerate was linked to insufficient production of retinoic acid, a vitamin A derivative crucial for cell development. By reactivating this disabled genetic pathway, the scientists successfully triggered complete tissue restoration. The team believes this mechanism may be present in other organs, offering hope that their findings could one day be applied to human organ regeneration.</p>

Despite Estevao's impressive performance, a late own goal by Palmeiras handed the win to the London club.

The injury occurred during a collision at third base, initially sparking fears of a much longer absence. General manager Brandon Gomes stated that because Muncy is expected to return well before the playoffs, the team's trade deadline strategy will not be significantly altered.
