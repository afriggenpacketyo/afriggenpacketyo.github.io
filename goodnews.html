          <p>Supreme Court Justice Amy Coney Barrett stated she is "not afraid" despite facing routine protests and death threats following the overturning of Roe v. Wade. In a recent interview, she explained that she has learned to handle such pressures in a businesslike manner, refusing to let threats influence her emotions or judicial decisions. Barrett, who is promoting her new book, emphasized her commitment to originalism, the judicial philosophy of her mentor Antonin Scalia. She maintains that her legal interpretations are based on the Constitution's original meaning, not political pressure or personal feelings.</p>

          <p>At 70, marine biologist Elvira Alvarado, known as "the mother of Colombian corals," is pioneering efforts to save Colombia's endangered coral reefs. Witnessing over half of the Caribbean's coral die since the 1970s due to climate change and pollution, she now leads a team using in-vitro fertilization. This technique involves collecting coral eggs and sperm to grow new, more resilient coral in nurseries before transplanting them to the reefs. Alvarado's work not only aims to regenerate these vital ecosystems but also inspires a new generation of scientists to continue the fight.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Recent consumer fads like Labubu dolls and Dubai chocolate bars are examined as products of an algorithm-driven culture, lacking the clear sociological origins of past trends like Beanie Babies. Unlike older fads fueled by specific marketing or new commerce platforms, today's trends gain traction through visually stimulating content on platforms like TikTok, which prioritizes engagement over context. This phenomenon can lead to the infantilization of adult consumer tastes, as products designed for maximum stimulation often resemble children's items. However, it also reflects a desire to connect online experiences with tangible, real-world activities.</p>

          <p>Under new leader Zack Polanski, the Green Party of England and Wales is shifting towards a more confrontational, "eco-populist" strategy to capitalize on recent membership growth. Polanski's promise to "pick fights" aims to cut through voter disillusionment and challenge rising right-wing populism, a move inspired in part by the attention-grabbing tactics of Reform UK. While this bolder approach has energized some within the party, there are concerns it could alienate rural voters who were key to their 2024 election successes. The party hopes this new direction will translate its growing momentum into significant electoral power.</p>

          <p>UK Conservative leader Kemi Badenoch has defended her leadership strategy, stating that her deliberate and patient approach to policy-making will "pay off eventually," even if it comes at a short-term cost in opinion polls. Speaking at her party's conference, she contrasted her methods with what she described as rushed announcements from Labour and Reform UK. Acknowledging poor polling and defections to Reform, Badenoch insisted that "winning elections without a plan is what got us into trouble." She emphasized her commitment to "do politics differently" by taking the necessary time to develop sound policies.</p>

          <p>The prominent medical publisher BMJ Group has retracted a March 2024 study that claimed apple cider vinegar could lead to significant weight loss. The retraction was prompted by "concerns raised about the quality of the work," which many nutrition experts had questioned from the outset due to its implausible results. The original study, which received global media attention, suggested participants lost about 9% of their body mass in 12 weeks. This retraction is the latest setback for the popular wellness product, which has long been promoted by celebrities and influencers despite skepticism from the scientific community.</p>

          <p>A pirate flag from the Japanese anime series "One Piece" has emerged as a unifying symbol for Gen Z-led protests across the globe, from Nepal to Morocco. The flag, featuring a skull and crossbones in a straw hat, represents the show's protagonists who fight against an oppressive world government. Young protesters identify with the series' narrative of misfits and rebels challenging corrupt systems, making the symbol a powerful tool for expressing dissent. This adoption of a pop culture icon follows a trend of using familiar symbols, like the Guy Fawkes mask, to create solidarity and quickly convey a message of opposition.</p>

          <p>This opinion article reflects on the introduction of Raquel Reyes, a new Mexican American "Girl of the Year" doll from American Girl, and what it signifies for representation. The author, an educator and author herself, connects Raquel's story of heritage and compassion to the original character Samantha Parkington, who inspired her as a child. While praising the doll's narrative for exploring a blended cultural identity, the author criticizes Mattel for Raquel's physical resemblance to a previous Latina doll, Maritza Ochoa. This lack of diversity in appearance, she argues, misses an opportunity to reflect the true range of Latina identities.</p>

          <p>Nearly four years after its controversial £305m Saudi-led takeover, Newcastle United has undergone a significant transformation, though its path to success has been gradual. The club has modernized its training facilities, won its first major domestic trophy in 70 years, and qualified for the Champions League twice. However, growth has been constrained by the Premier League's Profit and Sustainability Rules, preventing the owners from simply buying their way to the top like previous disruptors. While the club's revenue and staff have grown, the takeover continues to draw criticism from human rights campaigners concerned about sportswashing.</p>

          <p>South Africa secured its second consecutive Rugby Championship title after defeating Argentina in the final round of a tightly contested tournament. The Springboks' victory was notable as it was achieved while coach Rassie Erasmus used 47 different players, successfully building squad depth with emerging young stars. New Zealand finished as runners-up, with coach Scott Robertson also focused on developing new talent ahead of the 2027 World Cup. Australia showed improvement under Joe Schmidt to finish third, while Argentina's disappointing campaign saw them finish last despite a historic home victory over the All Blacks.</p>
