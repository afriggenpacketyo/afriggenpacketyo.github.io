          <p>Ben McDonald, a former MLB pitcher and the first overall pick in the 1989 draft, is recovering from serious injuries after a 25-foot fall from a deer stand. He posted on social media from his hospital bed, revealing he suffered a severe concussion and two cracked vertebrae but remembers nothing of the incident. McDonald, who is now a color commentator for the Baltimore Orioles, expressed gratitude for the support he has received and assured fans he would return to broadcasting soon.</p>

          <p>Belgian champion Tim Wellens achieved his first-ever Tour de France stage win after a successful breakaway on the hilly 15th stage. The UAE Team Emirates rider, typically a support rider for race leader Tadej Pogacar, attacked from a lead group with 44km remaining and held his advantage to the finish in Carcassonne. Pogacar finished safely with the main peloton, maintaining his significant overall lead in the general classification. Wellens described the victory as "very special," marking a major personal milestone in his career.</p>

        </div>
        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>The UK's environment secretary, Steve Reed, has committed to a new target of halving the number of sewage discharges by water companies by the year 2030. This pledge comes in response to public anger over the state of the nation's waterways and follows data showing a 60% rise in serious pollution incidents in 2024. While the government is investing heavily in infrastructure, which will lead to higher consumer bills, critics question the plan's enforceability. Reed stated that the sector's regulator, Ofwat, is "clearly failing" and that changes are necessary.</p>

          <p>US Vice President JD Vance is reportedly planning to spend his family's summer holiday in the Cotswolds region of England, a choice that contrasts with his "hillbilly" persona and past criticisms of European governments. The article notes the irony of the visit, given Vance's previous statements that London was "not English any more" and his sharp rebukes of UK and Scottish policies. His trip follows President Trump's stay in Scotland, where Vance's past comments about the Scottish government's abortion rights policies could lead to a chilly reception.</p>

          <p>The upcoming week on Wall Street will be dominated by second-quarter earnings reports, with a relatively quiet schedule for economic data. Key companies reporting include Danaher, where investors will watch for signs of life in its China business, and Capital One, which may provide updates on its Discover acquisition and a new buyback program. GE Vernova's results will be scrutinized given its recent stock performance and high expectations for orders driven by AI data center demand. Honeywell and Dover are also set to report, with analysts anticipating solid performance from both industrial firms. (not investment advice)</p>

          <h2>Former Obama Speechwriter Advocates for Finding "Neutral Ground" in a Divided Nation</h2>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>In a commentary piece, former Obama speechwriter David Litt suggests that in a deeply divided America, seeking "common ground" is often futile. Instead, he advocates for finding "neutral ground"—shared activities or spaces where people with opposing views can interact without focusing on their differences. Drawing from his experience surfing with his politically different brother-in-law, Litt argues that these neutral interactions can foster friendship and lead to more genuine discussions. This approach, he believes, is a more practical way to bridge divides than trying to force agreement on contentious issues.</p>

          <p>According to multiple sources, the most probable opportunity for a meeting between Chinese President Xi Jinping and US President Donald Trump this year is during the APEC summit in South Korea. The meeting could potentially take place in China just before the summit or on its sidelines. This speculation follows recent high-level talks between the two countries' top diplomats, where both sides expressed a strong desire for a presidential meeting. Relations have been working to stabilize after President Trump threatened significant tariffs on Chinese goods earlier in his term.</p>

          <p>An excerpt from Olga Khazan's book, "Me, But Better," chronicles her journey to become more extroverted by enrolling in an improv comedy class. As a self-described introvert who disliked improv as an art form, she found the experience to be like "full-immersion insanity." The class involved warm-up games like "Zip Zap Zop" and juggling invisible items, which felt both ridiculous and rehabilitating for a perfectionist. The experience forced her out of her comfort zone, representing a deliberate effort to change a core personality trait she was unhappy with.</p>

          <p>The small desert community of Newberry Springs, California, a near-ghost town on the historic Route 66, is preparing for a potential comeback as the famous highway's 100th anniversary approaches in 2026. Local residents and business owners are hoping the centennial will bring a flood of tourists and are planning events and improvements to capitalize on the milestone. Once a bustling stop, the town declined after being bypassed by Interstate 40 in the 1970s. Now, its "frozen in time" appeal is seen as a key asset for attracting a new generation of road-trippers.</p>

          <p>This commentary argues that traditional US labor market metrics, like the monthly jobs report, are becoming obsolete in an economy defined by side gigs, remote work, and the "over-employed." The author suggests that conflicting data from the Department of Labor and private payroll companies show we don't have a clear picture of how many Americans are truly working. Instead of counting jobs, the article proposes measuring the economy's health by tracking the number of people earning above a certain income threshold from all sources, adjusted for inflation, arguing this would be a more relevant indicator.

          <p>A new study analyzing Census Bureau data shows that major U.S. cities, including New York City, Los Angeles, and Washington D.C., are seeing a significant net outflow of residents aged 60 and over. New York City leads the trend, with nearly 24,000 more seniors moving out than moving in during 2023. California was the state with the highest overall net loss of retirees. The high cost of living is cited as a major contributing factor, as most of the cities on the list are in states where over $1 million is considered necessary for a comfortable retirement.
