These influences include fundamental supply and demand, broader economic conditions, inflation rates, and geopolitical events. Central bank policies and currency movements, particularly the strength of the U.S. dollar, also play a significant role in determining its market value. (not investment advice)</p>

The move comes as Oracle experiences significant growth driven by the artificial intelligence boom, which has boosted demand for its cloud infrastructure and access to Nvidia GPUs.

          <p>Researchers in China have developed a new method that shows promise for analyzing old and poorly preserved biological samples, which were previously difficult to study due to chemical damage. The technique has successfully been used on cancer tissues that were stored for nearly a decade under suboptimal conditions. One of the co-corresponding authors noted that while challenging due to historical preservation methods, the technology could potentially be applied to study significant historical samples. This breakthrough could open new avenues for historical and medical research.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>A growing trend, particularly among wealthy clients and celebrities, involves receiving large tattoos while under medical anesthesia to avoid pain. Studios like Sedation Ink in Miami offer procedures where licensed anesthesiologists administer drugs like fentanyl and propofol, allowing artists to complete extensive work in a single session. This practice has created a divide within the tattoo community, with some artists embracing the efficiency and potential for cleaner work. However, traditionalists argue that enduring pain is an integral part of the tattooing experience and that its removal diminishes the art form's cultural significance.</p>

          <p>Pfizer has announced a deal to acquire Metsera, a developer of weight-loss drugs, for an initial $4.9 billion, with the total value potentially reaching $7.3 billion based on future milestones. This move signals Pfizer's aggressive push into the lucrative obesity drug market after its own previous candidates faced setbacks. Metsera's pipeline includes promising oral and injectable treatments, such as a once-monthly GLP-1 drug, which could compete with popular existing medications from Eli Lilly and Novo Nordisk. The acquisition is expected to leverage Pfizer's resources to accelerate development. (not investment advice)</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Despite technological advancements and government authorization for Level 4 autonomous driving, Germany's goal of becoming a leader in the field faces significant challenges. Projects are often limited to small-scale, localized shuttles on preapproved routes, hampered by a strong taxi lobby, extensive public transit, and a cautious approach to mass production. While initiatives like NeMo Paderborn are developing innovative concepts such as energy-efficient "swarms" of autonomous cabs, a nationwide rollout remains distant. Industry groups are calling for more substantial government support to move beyond temporary pilot projects.</p>

          <p>A recent phone call between Presidents Donald Trump and Xi Jinping, described by Chinese state media as "constructive," may signal a new phase in U.S.-China relations characterized by managed rivalry rather than direct escalation. Despite ongoing strategic competition and trade tensions, this diplomatic engagement suggests a pragmatic acceptance of their mutual economic dependence. The relationship is defined by an asymmetric rivalry, with U.S. strength in high-tech sectors and Chinese dominance in key supply chains. This interdependence necessitates a cautious approach, creating a framework for stability where all-out conflict would be mutually destructive.</p>

          <p>A new mutual defense pact between Saudi Arabia and Pakistan is not expected to disrupt Riyadh's significant energy trade with India, according to a source familiar with the matter. India is a key customer for Saudi crude, and the source stated that the kingdom is broadening its security alliances without compromising its commercial relationships. The source also dismissed speculation that Saudi Arabia would move away from pricing its oil in U.S. dollars. This development highlights Riyadh's complex geopolitical balancing act, maintaining security ties with the U.S. and Pakistan while expanding trade with India.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>The multibillion-dollar self-help industry, promising personal growth and optimization, may be contributing to feelings of isolation and inadequacy. Author Jessica Lamb-Shapiro explores this phenomenon, noting that while the appeal of self-improvement is powerful, the focus on individual solutions can be detrimental. The article suggests that by emphasizing "self" help, the culture overlooks the importance of community and interpersonal relationships. Asking others for help can strengthen social bonds, whereas a solitary quest for betterment can leave individuals feeling more alone, even if they achieve their personal goals.</p>

          <p>Senator Ted Cruz is urging President Donald Trump to support international efforts to raise the mandatory retirement age for airline pilots from 65 to 67. As head of the Senate Commerce Committee, Cruz argues that the current policy forces thousands of experienced pilots into early retirement. The issue is set to be discussed at an upcoming United Nations aviation meeting, where an airline trade group will propose the change. However, the move is opposed by the Air Line Pilots Association, which cites health risks and potential cognitive decline in older pilots as safety concerns.</p>
