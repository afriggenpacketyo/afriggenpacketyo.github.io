          <p>Robert F. Kennedy Jr. testified regarding recent changes at the CDC, asserting they were necessary to restore the agency's role as a gold standard in public health, while also facing scrutiny over vaccine recommendations. Kennedy denied allegations from former CDC Director Susan Monarez that he pressured her to approve vaccine recommendations without scientific evidence. He claimed that the CDC's current statistics indicate a concerning rise in chronic diseases among Americans, which he considers a national security issue. Kennedy criticized the CDC's response to the COVID-19 pandemic, and his testimony highlights ongoing debates about public health policy and the role of scientific evidence in decision-making.</p>

          <p>Legendary Italian fashion designer Giorgio Armani has died at the age of 91, according to an announcement from his company, marking the end of an era for the globally recognized brand. Armani founded his namesake luxury fashion house in Milan in 1975 and remained its CEO and sole shareholder until his death. His designs graced runways and Hollywood red carpets, shaping not just fashion but a lifestyle defined by natural sophistication and balance. Armani expressed regret for dedicating too much time to work and not enough to loved ones, and his succession plans involve a gradual transition of responsibilities to his closest team members.</p>

          <p>Keir Starmer, the Prime Minister, has refrained from stating whether he would dismiss Deputy Prime Minister Angela Rayner if she is found to have violated the ministerial code. Rayner is under investigation for underpaying stamp duty on a property, a mistake she attributes to incorrect legal advice. Starmer emphasized the need to establish the facts through an independent advisor's report, which he expects to be comprehensive and quickly delivered. While acknowledging the seriousness of upholding standards, Starmer avoided direct commitment to firing Rayner, while Conservative Party members have called on Rayner to resign.</p>

          <p>Justice Amy Coney Barrett stated that the Supreme Court should not impose its own values on the American people, emphasizing the importance of understanding the law. In an interview, Barrett highlighted that the court's role is to interpret what the American people have decided through the Constitution and statutes, not to impose its own values. Her comments come as the Supreme Court faces a longshot bid to revisit the 2015 ruling that legalized same-sex marriage. Barrett also addressed concerns about the potential overturning of other precedents, following the Supreme Court's decision to overturn Roe v. Wade.</p>

          <p>The number of Americans filing for unemployment benefits experienced a modest increase last week, suggesting that employers are continuing to retain workers despite indications of an economic slowdown. Applications for unemployment benefits rose by 8,000 to 237,000, slightly above economists' expectations, but still within a historically healthy range. While layoffs remain low, hiring has also weakened, leading to a "no hire, no fire" economy, with the unemployment rate remaining at a historically low 4.2%. The government is set to release its August jobs report, with economists anticipating a slim increase in private non-farm jobs.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Coffee prices have surged due to weather volatility affecting major growers like Brazil and Vietnam, with ground roast coffee prices in the U.S. reaching a record high. A severe drought in Brazil and heavy rainstorms in Vietnam have crimped coffee production, leading to reduced crop yields and increased prices. While some analysts expect price pressures to ease in the near term, tariffs on Brazil could put upward pressure on coffee prices. Over the long term, consumers should anticipate higher-than-average prices due to increasing global consumption and more frequent extreme weather events.</p>

An Advocate General recommended that EU law should prevent national legislation that does not allow legal recognition of gender identity, even without gender reassignment surgery. The AG argued that refusing to recognize a person's gender identity infringes on their right to freedom of movement and residency within the EU.

          <p>A former police detective shares six important steps to take in the aftermath of a car accident, drawing from personal experience after being involved in a head-on collision. It's crucial to be mindful of what you say at the scene, as apologizing can be taken as an admission of guilt, and speaking to witnesses is invaluable for understanding what happened and proving liability. Gathering witness details helps process the event and provides essential information for insurers. It is also critical to remember that your words can be used against you and to avoid apologising.</p>

The consensus estimate for Broadcom's quarterly revenue is a 21% increase year-over-year, with earnings per share expected to rise by 33%. Analysts believe Broadcom's networking division should see upside due to AI accelerators and networking chips being sold to hyperscalers for data centers. (not investment advice)</p>
