          <p>In an interview, U.S. Secretary of State Marco Rubio elaborated on the recent diplomatic talks between President Trump and Vladimir Putin regarding the war in Ukraine. Rubio emphasized that while no ceasefire was achieved, the discussions opened potential pathways for progress and that any final peace agreement will require significant concessions from both Russia and Ukraine. He confirmed that concepts like security guarantees for Ukraine are being discussed with European allies, who will meet with President Zelenskyy in Washington, but stressed that the U.S. cannot accept or reject terms on Ukraine's behalf.</p>

Initially thinking she was stung by a jellyfish, she realized the severity of the situation upon seeing the bite on her thigh, screaming for help and fearing for her and her unborn baby's life. Boi, who is expecting her third child, credits another woman on the scene with applying pressure to the wound before help arrived and says she is still traumatized by the event but is expected to make a full recovery.</p>

          <p>Actor Adam Scott discusses his journey from a recognizable character actor to the Emmy-nominated lead of the critically acclaimed series "Severance." Scott reveals his initial terror at headlining such a major show, fearing it would be poorly received, but it became a massive success. He and director Ben Stiller reflect on the technical challenges of playing a character with a surgically divided consciousness, a role Scott felt he had to give his all to after a 30-year career. The article highlights how his previous comedic roles made it difficult to be cast in dramas, a hurdle he overcame for this defining part.</p>

        </div>
        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>A free-kick goal by Crystal Palace's Eberechi Eze against Chelsea was correctly disallowed by VAR due to a specific rule infringement. The decision was made because a Crystal Palace player was positioned less than one meter away from Chelsea's defensive wall at the moment the kick was taken. According to the International Football Association Board's Law 13, which was introduced in 2019, all attacking players must maintain at least a one-meter distance from a defensive wall composed of three or more players. This rule aims to prevent management issues and time-wasting during free-kicks.</p>

          <p>Icelandic singer and cellist Laufey has gained widespread popularity by creating a unique sound that blends pop, jazz, classical, and bossa nova influences. The 26-year-old Grammy winner, whose new album "A Matter of Time" is out this week, attributes her musical style to her childhood, where she was exposed to both classical music and jazz. Initially feeling like an outsider for her old-fashioned tastes, she found a massive following on social media during the pandemic, connecting with a surprisingly young audience that embraces her modern take on traditional genres, which she sees as a bridge to a rich musical past.</p>

          <p>Hurricane Erin, the first of the Atlantic season, has been downgraded to a Category 3 storm after briefly reaching Category 5 intensity, with maximum sustained winds of 125 mph. While the storm is not expected to make landfall on the U.S. mainland, its outer bands are bringing heavy rain and gusty winds to Puerto Rico and the U.S. Virgin Islands, prompting flash flood warnings. Forecasters anticipate Erin will turn north, away from the U.S., but it will still generate dangerous surf and rip currents along much of the East Coast this week.</p>

          <p>Manchester United striker Rasmus Hojlund is expected to be excluded from the squad for the upcoming Premier League game against Arsenal. The decision by coach Ruben Amorim comes amidst intense speculation about the 22-year-old's future with the club. With the recent high-profile signing of Benjamin Sesko, Hojlund's playing opportunities are likely to be significantly reduced. AC Milan is reportedly among the clubs interested in signing the Danish player, though no formal agreement has been reached, fueling rumors of an imminent departure from Old Trafford.</p>

          <p>Ronnie Rondell Jr., the legendary Hollywood stuntman famously set on fire for the cover of Pink Floyd's 'Wish You Were Here' album, has passed away at the age of 88. His extensive career spanned decades and included stunt work on iconic films and TV shows like 'Lethal Weapon,' 'Diamonds are Forever,' and 'Star Trek: First Contact.' The photographer for the album cover recalled the dangerous shoot, where on the 15th take, the wind shifted and burned off Rondell's eyebrow and part of his mustache. Rondell was a co-founder of the company Stunts Unlimited and received a lifetime achievement award in 2004.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Astronomers may have solved the mystery of the 'little red dots' first observed by the James Webb Space Telescope in the early universe. A new study by Harvard astronomers Avi Loeb and Fabio Pacucci suggests these objects are extremely compact galaxies that formed within slow-spinning halos of dark matter. According to their hypothesis, the low rotational velocity of these halos caused the matter to concentrate centrally, explaining their small size. Over cosmic time, these halos would naturally speed up, causing the galaxies to expand, which is why they are only seen in the universe's nascent period.</p>

          <p>A derelict Napoleonic fort on Thorne Island in Pembrokeshire, Wales, has been transformed into a luxury party destination and is now on the market for £3 million. Purchaser Mike Conner bought the abandoned 19th-century fortress in 2017 for £555,000 and undertook a challenging five-year renovation, overcoming logistical hurdles like having no running water or electricity. Now equipped with 40 beds, en-suite bathrooms, and a nightclub, the historic site, originally built to defend against French naval attacks, has been fully modernized while honoring its formidable Victorian construction.</p>

          <p>Los Angeles Sparks forward Cameron Brink has revealed that creating vision boards was a key part of her mental recovery from a torn ACL. During her 13-month rehabilitation, the practice of visualizing her goals—from Olympic rings to simply being a good teammate—helped her maintain a positive outlook and combat the doubts that arose during the long process. Encouraged by veteran teammate Dearica Hamby, Brink used the collages to manifest her desired future and stay focused on incremental progress. This mental rehearsal is credited with helping her make an immediate and meaningful impact upon her return to the court.</p>

          <p>UCLA football coach DeShaun Foster implemented a series of 'brotherhood meetings' during training camp to build chemistry among a team with 55 new players and eight new coaches. In these sessions, coaches and players shared personal stories and vulnerabilities, leading to what Foster described as 'a lot of tears' and a stronger team bond. One notable story came from tight ends coach Jerry Neuheisel, who spoke about the anxiety he felt after a heroic performance as a backup quarterback. The initiative aims to foster a 'we over me' mentality ahead of the 2025 season.</p>
