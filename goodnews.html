        </div>
        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Prime Minister Mark Carney has announced an ambitious goal for Canada to double its non-U.S. exports within the next decade, attributing this strategic shift to American tariffs that are significantly dampening investment and creating economic uncertainty. Carney emphasized that Canada can no longer solely rely on its southern neighbor, as the U.S. has fundamentally altered its trade approach, imposing tariffs at levels last seen during the Great Depression. This move aims to mitigate vulnerabilities in Canadian industries like autos, steel, and lumber, which are under threat. Canada plans to actively re-engage with global economic powers such as India and China, seeking to diversify its trade relationships and ensure long-term national economic stability.</p>

          <p>China's Chang’e-7 mission, hailed as the most complex spacecraft built for its lunar program, is poised to undertake humanity's inaugural water probe near the moon's south pole. This ambitious endeavor will meticulously study the lunar environment and search for vital water ice, a resource indispensable for future crewed space exploration. The discovered water could be transformed into drinking water, breathable oxygen, and even rocket fuel, significantly advancing long-duration missions. Comprising an orbiter, lander, rover, hopper, and a relay satellite, the spacecraft is engineered for extended operations, targeting a landing site with prolonged sunlight exposure.</p>

          <p>An article details the immersive experience of a 24-hour "vibe coding" hackathon in Singapore, sponsored by leading AI entities like OpenAI and Google DeepMind. The event, drawing over 400 participants, underscored how artificial intelligence is significantly lowering the entry barrier for tech development, enabling individuals even without deep technical backgrounds to create functional products. The author, a non-technical participant, successfully contributed to building "Heirloom," a digital time capsule for family narratives. Organizers observed that many hackathon newcomers, some with minimal "vibe coding" experience, achieved high rankings, demonstrating the transformative impact of AI on the builder community and the evolving landscape of software engineering.</p>

          <p>Misty Copeland, the groundbreaking first Black female principal dancer in American Ballet Theatre's 75-year history, has officially retired following a star-studded gala celebrating her illustrious career. The 43-year-old ballerina was widely praised by figures such as Oprah Winfrey for her profound impact in redefining representation and inspiring countless individuals within the overwhelmingly white art form. Her farewell performance featured iconic roles, including Juliet, danced alongside Calvin Royal III, ABT's first Black male principal in two decades. Beyond her stage presence, Copeland has dedicated her time to motherhood, authorship, and actively promoting diversity in the dance world through her foundation, promising to continue her influential work.</p>

          <p>This article delves into the experiences of former Love Island and Big Brother contestants navigating the return to conventional 9-5 jobs after their fleeting moments of reality television fame. Ellie Jackson, a Love Island participant, openly discussed the immense pressure to become a prominent influencer, coupled with subsequent mental health challenges and financial precarity as brand deals diminished. She ultimately found greater fulfillment by returning to her accountancy career, balancing it with social media work. Similarly, Big Brother contestant Jenkin Edwards, who initially struggled with social reintegration, embraced his role as a barman, prioritizing a normal life over the often-unrealistic expectations of influencer stardom.</p>

          <p>As China concludes its fourth plenum and prepares for the unveiling of its next five-year plan, a state media editorial has emphatically praised the nation's socialist system as a foundational source of strength. The article asserts that the scientific and consistent formulation and implementation of five-year plans represent a core political strength of socialism with Chinese characteristics, ensuring the economy's steady navigation through global complexities. It draws a stark contrast between China's unified national strategy and the "short-term policymaking and frequent policy reversals" often seen in multi-party systems, portraying the Communist Party's decisive leadership as paramount for both domestic economic stability and its growing influence on the global stage.</p>

          <p>This article examines China's perspective on the deepening defense collaborations among Asia-Pacific allies, specifically highlighting the inaugural joint bilateral naval exercise between India and South Korea. The Indian naval vessel Sahyadri recently docked at Busan naval port for this exercise, which India's Ministry of Defence described as the "culmination of years of discussions and planning." This enhanced military cooperation is framed within India’s broader operational deployment to the South China Sea and the Indo-Pacific, reflecting a shared concern among these nations regarding a potential security vacuum should the United States scale back its military presence in the region.</p>

          <p>The Westminster Mall in Orange County is preparing for its final closure, with the majority of its shops scheduled to cease operations by October 29 as leases conclude. After serving as a prominent community hub for decades, the 100-acre property is slated for extensive redevelopment into a mixed-use site, which will include 3,000 housing units, 600,000 square feet of upscale retail space, and dedicated park areas. The city council approved this revitalization plan in 2022, aiming to transform the commercial center. While anchor store JCPenney will close by November 21, Best Buy and Target are anticipated to remain open during the multi-year redevelopment project, which seeks to create a new, vibrant activity center.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>South Korea's central bank has maintained its benchmark interest rate at 2.5%, extending a pause initiated in May, largely driven by persistent concerns over household debt and housing market stability. This decision was widely anticipated, coinciding with the implementation of tighter property regulations across Seoul and parts of Gyeonggi Province aimed at restricting borrowing. The Bank of Korea cited stable inflation and an improving economic growth outlook, bolstered by consumption and a robust semiconductor sector, as key factors supporting the rate hold. However, the article highlights ongoing uncertainties stemming from trade negotiations with the U.S. and the potential for expanded U.S. tariffs to negatively impact Korean exports.

Recent significant signings include high-profile properties such as Waldorf Astoria Shenzhen and Conrad Zhoushan. This aggressive growth trajectory, which has seen Hilton's footprint in China nearly sextuple since 2018, positions the hospitality giant competitively against rivals like InterContinental in the rapidly expanding Chinese market.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>California's special election for Proposition 50, a Democratic initiative aimed at redrawing congressional districts, is witnessing unexpectedly high early voter turnout. Over 3.4 million mail ballots have already been returned, a figure comparable to the 2024 presidential election at this point, despite the complex nature of redistricting. Democrats are notably outperforming Republicans and voters with no party preference in ballot returns, indicating a potential advantage for Proposition 50, which requires a simple majority for approval. Former President Obama has endorsed the measure, framing it as essential for safeguarding democracy against manipulation. Conversely, Republicans are concerned that past criticisms from Donald Trump regarding mail-in balloting might be suppressing early GOP votes.</p>
