        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Boxers Julio C√©sar Ch√°vez Jr. and Jake Paul are insisting their upcoming fight is a genuine contest, not a staged spectacle. Ch√°vez Jr., son of a boxing legend, is looking to revitalize his career after personal struggles and sees the fight as a path to more significant opportunities, including a potential world championship. Conversely, social media personality Jake Paul aims to solidify his boxing legitimacy by defeating a seasoned professional, dismissing criticisms that his previous fights were against weaker or compromised opponents. Both fighters have exchanged confident predictions, emphasizing that a real and consequential bout will take place.</p>

        </div>
        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>According to Peng Wensheng, chief economist at China International Capital Corporation, China's established third-party payment platforms like WeChat and Alipay give the nation a significant edge in the global stablecoin race. He argues that this platform-based digital money already functions similarly to stablecoins and is supported by a mature regulatory framework that ensures a 1:1 peg with fiat currency. Peng notes that customer funds are backed by central bank base money, providing a high degree of stability and regulatory oversight. This position comes as Chinese state media encourages policymakers to remain competitive in the evolving landscape of global digital finance. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>A research team from China's Nankai University has successfully completed the world's first human trial of a brain-computer interface (BCI) implanted through blood vessels, a method that avoids open-skull surgery. In the trial, a 67-year-old paralyzed patient reportedly regained some limb movement after surgeons inserted a stent electrode into his intracranial vasculature via a minimally invasive neck vein procedure. This technique, performed at the Fujian Sanbo Funeng Brain Hospital, presents a potentially safer alternative to more invasive methods like those used by Elon Musk's Neuralink. The approach promises to reduce surgical risks and significantly shorten patient recovery times.</p>

          <p>The Los Angeles Dodgers defeated the Kansas City Royals 5-4, extending their winning streak and taking sole possession of the best record in the majors, despite what their manager called an incomplete performance. The team overcame a shaky start from pitcher Dustin May and defensive errors, securing the victory with key hits from Max Muncy and Shohei Ohtani. The game culminated in a tense ninth inning where reliever Tanner Scott induced a game-ending double play with the bases loaded. The win highlights the team's ability to grind out victories even when not playing at their peak, a recurring theme during a softer portion of their schedule.</p>

          <p>Chelsea's manager, Enzo Maresca, has publicly stated that the club has no plans to sell 19-year-old defender Josh Acheampong this summer, despite interest from other clubs in England and Europe. Maresca emphasized his belief in Acheampong's potential to become a top defender for Chelsea and sees the player's development as best served by remaining with the team. Acheampong, a product of Chelsea's academy, had a breakthrough season and signed a new five-year contract last year. Sources close to the player have also refuted suggestions that he is unhappy at the club, indicating a loan would only be considered if mutually beneficial.</p>

          <p>A recent study indicates that a Japanese-style diet, rich in rice, miso soup, fish, and soy products, is associated with a lower rate of depressive symptoms among working-age people. The research, conducted by the Japan Institute for Health Security among nearly 12,500 employees, is the first of its kind to assess the Japanese diet's impact on mental health. Researchers suggest that certain foods in the diet, such as seaweed, soy, and oily fish, may contribute to well-being by assisting in the release of neurotransmitters like serotonin and providing anti-inflammatory benefits. While further research is needed, the findings offer potential public health insights for preventing depression.</p>

The May 16 escape, which went unnoticed for hours, has drawn heavy criticism of the Orleans Parish Sheriff's management of the facility. Authorities have now recaptured nine of the escapees, with only one, Derrick Groves, still at large. A significant reward remains for information leading to his arrest.</p>
