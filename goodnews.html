          <p>Zia Yusuf, former Reform UK chairman, dismisses the burka ban debate as a minor issue after criticizing MP Sarah Pochin's stance. Yusuf regretted his social media post and returned to a different role within the party, leading the 'Doge unit' focused on cutting wasteful spending. The controversy arose after Pochin questioned Prime Minister Starmer about banning the burka, a policy not aligned with the party's official position. Yusuf supports considering a ban on face coverings in public, emphasizing assimilation concerns. </p>
