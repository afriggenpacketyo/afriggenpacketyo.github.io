        </div>
        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Emerging markets stocks are gaining attention as the "sell U.S." narrative gains momentum, driven by factors like Moody's downgrade of the U.S. credit rating and thawing U.S.-China trade tensions. Bank of America and JPMorgan have expressed bullish views on emerging markets, citing attractive valuations and a weaker U.S. dollar. This shift reflects dented confidence in U.S. assets, leading to a divergence in performance between emerging market equities and U.S. stocks. The MSCI Emerging Markets Index has outperformed the S&P 500 year-to-date, indicating a potential rotation towards emerging markets. (not investment advice)</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Sixteen consumer groups are calling on the European Union to take action against seven low-cost airlines, including Ryanair and EasyJet, over their baggage fees. The European Consumer Organisation (BEUC) accuses the airlines of "misleading" passengers and creating "confusion" at check-ins by charging extra for hand baggage that doesn't meet their guidelines. The groups argue that these practices breach EU consumer law and are seeking an investigation and sanctions. Ryanair and Norwegian have defended their policies, stating they comply with EU law, while other airlines referred to a statement by Airlines for Europe that the action would decrease consumer choice.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Japanese Finance Minister Katsunobu Kato and U.S. Treasury Secretary Scott Bessent discussed currency issues tied to ongoing tariff negotiations, agreeing that the current dollar-yen exchange rate reflects economic fundamentals. This acknowledgement suggests that the yen's weakness against the dollar is no longer a point of contention in trade talks. Kato expressed concerns about the impact of U.S. tariffs on the global economy, while both sides aim to strike a "mutually beneficial" deal as early as June. Japan is considering backing off from seeking a full removal of U.S. tariffs in order to reach a quicker agreement.</p>

          <p>Ford Motor Co. has filed a $100 million lawsuit against multiple Southern California law firms and attorneys, accusing them of engaging in a racketeering scheme to collect inflated legal fees under the state's Lemon Law. Ford alleges the lawyers violated the RICO Act by inflating billing hours and claiming work that never happened. The lawsuit claims that attorneys took advantage of a law designed to protect consumers with faulty products by billing more hours than they worked. One attorney is alleged to have billed over 24 hours per day on multiple occasions.</p>

          <h2>Afrikaners Dispute Claims of 'White Genocide' in South Africa</h2>

        </div>
        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>While the Trump administration is offering Afrikaners refugee status based on claims of persecution, some members of the white South African community dispute the narrative of a "white genocide." They argue that white South Africans still hold significant economic power and that racial motives are not generally a factor in the country's high crime rate. They acknowledged challenges related to land expropriation and dysfunctional government policies, but emphasized that the land must be shared by both Black and White people and there is no systemic genocide in play.</p>
