          <p>This opinion article posits that China is uniquely positioned to shape the future of the Middle East due to its extensive trade and defense relationships throughout the region. The author argues that as the world's second-largest power and the top trading partner for many nations, Beijing can leverage its economic influence to foster constructive solutions and prevent wider conflicts. This contrasts with the West, which the article claims has failed to prevent multiple simultaneous conflicts despite advocating for a rules-based international order.</p>

          <p>Former Secretary of State Hillary Clinton remarked that she would nominate Donald Trump for a Nobel Peace Prize if he successfully negotiates an end to the war in Ukraine without Kyiv having to concede territory to Russia. Speaking on a podcast, Clinton emphasized that a valid peace agreement must not validate Russia's aggression or its vision of a 'greater Russia.' She expressed a hope, which she termed a 'dream,' that Trump might stand up to Putin to protect not just Ukraine but also U.S. security interests.</p>

          <p>The Jeff Bezos-backed startup Slate Automotive is positioning itself to enter the electric vehicle market with a low-cost, American-made pickup truck. The company's strategy involves selling a simple, two-seat base model and allowing owners to customize it with over 100 different accessories, including a kit to convert it into an SUV. Slate's primary challenge is maintaining its affordable price point, especially as the Trump administration has rolled back federal EV tax credits, potentially raising the vehicle's cost.</p>

          <p>At 21 years old, all-rounder Jacob Bethell is set to become the youngest man to captain England in international cricket, leading a T20 squad for an upcoming tour of Ireland. The decision comes as regular white-ball captain Harry Brook and other senior players are being rested. This appointment is a significant show of faith from England's selectors in Bethell's leadership abilities, despite him having never captained a full senior-level match before and having had limited playing time this summer.</p>

          <p>Las Vegas Aces star Kelsey Plum has addressed the controversy surrounding her comments about Caitlin Clark's All-Star team, stating that her words were an ill-advised joke.

          <p>Carrie Wheeler, the CEO of online real estate company Opendoor, has announced her resignation following a period of intense pressure from activist investors. The move comes after the company's stock experienced a recent surge, driven by investors betting on a turnaround for the struggling business. In her announcement, Wheeler stated that stepping aside would allow new leadership to take over without the distraction of the "intense outside interest" in the company, which has been grappling with a difficult housing market.</p>

          <p>Following a six-month freeze and a lawsuit from over a dozen states, the Trump administration has agreed to resume funding for the National Electric Vehicle Infrastructure (NEVI) program. The bipartisan program, created to build a network of high-speed EV chargers, had been halted by the administration, which called it wasteful. While officials maintain their opposition to green energy subsidies, they are now complying with the law, though they have removed several Biden-era requirements related to community engagement and labor standards.</p>

The move would aim to revive the struggling American chipmaker and reduce U.S. reliance on foreign semiconductor manufacturers like Samsung and TSMC. While direct government ownership of a private company is controversial, proponents believe it is necessary to ensure the U.S. maintains a domestic supply of critical technology.
