          <p>In a wide-ranging interview with the BBC, former Vice President Kamala Harris indicated she is considering another run for the presidency. While not officially committing, she responded with "possibly" when asked about a 2028 bid, asserting that her career in public service is not over. Harris also commented on the 2024 election, stating her warnings about Donald Trump's authoritarian tendencies have been proven correct and criticized businesses for capitulating to his demands. Polling in her home state of California, however, shows limited support for another presidential campaign at this time.</p>

Her parents attribute her remarkable recovery, which includes walking and dribbling a basketball, to the "miraculous power of prayer" and skilled medical care. The community gathered to celebrate her release, offering a moment of hope following the tragic August attack that killed two children and injured 18 others.

          <p>The popular investment strategy of passively investing in S&P 500 index funds, like the Vanguard S&P 500 ETF (VOO), may be losing its appeal for some investors seeking better diversification. Financial experts note that the S&P 500 has become heavily weighted towards the technology sector, which now accounts for over 35% of the index, a record high. In response, some traders are showing renewed interest in small-cap stocks, with the Russell 2000 index recently outperforming the S&P 500. This trend suggests a broadening of investment focus beyond large-cap tech giants. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>European Commission President Ursula von der Leyen announced that the EU is actively working to end its reliance on China for rare earth elements, which are crucial for manufacturing smartphones, electric vehicles, and military technology. Recent export curbs by Beijing have highlighted Europe's vulnerability and caused economic damage to some industries. The EU's strategy involves securing alternative sources through partnerships with countries like Australia and Canada, increasing recycling efforts, and developing its own production capabilities.

          <p>Billionaire investor Mark Cuban suggests that one of the most effective financial moves for the average person is not picking stocks but buying household consumables in bulk. He argues that saving a significant percentage on items like toilet paper and toothpaste by purchasing larger quantities yields a guaranteed return, unlike the uncertainties of the stock market. Cuban emphasizes that this strategy is a smart investment, provided it is done with cash rather than by accumulating credit card debt. This practical advice reflects his belief in simple, effective ways to manage personal finances.</p>

          <p>One year after the largest dam removal project in U.S. history, the Klamath River is showing remarkable signs of ecological recovery. Salmon have been observed in headwaters for the first time in over a century, water temperatures have stabilized, and native wildlife is returning to the restored riverbanks. To mark the milestone, a group of 28 Indigenous teenagers became the first to kayak the full length of the river in more than 100 years. The project's success is now serving as an inspiration for river restoration movements and Indigenous-led conservation efforts worldwide.</p>

          <p>The S&P 500 and Nasdaq both closed at record highs for the week, propelled by encouraging economic news and strong corporate earnings reports. A key driver was the September consumer price index (CPI), which showed inflation rising less than anticipated, increasing the likelihood of another interest rate cut by the Federal Reserve. Despite the ongoing government shutdown and trade tensions, the market was buoyed by the fact that 87% of S&P 500 companies that have reported so far have beaten earnings expectations, signaling underlying strength in the corporate sector.

          <p>Located just blocks from the White House, the Octagon House holds a significant place in U.S. history as one of Washington D.C.'s oldest homes. Completed in 1801, it temporarily served as the executive mansion for President James Madison and his wife Dolley after the White House was burned by the British during the War of 1812. It was in this house that President Madison signed the Treaty of Ghent, officially ending the war. Now a museum, the building is also known for its reported paranormal activity and is undergoing renovations as part of America's 250th independence celebration.</p>

          <p>Researchers at China's Northwestern Polytechnical University have developed a bionic robot that mimics a jellyfish, designed for covert underwater surveillance and monitoring. Described as an "underwater phantom," the drone is made of a transparent hydrogel material, operates nearly silently, and has very low power consumption. Its lifelike design makes it suitable for observing fragile marine ecosystems without disturbance, inspecting underwater structures, and conducting stealthy monitoring operations. The compact device measures 120mm in diameter and weighs only 56 grams, showcasing advancements in biomimetic technology.</p>
