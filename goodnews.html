          <p>New York Yankees outfielder Aaron Judge recently stated that his relationship with God provides more fulfillment than his considerable fame and fortune. During a media session before the MLB All-Star Game, he advised that building a relationship with Jesus Christ is the key to solving life's problems. Judge, who is having another MVP-caliber season, has often been public about his faith, which he also displayed through a biblical reference on his custom bat. This highlights a personal dimension of the athlete beyond his on-field achievements.</p>

The new application, which replaces Coinbase Wallet, integrates wallet, trading, and payment functionalities, along with social and messaging features, all running on its Base blockchain. As part of the launch, Coinbase rolled out Base Pay, a one-click checkout system for USDC stablecoin payments, in partnership with Shopify. The move aims to attract a broader consumer base by creating a more accessible and practical crypto-powered economic ecosystem for everyday use.</p>

          <h2>Tsunami Advisory Lifted for Southern Alaska Following 7.2 Magnitude Earthquake</h2>
          <div class="timestamp">2025-07-16 19:31:43 EDT</div>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>A tsunami advisory issued for parts of southern Alaska has been canceled after a powerful 7.2 magnitude earthquake struck off the coast. The quake, which occurred about 50 miles south of Sand Point, initially triggered a more severe tsunami warning, prompting evacuations in coastal towns like Seward. Officials later downgraded the alert to an advisory, noting that the earthquake's shallow depth meant widespread, large waves were not expected. While some small sea level changes were possible, the threat passed without major incident, and there was no danger to Anchorage.</p>

          <p>President Trump announced on social media that Coca-Cola has agreed to replace high-fructose corn syrup with cane sugar in its beverages sold in the United States. While Trump praised the move as "just better," Coca-Cola has not explicitly confirmed the change, stating only that they appreciate his enthusiasm and will share details on new offerings soon. The potential switch has drawn criticism from the Corn Refiners Association, which warned of job losses and increased foreign sugar imports. Coca-Cola currently uses cane sugar in its products in other countries, such as Mexico.</p>

          <p>Legacy media companies are increasingly partnering with established digital creators to attract younger, online audiences, as exemplified by Fox News Media's recent licensing deal with the conservative podcast "Ruthless." This move is part of a broader industry trend where traditional outlets aim to engage consumers who have moved away from conventional television and pay-TV services. By bringing popular online shows into their fold, companies like Fox and ESPN, which licensed Pat McAfee's program, hope to expand their digital footprint and stay relevant. The strategy highlights the growing influence of podcasters and YouTubers in the modern media landscape.</p>

          <p>Former President Barack Obama and First Lady Michelle Obama have publicly addressed and humorously dismissed persistent rumors about their marriage being in trouble. Appearing together on a podcast, the couple joked about the speculation, which had been fueled by Barack Obama attending some high-profile events alone. Michelle Obama clarified that her occasional solo public life is a personal choice now that her children are grown. She reaffirmed the strength of their 32-year marriage, stating she has never considered leaving and has become a better person because of her husband, putting the unfounded rumors to rest.</p>

          <p>Prince Harry recently walked through a minefield in Angola, continuing the advocacy work of his late mother, Princess Diana, who famously did the same 28 years ago. Working with the HALO Trust, the same organization his mother supported, the Duke of Sussex visited a newly cleared area to raise awareness about the ongoing danger of landmines left from Angola's civil war. He emphasized that children should not have to live in fear from the remnants of war. Diana's efforts in 1997 were instrumental in mobilizing global support for a treaty to ban landmines.</p>

          <p>A recent report from Vanguard provides insights into average 401(k) retirement savings balances from the last year, offering a benchmark for individual savers. The article emphasizes that one of the most effective ways to increase savings is by contributing enough to receive the full employer match, a benefit offered by the vast majority of plans. Using an example, the article illustrates how maximizing this "free money" can lead to a substantially larger nest egg over a worker's career. The piece serves as a reminder of the power of consistent contributions for long-term financial growth. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>Germany has committed to strengthening its laws to crack down on gangs smuggling migrants to the UK, with changes expected by the end of the year. The move will make facilitating illegal migration to the UK a crime in Germany, which is currently not the case for non-EU destinations. This change is part of a new bilateral agreement between the UK and Germany covering migration, defense, and business. The new legislation aims to make it easier for German authorities to disrupt smuggling operations, particularly those involving the storage and supply of small boats used for Channel crossings.</p>

          <p>For the first time, astronomers have captured the moment planets begin to form around a young, sun-like star named HOPS-315, located 1,300 light-years away. Using data from NASA's Webb Telescope and the European Southern Observatory, scientists identified the formation of silicon monoxide, a mineral found in ancient meteorites in our own solar system. This discovery provides a direct look at the earliest stage of planet building, showing a system that resembles what our solar system looked like in its infancy. The finding offers a crucial glimpse into the processes that lead to the creation of planetary systems.</p>

The airline expects to achieve adjusted earnings between $9 and $11 per share for 2025, a sign of growing confidence in travel demand. While second-quarter revenue of $15.24 billion was slightly below expectations, the company highlighted strong premium cabin sales. The updated outlook suggests a more stable environment for the airline industry following a period of weaker-than-expected domestic demand. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>A landmark UK study has confirmed the births of eight healthy babies using a pioneering technique that combines DNA from three people to prevent incurable mitochondrial diseases. These devastating genetic disorders, which are passed from mother to child, can cause organ failure and early death. The method involves transferring the nuclear DNA from the parents' fertilized egg into a donor egg with healthy mitochondria. While the children inherit a tiny amount of DNA from the donor, the procedure has so far proven successful in allowing at-risk families to have children free of the hereditary condition.</p>

          <p>President Trump has stated that China is making "big steps" to control the flow of fentanyl into the United States, adopting a more positive tone on an issue he previously used to justify tariffs. Speaking from the Oval Office, Trump acknowledged the severity of the fentanyl crisis but said that his administration's talks with Beijing have led to progress. This assessment differs significantly from his earlier rhetoric, where he directly linked tariffs to China's failure to stop the drug's production and supply. The comments come as high-level trade negotiations between the two countries are ongoing.</p>
