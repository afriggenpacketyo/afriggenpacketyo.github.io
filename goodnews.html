          <p>The high-profile summit between U.S. President Donald Trump and Russian President Vladimir Putin is set to occur at Joint Base Elmendorf-Richardson in Anchorage, Alaska. White House officials selected the military installation for its ability to meet stringent security requirements, and the location carries historical significance as Alaska was purchased by the U.S. from Russia in 1867. The primary topic of discussion is ending the war in Ukraine, although the White House has described the meeting as a "listening exercise" to temper expectations for an immediate breakthrough.</p>

          <p>Economist Marc Sumerlin has confirmed he is being considered for the position of Federal Reserve chair and has publicly advocated for an aggressive interest rate cut. Sumerlin, a former economist in the George W. Bush administration, stated that a 50-basis-point reduction is a "no-brainer" due to weaknesses in the labor market and stable inflation. This position aligns with President Trump's repeated calls for the central bank to ease monetary policy, though Sumerlin also stressed the importance of maintaining the Fed's independence.

          <p>In Virginia's gubernatorial race, Democratic candidate Abigail Spanberger is targeting Latino voters with her first Spanish-language radio advertisement, focusing on her plans to lower living costs. The ad is part of a broader Democratic effort to regain support from the Latino community, which saw a shift toward Republicans in the 2024 presidential election. By starting this outreach early, Spanberger aims to build a narrative around affordability and contrast her platform with that of her Republican opponent, whom the ad links to unpopular Trump administration policies.</p>

          <p>In a significant scientific breakthrough, researchers at MIT have successfully used generative artificial intelligence to invent two new types of antibiotics that can kill drug-resistant superbugs like MRSA and gonorrhoea. The AI was trained to design entirely new molecular structures from scratch, a method that could revolutionize the discovery of new medicines and help combat the growing crisis of antibiotic resistance. Although the new compounds were effective in lab and animal tests, they still face years of further development and clinical trials.</p>

          <p>This year's A-level results in the UK show a modest increase in the proportion of top grades awarded, with 28.3% of entries marked A* or A. A record number of 18-year-old students secured a place at their first-choice university, with the most selective institutions seeing the largest increase in acceptances. However, the results also highlighted a widening regional disparity in England, as students in London and the South East continue to achieve significantly higher grades than their peers in the North East.</p>

          <p>Swiss pilot Raphael Domjan has set a new altitude record for a solar-powered electric plane, flying his SolarStratos aircraft to 31,237 feet (9,521 meters). The five-hour flight, which launched from Sion, Switzerland, aims to demonstrate the potential of decarbonized aviation and promote the use of solar energy. The achievement marks a major milestone for the project, which ultimately hopes to complete the first manned solar-powered flight into the stratosphere. The data from the flight will now be sent to the World Air Sports Federation for official validation.</p>

          <p>A routine car accident in a small Tennessee town has led to the unsealing of federal indictments against five leaders of the United Cartels, a prominent Mexican drug trafficking organization. The initial incident triggered a multi-year investigation involving wiretaps and surveillance that uncovered a vast network supplying methamphetamine to the Atlanta area. The Justice Department's case highlights how local law enforcement actions can unravel complex international criminal operations, and the U.S. is now offering multi-million dollar rewards for the capture of the indicted individuals.</p>

          <p>Residents in Fort Collins, Colorado, have been spotting rabbits with grotesque, horn-like growths, but scientists have confirmed the phenomenon is not as sinister as it appears. The animals are infected with Shope papillomavirus, a common virus that causes wart-like tumors on their heads and faces. The virus, which is not transmissible to humans or pets, is believed to be the origin of the jackalope myth and is typically fought off by the rabbits' immune systems, after which the growths disappear.</p>

          <p>Rebecca Young, a 13-year-old student from Glasgow, has been named one of Time magazine's "Girls of the Year" for inventing a solar-powered heated blanket to help homeless individuals. Her idea, conceived in a school engineering club, won a national competition and was subsequently developed into a working prototype by the technology company Thales. The blankets have been distributed to homeless people in Glasgow, and as part of the recognition, Rebecca has been featured on a digital cover of Time as a Lego mini-figure.</p>

          <p>A woman from New York successfully completed her quest to find her own diamond for an engagement ring by unearthing a 2.30-carat gem at Crater of Diamonds State Park in Arkansas. Micherre Fox spent a month digging at the public park, the only one of its kind in the world, and found the colorless diamond on her last day. She described the act of finding the stone herself as symbolic of the hard work required in a marriage, a personal project that her partner had fully supported.</p>

          <p>Based on recent inflation data, the Senior Citizens League is estimating a 2.7% cost-of-living adjustment (COLA) for Social Security beneficiaries in 2026. This would be a slight increase from the 2.5% boost implemented in the current year. The annual COLA is designed to help seniors' benefits keep pace with rising costs, but some experts worry that even with this adjustment, the payments may not fully cover the true expenses faced by retirees, especially if inflation accelerates due to factors like new tariffs.

          <p>Networking technology company Cisco has reported fourth-quarter financial results that narrowly beat analyst expectations, with revenue of $14.67 billion representing a 7.6% year-over-year increase. The company also provided an optimistic forecast for the coming fiscal year that was in line with market consensus. A key driver of this performance has been the surging demand for AI infrastructure, with Cisco securing over $2 billion in AI-related orders during the fiscal year, more than double its initial goal.
