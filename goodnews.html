          <p>Tech and music industry leaders testified before the Senate Judiciary Committee, urging the passage of the No Fakes Act to protect individuals from unauthorized AI-generated deepfakes. Executives from YouTube and the Recording Industry Association of America, along with singer Martina McBride, emphasized the risks of voice and likeness misuse. The No Fakes Act aims to hold individuals or companies liable for creating unauthorized digital replicas in performances, while also establishing a notice-and-takedown process for victims to remove deepfakes from online platforms. The bill has garnered support from nearly 400 artists and performers who are advocating for responsible AI use.</p>

Representatives of the Chagossian community have been invited for discussions regarding the sovereignty of the territory.

          <p>A man from mainland China reportedly entered Taiwan illegally by sea and spent over a month travelling freely around the island before surrendering to immigration authorities. The man, identified as Li, departed from a beach near Fuzhou, Fujian province, and boarded a cargo vessel in the Taiwan Strait. The ship docked in Kaohsiung, where Li disembarked illegally and travelled undetected across Taiwan. This incident has raised alarms about loopholes in Taiwan‚Äôs maritime security. Li was charged with violating Taiwan‚Äôs Immigration Act and received a lenient sentence due to his self-surrender.</p>

Trump stated that these entities are performing well and generating significant cash, suggesting the timing may be right for privatization.

JPMorgan also upgraded emerging market equities, citing thawing U.S.-China trade tensions and attractive valuations.

EHang and its joint venture partner Hefei Heyi Aviation recently became the first companies to receive certification from the Civil Aviation Administration of China (CAAC) to operate autonomous passenger drones.

Sacks claims that this legislation could unlock trillions of dollars for U.S. Treasuries by providing legal clarity for stablecoins. He noted that over $200 billion in stablecoins already exists, but is unregulated, and that providing a legal framework could create significant demand for U.S. Treasuries quickly.

          <p>US researchers propose a novel approach to combat malaria by administering malaria drugs to mosquitoes, clearing their infection and preventing disease spread. Instead of focusing solely on killing mosquitoes with insecticides, the team at Harvard University identified drugs that can rid the insects of malaria when absorbed through their legs. The long-term goal is to coat bed nets with a drug cocktail, as mosquitoes have developed resistance to insecticides. The approach offers a new strategy to kill parasites in the mosquito, addressing the limitations of current methods.</p>

          <p>While the Trump administration has expedited refugee status for Afrikaners claiming violence and discrimination, some Afrikaners dispute claims of a "White genocide" in South Africa. Afrikaner commentator Piet Croucamp states there's no evidence of genocide, and Whites remain economically strong. Nick Serfontein, an Afrikaner cattle farmer, says he feels safe and sees a positive vibe between farmers of all races. He also said that there hasn't been a single case of expropriation without compensation documented in the 31 years since apartheid ended. While acknowledging attacks on farmers, Serfontein emphasized that racial motives are not generally a factor.</p>

Two alternative methods, an enhanced mammogram and a fast MRI scan, detected 17-19 cancers per 1,000 women screened, compared to traditional mammograms detecting eight.</p>
