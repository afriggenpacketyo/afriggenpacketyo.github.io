          <div class="timestamp">2025-07-23 10:30:50 EDT</div>
        </div>
        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>The UK's Supreme Court has quashed the convictions of two former city traders, Tom Hayes and Carlo Palombo, who were jailed for manipulating the Libor and Euribor interest rate benchmarks. The court ruled that the directions given to the juries in their original trials were incorrect, rendering the convictions unsafe. This decision concludes a decade-long legal battle, with the traders arguing their actions were common practice and known to superiors, making them scapegoats for a wider industry issue. The ruling may open the door for other convicted traders to appeal and has prompted calls for a public inquiry into the prosecutions.</p>

          <p>Uber is launching a new feature in the U.S. that allows women and non-binary drivers and riders to indicate a preference for being matched with each other. The pilot program, called "Women+ Connect," will begin next month in Los Angeles, San Francisco, and Detroit. While not a guarantee, the feature is designed to increase the likelihood of women-to-women pairings, aiming to enhance comfort and safety on the platform. This initiative builds on a similar feature previously rolled out in about 40 other countries and comes as the company continues to address long-standing safety concerns.</p>

          <div class="timestamp">2025-07-23 10:14:46 EDT</div>
        </div>
        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>A concert at Italy's Reggia di Caserta palace featuring renowned Russian conductor Valery Gergiev was abruptly canceled following a public outcry over his support for Vladimir Putin. The decision was praised by critics, including Yulia Navalnaya, widow of the late opposition leader Alexey Navalny, who argued that artists supporting the Russian dictatorship should not be welcomed in Europe. Gergiev has faced numerous cancellations across Europe and the U.S. for his refusal to condemn Russia's invasion of Ukraine. Russia's Foreign Ministry condemned the cancellation as "cultural censorship," accusing Italy of caving to Ukrainian pressure.</p>

          <p>Vladimir Lenin's tomb in Moscow's Red Square is experiencing a surge in visitors ahead of its scheduled closure for extensive repairs, which will last until 2027. The mausoleum, which has housed the preserved body of the Soviet Union's founder since his death in 1924, has been a unique and somber attraction for a century. In Soviet times, it drew massive, reverent crowds, a phenomenon that faded after the USSR's collapse. The renewed interest appears driven less by political nostalgia and more by a desire for a final look at the historical curiosity, amid ongoing debates about whether Lenin should finally be buried.</p>

          <p>After nearly two decades without a confirmed sighting, the Barbados threadsnake, the smallest known snake species in the world, has been rediscovered on the Caribbean island. The tiny, blind snake, which measures only up to four inches long and can fit on a coin, was found by a local research team under a rock. Its rediscovery has brought relief to conservationists who feared it was extinct. The species, which eats termites and ants, is considered critically endangered due to habitat loss, and scientists hope its reappearance will bolster efforts to protect the island's remaining native wildlife habitats.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Amid rising household debt driven by high interest rates and the resumption of student loan payments, financial experts are highlighting several effective debt relief strategies. For disciplined borrowers, the "debt avalanche" method, which prioritizes paying off high-interest debts first, can save the most money over time. Other options include debt consolidation through personal loans or balance transfer credit cards, which can lower interest rates for those with good credit. For individuals facing more severe struggles, nonprofit credit counseling agencies can arrange debt management plans to negotiate better terms, while debt settlement and bankruptcy remain options for extreme situations.

Inspired by the #MeToo movement, she fought for years to have her case reopened, and prosecutors are now asking the court to quash the guilty verdict, issuing a formal apology for her suffering.

          <p>A Pulitzer Prize-winning photograph taken by Stanley Forman in 1975, capturing a woman and child falling from a collapsed fire escape in Boston, had a profound and lasting impact on public safety. The haunting image depicted 19-year-old Diana Bryant, who was killed in the fall, and her 2-year-old goddaughter, Tiare Jones, who survived. The photo's widespread publication shocked the public and spurred immediate action from city officials. Within months, Boston implemented a new city code requiring all fire escapes to be inspected and certified as safe every five years, a regulation that has since influenced safety standards across the country.</p>

Woodward and Campese argued the team should have played on for pride, but Potter insisted the squad's intention was to win. Following the loss in Brisbane, Australia must win the second Test in Melbourne to keep the series alive.</p>

Analysts attribute this decline partly to a drop in orders for oil and LNG tankers, as shipowners are reportedly cautious due to the United States' prominent role in energy exports and potential trade frictions.

While New Hampshire ranked poorly for weather, it was number one for safety and in the top ten for healthcare and tax-friendliness.

          <p>The sea slug Elysia chlorotica exhibits a remarkable biological feat by stealing chloroplasts from the algae it consumes and integrating them into its own body to perform photosynthesis. This process, known as kleptoplasty, allows the slug to sustain itself on light like a plant, blurring the lines between animal and plant kingdoms. The phenomenon is a striking example of symbiosis, where organisms co-opt traits from others, a mechanism some biologists believe is a more significant driver of evolution than traditionally thought. While the exact genetic mechanics remain a mystery, the slug highlights how permeable the boundaries between species and their environments can be.</p>
