          <p>Russian billionaire Oleg Deripaska, a close associate of President Vladimir Putin, has asserted that a yuan-based payment system is fundamental for China to realize its vision of a new multipolar world order. Speaking in Beijing, Deripaska highlighted Chinese banks' cautious reliance on dollar assets, which he noted has frustrated Moscow's efforts to diminish U.S. dollar dominance. He further urged China to accelerate the expansion of its yuan-based debt market to bolster the international use of its currency in financial settlements, emphasizing its necessity for global trade. This strategic shift is seen as crucial for China's ascent as a global power.</p>

          <div class="timestamp">2025-09-05 06:00:00 EDT</div>
        </div>
        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Despite widespread public support for organ donation, a significant gap persists between intent and actual donations, leaving over 100,000 people awaiting transplants in the U.S. This article explains that only a tiny fraction of deaths occur under the specific medical circumstances suitable for organ donation, often requiring continuous blood flow until surgical removal. Additionally, families can sometimes override registered donor wishes, and living donation faces considerable psychological and practical hurdles, including uncompensated financial costs for donors. Proposed legislation like the End Kidney Deaths Act, which would offer substantial tax credits, aims to effectively address these systemic barriers and dramatically increase life-saving transplants.</p>

          <p>Offshore wind developer Orsted received shareholder approval for a crucial 60 billion Danish kroner ($9.4 billion) rights issue, following a recent profit warning. This financial lifeline comes amidst sustained political pressure from U.S. President Donald Trump, who recently ordered an abrupt halt to the Revolution Wind project off the U.S. coast, despite it being 80% complete. Orsted has since initiated a lawsuit against the Trump administration to resume construction, underscoring the significant regulatory and political challenges facing large-scale renewable energy projects. Investors responded positively to the news, with shares seeing a modest increase despite the ongoing turmoil.</p>

          <p>European stock markets experienced gains on Friday as investors anticipated a key U.S. jobs report, which is expected to influence the Federal Reserve's decision on interest rate cuts. Shares of Danish wind farm developer Orsted rose 3% after shareholders approved its emergency $9.4 billion rights issue, despite ongoing opposition to offshore wind projects from U.S. President Donald Trump. This market movement also reflects broader sentiment that brightened after U.S. payrolls data boosted bets on a September Fed rate cut, indicating a "Goldilocks" scenario for the labor market.
