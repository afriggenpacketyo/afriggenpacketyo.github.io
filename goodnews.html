        </div>
        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Pop Mart, the company behind the popular Labubu monster toys, has stated it is pleased with the recent drop in the toys' high resale prices. The secondary market had seen markups of over 2,000%, but increased production and cooling demand have caused prices to fall, which the company sees as a positive development for making its products accessible to genuine fans. Pop Mart is focusing on a sustainable long-term model by expanding overseas and developing original content to build character backstories. Analysts view the move as a necessary step to transition from a hype-driven phenomenon to a stable consumer brand.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>British energy giant BP has seen its stock value increase by over 32% since April, reducing the intense takeover speculation that surrounded the company earlier this year. This improved performance is attributed to a strategic reset, leadership changes, cost-cutting measures, and recent oil discoveries. While activist investor Elliott's arrival has pressured the company to focus on its core oil and gas business, analysts remain concerned about BP's significant debt burden. The company's focus is now on growth and delivering on its divestment program to further strengthen its financial position.</p>

        </div>
        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>The Welsh word "poody," meaning to sulk or pout, has been officially included in the Oxford English Dictionary's latest update. The term gained wider recognition after being used by contestants on the BBC show "Race Across the World," who had to explain its meaning to baffled producers. It is one of ten Welsh words added, including "nobbling" (freezing cold) and "scram" (to scratch). The OED notes that "poody" is a "boomerang word," having originated from the English "pout" before being re-borrowed back into English from Welsh.</p>

          <p>As autumn begins, health officials are warning of a potential seasonal increase in both flu and COVID-19 cases, creating confusion due to their similar symptoms. While the flu often presents suddenly with fever and body aches, COVID-19 symptoms have evolved and can now resemble a common cold, though a hoarse throat has become a hallmark of recent variants. Experts stress that both viruses can cause serious illness, particularly in vulnerable populations, and are urging eligible individuals to get vaccinated. Vaccination remains the most effective defense against severe outcomes and helps reduce strain on healthcare systems during the winter months.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>London-based fintech company Checkout.com has initiated a share buyback program for employees based on a new internal valuation of $12 billion. This figure represents a significant decrease from its peak valuation of $40 billion during a 2022 funding round, though it is an increase from a previous internal valuation of $9.35 billion in 2023. The company, which competes with giants like Stripe and PayPal, stated it is on track for over 30% revenue growth this year. The move to offer liquidity to employees through buybacks is an increasingly common trend for private tech companies amid a slow IPO market.</p>

          <p>Quantum computing firm IonQ is positioning itself as a key player in the defense industry through strategic government contracts and acquisitions. The company recently secured major contracts with the U.S. Air Force Research Laboratory and the Department of Defense to develop scalable quantum systems and secure networking infrastructure. To support this expansion, IonQ has acquired peers Oxford Ionics and Vector Atomic and has launched a dedicated division, IonQ Federal, to manage its government projects. These moves could establish IonQ as a leading "quantum defense" stock as the technology becomes a critical area of geopolitical competition. (not investment advice)</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>The World Trade Organization's recent agreement to ratify a deal eliminating harmful fisheries subsidies is being viewed as a significant victory for global cooperation. After 25 years of negotiations, the deal marks only the second multilateral agreement in the WTO's three-decade history, providing a much-needed boost to the institution. The development, combined with China's decision to no longer use its "developing country" status to delay commitments, offers a glimmer of hope for multilateralism. It suggests that despite rising protectionism and political tensions, international bodies can still achieve progress on critical global issues.</p>

          <p>A coordinated operation by Interpol across 14 African countries has resulted in the arrest of 260 individuals suspected of involvement in romance scams and "sextortion." The sting, funded by the UK, targeted criminal networks that use digital platforms to defraud and blackmail victims, with estimated losses reaching nearly $2.8 million from over 1,400 identified victims. The crackdown led to the seizure of forged documents and digital devices, and the dismantling of 81 cyber-crime groups. The operation highlights the sharp rise in digitally-enabled crime in the region and the international effort to combat these networks.</p>

          <p>Shipping analysts report that carriers are already beginning to reduce the deployment of Chinese-built vessels on transpacific routes ahead of new U.S. port fees. Data from Sea Intelligence shows a downward trend in the share of Chinese-built ships on routes to both the U.S. West and East Coasts in recent weeks. This proactive shift suggests that shipping lines are attempting to mitigate the financial impact of the impending U.S. policy. Despite this, major carriers like Cosco Shipping Lines have publicly affirmed their commitment to maintaining stable service to the American market.</p>

          <p>Senior officials from the United States and China have agreed to increase communication to better manage their differences and expand cooperation.

          <p>The Ryder Cup begins this week at Bethpage Black, with Team USA favored to continue the trend of home-side victories that has defined the last five contests. However, Team Europe, captained by Luke Donald, is seen as a strong contender to win on U.S. soil for the first time since 2012, boasting a more experienced roster. Key factors likely to decide the outcome include performance in the opening foursomes sessions, the ability to manage the notoriously boisterous New York crowd, and the influence of veteran players. President Trump is also expected to attend, adding another layer of intensity to the electric atmosphere.</p>
