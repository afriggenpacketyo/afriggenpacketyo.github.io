          <p>A Southern California family, the Turners, sought grandparent figures for their twin boys, Cayden and Cameron, and discovered Janet Firestein Daw through the "Surrogate Grandparents USA" Facebook group. Firestein Daw, who desired grandchildren, connected instantly with the family, becoming an affectionate "Nana J" and an integral part of their lives, joining trips and celebrating holidays together. This unique relationship has brought a profound sense of completion to the Turners, filling a missing piece in their family structure and providing the "village" they wished for. For Firestein Daw, it has fulfilled a lifelong void, remaining strong even after her own child later had a baby, demonstrating the depth of these chosen family bonds.</p>

Earlier, England bowlers Sophie Ecclestone, with 2-12, and Lauren Filer, taking 3-23, were instrumental in restricting the Trent Rockets' innings to 111-7.

          <p>The Dow Jones Industrial Average achieved a new record high, largely propelled by a significant gain in Home Depot's stock, despite the retailer reporting weaker-than-expected quarterly revenue and earnings. Home Depot reaffirmed its full-year outlook, with July sales showing strong momentum, suggesting a positive trend for the third quarter. Meanwhile, Nvidia is reportedly developing a new, more advanced AI processor specifically for the Chinese market, aiming to deliver samples next month, though regulatory approvals remain uncertain. This article highlights mixed market performance, with value stocks gaining as some tech leaders cool, and ongoing developments in the semiconductor industry. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>Certificate of Deposit (CD) accounts remain an attractive savings option due to current interest rates, which often exceed inflation, and their ability to lock in rates for the entire term. This article details the potential earnings for a $150,000 CD deposit across various terms, from three months to five years. For instance, a 3-month CD at 4.30% could earn approximately $1,587, while a 5-year CD at 4.20% could yield around $34,259 in interest. The analysis emphasizes that CDs offer a secure and predictable way to grow savings without stock market volatility, providing peace of mind in a shifting economic environment.

Microsoft, OpenAI, and Anthropic are investing $23 million to train hundreds of thousands of American Federation of Teachers members, aiming to empower educators and streamline class preparation and lesson planning. While a Gallup and Walton Family Foundation survey indicates teachers save nearly six hours weekly with AI, critics raise concerns about cheating and a potential decline in critical thinking skills.

          <p>Amanda Anderson, a 43-year-old mother of four, initially dismissed a small spot on her nose as dry skin before receiving a shocking basal cell carcinoma diagnosis months later.

The procedure required three passes, leaving a quarter-sized hole in her nose and over 50 stitches, which was far more extensive than she anticipated. Anderson, whose father also battled skin cancer, is now using her experience to advocate for sunscreen use and healthy skin habits, emphasizing the preventability of skin cancer.</p>
