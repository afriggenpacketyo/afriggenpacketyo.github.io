          <p>In a significant sign of a potential trade truce, the U.S. has rescinded export controls on chip-design software for China, as confirmed by major industry players Siemens, Synopsys, and Cadence. The companies announced they had received letters from the Commerce Department lifting the restrictions that were imposed in May, which had required them to obtain licenses for such exports. This reversal allows them to resume full sales and support to Chinese customers, providing a boost to the U.S.-dominated electronic design automation (EDA) market and signaling a de-escalation in trade tensions.</p>

          <p>As families prepare for the 2025-26 academic year, the choice between federal and private student loans remains a critical financial decision. While new federal undergraduate loans offer a fixed rate of 6.39%, some private lenders are advertising rates as low as 3.2% for borrowers with excellent credit or a qualified co-signer. Federal loans provide essential protections like income-driven repayment plans, making them a safe starting point for many. However, families who can secure a lower rate with a private loan could potentially save thousands over time and should compare all options. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>The U.S. labor market showed continued resilience by adding 147,000 jobs in June, surpassing economists' expectations, while the unemployment rate fell slightly to 4.1%. The stronger-than-anticipated job growth, primarily in state government and healthcare, comes as the Trump administration's trade policies create economic volatility. Despite concerns that tariffs would slow hiring, the report suggests the economy remains robust, though some private sector data indicated a slight hesitancy to create new positions. The White House has continued to downplay the economic impact of its tariffs ahead of a key deadline next week. (not investment advice)</p>

Despite these successes, challenges such as youth unemployment and outward migration of its educated youth persist.

          <p>This article explores the ancient wisdom of the Roman philosopher Cicero, particularly from his work "De Officiis," as a guide to achieving lasting happiness. Cicero argued that true, enduring success and contentment are not at odds with moral rectitude but are, in fact, direct results of it. He contended that while people are often tempted by dishonest or selfish shortcuts, the most effective path to both worldly success and personal well-being is through virtuous behavior like justice, honesty, and generosity. Modern social science supports this, showing a strong correlation between ethical living and life satisfaction.</p>
