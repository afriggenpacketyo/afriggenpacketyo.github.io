          <p>The Minnesota Timberwolves have initiated an investigation after fans allegedly made racially charged comments toward Golden State Warriors forward Draymond Green during a playoff game. According to a statement released by the Timberwolves, one fan was ejected, and another left voluntarily before being identified, prompting further investigation. The team emphasized its commitment to fostering an inclusive and respectful environment, condemning any racist or threatening behavior. Green himself commented after the game that there seemed to be an agenda to portray him as an angry Black man, which he refuted by highlighting his success and education. Optimism score must be between 0 and 100.</p>

          <p>A 4.1 magnitude earthquake struck near Greenback, Tennessee, and was felt as far away as Atlanta on Saturday morning, according to the New York Times. The tremor occurred in the Eastern Tennessee Seismic Zone, an area known for minor earthquakes, although stronger quakes are rare. Seismologists are reviewing data to potentially revise the magnitude of the earthquake. The last notable earthquake in the region occurred in 2018, registering a magnitude of 4.4 but causing minimal damage.</p>

          <p>House Republicans have released a portion of President Trump's tax agenda, including an increased child tax credit, a higher threshold for estate tax liability, and measures to make the 2017 Tax Cuts and Jobs Act permanent, according to Fox News. The legislation aims to prevent a tax increase for millions of Americans if the TCJA were to expire. Key points of contention, such as state and local tax deduction caps and a new millionaires‚Äô tax bracket, are notably absent but could be added through amendments. Trump also seeks to eliminate taxes on tips, overtime wages, and Social Security checks for retirees.</p>

President Trump announced the agreement, attributing it to US mediation efforts, while Secretary of State Marco Rubio confirmed the involvement of Vice President JD Vance and himself in brokering the ceasefire. The agreement follows days of cross-border fire and strikes, with both sides reporting civilian casualties. Tensions had risen after an attack on Hindu tourists in Kashmir, which India blamed on Pakistani-backed militants, prompting retaliatory strikes.</p>

While the exact location of reentry is unknown, experts had anticipated that some parts of the half-ton spacecraft might survive the descent. Launched as part of the Soviet Union's Venus exploration program, Kosmos 482 became stranded in Earth's orbit due to a rocket malfunction.</p>

An aging and shrinking population leads to decreased quality of life, with fewer people supporting a larger elderly population. A stable or slightly shrinking population would be acceptable, but a population halving every 50 years is unsustainable.</p>

          <p>Chargers coach Jim Harbaugh is implementing a new approach to evaluating rookie talent during the team's minicamp, focusing primarily on individual drills rather than 11-on-11 periods, according to the Los Angeles Times. This method aims to provide a fair way for rookies to compete and showcase their pure talent. Harbaugh described the system as ‚Äúmining for gold,‚Äù seeking to identify hidden gems within the team's draft picks, undrafted free agents, and tryout players. The coaching staff will teach drills directly applicable to the Chargers‚Äô scheme.</p>
