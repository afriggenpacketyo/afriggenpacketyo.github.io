          <p>In the Women's Cricket World Cup, Australian leg-spinner Alana King achieved the best bowling figures in the tournament's history, taking seven wickets for just 18 runs. This record-breaking performance led to a swift collapse for South Africa, who were bowled out for only 97 runs. Australia easily chased the target, winning by seven wickets with more than half their overs to spare. The decisive victory secures Australia's position at the top of the group stage table and sets up a semi-final clash against India, while South Africa will face England in their semi-final match.</p>

          <p>A vibrant 1943 Picasso portrait of his muse and partner, Dora Maar, has been sold for approximately $37 million at an auction in Paris. Titled "Bust of a Woman with a Flowered Hat (Dora Maar)," the painting had been in a private family collection since 1944 and was hidden from public view for over eight decades. The work captures a poignant moment towards the end of Picasso and Maar's tumultuous relationship, with experts noting its remarkably preserved, vivid colors. The sale price surpassed expectations and marked the highest amount paid for an artwork at a French auction this year.</p>

In populous cities like Chicago, Los Angeles, and Phoenix, manual labor positions such as freight and stock movers are the most common, with median salaries around $40,000.

          <p>President Trump has publicly denied reports that he plans to name the new $300 million White House ballroom after himself, calling the suggestion "fake news." He stated that a name like "the presidential ballroom" is more likely, though a final decision has not been made. This contradicts earlier reports from senior administration officials and a donor list provided by the White House which referred to the project as “the President Donald J. Trump Ballroom.” The project, funded by private donations, involved demolishing the historic East Wing and has raised $350 million, with the extra funds potentially being used for a triumphal arch.</p>

          <p>The Sienna Awards, a global competition for aerial photography, has celebrated a series of breathtaking images captured by drones. The top prize was awarded to German filmmaker Dennis Schmelz for "The Lone Horseman," a striking photo of a rider on a snowy plateau in Cappadocia, Turkey. Other winning entries showcase unique perspectives from around the world, including a vast urban panorama of Dhaka, Bangladesh, the vibrant chaos of a traditional wrestling tournament, and the symmetrical patterns of seaweed farms in China. The collection demonstrates how drone technology allows photographers to reveal compelling stories and patterns invisible from the ground.</p>

          <p>A family in West Virginia has experienced a medical ordeal after four of their six children were diagnosed with Chiari malformation, a rare condition where brain tissue extends into the spinal canal. The journey began when their youngest daughter, Austyn, underwent brain surgery that dramatically improved her constant pain and developmental delays. Subsequently, three of her older sisters—Amelia, Aubrey, and Adalee—were also diagnosed after exhibiting various symptoms. While a genetic link is possible in about 10% of cases, it is highly unusual to see it in four siblings. Following successful surgeries, the family is now enjoying a "new normal."</p>

          <p>The UK's Medicines and Healthcare Products Regulatory Agency (MHRA) has dismantled the country's first-ever discovered illicit factory producing weight loss medications. The raid in Northampton resulted in the largest single seizure of trafficked weight loss drugs by law enforcement worldwide, with an estimated value over £250,000. Officers confiscated tens of thousands of empty injection pens, raw ingredients, and over 2,000 filled pens containing unlicensed drugs like Retatrutide and Tirzepatide. Officials warned that these unauthorized products are untested and potentially deadly, urging the public to only purchase medicines from registered pharmacies.</p>

          <p>In her first UK interview since losing the 2024 presidential election, former Vice President Kamala Harris told the BBC she is considering another run for the White House in 2028. When asked if she could be president one day, she replied, "possibly," and affirmed her belief that a woman will hold the office in the future. Harris dismissed unfavorable polls and emphasized her career in public service is "not done." She also strongly criticized President Trump, labeling him a "tyrant" and asserting that her campaign warnings about him weaponizing federal agencies against political opponents have been proven correct.</p>

          <p>Dr. Roy Meals, a hand surgeon nearing 80, recently completed a 342-mile solo hike along the entire perimeter of the city of Los Angeles. He undertook the journey, documented in his new book "Walking the Line," to better understand the diverse city where his patients live and to promote physical and mental fitness. Meals divided the trek into 34 segments, discovering historical sites, diverse cultures, and unique local businesses often missed from a car. His experience serves as a prescription for others to venture out of their own neighborhoods on foot, fostering curiosity, connection, and a deeper appreciation for their surroundings.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>While new AI tools like OpenAI's Sora 2 video generator have caused widespread panic in Hollywood over potential job losses and copyright infringement, the technology's actual integration has been slow. Major studios like Disney and Lionsgate have made significant investments in AI but have yet to see substantial cost savings or revolutionary creative outputs. Hurdles include the difficulty of integrating third-party AI tools into established production pipelines, legal uncertainties surrounding copyright for AI-generated content, and resistance from actors and guilds. For now, AI remains more of a developing curiosity than an immediate existential threat to the entertainment industry.</p>

          <p>Activist investment firm Starboard Value has taken a nearly 5% stake in engineering and construction company Fluor, aiming to unlock the value of its significant holding in NuScale Power. Fluor's 39% stake in the small modular nuclear reactor (SMR) company is valued at approximately $4.3 billion, representing over 60% of Fluor's own market capitalization. Starboard argues that this stake is depressing Fluor's core business valuation and is urging management to separate the holding, potentially through a sale or a tax-free spinoff to shareholders. This move could significantly rerate Fluor's stock and deliver substantial returns. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>A recent Charles Schwab survey found that 45% of investors are interested in alternative investments like private equity and real estate, moving beyond traditional stocks and bonds. Financial advisors suggest that exchange-traded funds (ETFs) offer a practical and liquid way to gain exposure to these less-traditional asset classes. Unlike direct private investments that often have long lockup periods, alternative ETFs can be traded freely. This approach aligns with a broader trend, as investors have poured over $1 trillion into ETFs this year, with significant flows into gold and crypto products. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>Manchester Central MP Lucy Powell has been elected as the new deputy leader of the UK's Labour Party, defeating Education Secretary Bridget Phillipson. The election was initiated after Angela Rayner's resignation last month. Powell ran on a platform promising to give a louder voice to grassroots members and advocating for a "course correction" in government, drawing support from those dissatisfied with the current party leadership. In her victory speech, she called for the party to be "bolder" and pledged to be an ally to leader Keir Starmer while also bringing critical voices to the forefront of party discussions.</p>

          <p>Negotiating teams from Afghanistan and Pakistan are set to meet in Istanbul to strengthen a fragile ceasefire along their shared border. The talks follow recent deadly clashes that were triggered by explosions in Kabul, which the Taliban blamed on Pakistan, leading to a series of cross-border retaliatory strikes. A second truce, mediated by Qatar and Turkey, is currently holding. The discussions aim to establish mechanisms to ensure the ceasefire's stability, with Afghanistan focused on territorial integrity and Pakistan demanding action against terrorist groups it claims are operating from Afghan soil.</p>

          <p>As he departed for a five-day tour of Asia, President Trump told reporters he is open to meeting with North Korean leader Kim Jong-un. The trip includes stops in Malaysia, Japan, and South Korea, where he is scheduled to hold high-stakes trade talks with Chinese President Xi Jinping to address their ongoing tariff war. While U.S. officials have downplayed the possibility, Trump's comments have fueled speculation of a potential fourth summit with Kim, stating he had a "great relationship" with the North Korean leader. The two last met in 2019, with talks stalling over denuclearization demands.</p>
