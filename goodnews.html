          <p>Hainan, China‚Äôs southernmost island province, is becoming a hub for experimental medical treatments, allowing patients to access therapies still in clinical trials. Lecheng, a special medical zone on Hainan, is home to over 30 state-of-the-art hospitals where patients can receive cutting-edge treatments like stem cell therapies and gene therapies. One example is a woman with early-stage lung cancer receiving the LK101 injection, a personalized mRNA vaccine designed to reduce the risk of relapse. These hospitals offer modern facilities, a stark contrast to the crowded wards typical of mainland public hospitals.</p>

          <p>Under new government plans, developers who leave housing sites unfinished for years could have their land transferred to local councils to accelerate the construction of new homes. Housebuilders will be required to commit to delivery time frames before obtaining planning permission and submit annual progress reports to councils. The government aims to build 1.5 million new homes in England by 2029 as part of its plan to address the housing crisis. Developers who repeatedly fail to meet targets may face penalties and be denied future permissions.</p>

          <p>Scientists have captured unprecedented images of the USS F-1, a World War I-era submarine that sank off the coast of California in 1917, killing 19 crew members. The high-definition pictures were taken using advanced deep-sea imaging technology during an expedition earlier this year. The USS F-1 collided with its sister ship during training exercises and sank rapidly. The team also captured images of a U.S. Navy Avenger torpedo bomber that crashed near the same area in 1950. After the dives, a remembrance ceremony was held on board Atlantis, honoring the lost crew members.</p>
