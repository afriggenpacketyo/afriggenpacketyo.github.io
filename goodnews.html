          <h2>China's Exports Surge Despite U.S. Tariffs Due to Increased Shipments to Southeast Asia</h2>
          <div class="timestamp">2025-05-09 00:22:32 EDT</div>
        </div>
        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>China's exports increased by 8.1% in April, driven by a rise in shipments to Southeast Asian countries, which offset a decline in exports to the U.S. due to tariffs. Imports, however, slightly decreased, highlighting the challenge of reviving domestic demand. While exports to the U.S. fell significantly, those to ASEAN surged, and exports to the EU also rose. Analysts suggest the surge in exports may be partly due to transshipment through third countries and contracts signed before the tariffs were announced. Relevant context: The U.S. has imposed tariffs on all imports from China, leading to retaliatory measures from China, although both sides have granted exemptions on certain products.</p>

          <div class="timestamp">2025-05-09 00:15:17 EDT</div>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>The United States and the United Kingdom have announced a new trade agreement aimed at reducing tariffs and boosting trade between the two countries. The deal, hailed as "historic" by both President Trump and Prime Minister Starmer, seeks to eliminate or reduce some of the tariffs imposed by the U.S. The agreement includes concessions on car and steel exports for the UK, but a flat 10% levy on most goods remains. The Daily Telegraph claims the pact includes a clause allowing the US to object to Chinese firms investing in Britain, but a government spokesperson has dismissed the claim as "nonsense".</p>

          <p>President Trump announced the broad terms of a trade deal with Britain, which could lower the burden of his sweeping tariffs. The deal is the first rolled out in Mr. Trump's second term and comes as the president has used tariffs as leverage to bring other countries to the table to negotiate trade deals with his administration. The 10% tariff imposed on U.K. imports remains in place, but the first 100,000 vehicles imported into the U.S. by British automakers each year are subject to that 10% rate, and additional vehicles will face 25% rates, according to the White House. The commerce secretary said the deal will raise $6 billion in revenue for the U.S. as a result of the 10% tariff on imports from the U.K.</p>

          <p>China's exports grew by 8.1% year on year in April, defying US President Donald Trump‚Äôs tariff increases. The figure beat market expectations and followed a 12.4% rise in March. The damage of the US tariffs has not showed up in the trade data in April, which may be partly due to transshipment through other countries, and partly because of trade contracts that were signed before the tariffs were announced. Trump has slapped tariffs of up to 145 per cent on a wide range of Chinese imports so far this year. In retaliation, China imposed duties of up to 125 per cent on American goods.</p>

          <p>A Southern California Edison transmission tower, being removed as part of the Eaton fire investigation, was damaged when it came into contact with power lines during a helicopter lift. The damage occurred as the top portion of the tower was being lifted. No injuries were reported, but the extent of the damage and its impact on the investigation are still being assessed. The tower was one of two being removed for testing to determine the cause of the fire. Relevant context: The Eaton fire caused significant damage, and the investigation aims to determine if faulty equipment was responsible.</p>

        </div>
        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Analysts are assessing the impact of the US-UK trade deal, with limited details offered so far. The 10% import tax on most UK goods remains in place, while the White House agreed to walk back some import taxes on strategic sectors like cars and steel. In exchange, the White House said it had won changes that would expand opportunities for sales of American beef, ethanol and other agricultural products in the UK. Despite progress, goods from the UK are still facing higher tariffs than they were a few weeks ago.</p>
