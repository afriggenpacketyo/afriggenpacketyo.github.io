          <h2>Palantir Shares Decline Amid International Growth Concerns Despite Revenue Beat</h2>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Palantir's stock experienced a significant drop despite exceeding revenue expectations and raising its full-year guidance, due to concerns over slowing international revenue growth. CEO Alex Karp defended the company's performance, stating that Palantir is happy with its position and partnerships, and that investors are welcome to join or not. Analysts attributed the stock's decline to the company's high software multiple making it susceptible to compression as growth slows. The company reported adjusted earnings of 13 cents per share on $884 million in revenue, a 39% increase from the previous year.</p>

          <p>North Dakota has reported its first measles case since 2011, involving an unvaccinated child who may have contracted the virus from an out-of-state visitor.

The BMA union, representing Scotland's doctors, expressed skepticism that the extra appointments would resolve the core issues, citing funding shortfalls and staffing challenges. Swinney also highlighted his government's commitment to tackling child poverty and stimulating the economy through a six-point export plan.</p>

Economists project that the Fed is likely to cut rates at its July 30 meeting, but some expect the central bank to hold off even longer.

          <p>LAFC and Club Am√©rica will compete for the final spot in the FIFA Club World Cup after the Court of Arbitration for Sport (TAS) ruled that Le√≥n violated FIFA's multi-ownership rules. The winner will join Chelsea, Flamengo, and ES Tunis in Group D, with a potential value of nearly $10 million for participating in the tournament. Le√≥n argued that the rules were imposed after they earned their spot by defeating LAFC in the 2023 CONCACAF Champions League final, but the TAS determined that Le√≥n and Pachuca FC are owned by the same entity.</p>

          <p>Canadian Prime Minister Mark Carney emphatically rejected President Trump's suggestion of Canada becoming the 51st state during an Oval Office meeting. Carney stated that Canada is "not for sale" and "won't be for sale, ever," emphasizing the importance of partnership. Mr. Trump said he and Carney wouldn't be discussing the U.S. acquiring Canada unless "somebody wants to discuss it," but said there would be "tremendous" benefits to Canada in the event of a "wonderful marriage" between the two countries.</p>
