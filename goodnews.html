        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>A panel of journalists has analyzed the recently brokered peace agreement between Israel and Hamas, suggesting that former President Donald Trump was a pivotal figure in its realization. According to Jonathan Karl of ABC News, Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu, who has long prided himself on understanding American politics, recognized his fundamental need for U.S. support. This context made him susceptible to pressure from Trump, ultimately leading to the historic deal to end the war in Gaza. The discussion highlights the significant influence of American political dynamics on the Middle East conflict.</p>

          <p>Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy reported having a "very productive" phone call with U.S. President Donald Trump, urging him to apply his recent Middle East peacemaking success to the war in Ukraine. Zelenskyy stated he informed Trump about Russia's recent attacks on Ukraine's energy infrastructure and discussed opportunities to strengthen air defense. This conversation marks a significant warming of relations between the two leaders, who previously had a contentious televised meeting. Trump has recently expressed support for Ukraine's ability to win back its territory from Russia.</p>

          <p>Jack Wilshere, the former Arsenal and England midfielder, is reportedly the leading choice to become the new manager of Luton Town. The 33-year-old has engaged in talks with the club's board and is considered the frontrunner for the position, which became vacant after the dismissal of Matt Bloomfield. While a final deal has not yet been signed, Wilshere is in a strong position to secure the job. His most recent coaching experience was as an interim coach for Norwich City at the end of last season.</p>

          <p>A growing number of Australian soccer players are moving to Major League Soccer (MLS) in North America to advance their careers and national team prospects. The article profiles several players and coaches who have found success in the league, highlighting it as a high-quality alternative to European football that is increasingly on the radar of Australia's national team selectors. Players like Patrick Yazbek of Nashville SC note that the league's quality is often underestimated in Australia. The trend reflects a shift in MLS transfer strategy, which now includes developing younger international talent for profit.</p>

          <p>Independent movie theaters are adapting to challenges from streaming services and high ticket prices by embracing creative business models to foster community. The article highlights examples like filmmaker Kevin Smith's non-profit Smodcastle Cinemas in New Jersey, which hosts special events, and Vidiots in Los Angeles, which combines a theater with an extensive video store. New York's for-profit Metrograph has found success by integrating a bookstore, restaurant, and streaming service.

          <p>As part of the U.S.-brokered ceasefire deal, Hamas is insisting that Israel include prominent Palestinian figures, such as Marwan Barghouti and Ahmad Saadat, in the upcoming prisoner exchange. Israel's justice ministry published a list of 250 prisoners to be freed but excluded these high-profile names, creating a potential sticking point in the negotiations. The exchange is a key component of the first phase of the deal, which will also see the release of 20 Israeli hostages from Gaza. The agreement aims to end the two-year war.</p>

          <p>With gold prices surging above $4,000 an ounce, financial commentator Jim Cramer has pointed to Agnico Eagle Mines as a company well-positioned to benefit. He noted that while gold itself is up 54% for the year, shares in the mining company have risen by 117%. Cramer attributed this performance to the company's low-cost mines that are scheduled to become operational soon. He suggested that as long as gold prices remain elevated, the company could see significant profits. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>The Welsh political party Plaid Cymru has announced a plan to offer trainee teachers up to £30,000 in incentive payments if they win the next Senedd election. The policy is designed to address a teacher recruitment crisis and prevent educators from leaving for better financial offers in England. The payments would focus on priority subjects like math and science, as well as on teachers who can work in the Welsh medium. To receive the full amount, recipients would be required to work in Wales for five years after completing their training.</p>

          <h2>Exploring How to Productively Engage with the Emotion of Regret</h2>
          <div class="timestamp">2025-10-11 09:00:00 EDT</div>
        </div>
        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>This article collection from The Atlantic explores the complex emotion of regret, positing it as an unavoidable consequence of having free will. Rather than adhering to a "no regrets" philosophy, which can be a form of denial, the pieces suggest that regret can be a useful tool for self-discovery. By allowing oneself to feel the sadness or disappointment associated with past decisions, it is possible to learn valuable lessons about one's present self. The goal is to transform regret from a backward-looking fixation into a forward-looking opportunity for growth.</p>
