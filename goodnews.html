          <p>Shares of Hang Seng Bank surged by nearly 30% after its parent company, HSBC, announced a proposal to take the Hong Kong-based lender private in a deal valued at over $37 billion. HSBC, which already owns about 63% of Hang Seng, offered to buy the remaining shares at a 33% premium over the recent average price. The move is part of HSBC's strategy to grow its presence in Hong Kong, which it views as a critical financial hub and a "super-connector" to mainland China. While HSBC's own shares declined, analysts see the privatization as a positive step to resolve governance issues. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>UK Prime Minister Keir Starmer met with his Indian counterpart, Narendra Modi, in Mumbai during his first official visit to India, aimed at expanding trade and business relations. The meeting follows the signing of a landmark UK-India trade deal in July, which is projected to significantly boost trade and create thousands of jobs in the UK. During the visit, Starmer announced that three Bollywood films would be produced in the UK, signaling strengthening cultural ties. Despite the positive engagement, Starmer confirmed that the UK would not relax its visa rules for India, a point of ongoing discussion between the two nations.</p>

          <p>Chinese Foreign Minister Wang Yi promoted China's market as a prime opportunity for Italian investors during a visit to Italy, emphasizing that cultural and institutional differences should not hinder cooperation. The visit is part of Beijing's efforts to strengthen trade relationships with key European Union members as tensions with the bloc persist. Wang's diplomatic outreach comes as the EU proposes new measures to protect its steel industry from what it describes as overcapacity originating from China. He stressed the importance of mutual understanding and support for each other's core interests to foster a stronger economic partnership.</p>

          <p>Scotland's national football team has a clear path to potentially securing a World Cup play-off spot by the end of the week, depending on the results of two crucial home qualifiers. After a strong start to their campaign, victories against Greece and Belarus at Hampden Park would elevate their points total to ten. This outcome would guarantee at least a second-place finish in their group for the October window. If Greece also loses its subsequent match against Denmark, Scotland's place in the play-offs would be confirmed, marking a significant step towards qualifying for their first World Cup since 1998.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>The newly announced ceasefire and hostage deal between Israel and Hamas represents a significant diplomatic victory and a crucial step toward ending the two-year war, though formidable obstacles to a permanent peace remain. The personal intervention of U.S. President Donald Trump was a key factor in pressuring both sides to reach an agreement for the release of hostages and Palestinian prisoners. However, the deal's first phase does not address core issues such as the disarmament of Hamas, the extent of an Israeli withdrawal, or a long-term plan for governing Gaza. Israeli Prime Minister Netanyahu faces political pressure from ultranationalist coalition partners who oppose the deal.</p>

          <p>China has launched a pioneering thermal power station in the Gobi Desert, the first in the world to use a dual-tower design feeding a single turbine. The plant utilizes nearly 27,000 mirrors to concentrate sunlight onto two 200-meter towers, heating molten salt to 570 degrees Celsius to create steam and generate power. This innovative configuration allows one tower to capture morning sun and the other to capture afternoon sun, increasing efficiency by about 25% compared to single-tower designs. The system can store heat to provide a continuous power supply even after sunset, marking a significant advancement in renewable energy technology.</p>

          <p>Citigroup's venture capital arm has invested in BVNK, a company that provides infrastructure for stablecoin transactions, signaling growing interest from major U.S. banks in digital assets. BVNK's technology acts as a payment rail for converting fiat currency to stablecoins, which are cryptocurrencies pegged to real-world assets, facilitating faster and cheaper cross-border payments. The investment comes as the U.S. implements clearer regulations like the GENIUS Act, which has spurred demand and innovation in the stablecoin market. This move places Citi alongside other financial giants like JPMorgan Chase and BNY Mellon, who are also exploring tokenization and crypto services. (not investment advice)</p>

The new regulator aims to ensure the financial stability of clubs and protect them from irresponsible ownership, which has led to several clubs facing collapse.

          <p>For the first time, the Norwegian Nobel Committee has allowed media a glimpse into its secretive deliberation process as it prepares to announce this year's Peace Prize winner. The decision comes amid an unprecedented public campaign by U.S. President Donald Trump, who has repeatedly stated he deserves the award for his diplomatic efforts, including the recent Gaza peace plan. While the committee chairman acknowledged the global attention, he affirmed their commitment to a principled, consensus-based decision free from external pressure. Experts note that nominations closed in January, making Trump a more likely contender next year if the Gaza deal holds.</p>

          <p>Construction workers at the Port of Long Beach discovered a World War II-era explosive device on Wednesday, prompting a temporary evacuation and a multi-agency response. The eight-decade-old shell was found at one of the port's container terminals, leading to the establishment of a safety perimeter by local police, fire departments, and the U.S. Coast Guard. A U.S. Marine Corps ordnance disposal team was called to the scene, where they determined the device was safe to transport. It was subsequently moved off-site and deactivated, allowing port operations to return to normal by Wednesday night.</p>

          <p>The recent agreement between Israel and Hamas on an initial peace plan marks a significant diplomatic achievement for President Donald Trump, who personally intervened to pressure both sides. By leveraging his relationships with regional allies like Qatar and Turkey, Trump compelled Hamas to agree to release its hostages upfront, a major concession. However, this first phase only addresses the hostage crisis and does not resolve the core drivers of the conflict, such as Hamas's military capabilities or the future of Gaza's governance. The president is now counting on the momentum from this deal and his own political capital to push the parties toward a more permanent end to the war.</p>
