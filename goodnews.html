        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Australia's economic growth in the first quarter of 2025 remained unchanged at 1.3% year-on-year, failing to meet the estimated 1.5% growth. The Australian Bureau of Statistics attributed the slow growth to reduced public spending, weak consumer demand, and decreased exports. Extreme weather events, such as mining disruptions, tourism declines, and shipping delays, also contributed to the economic slowdown. The Reserve Bank of Australia previously lowered interest rates to a two-year low in May, and anticipates a gradual recovery in consumption and public demand during 2025, but the recovery may be slower than initially expected due to global uncertainties.

          <p>Despite the common narrative that China has stolen millions of American jobs, particularly in manufacturing, an opposing viewpoint suggests that the "China shock" was beneficial for America. While acknowledging that some sectors experienced layoffs and regional manufacturing declined, the article argues that cheap Chinese goods have made life more affordable for the average American. The piece challenges the research from economists like David Autor, who claim the "China shock" harmed the U.S. labor market, suggesting a more nuanced perspective on the economic impact of trade with China. This challenges the anti-China sentiment often voiced by politicians and voters.</p>

          <p>Despite delivering strong quarterly results, CrowdStrike experienced a dip in after-hours trading due to mixed guidance, prompting analysts to raise the company's price target. The company's first-quarter revenue increased by 20% year-over-year, with adjusted earnings per share exceeding estimates. Management also announced a new $1 billion share repurchase authorization, and the company's CEO noted that the Falcon Flex subscription model is accelerating platform adoption. The analysts believe that the demand for cybersecurity will continue to grow, making CrowdStrike a critical expense for corporations. (not investment advice)</p>

Prosecutors now claim that Demetric Deshawn Scott, who is set to face trial for assaulting and robbing Morales-Reyes, wrote the letters to prevent him from testifying in the robbery case. Scott has been charged with witness intimidation, identity theft, and breach of bail, admitting that his intention was to prevent Morales-Reyes from testifying rather than to threaten the president. The Department of Homeland Security had previously announced Morales-Reyes's arrest and published a copy of the threatening letter.</p>

          <p>The spouse of a U.S. senator was placed on a government watchlist in 2023 after a surveillance program flagged his travel profile, but he was removed after the senator contacted administration officials. Senator Jeanne Shaheen spoke with the TSA about her husband, William Shaheen, who was then removed from the "Quiet Skies" list and placed on a "secure flight exclusion list," exempting him from future screening. The initial flagging occurred due to his travel companion being listed as a "known or suspected terrorist" by the FBI. The senator said she was unaware of her husband's monitoring or preferential treatment, and he has since been removed from the exclusion list.</p>
