          <p>Marks and Spencer has resumed online orders after suspending them in April due to a major cyberattack. Shoppers can now purchase fashion products for home delivery in England, Scotland, and Wales, with more products and services, including click and collect and deliveries to Northern Ireland, to be available soon. The retailer has been working to restore its services since the attack, which caused empty shelves and delivery delays. The return of online shopping is a significant step toward recovery for the company, which has faced challenges in restoring normalcy after the incident.</p>

          <p>Amid growing concerns about sabotage and espionage, Germany plans to increase its use of artificial intelligence in national security. Interior Minister Alexander Dobrindt stated that AI must be used more extensively in intelligence services to defend against hybrid threats, which are constantly increasing. The government acknowledges the growing number of attacks on infrastructure, including civilian facilities and military sites, and will allocate substantial financial resources to strengthen the defense mechanisms of Germany's security agencies. The move aims to enhance Germany's technical, legal, and organizational capabilities in the face of evolving threats.</p>

          <p>Japan plans to release an additional 200,000 tons of rice from government stockpiles to address elevated prices of the staple food, according to Farm Minister Shinjiro Koizumi. The released rice, consisting of 100,000 tons each from the 2020 and 2021 harvests, is expected to be sold at 1,700 yen per 5 kilograms. This move will reduce the country's rice reserve to around 100,000 tons, prompting concerns about emergency preparedness. The government aims to distribute the rice to smaller supermarket chains and specialty shops to lower prices for consumers.</p>

Complaints have been filed against both companies in the EU, and the bloc is preparing a new customs fee on small packages from online marketplaces. Consumer spending on Temu in the U.S. fell by about 36% in May, while Shein's fell by 13%, but both companies have seen growth in the EU and U.K. Temu and Shein are expanding their operations in Europe, including increasing warehouse capacity and digital ad spending, but face challenges due to stricter regulations on product safety and consumer protection.</p>

          <p>China is tapping into its 10.9 trillion yuan ($1.5 trillion) housing provident fund to support its struggling housing sector. This fund, a government savings program, offers an alternative to bank mortgages, providing loans at lower interest rates. The fund's importance is growing as banks become more cautious due to profit challenges, with outstanding mortgages reaching 8.1 trillion yuan last year. While this effort aims to ease financing needs for borrowers, some analysts remain skeptical that it will be sufficient to drive a full housing recovery, as it does not address the fundamental issue of demand shortage.

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Chinese exports to major industrial centers in Southeast Asia have risen significantly, driven by growing consumer markets and offshore factory investments, partly to offset losses from high US tariffs. Shipments to Vietnam increased by 18.8% from January to May, while exports to Thailand grew by 20.9%, and Indonesia saw a 16.8% increase. Analysts suggest that Chinese manufacturers are increasingly shipping to factory sites in Southeast Asia to produce finished goods for local sale or re-export to Western countries, including the US, potentially avoiding tariffs. These trends indicate a diversification of exports and closer economic ties between China and Southeast Asian countries.</p>
