          <p>One year after Labour's general election victory, the government is attempting to highlight its achievements while blaming the Conservatives for ongoing challenges. Examples include the handover of the Chagos Islands, where Labour claims the previous government failed to secure a deal, and prison overcrowding, attributed to Conservative underinvestment. The government is also considering mandatory chemical castration for sexual offenders and releasing new data on migration and public sector pay. Despite a difficult start marked by economic challenges and declining poll numbers, ministers aim to demonstrate delivery and regain popularity.</p>

          <p>India is facing challenges in trade negotiations with the United States, particularly concerning Apple's manufacturing. Despite India's efforts to attract Apple's production away from China, President Trump has suggested Apple should move its manufacturing to the United States instead. This demand has complicated negotiations, as India seeks a reduction in tariffs and recognition of its growing manufacturing capabilities. The article highlights the factors that have made India competitive in manufacturing, such as government support, lower labor costs, and the development of a local ecosystem.</p>
