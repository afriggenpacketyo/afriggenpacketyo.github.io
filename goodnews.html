          <p>Willie Eugene Sims, 69, has been charged with the 1977 murder of Jeannette Ralston in San Jose, California, nearly five decades after her death. Ralston, a young mother, was found strangled in her car after telling friends she would be back in 10 minutes, marking the beginning of a long cold case. The break came when an upgraded F.B.I. fingerprint database matched Sims' thumbprint on a cigarette carton found in the victim's car. Further investigation revealed Sims' past conviction for assault to commit murder and robbery, and his DNA matched evidence found on Ralston's body, bringing closure to her family after years of uncertainty.</p>

          <p>Fulham Football Club has opened its new Riverside Stand, an eight-tier hospitality section featuring Michelin star menus and a rooftop swimming pool, aiming to provide the 'best stand in the world'. The stand, part of Craven Cottage, prioritizes a high-end experience similar to a five-star hotel or cruise ship, focusing on views of the River Thames rather than the pitch. The rooftop pool offers an experience separate from the football match itself. The stand will operate as a private members' club on non-matchdays, targeting local residents in the wealthy west London area, combining heritage with modern luxury.</p>
