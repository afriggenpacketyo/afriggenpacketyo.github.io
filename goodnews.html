          <p>Homeowners with 100% home equity have attractive borrowing options like home equity loans and HELOCs, offering lower interest rates compared to personal loans and credit cards. Having 100% equity means the home is fully owned without a mortgage balance, though lenders typically allow borrowing only 80-90% of the home's value. HELOCs offer variable rates that could decrease with potential interest rate cuts, while home equity loans provide a lump sum with fixed rates. The article provides context of both products' pros and cons, and stresses the importance of careful evaluation before borrowing.</p>
