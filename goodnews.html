          <p>Despite ongoing trade tensions initiated by the Trump administration, China experienced a net capital inflow of US$17.3 billion into its bond and equities markets in April. This contrasts with market concerns over rising Treasury yields and Moody's downgrade of the US sovereign credit rating. Analysts suggest this shift indicates changing global investment dynamics, with investors moving away from US dollar assets since the trade war began. Bank of America analysts noted that a weaker US dollar, peaking US bond yields, and China's economic recovery are favorable for emerging markets. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>Contemporary Amperex Technology Co Limited (CATL), the world's largest electric vehicle (EV) battery maker, saw its shares jump over 10% during its Hong Kong Stock Exchange debut, marking the biggest IPO of the year. The company raised almost HK$35.7 billion (approximately $4.55 billion) from the listing, with funds intended to support the construction of its factory in Hungary. Despite concerns raised by US lawmakers regarding national security risks and past revenue declines, CATL continues to invest heavily in new battery technology, including fast-charging capabilities and partnerships with major automakers like Tesla and Stellantis.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Shares of Contemporary Amperex Technology (CATL), the world's largest battery manufacturer, rose significantly in their Hong Kong trading debut. The company's IPO raised HK$35.7 billion ($4.6 billion), reportedly the largest global listing in 2025, and will fund a new factory in Hungary to supply batteries to European automotive clients. CATL's expansion aligns with the global push for electric vehicles, although the company faces challenges including tariffs and scrutiny over potential links to China's military. Despite a revenue drop in 2024 due to competition, CATL's net profit increased, reflecting its strong position in the EV market.</p>

          <p>The Japanese government is initiating offshore "blue carbon" research to capture carbon dioxide through cultivated sea plants and store it in the deep sea. The goal is to leverage marine vegetation like mangroves and kelp, which absorb and store more carbon than terrestrial vegetation, to help achieve net-zero emissions by 2050. The Environment Ministry will commission studies to assess the behavior of seaweed at significant depths and the environmental impact of such projects. Japan aims to capture 1 million tons of CO2 by fiscal 2035 and 2 million tons by fiscal 2040 through blue carbon initiatives.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>China's central bank reduced its key lending rates by 10 basis points, marking the first rate cut since October, as Beijing intensifies efforts to bolster its economy. The move saw the 1-year loan prime rate lowered to 3.0% and the 5-year LPR to 3.5%. These rate cuts are part of a broader stimulus package that includes reductions to the lending rates and the amount of cash that banks must hold in reserves. The Chinese offshore yuan has stabilized due to a weakening U.S. dollar, leading analysts to revise targets for the currency.</p>

          <p>A new UK-EU deal, aimed at easing trade frictions, underscores the continuing complex relationship between the UK and its nearest neighbors. While the government touts improvements in trading ties, some Brexiteers criticize the acceptance of "dynamic alignment" with EU rules, trading some power for easier trade. The agreement's details, including costs, defense cooperation, youth travel, and professional qualification recognition, remain to be sorted. This summit is planned as the first of many, reflecting the permanent nature of the UK's uneasy relationship with the EU, regardless of membership.</p>

          <p>The Woods, a West Hollywood cannabis dispensary co-owned by actor Woody Harrelson and comedian Bill Maher, was burglarized early Saturday morning. Five individuals broke the front window and stole cannabis products before fleeing in a black sedan.

The Woods features a cannabis consumption lounge, a bar with cannabis-infused drinks, and an outdoor garden. The break-in occurred two days after a suspected attempted burglary at another dispensary co-founded by the same owners.</p>

He started the run in Perth and finished at Bondi Beach, dedicating the journey to his late mother, who died from cancer. Goodge ran approximately 100km daily, facing challenges such as toenail loss and hallucinations. The run raised money for cancer charities in the UK, US, and Australia. Along the way, Goodge saw much of Australia's countryside, as well as most of its animals, though most were dead on the road.</p>
