          <p>Scott Swift, the 73-year-old father of pop superstar Taylor Swift, is reportedly recovering well after undergoing quintuple bypass surgery over a month ago. A representative for the singer confirmed that the procedure was not the result of a heart attack and that he is "doing fantastic." His wife, Andrea, and children, Taylor and Austin, have been by his side during his recovery. This health scare follows the family's previous experiences with serious illness, including Andrea Swift's battles with cancer and a brain tumor, which Taylor has spoken about publicly as a significant challenge for their family.</p>

          <p>A new experimental weight loss drug developed by Chinese drugmaker Hengrui Pharma has shown promising results in a late-stage trial, positioning it as a potential competitor to popular treatments like Zepbound. The weekly injection, HRS9531, helped patients lose nearly 18% of their body weight on average over 48 weeks, with no plateau in weight loss observed. The drug works similarly to Zepbound by targeting both GLP-1 and GIP hormones. While global studies are still needed, the strong performance in the Chinese trial signals growing competition in the lucrative global market for obesity treatments.</p>

          <div class="timestamp">2025-07-16 13:17:48 EDT</div>
        </div>
        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Morgan Stanley reported second-quarter earnings that exceeded Wall Street expectations, driven by strong performance in its trading and wealth management divisions. The bank's net income rose 13% to $3.5 billion, with revenue increasing 12% to $16.79 billion. The institutional securities unit saw a boost from higher client activity, particularly in equity trading, while the wealth management segment delivered robust revenues from higher asset management fees. CEO Ted Pick highlighted the consistent earnings as a reflection of strong performance across different market environments, even as the company's stock saw a slight dip following the announcement.

          <p>U.S. Central Command announced that its Yemeni partners, the National Resistance Forces, have intercepted the largest-ever shipment of advanced Iranian weapons intended for Houthi rebels. The seizure totaled over 750 tons of munitions, including hundreds of advanced cruise, anti-ship, and anti-aircraft missiles, as well as drone components and radar systems. Many of the systems were reportedly manufactured by a sanctioned company linked to Iran's Ministry of Defense. CENTCOM praised the operation, stating that limiting the flow of Iranian support to the Houthis is critical for regional security and freedom of navigation.</p>

          <p>After 80 years, the family of U.S. Army Air Corps Staff Sgt. Michael Musashe, who went missing during World War II, has been reunited with his inscribed Zippo lighter. The reunion was made possible after a relative saw the lighter, which had been acquired by a Swiss collector, in a Facebook post. The Defense POW/MIA Accounting Agency helped facilitate the return of the memento. The airman's 95-year-old sister, Virginia Zoller, who last saw her brother in 7th grade, was overcome with emotion, clutching the lighter as if hugging him and fulfilling a promise to kiss it upon his return.</p>

          <p>Following a court ruling that blocked a federal rule to automatically wipe medical debt from credit reports, consumers are being advised on alternative ways to manage this financial burden. Experts suggest several strategies, including disputing incorrect or unverifiable debts with credit bureaus, which must be investigated within 30 days. Other options include negotiating a debt settlement with collection agencies, applying for financial assistance or forgiveness programs offered by many hospitals, or using a debt management plan through a credit counseling agency. Consumers should also verify that any medical collection under $500 has been removed, per existing credit bureau policies.</p>

          <p>Director James Gunn revealed that the central theme of his new "Superman" movie, which topped the box office with a $122 million domestic debut, is "kindness in a world that isn't kind." He emphasized the character's immigrant story, created by the children of immigrants, as a core part of his identity. The film portrays a more human, vulnerable Superman to create a more balanced universe of characters. Gunn also highlighted the dynamic between Superman's value of life and Lois Lane's value of truth, creating a central tension that explores how these ideals can sometimes conflict.</p>

          <p>The cryptocurrency market saw a rebound, with Bitcoin and Ether prices rising, following a temporary setback in the U.S. House for key crypto legislation. Investor optimism was renewed after President Trump indicated that Republican holdouts would now support advancing the bills, including the GENIUS Act for stablecoins. The brief market dip was seen by some analysts as an overreaction, with the passage of regulation viewed as a matter of "when," not "if." This legislative progress is considered crucial for the industry's future, particularly for stablecoin issuers like Circle and the broader ecosystem supported by networks like Ethereum.

          <p>The U.S. Space Force is actively tracking global missile launches 24/7 from its operations center at Buckley Space Force Base in Colorado, providing a critical first line of defense. Guardians at the base monitor data from military satellites to detect heat signatures from launches anywhere in the world, from Yemen to Iran. This capability is foundational to President Trump's planned "Golden Dome" missile defense shield. Officials state that space is now a "highly contested" warfighting domain, with a primary focus on the "pacing threat" from China, which is rapidly expanding its satellite network and developing anti-satellite capabilities.</p>
