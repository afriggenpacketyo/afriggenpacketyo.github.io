          <p>Tropical Storm Iona has rapidly intensified to become the first hurricane of the season in the central Pacific Ocean. Currently a Category 1 storm, it is located hundreds of miles south-southeast of Hawaii and is not expected to pose a direct threat to the islands. Forecasters anticipate Iona will strengthen to a Category 2 hurricane before gradually weakening later in the week as it moves westward. This development follows an active season in the eastern Pacific, which has already seen several named storms.</p>

          <p>Real-life couple Dave Franco and Alison Brie are starring in the new body horror film "Together," which explores themes of codependency and troubled relationships. In an interview, they discussed how being married in reality aided their portrayal of a long-term couple who become physically and supernaturally intertwined. Franco noted the challenging 21-day shoot required intense intimacy, which their real connection facilitated. The film, which blends horror with dark comedy, is being praised for its unique and surprisingly romantic take on the genre.</p>

          <p>China's aviation regulator is surveying the country's airlines about their future fleet requirements, specifically asking about potential orders for Boeing jets. This move is being interpreted as a positive signal that could improve trade relations between Beijing and Washington. Boeing, which has often been caught in the middle of bilateral tensions, could be a major beneficiary if a broader trade thaw occurs. The survey follows a meeting between a senior Boeing executive and the head of China's Civil Aviation Administration to discuss expanding cooperation.</p>

          <p>A federal judge has denied a legal challenge that sought to force the Federal Reserve's Open Market Committee (FOMC) meetings to be open to the public. The lawsuit, filed by Azoria Capital, an investment fund led by a Donald Trump ally, argued the meetings should be subject to the federal "Sunshine Act." However, the judge ruled that the FOMC is not a government agency under the act's definition, upholding its long-standing practice of meeting privately. The judge also questioned if the lawsuit was a publicity stunt for the new fund. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>The article explains the "4% rule," a long-standing guideline for retirement planning that suggests withdrawing 4% of a portfolio annually will likely make it last for 30 years. When applied to annuities, this rule serves as a benchmark to evaluate if an annuity's guaranteed income stream offers a better value than a traditional withdrawal strategy. While an annuity might offer a higher initial payout and protection against outliving savings, it often lacks inflation adjustments and liquidity. The article suggests a hybrid approach can balance security with flexibility. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>The price of gold is holding steady as investors await the outcome of the Federal Reserve's July meeting, with expectations of an interest rate cut being very low. While lower rates historically boost gold prices, the metal has recently surged due to inflation and geopolitical concerns, overriding the traditional relationship. Analysts suggest that while a rate change is unlikely this week, comments from the Fed or future inflation data could still influence the market. With gold currently priced below its recent highs, some investors may see this as a strategic time to buy. (not investment advice)</p>
