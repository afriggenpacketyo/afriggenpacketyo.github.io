          <p>Tim Friede, who has allowed himself to be bitten by venomous snakes over 200 times, may hold the key to developing a universal antivenom. Over decades, Friede has gradually built up immunity to various snake venoms, prompting researchers to study his blood for potential medical applications. The World Health Organization estimates that venomous snake bites affect millions annually, resulting in tens of thousands of deaths and disabilities. Researchers aim to synthesize a treatment from Friede's antibodies that could neutralize toxins from multiple snake species, offering a more effective and accessible solution for envenomation.</p>

          <p>Thames Water has paused its scheme to pay out large bonuses to senior executives linked to securing its ¬£3bn rescue loan, following public and governmental criticism. The company's "retention scheme" was set to amount to 50% of senior bosses' pay packets, potentially leading to ¬£1m payouts on top of their annual salaries and regular bonuses. Downing Street stated that rewarding themselves for failure is unacceptable, and the regulator Ofwat may introduce new rules to prevent water firms from handing out bonuses.
