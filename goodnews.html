        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>A growing number of young Japanese workers are 'quiet quitting,' prioritizing work-life balance over career advancement and higher pay. A study shows that nearly half of Japanese workers are doing the bare minimum, with those in their 20s being the most likely to admit it. This shift is attributed to a desire for more 'me time,' disillusionment with traditional corporate sacrifices, and the impact of the coronavirus pandemic. Experts see this trend as a positive change, moving away from the 'karoshi' culture of death by overwork.</p>

          <p>The Los Angeles Dodgers defeated the New York Mets in 13 innings, winning 7-5, but faced pitching staff challenges during the game.

Teoscar Hern√°ndez's RBI double in the 13th inning ultimately secured the win for the Dodgers. This victory, however, could have future repercussions for an already stretched pitching staff during a tough stretch of the schedule.</p>

          <p>China has officially approved a 767-kilometer canal project linking the resource-rich province of Jiangxi to the wealthy province of Zhejiang. The canal is part of a mega-project aimed at connecting Guangdong, Jiangxi, and Zhejiang by water. The Jiangxi-Zhejiang Canal is expected to become the most expensive artificial canal ever built in China, with an estimated investment of 320 billion yuan. The project aims to lower logistical costs and integrate less-developed inland regions with wealthier coastal hubs.</p>
