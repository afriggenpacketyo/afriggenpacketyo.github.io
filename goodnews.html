          <p>The Canadian government has withdrawn its planned digital services tax on U.S. technology companies, prompting the resumption of trade talks with the United States. The move came after President Trump suspended negotiations, calling the tax a "direct and blatant attack." Prime Minister Mark Carney's office confirmed that he and Trump agreed to restart negotiations following a phone call. While the decision is aimed at advancing a new economic and security relationship, some analysts view it as a significant concession to U.S. pressure, potentially making the Canadian government appear vulnerable.

          <p>Germany's Foreign Minister, Johann Wadephul, made an unannounced visit to Kyiv to underscore Germany's unwavering support for Ukraine in its ongoing conflict with Russia. During his visit, Wadephul condemned Russia's actions and pledged continued German assistance, including modern air defense systems and other crucial aid. As Ukraine's second-largest supporter after the United States, Germany's commitment is particularly significant as Europe attempts to compensate for uncertainty in U.S. aid.

          <p>President Donald Trump has announced that he has a group of "very wealthy people" prepared to purchase the U.S. operations of TikTok. This development follows a 2024 law requiring the app's Chinese owner, ByteDance, to divest due to national security concerns over data privacy and content manipulation. Trump recently extended the deadline for the sale to September 17, his third extension since the law was upheld by the Supreme Court. While potential buyers have previously expressed interest, any deal would likely require approval from the Chinese government, making the platform's future uncertain.</p>

          <p>China has announced a conditional resumption of seafood imports from certain regions of Japan, partially lifting a ban that was imposed in 2023. The prohibition was enacted after Japan began releasing treated wastewater from the damaged Fukushima nuclear power plant. However, the ban will remain in effect for ten prefectures, including Fukushima, Tokyo, and surrounding areas. This move represents a slight easing of tensions between the two nations, though the core dispute over the safety of Japanese aquatic products continues to be a point of diplomatic friction.</p>

          <p>A new trade deal between the United Kingdom and the United States has kicked in, reducing a 25% tariff on British cars to 10% and prompting manufacturers like Aston Martin and JLR to resume shipments. The auto industry had been hit hard by the tariff, with exports down significantly. However, the deal has been criticized by British farmers, who argue that agriculture was used as a bargaining chip. Concessions on tariff-free beef quotas and the removal of tariffs on American ethanol have left the UK's farming and biofuel sectors feeling disadvantaged. (not investment advice)</p>

        </div>
        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Recent studies suggest that electric vehicles (EVs) are more likely to induce motion sickness than conventional cars due to their unique performance characteristics. Researchers have identified the rapid acceleration and deceleration, particularly the low-frequency slowing caused by regenerative braking systems, as key factors. This function, which recharges the battery by converting kinetic energy, can provoke queasiness and discomfort in passengers. As EVs become more prevalent, especially in markets like China, addressing this issue is becoming a more significant concern for automotive engineers and manufacturers aiming to improve passenger comfort.</p>
