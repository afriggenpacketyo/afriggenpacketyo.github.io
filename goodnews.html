          <p>A recent study indicates that music therapy is as effective as cognitive behavioral therapy in managing symptoms and anxieties associated with cancer. The therapy involves trained therapists helping patients express their emotions through talk, music, and lyrical composition. With the increasing number of cancer survivors, there is a growing need for varied therapies to improve their quality of life. Music therapy provides a unique way for patients to process emotions and find healing through creative expression, with patients actively creating something beautiful coming from their cancer, in order to heal.</p>

          <p>A new drug, Vykat XR, has been approved for treating Prader-Willi syndrome, a rare genetic disorder characterized by insatiable hunger. The drug eases relentless hunger and may offer insights into the biology of extreme appetite and binge eating. This breakthrough comes as other drugs are revolutionizing how doctors treat obesity, which affects more than 40% of American adults. However, researchers express concern that efforts to understand and treat obesity's many causes are now in question as the Trump administration is dismantling the nation's infrastructure for medical discovery.</p>
