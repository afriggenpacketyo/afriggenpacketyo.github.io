          <p>Amazon Web Services is enhancing its Graviton4 chip with increased network bandwidth, aiming to provide a cost-effective alternative to Nvidia's GPUs for AI training. AWS has invested significantly in Anthropic, building an AI supercomputer called Project Rainier to support the startup's Claude Opus 4 AI model using Trainium2 GPUs. This move signifies AWS's commitment to reducing AI training costs and competing directly with established semiconductor players. The Graviton4 chip, developed by Amazon's Annapurna Labs, showcases the success of the company's custom chip strategy, positioning it as a strong contender in the AI infrastructure space. The development of these chips provides companies with more options when it comes to building out their AI infrastructure.</p>

          <p>The Senate has approved the GENIUS Act, a bill establishing federal regulations for U.S. dollar-pegged stablecoins, marking a legislative milestone for the crypto industry. The act sets guardrails including full reserve backing, monthly audits, and anti-money laundering compliance, and grants authority to the Treasury Secretary to oversee the market. The bill now proceeds to the House, where reconciliation with their version, STABLE, will be necessary, focusing on differing regulatory authorities. The GENIUS Act's passage represents a turning point for the digital asset industry and President Trump's crypto ventures, though it restricts non-financial Big Tech companies from directly issuing stablecoins.

          <p>Members of Parliament in England and Wales have voted to decriminalize abortion for women, marking the most significant change to abortion laws in nearly 60 years. The law will still penalize those who assist a woman in obtaining an abortion outside the current legal framework. Women who terminate pregnancies outside the rules, such as after 24 weeks, will no longer face police investigation. The amendment, put forward by Labour MP Tonia Antoniazzi, won support from 379 MPs, with 137 against, highlighting a significant shift in attitudes toward abortion.</p>

          <p>Jane Dorotik's conviction for the 2001 murder of her husband Bob has been overturned after she spent two decades in prison, fighting for her freedom. New testing of evidence, conducted with Loyola Project for the Innocent, revealed inconsistencies and questionable practices in the original investigation. Notably, foreign male DNA was found on several items, and not all blood-like stains in the bedroom were tested or confirmed to be blood. While the DA's office initially decided to retry her, the charges were ultimately dropped, allowing her to rebuild her life.</p>
