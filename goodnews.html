          <p>Tesla has applied for permits to test and deploy its Robotaxi service in Phoenix, Arizona, a market currently dominated by its rival, Waymo. This expansion follows a pilot program in Austin, Texas, which has faced some operational issues and regulatory scrutiny from federal safety agencies. While Tesla aims to catch up in the autonomous vehicle space using a camera-based system, Alphabet's Waymo has been operating a public driverless service in the Phoenix area since 2020. A decision on Tesla's Arizona application is expected by the end of July.</p>

          <p>Varda, a startup focused on manufacturing pharmaceuticals in orbit, has raised $187 million in a Series C funding round led by Natural Capital and Shrug Capital. The company aims to leverage the unique microgravity environment of space to crystallize drugs that are difficult to produce on Earth. This new capital will help Varda increase its flight frequency and expand its biologics lab to identify more drug molecules suitable for in-space production. Varda has already completed three space launches and successfully returned a capsule containing the drug Ritonavir.</p>

          <p>Denim maker Levi Strauss has raised its full-year sales and earnings guidance after reporting stronger-than-expected second-quarter results. The company now anticipates revenue growth of 1% to 2%, a significant improvement from its previous forecast, driven by strong consumer demand and growth in direct-to-consumer sales. Levi's stated it is working to absorb some of the costs from higher tariffs imposed by the Trump administration, which currently affect a small portion of its manufacturing. However, the company acknowledged this could change as U.S. trade policy evolves with key manufacturing regions.</p>

          <p>The Department of Homeland Security has announced an end to the universal requirement for air travelers to remove their shoes at airport security checkpoints. The policy, in place for over two decades since the 2001 Richard Reid shoe-bomb attempt, had become a symbol of "security theater" for many. While the change is presented as a populist move that grants a convenience previously reserved for premium travelers, it was announced without a specific technological or intelligence breakthrough as justification. The article frames the decision as a form of spectacle, trading the appearance of vigilance for the appearance of public-friendly reform.</p>

          <p>A San Francisco judge has ruled that former CNN anchor Don Lemon's lawsuit against Elon Musk and his social media company, X, can proceed to trial. Lemon sued for breach of contract after X abruptly canceled a planned show partnership just hours after he conducted a tense interview with Musk. The judge found that Lemon's legal team had plausibly alleged claims including "fraud by false promise" and the existence of an implied contract. The case centers on Musk's actions following an interview where he was questioned on contentious topics and content moderation on the platform.</p>
