          <p>Following a recent interest rate cut by the Federal Reserve, the cost of borrowing through a Home Equity Line of Credit (HELOC) has decreased. The article provides specific monthly cost examples for an $80,000 line of credit, demonstrating that current payments are notably lower compared to previous months. It highlights the potential savings for homeowners but also advises them to carefully consider the variable interest rate of a HELOC against the predictability of a fixed-rate home equity loan before making a decision.

          <p>This article explains the "7-year rule" as defined by the Fair Credit Reporting Act, which mandates that most negative financial information, including delinquent credit card debt, must be removed from a consumer's credit report after seven years. It clarifies that while the removal of this information can significantly improve an individual's credit score, the underlying debt is not legally extinguished. The article also notes that the statute of limitations for lawsuits over debt varies by state and that making a payment can sometimes restart this legal clock.</p>

          <p>This article provides a detailed cost analysis for a $200,000 home equity loan in the wake of a recent interest rate reduction by the Federal Reserve. It calculates that monthly payments for such a loan currently range from approximately $1,936 to $2,463, depending on the term, which is slightly less expensive than in previous months. The article cautions that a loan of this magnitude is only advisable for homeowners who have significant equity and a stable financial situation, as their home serves as collateral.

          <p>The Trump administration has reached an agreement with pharmaceutical giant Pfizer to voluntarily lower the prices of certain prescription drugs for American consumers. Under the deal, Pfizer will also sell its medications to Medicaid at the lowest price offered in other developed countries and invest $70 billion in U.S.-based manufacturing. In return, Pfizer will receive a three-year exemption from potential pharmaceutical-specific tariffs, a policy the administration is using as leverage to compel other drugmakers to negotiate similar price reductions.</p>
