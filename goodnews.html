          <h2>Emotionally Safe Parenting: A New Approach to Raising Successful Children</h2>
          <div class="timestamp">2025-05-25 13:36:51 EDT</div>
        </div>
        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>An emerging parenting style known as "emotionally safe parenting" focuses on attuning to a child's emotional needs to build resilience, trust, and connection. This approach emphasizes open communication, acceptance of emotions without judgment, and seeing misbehavior as a signal for support rather than defiance. Emotionally safe parents prioritize self-awareness and inner healing to become less reactive, creating an environment where children feel safe expressing themselves. By setting boundaries with empathy and preventing shame, parents can foster a secure and supportive environment for their children to thrive.</p>

          <p>Tommy Paul won his first-round match at the French Open, but also discussed his recent experience of having his truck repossessed due to missed payments. Paul explained that he had changed banks and forgot to update his automatic payments for his Ford F-150, resulting in three missed payments and the vehicle being taken. He discovered the repossession when his trainer asked him to check his security camera footage, which revealed a tow truck taking his car. Paul was able to regain possession of the truck, finding humor in the situation.</p>

          <p>Jim Cramer addresses the debate between investing in U.S. and European stocks, acknowledging the recent underperformance of the U.S. market compared to Europe due to factors like Trump's tariffs and Moody's downgrade. Despite this, Cramer and his team emphasize the stronger long-term returns of the S&P 500 and the international exposure already provided by many U.S. companies. While recognizing opportunities in European markets, Cramer advises against a "sell America" trade and suggests a more selective approach, focusing on domestic companies with pricing power and low credit risk.
