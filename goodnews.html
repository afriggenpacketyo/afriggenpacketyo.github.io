          <p>Apple is underperforming compared to other tech stocks, raising questions about its traditional role as a safe haven during market volatility. While the broader tech sector has rebounded strongly, Apple is trading below its key moving averages. Investors have largely been buying broad market indexes, which inherently include a significant weighting in tech. Despite Apple's recent struggles, experts suggest investors are diversifying into more traditional defensive sectors and that the market is adapting to higher volatility. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>US Soccer is constructing a new National Training Center (NTC) in Atlanta, aiming to create a world-class facility ready for the men's World Cup next year. Funded in part by Arthur M. Blank, the project seeks to consolidate the training of all 27 national teams in one central hub, eliminating the need to source different locations for each international break. Inspired by European training centers like St George's Park, the NTC will feature multiple pitches, indoor facilities, and locker rooms, and the center aims to foster connections between youth and senior players, and the facility is anticipated to boost the local economy by relocating staff from Chicago. The goal is to establish a heartbeat for the sport, encompassing coaching education and referee certification.</p>

          <p>Hideo Kojima's 'Death Stranding 2' casts players as delivery couriers in a post-apocalyptic world, navigating treacherous landscapes to connect isolated communities. The game delves into themes of digital alienation and technological dependence, questioning whether technology truly brings people closer or erodes human intimacy. Players make deliveries on foot, eventually gaining access to vehicles and infrastructure built by other players, creating a metaphor for interconnected society. Ultimately, the game argues that virtual life is no replacement for physicality and emphasizes the importance of physical bonds in a transient world.</p>

          <p>The percentage of children in Germany growing up in large families (three or more children) has increased in recent years, primarily due to immigration since 2015, according to the Federal Statistical Office (Destatis). Families with a migration background are nearly twice as likely to have three or more children compared to families without foreign roots. In 2024, 19% of migrant families had at least three children, compared to around 10% of other families, and larger families are slightly more common in western Germany than in eastern Germany.</p>
