        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>The Trump administration has announced a significant trade deal with Japan, which reportedly includes setting a 15% tariff on Japanese exports to the U.S., including a reduction for auto imports from the current 25%. The agreement is said to involve a $550 billion investment from Japan into the United States, with the goal of creating hundreds of thousands of jobs. The announcement prompted a surge in Japanese markets, particularly for major auto manufacturers like Toyota and Honda. This deal is seen as a potential political victory for Japanese Prime Minister Shigeru Ishiba amidst domestic challenges. (not investment advice)</p>

        </div>
        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>The Trump administration has detailed its national artificial intelligence action plan, which is structured around three core pillars: prioritizing American workers, ensuring AI is free from ideological bias, and protecting U.S. technology from theft or misuse. The strategy emphasizes significant deregulation to spur innovation, aiming to avoid what officials call Europe's "innovation-killing" regulatory approach. This plan follows a presidential directive to establish U.S. dominance in AI and is supported by major private sector investments, like the Stargate project, to build out the nation's data center and energy infrastructure. The administration aims to position the U.S. to lead the next industrial revolution through these policies.</p>

          <p>Alphabet is scheduled to report its second-quarter earnings, with analysts anticipating significant growth in both revenue and earnings per share. Key metrics under scrutiny will be advertising revenue from YouTube and the performance of Google Cloud, which recently secured a partnership with OpenAI. Investors are particularly focused on Google's strategy to maintain its search dominance amid the rise of AI chatbots. During the quarter, Google announced new AI products, a venture fund for AI startups, and made strategic hires, while also conducting workforce reductions and expanding its Waymo self-driving car service into new markets.

          <p>In a historic advisory opinion, the International Court of Justice (ICJ) has affirmed that countries can be sued over climate change and have a legal obligation to protect the environment. The ruling, initiated by a group of Pacific island nations vulnerable to climate impacts, establishes that states must develop the most ambitious plans possible to mitigate climate change or risk breaching international law. While the decision is non-binding, legal experts believe it will empower climate litigation, potentially leading to compensation claims against nations with high historical emissions. The court's opinion reinforces that existing agreements like the Paris Accord do not supersede broader international environmental protection duties.</p>

          <p>The German cabinet has approved a new law designed to accelerate the procurement of weapons and military equipment for its armed forces, the Bundeswehr. Defense Minister Boris Pistorius described the move as a "quantum leap" for national security, citing Russia as an immediate threat. The legislation aims to cut bureaucratic red tape by raising value limits for direct contracts, allowing for faster purchasing without extensive tendering processes. It also facilitates cooperation with defense technology start-ups to foster innovation. While the government sees this as essential for strengthening NATO defense capabilities, opposition parties have criticized the measures as potentially wasteful and inadequate.</p>

        </div>
        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>With inflation and high interest rates pressuring household budgets, many consumers carry credit card balances. For a $2,000 balance, the minimum payment is typically calculated as a percentage of the balance plus interest, often resulting in a payment between $40 and $60. However, only paying the minimum is a costly long-term strategy, as compounding interest significantly increases the total amount repaid over time. Financial experts advise paying more than the minimum whenever possible to reduce the principal balance faster. For those struggling, options like balance transfers, debt consolidation, or debt management programs can provide relief and a more structured path to becoming debt-free. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>The UK's Advertising Standards Authority (ASA) has banned a Marks & Spencer (M&S) advertisement after ruling that the featured model appeared "unhealthily thin."

M&S has since stopped using the image but defended its practices, stating it promotes aspirational fashion inclusively and ensures all models are in good health. This ruling follows a similar ban on an ad from retailer Next, reflecting a growing regulatory focus on preventing the promotion of unhealthy body images in advertising.</p>

          <p>Homeowners are finding it more challenging to qualify for a Home Equity Line of Credit (HELOC) due to higher interest rates and stricter underwriting standards from lenders. If an application is denied, experts advise first asking the lender for the specific reasons to identify areas for improvement. Proactive strategies to boost approval odds include checking and improving one's credit score, reducing overall debt to lower the debt-to-income ratio, and ensuring all financial documents are in order. If a HELOC remains out of reach, alternatives like a fixed-rate home equity loan, a cash-out refinance, or a personal loan may be more suitable options. (not investment advice)</p>
