          <p>Tottenham Hotspur has appointed Thomas Frank, formerly the Brentford head coach, as their new manager, signing him to a contract extending until 2028. Frank succeeds Ange Postecoglou, who was dismissed earlier in the month despite leading Spurs to victory in the Europa League final. During his seven-year tenure at Brentford, Frank guided the club's ascent from the Championship to the Premier League in 2021. Tottenham finished 17th in the top flight last season but qualified for the Champions League by winning the Europa League final against Manchester United, marking their first major trophy in 17 years. This appointment signifies a new chapter for Tottenham as they aim to improve their league performance under Frank's leadership.</p>

The MI400 chips can be assembled into a server rack called Helios, enabling thousands of chips to function as a single "rack-scale" system. AMD's rack-scale setup aims to compete with Nvidia's Blackwell chips, offering a unified system for AI customers like cloud providers and large language model developers. The MI400 chips and this year's MI355X chips are designed to compete on price, with AMD emphasizing lower power consumption and aggressive pricing.

          <p>Crude oil futures experienced a slight decrease on Thursday after a sharp increase in the previous session driven by fears of an impending war between Israel and Iran. The price drop followed President Trump's statement that an Israeli attack on Iran was not necessarily imminent. Concerns about potential disruptions to crude oil supplies due to the conflict had previously caused oil prices to jump by more than 4%. Despite the heightened tensions, analysts suggest the risk of Iran closing the Strait of Hormuz, a critical oil transit route, remains low. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>Despite fears, President Trump's tariffs have not yet significantly impacted inflation data, with recent reports showing benign consumer and producer prices. Several factors have contributed to this, including companies stockpiling imported goods ahead of tariff announcements, a time lag before tariffs affect the economy, and limited pricing power due to consumer belt-tightening. Economists believe the impact of tariffs will likely materialize in the coming months, but for now, inflation remains in check due to these mitigating factors. The situation is being closely monitored for future price increases. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>Kseniia Petrova, a Russian-born scientist and Harvard researcher, has been released from US custody after being arrested for allegedly smuggling frog embryos into the US. She was released on bail after an agreement was reached on conditions for her release, including travel restrictions and the retention of her passport by authorities. Petrova's case became one of several high-profile detentions under the Trump administration's immigration policies, sparking concerns about targeting academics. A judge had previously ruled that immigration officers' actions were unlawful and that the embryos posed no threat, leading to her release from ICE custody. The charges against her were considered controversial, and the judge's previous ruling has made the future uncertain.</p>
