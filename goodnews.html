          <p>Japan's core inflation rate surged to 3.7% in May, the highest since January 2023, intensifying pressure on the Bank of Japan to raise interest rates to combat rising prices. The figure, excluding fresh food costs, exceeded economists' expectations and April's reading. Rice prices experienced a significant spike, prompting the government to release emergency stockpiles. While headline inflation was slightly lower than the previous month, it marked the 38th consecutive month above the BOJ's 2% target, with the central bank closely monitoring the "core-core" inflation rate, which also climbed, despite forecasting that inflation would wane moving forward due to a deceleration in the economy.

The judge granted an injunction, stating the states were likely to succeed in their claims that the policy was unlawful. The lawsuit, filed by Democratic state attorneys general, argued that the administration was coercing states into adhering to Trump's immigration agenda by withholding federal funds. The states contended that the transportation secretary lacked the authority to impose immigration-enforcement conditions on funding appropriated by Congress.</p>
