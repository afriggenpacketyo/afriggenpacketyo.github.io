          <h2>Trump Administration to Officially Recognize the Arabian Gulf</h2>

          <p>President Trump plans to announce that the U.S. will officially refer to the Persian Gulf as the Arabian Gulf, aligning with the preference of Arab nations. This decision reverses the long-standing U.S. policy of using the name Persian Gulf, which has been in use since the 16th century, and could strain relations with Iran. The move is expected to be announced during Trump's trip to Saudi Arabia, reflecting his administration's efforts to strengthen ties with Gulf countries. The name of the body of water has become an emotive issue for Iranians who embrace their country‚Äôs long history as the Persian Empire.</p>

          <p>The federal government is resuming collections on defaulted federal student loans for the first time in five years, using tools like wage garnishment and tax refund offsets.

          <p>China's central bank and financial regulators announced plans to cut key interest rates and the reserve requirement ratio in an effort to stimulate economic growth.

          <p>President Trump adopted a friendly tone toward Canada during a meeting with the new Canadian Prime Minister Mark Carney, despite months of belittling the country. Trump praised Canada and its people, a stark contrast to his earlier rhetoric about absorbing Canada as the 51st state. Carney firmly asserted that Canada is not for sale, while Trump shifted the focus to other topics, including Obama's presidential library and diplomacy with the Houthis in Yemen. The New York Times article depicts the meeting as awkward and strained due to Trump's past actions.</p>

          <p>China is a top aluminium producer and consumer but lacks the high-quality bauxite needed to make it, relying on imports from Guinea and Australia. A plant in Shanxi province is being upgraded with French technology that will enable it to produce aluminium from China's low-grade ore. The process neutralizes silica and sulphur, meaning high-silica bauxite can be refined using the Bayer method. The French company IB2 signed a 22-year agreement with Chinese firm Liulin Senze Coal & Aluminum to switch over to the technology.</p>

The new law is contained in the Crime and Policing Bill and aims to protect war memorials from desecration. The Churchill statue has been a regular target for demonstrators in recent years, and the new law aims to prevent such acts and ensure the statue is treated with respect.</p>
