          <p>The Wimbledon women's final presents a compelling matchup between five-time Grand Slam champion Iga Swiatek and the resurgent Amanda Anisimova, both first-time finalists at the tournament. The article analyzes the tactical keys to the match, noting that managing nerves on the big stage will be crucial for both players. While Swiatek holds the edge in experience, Anisimova's aggressive, free-swinging style as the underdog could pose a significant threat. The analysis also explores how both players have adapted their games for the grass court season, setting the stage for a highly anticipated championship contest.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Australian Prime Minister Anthony Albanese is promoting a new foreign policy doctrine centered on national sovereignty, framed as putting "Australia first" amid rising global tensions. Drawing inspiration from wartime leader John Curtin, Albanese aims to recalibrate relationships with both allies like the U.S. and rivals like China based on strategic reality rather than tradition. This assertion of an independent course comes as his government navigates criticism over the AUKUS security pact and defense spending. The policy shift signals a move to shape Australia's future by thinking and acting for itself on the world stage.</p>

          <p>Viraj Dhanda, a 19-year-old with non-speaking autism and apraxia, has achieved a remarkable academic milestone by graduating high school and being accepted into the Massachusetts Institute of Technology. For 14 years, Viraj was unable to communicate, leading many to assume he was severely mentally disabled. However, after his father discovered he could type with his thumb on an iPad, his profound intelligence was revealed. In under three years, he progressed from basic math to calculus, earning a near-perfect ACT score and proving that his mind was fully functional all along.</p>

          <p>One year after the attempted assassination of President Trump in Butler, Pennsylvania, the U.S. Secret Service is showcasing enhanced security protocols. The agency has deployed a new fleet of military-grade drones for improved aerial surveillance, a direct response to the fact that the shooter flew a drone over the rally site undetected. Additionally, new mobile command posts, costing up to $1.5 million each, have been established to ensure direct and seamless radio communication with local law enforcement. These upgrades are part of a broader effort to correct the security and communication failures identified during the 2024 incident.</p>

The move underscores the intense competition for top AI experts among tech giants like Google, Meta, and Microsoft. Windsurf, which specializes in AI tools for writing code, will continue to operate under new interim leadership and remains free to license its technology elsewhere.</p>

          <p>HSBC has significantly upgraded its outlook on AMD, raising the stock to a "Buy" rating and doubling its price target to $200 per share. The analyst's optimism is driven by the belief that AMD's new MI350 data center GPUs will command a much higher average selling price than previously expected, potentially boosting 2026 AI-related sales to over $15 billion. The report also notes that AMD's Instinct accelerators are becoming more competitive with Nvidia's offerings, and the upcoming MI400 series could further challenge its rival's market dominance. This positive forecast reflects growing confidence in AMD's ability to capture a larger share of the lucrative AI hardware market. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>The U.S. military is advancing its development of autonomous air combat capabilities by conducting a complex training exercise involving both crewed fighter jets and uncrewed XQ-58A Valkyrie drones. In the test, pilots in an F-16 and an F-15 each successfully controlled two drones, testing the real-time integration of the systems in a simulated combat environment. This "loyal wingman" concept, where uncrewed aircraft are directed by crewed fighters, is a key focus for the U.S. Air Force as it competes with China to achieve the next generation of air dominance.</p>
