        </div>
        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Official figures indicate that the UK economy experienced stronger-than-anticipated growth in the first three months of 2025, expanding by 0.7%, surpassing analysts' forecasts of 0.6%. The Office for National Statistics attributes this growth primarily to the robust performance of the UK services sector, with significant contributions from production as well. Chancellor Rachel Reeves hailed these figures as evidence of the UK economy's strength, noting that its growth outpaced that of the US, Canada, France, Italy, and Germany during the same period. However, shadow chancellor Mel Stride criticized the rise in employer's National Insurance payments, which came into effect in April, calling it a "jobs tax".</p>

          <p>Two British academics have identified a manuscript in Harvard Law School's library as an original 1300 version of Magna Carta, not a copy as previously believed, making it one of only seven such documents in existence. The manuscript, purchased for a mere $27.50 after World War II, had remained largely unnoticed for decades. Researchers authenticated the document using ultraviolet light and spectral imaging, comparing it to other known originals. The discovery is considered providential, especially given the current political climate and scrutiny Harvard faces, highlighting the document's enduring relevance in upholding the rule of law.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>A group of 21 economies, including the United States and China, has issued a warning about a potential sharp slowdown in their collective growth due to ongoing trade tensions and policy uncertainty. The Asia Pacific Economic Cooperation forecasts a drop in growth to 2.6% in 2025, down from 3.6% in the previous year. Carlos Kuriyama, Director of the APEC Policy Support Unit, highlighted the detrimental impact of tariff hikes, retaliatory measures, and non-tariff barriers on trade. He emphasized that restoring confidence in trade requires easing tensions, strengthening supply chain resilience, and improving the transparency of trade rules.</p>

        </div>
        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Denmark's economy has experienced a boom driven by a surge in pharmaceutical exports, but the International Monetary Fund expects growth to moderate in the coming years. Despite this anticipated slowdown, the IMF suggests that potential U.S. tariffs on the pharma industry will have limited impact on Denmark. The country's drugmakers rely on a "merchanting and processing" system, with most of the value tied to intellectual property rather than domestic production. The IMF notes that only 3% of Denmark's total exports are produced in the country and pass through customs, thus limiting the direct impact of U.S. tariffs.</p>

          <p>The Japanese government is contemplating doubling the release of its rice stockpiles to address a rice shortage and near-record high prices, according to sources familiar with the matter. The government is considering releasing 100,000 tons of reserve rice per month for three months through July, in addition to the 321,000 tons already auctioned between March and April. This move comes as average rice prices have been rising due to a poor harvest in 2023 and increased consumption by tourists. The government is also considering relaxing the buyback requirement for distributors to encourage participation in auctions.</p>

          <p>A manuscript previously considered a copy of the Magna Carta is now believed to be a genuine version, potentially one of the world's most valuable documents.

          <p>An analysis of Eurovision Song Contest winners since 2000 reveals several key strategies for success, including singing about personal liberation, using the English language, and alluding to folk music without sending an actual folk song. The article advises against dramatic key changes and emphasizes the importance of all-out staging with fire and pyrotechnics. However, it cautions against sending novelty acts, as only one has won this century. The advice comes from analyzing the music, lyrics, and onstage performances of past winners.</p>
