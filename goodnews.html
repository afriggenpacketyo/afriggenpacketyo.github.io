          <p>Colorado Buffaloes head coach Deion Sanders has proposed a new model for the College Football Playoff that would pay players directly for their participation and advancement. Sanders argues this would create equality, as every player would earn the same amount, similar to how the NFL distributes playoff bonuses. This idea comes amid ongoing debates with coaching legend Nick Saban about the need for more structure in the new era of name, image, and likeness (NIL) deals in college sports.</p>

          <p>Naomi Osaka has reached the third round of the US Open with a decisive win over Hailey Baptiste, showing strong form after a difficult experience in Montreal. Following a loss in the Montreal final, Osaka faced criticism and expressed feelings of "shame" for her post-match conduct, but she appears to have regained her momentum. Now having won eight of her last nine matches, she is set to face either Daria Kasatkina or Kamilla Rakhimova in her bid to reach the fourth round of a major for the first time since 2021.</p>

          <p>George Clooney's latest film, "Jay Kelly," has premiered at the Venice Film Festival, with some critics hailing it as a "midlife crisis masterpiece." In the Netflix movie, directed by Noah Baumbach, Clooney plays an aging movie star grappling with his life choices and legacy, a role that draws parallels to his own public persona. The film, which also stars Adam Sandler and Laura Dern, explores themes of identity and the gap between public presentation and private self, potentially positioning Clooney for awards consideration.</p>

          <h2>Automotive Experts Suggest Labor Day Weekend Is an Opportune Time to Lease Electric Vehicles</h2>
          <div class="timestamp">2025-08-28 18:25:23 EDT</div>
        </div>
        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>According to auto research firm Edmunds, the upcoming Labor Day weekend presents a good opportunity for consumers to find deals on electric vehicle leases. This is partly due to a $7,500 federal tax credit for EV leases that is set to expire on September 30. With EV prices declining and leasing becoming the most popular way to acquire them, experts note that leasing is often a better option than buying due to rapid technological advancements and faster depreciation rates for electric cars.

          <p>A federal judge has blocked Trump administration official Kari Lake from firing Voice of America Director Michael Abramowitz, ruling that such an action would be illegal. U.S. Judge Royce C. Lamberth stated that by law, the director can only be removed with the backing of a congressionally-established advisory panel. Because President Trump has not filled the vacancies on this panel, Lake lacks the authority to proceed with the termination, which the judge called an unlawful attempt to dismantle the broadcaster.</p>

This marks Crystal Palace's first-ever European campaign, and despite being demoted from the Europa League due to ownership rules, there is optimism the team could be a contender.</p>

In his ruling, Judge George Daniels stated that the plaintiffs have provided reasonable evidence regarding the roles of Saudi officials in assisting the hijackers, and that the kingdom had not offered sufficient evidence to counter these claims.</p>
