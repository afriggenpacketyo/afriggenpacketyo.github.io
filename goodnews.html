          <p>Hamas has submitted a 'positive response' to the latest ceasefire proposal mediated by the U.S., Egypt, and Qatar, signaling its readiness to enter negotiations. The proposed framework reportedly includes a two-month truce, though Hamas is still insisting on guarantees for a complete Israeli withdrawal and a permanent end to the war. While President Trump stated Israel had agreed to the terms, Israeli officials have expressed support but have not yet formally committed to the deal. This diplomatic movement occurs amidst the ongoing conflict, which has resulted in over 57,000 Palestinian deaths according to the Hamas-run Gaza Health Ministry.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>England's women's cricket team narrowly defeated India by five runs in a dramatic T20 match at The Oval, keeping the series alive. Chasing 172, India needed six runs off the final ball, but captain Harmanpreet Kaur was caught, ending their innings at 166-5. England's victory was anchored by a strong opening partnership, with Sophia Dunkley scoring 75 and Danni Wyatt-Hodge adding 66, although the team then suffered a dramatic collapse, losing nine wickets for just 31 runs. A crucial bowling spell from Lauren Filer, who dismissed key Indian batters, ultimately turned the game in England's favor, setting up a vital fourth match.</p>

          <h2>Ken Burns Discusses the American Revolution's Enduring Significance and Complexity</h2>
          <div class="timestamp">2025-07-04 17:16:55 EDT</div>
        </div>
        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>In a recent interview, filmmaker Ken Burns described the American Revolution as the most important event in world history since the birth of Christ, as it introduced the novel concept of a 'citizen' rather than a 'subject.' He emphasized that the nation was born from deep division and civil war, a complexity often overlooked but one that makes its founding ideals even more inspiring. Burns argued that understanding the flaws of the founders, such as their involvement in slavery, does not diminish their achievements but rather makes their stories richer and more accessible. He advocates for embracing this complex, gritty history to better understand America's present and future challenges.</p>

          <p>A federal judge has issued a temporary halt to the deportation of eight immigrants to South Sudan, a country currently embroiled in a civil war. This decision came just hours after the Supreme Court had cleared the way for the Trump administration to proceed with the removals. The men, only one of whom is from South Sudan, were convicted of serious crimes and were being held in Djibouti pending deportation. In an unusual Fourth of July hearing, Judge Randolph Moss extended the stay and transferred the case to a Boston judge, stating that new claims from the immigrants' lawyers about the perilous conditions they would face deserved a proper hearing.</p>

          <p>The market for initial public offerings is showing strong signs of a rebound, fueling optimism among venture capitalists that a nearly three-year drought may be ending. The recent surge is highlighted by the performance of crypto company Circle, whose stock has risen sixfold since its June debut, and infrastructure provider CoreWeave. This renewed activity is crucial for venture firms needing to generate returns for their investors after a prolonged slowdown caused by rising interest rates. While the market is not fully recovered, the increase in tech IPOs and successful listings has created a sense of 'light at the end of the tunnel.' (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>A board-certified cardiologist has identified five common food types he avoids feeding his own children due to their long-term health risks. The list includes microwave popcorn, often lined with 'forever chemicals'; flavored yogurts high in sugar; processed meats like bacon and hot dogs, which are loaded with sodium and nitrates; sugary cereals and drinks; and deep-fried foods. The article emphasizes that these foods can contribute to chronic illnesses like heart disease and cancer later in life. Instead, the doctor recommends healthier alternatives such as air-popped popcorn, plain Greek yogurt with fruit, unprocessed proteins, and air-fried foods.</p>

He secured his spot with a 7-6 (7-5) 6-4 6-3 victory over Italy's Matteo Bellucci on Court One. Norrie revealed he drew energy from the crowd, a tactic he learned from Andy Murray, to help him through the match. After a tense first set, Norrie found his rhythm and comfortably controlled the next two, setting up a last-16 meeting with Chile's Nicolas Jarry.

          <p>A provision in President Trump's 'big, beautiful bill' creates a new federal tax deduction for tipped income, a move the White House frames as a victory for the working class. The article explains that this measure creates a deduction for tips, effectively eliminating federal income tax on that portion of a worker's earnings, though it would not affect state, local, or payroll taxes. Critics, however, point out that the tax break is temporary, expiring in 2028, and may not benefit the lowest-wage workers, as over a third of them already earn too little to have federal income tax liability.

          <p>The U.S. Air Force has suspended a proposed project with SpaceX to test hypersonic rocket cargo deliveries from Johnston Atoll, a remote Pacific wildlife refuge. The decision follows reports and opposition from biologists and environmental groups who warned that the project would severely harm the many protected seabird species that nest on the island. The program aimed to test the delivery of up to 100 tons of cargo anywhere on Earth within 90 minutes, a potential breakthrough for military logistics. The Air Force is now reportedly exploring alternative locations for the rocket-landing tests, according to the military publication Stars and Stripes.</p>

          <p>Cars manufactured in China accounted for a record one in ten new vehicles sold in the UK during the month of June, according to new industry data. This represents a significant increase from 6% in the same month last year, driven by the rapid growth of Chinese brands like BYD and MG. This surge in the UK market is particularly notable as other G7 nations have recently imposed steep tariffs on Chinese auto imports. The trend is largely, but not exclusively, focused on electric vehicles, with analysts pointing to the UK's lack of tariffs and the popularity of EVs as key factors.</p>
