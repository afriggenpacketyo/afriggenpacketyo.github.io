          <p>Despite concerns, President Trump's tariffs have not yet significantly impacted inflation.  Consumer and producer prices remained relatively stable in May.  Three factors are cited: pre-tariff stockpiling, time lag in tariff impact, and limited pricing power due to consumer belt-tightening. Economists anticipate a delayed inflationary effect in the coming months. (not investment advice)</p>
