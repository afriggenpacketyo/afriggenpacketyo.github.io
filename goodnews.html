          <p>Alaska Airlines is expanding its international presence by launching new flights from Seattle to London, England, and Reykjavik, Iceland, beginning next May. The daily London route will utilize Boeing 787-9 Dreamliners, targeting both business and leisure travelers, while the Iceland service will be a seasonal offering using a 737 Max 8. This expansion follows the airline's acquisition of Hawaiian Airlines and is part of a broader strategy to establish at least a dozen intercontinental routes from its Seattle hub. To mark its global growth, the airline also unveiled a new livery for its Dreamliner fleet inspired by the northern lights.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>The future of RB Leipzig's highly-rated striker, Benjamin Sesko, remains uncertain as both Manchester United and Newcastle United show strong interest in the £70 million player. Newcastle has reportedly made a formal offer, while Manchester United is still evaluating a potential deal, possibly needing to sell players first to finance the move. Sesko faces a choice between joining a rebuilding Manchester United, where he would likely be a starter but miss out on European competition, or moving to a Newcastle team that can offer Champions League football. Alternatively, the 22-year-old Slovenian could remain at Leipzig, awaiting potential offers from other top European clubs next summer.</p>

          <p>Palo Alto Networks is facing a skeptical market reaction to its largest-ever acquisition, the $25 billion purchase of Israeli identity security firm CyberArk. The company's stock dropped 16% following the announcement, with several analysts downgrading the shares due to concerns about the deal's strategic fit and integration challenges. CEO Nikesh Arora defended the acquisition as a crucial move into the identity management market, aligning with the company's focus on AI-driven security. This massive deal positions Palo Alto Networks to compete more directly with giants like Microsoft and Okta in a rapidly consolidating cybersecurity industry driven by increasingly sophisticated cyber threats.</p>

          <p>India is experiencing a remarkable surge in the world of competitive chess, challenging the long-standing dominance of Russian and European players. This rise is exemplified by 19-year-old Divya Deshmukh's recent victory at the FIDE Women's Chess World Cup and 18-year-old Gukesh Dommaraju becoming the youngest-ever world champion. The epicenter of this movement is Chennai, which has produced a third of India's grandmasters, supported by a robust ecosystem of grassroots training, dedicated parents, and school support. The global chess boom, fueled by online platforms and a new generation of talent, has transformed the ancient game into a viable career path in India.</p>

          <p>Energy giant BP is launching a comprehensive review of its oil and gas operations with the goal of cutting costs and maximizing shareholder value. This move signals a continued strategic pivot back toward fossil fuels, following pressure from investors over underperformance compared to rivals. The announcement coincided with news of BP's largest oil and gas discovery in 25 years, located in deep water off the coast of Brazil, which could become a major production hub. CEO Murray Auchincloss stated that the company "can and will do better" for its investors, reinforcing a shift away from its earlier, more aggressive renewable energy targets.</p>

The company now expects full-year adjusted earnings between $2.90 and $3.10 per share, up from its previous forecast.

          <p>The U.S. space agency NASA is reportedly fast-tracking its plan to build a nuclear reactor on the Moon, setting an ambitious goal for completion by 2030. This initiative is a key component of American ambitions to create a permanent human settlement on the lunar surface and ensure a reliable power source during the two-week lunar nights. The move is seen by some as a response to similar plans announced by China and Russia, raising concerns that the new space race is driven by geopolitical competition rather than purely scientific goals. The project also faces significant hurdles, including recent cuts to NASA's budget and technical safety challenges.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>The newsletter platform Substack is emerging as a vital hub for literary discourse, providing a space for both established authors and new voices to engage directly with readers. As traditional media outlets reduce arts coverage, many writers and critics are turning to Substack to publish essays, serialize fiction, and build communities, a phenomenon being called "Substack summer." The platform is credited with generating buzz for novels from smaller presses that might otherwise be ignored. This trend is seen by some as a revival of the early-2000s blogosphere, fostering a new literary scene that champions long-form discussion and intellectual engagement around books.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>A new generation of autonomous robots is transforming the labor-intensive job of painting lines on athletic fields for sports like soccer and football. Companies like Turf Tank have developed GPS-linked machines that can accurately mark a full-size field in as little as 24 minutes, a task that would take a human crew of three nearly two hours. This technology has become essential for large-scale events and is being adopted by professional sports teams, universities, and high schools across the country. The robots offer significant efficiency gains, freeing up groundskeepers from a tedious task and allowing them to focus on turf management.</p>
