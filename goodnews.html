        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Alibaba reported a better-than-expected net income surge of 78% in the June quarter, primarily fueled by accelerated sales in its cloud computing division and a revival in its e-commerce operations. Despite revenue falling slightly short of analyst forecasts, the cloud unit's 26% growth, driven by robust AI demand, was a key highlight. The company faces intense competition in China's "instant commerce" space, requiring significant investment, which impacted adjusted earnings in its core e-commerce business. Investors have responded positively, with the U.S.-listed stock rallying 40% this year, recognizing Alibaba's strategic investments in AI and new e-commerce models.</p>

          <p>India's economy experienced a robust 7.8% annual growth rate in the June quarter, significantly surpassing economists' forecasts of 6.7%. This stronger-than-expected performance was attributed to substantial contributions from the manufacturing, construction, and service sectors, indicating sustained economic momentum. The latest figures follow a healthy 7.4% growth rate in the preceding quarter, reinforcing India's position as a rapidly developing global market. International bodies like the World Bank and IMF project the country's economy to grow around 6.3-6.4% for the fiscal year, underscoring positive long-term prospects. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>Eric Trump, son of former President Donald Trump, expressed strong confidence in Bitcoin reaching a $1 million valuation, stating he now dedicates 90% of his time to the crypto community. This declaration was made at a Hong Kong conference, marking the Trump family's strategic expansion into the Asian digital asset market. Both Eric and Donald Trump Jr. are actively involved in crypto ventures, with upcoming appearances at major Asian crypto events. The family's growing involvement coincides with President Trump's shift to a pro-crypto stance, though critics raise concerns about potential conflicts of interest and illicit activity in the volatile market.

          <p>Nearly two decades after Hurricane Katrina, Dorothy Virginia Driggers Taquino, 81, a victim who died in her Arabi home, has finally been identified. The breakthrough, aided by a local news outlet, allows her family to move her from an unmarked grave to her chosen burial plot, bringing significant closure. Investigators had struggled with identification in the chaotic aftermath, despite a genetic sample provided by her niece. The coroner's office ultimately used utility bills, driver's license files, and property records to confirm her identity, reducing the number of unidentified victims at the memorial to 29.</p>

          <p>Chinese researchers have unveiled what they claim is the world's first "universal" 6G chip, capable of transmitting a 50GB 8K movie within seconds. This breakthrough could revolutionize connectivity, especially for remote areas, by unifying the fragmented spectrum of frequencies currently used by various devices. The innovation, led by scientists from Peking University and City University of Hong Kong, aims to overcome the current piecemeal approach to wireless communication challenges. The development signifies a major leap in telecommunications technology, potentially making existing solutions for diverse frequency requirements obsolete.</p>

          <p>Illinois has introduced IL Pride Connect, a pioneering legal hotline offering free, affirming support and resources for the LGBTQ+ community, countering increased hostility nationwide. This initiative, launched by Governor JB Pritzker, provides access to legal aid for healthcare, name changes, and gender marker updates, along with advocacy tools. The hotline's establishment comes as the Trump administration has implemented rollbacks on LGBTQ+ initiatives, including shutting down a youth suicide lifeline and cutting health funding. Supporters praise Illinois for leading the way in protecting its LGBTQ+ residents and providing vital, trusted guidance in a challenging political climate.</p>

          <h2>Wealthy Shoppers Drive Rise in Retail Returns, Impacting Retailers</h2>
          <div class="timestamp">2025-08-29 07:00:01 EDT</div>
        </div>
        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>A new Bank of America Institute report indicates that higher-income shoppers are increasingly returning retail purchases, accounting for 5.3% of their transactions. This trend, often linked to "bracketing" — buying multiple items with intent to return some — is less prevalent among lower-income households. While consumers value flexible return policies, this behavior is proving costly for retailers, with returns reaching an estimated $890 billion in 2024. In response, many companies are tightening return policies, including charging for return methods and shortening return windows, to mitigate the financial burden. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>Long-held, trophy ranches are increasingly coming onto the market as generational heirs struggle to agree on their future or lack interest in continuing the ranching lifestyle. Properties like California's Reynolds Ranch (7,600 acres for $30.7 million) and Wyoming's Antlers Ranch (40,000 acres for $85 million) are examples of these legacy properties. While the "Yellowstone" effect fuels demand from deep-pocketed buyers seeking privacy and a rural lifestyle, the decision to sell is often "bittersweet" for families. The trend reflects broader shifts in wealth transfer and the declining appeal of traditional ranching for younger generations, despite the unique allure of these vast estates.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>This article explores how to approach life's most challenging decisions, such as career paths, using the philosophical framework of value pluralism. It draws on Ruth Chang's theory that hard choices aren't difficult due to ignorance of a "better" option, but because alternatives are "on a par"—equally valid yet different in kind of value. The article suggests that in such dilemmas, individuals must exercise "normative power" to create their own reasons and define who they want to be. This perspective emphasizes personal agency and freedom in shaping one's life by making choices that align with deeply held moral commitments or personal security.</p>

          <p>This article explores parasocial relationships, the one-sided intimacy fans feel with celebrities, influencers, or public figures they've never met. It traces their history from "Byronmania" to modern "stan culture," noting how media and marketing create public personas that foster deep, yet unreciprocated, connections. While fandom can be meaningful, the article highlights the increasing toxicity, with some fans overstepping boundaries, stalking, and attempting to control stars' private lives. It emphasizes that these relationships are with a constructed persona, not the real person, and advises responsible fandom, urging individuals to manage their investment and distinguish between reality and mediated interaction.</p>

          <p>The Los Angeles City Council is debating a proposal to allow single stairways in apartment buildings up to six stories, a move aimed at accelerating development and addressing the city's housing crisis. Proponents argue this change would make it easier and cheaper to build on smaller lots and create more family-sized units, improving light and ventilation. However, firefighters express strong opposition, citing safety concerns about limited escape routes during fires or earthquakes and challenges for emergency access. The article highlights the ongoing tension between urban planning goals for affordability and density versus traditional fire safety regulations.</p>
