          <h2>Cognac Producers in France Navigate Climate Change and Trade Challenges</h2>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Cognac producers in France are facing a multitude of challenges including climate change, tariffs, and the loss of the Russian market. Global warming is causing grapes to ripen earlier and become sweeter, impacting the quality of cognac, while tariffs imposed by the US and China have significantly reduced exports. Despite these difficulties, family-run businesses like Earl du Bois Noble winery and Tonnellerie Allary are adapting by diversifying their markets and implementing sustainable practices. The Cognac region owes its success to trade, with famous houses like Hennessy and Martell founded by immigrants, and is now exploring new markets like organic cognac and cocktails to attract younger consumers.</p>

          <p>Smartex, a sustainable fashion startup, is using cameras, vision software, and artificial intelligence to detect defects in textiles during production, reducing fabric waste. The company claims to have prevented 1 million kilograms of fabric from going to waste in the past three years and has attracted investments from H&M Group, Tony Fadell, and Amazon's AWS Compute for Climate Fellowship. Smartex uses AWS technology to train its machine learning models to identify flaws in fabric, which can vary significantly. The fashion industry has a significant waste problem, with a truckload of clothes thrown away every second, and Smartex is working to address this issue by improving efficiency and reducing pollution.</p>

          <p>Conservationists in Wales are using edible glitter to track endangered water voles, whose numbers have declined by 90% in the past 30 years. The glitter, which is safe for the animals, is added to their food and then tracked in their droppings, allowing conservationists to monitor their movements and habitat use. This innovative approach aims to help protect the species by identifying key territories and informing environmental adjustments, such as removing invasive conifers and fencing off riverbanks. The team is testing the method on captive-bred water voles before applying it in the wild, hoping to improve the species' chances of survival.</p>

          <p>Palaeontologists in Alberta, Canada, are investigating a mass grave containing thousands of Pachyrhinosaurus fossils to understand how these dinosaurs died. The team believes the dinosaurs were part of a large herd migrating when a catastrophic flash flood wiped them out. The site, known as Pipestone Creek, is one of the largest bone beds in North America, offering a unique opportunity to study dinosaur biology and community structure. Researchers are also studying Edmontosaurus fossils found nearby to build a more complete picture of the ancient ecosystem, with the findings featured in the BBC series 'Walking With Dinosaurs'.</p>

          <p>China's retail sales growth slowed in April, indicating that consumption remains a concern for the world's second-largest economy, despite government stimulus efforts. Industrial output grew more than expected, suggesting that the impact of U.S. tariffs was not as severe as anticipated. The Chinese government is focused on diversifying exports to other regions to offset trade tensions with the U.S., while acknowledging that domestic demand still lacks momentum. Automobile sales grew slowly, and the real estate sector remains in a period of 'adjustment'. (not investment advice)</p>
