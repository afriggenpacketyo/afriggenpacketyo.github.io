          <p>Singapore's headline inflation rate held steady at a four-year low of 0.8% in June, coming in below economists' expectations and signaling potential for a monetary policy shift. The soft inflation figures, along with unchanged core inflation, provide the Monetary Authority of Singapore (MAS) with latitude to ease its policies to bolster economic growth amid global trade uncertainties. The MAS has noted that inflation has been below expectations and anticipates subdued domestic growth for the second half of the year, despite strong GDP figures earlier. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>Laurent Mekies has officially begun his tenure as the new team principal for the Red Bull Formula 1 team, following the departure of Christian Horner. Mekies, a veteran F1 engineer, is tasked with reversing the team's competitive decline over the past 18 months and navigating the organization after the exits of both Horner and design chief Adrian Newey. He plans to begin by listening and understanding the team's existing dynamics before implementing changes. His first public appearance will be at the Belgian Grand Prix, a track that historically favors Red Bull's car design.</p>

          <p>The United States has announced a significant trade deal with Japan, which includes setting a "reciprocal" tariff of 15% on Japanese exports. This new rate represents a reduction for Japanese automobiles, a critical component of the nation's economy, from a previous level of 25%. The agreement is also expected to open Japan's market to more U.S. goods, including agricultural products, and is seen as a potential political victory for Japanese Prime Minister Shigeru Ishiba. The deal involves a reported $550 billion investment from Japan into the U.S. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>Despite a challenging UK retail environment, a chain of stores named Duck World, which exclusively sells themed rubber ducks, is managing to stay afloat in prime London locations. The business appeals to tourists, collectors, and gift-seekers, leveraging the "treatonomics" trend where consumers make small, mood-boosting purchases. The co-founder notes that while challenges like inflation have forced price increases, the iconic nature of the rubber duck provides a resilient customer base. The article explores the business model, which relies on high-margin collectibles and a diverse product line to succeed where other retailers have failed.</p>

The court's opinion will address what countries must do under international law and the legal consequences for failing to act. While not directly enforceable, the ruling is expected to set a powerful legal benchmark for future climate litigation and international agreements.</p>

          <p>Shares of major Japanese automakers, including Toyota, Honda, and Nissan, soared following the announcement that the U.S. would lower its tariffs on their vehicles to 15% from 25%.

The auto export sector is a cornerstone of Japan's economy, and the high tariffs had negatively impacted shipments.

          <p>Scientists believe that a 'terror bird,' a formidable top predator from 13 million years ago, was killed and eaten by an even larger predator. The conclusion is based on distinct teeth marks found on the fossilized leg bone of the bird, which was unearthed in Colombia's Tatacoa Desert. Using 3D digital scans, paleontologists matched the bite marks to an extinct caiman species that could grow up to five meters long. This rare discovery provides direct evidence of an interaction between two of the region's ancient apex predators, revealing new insights into the prehistoric ecosystem.</p>
