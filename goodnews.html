          <p>Hawaii's Kilauea volcano has erupted for the 31st time since December, with lava fountains soaring 100 feet from its summit crater. This highly active volcano's latest display is contained within the crater, posing no threat to homes, offering spectacular views for park visitors and livestream audiences. Scientists monitor the magma flow and ground changes to predict eruptions, noting a recent trend of shorter, wider lava fountains. Native Hawaiian tradition views the crater as home to the goddess Pele, emphasizing the cultural significance of these natural phenomena.</p>

          <p>A federal judge has issued a preliminary injunction, blocking the Trump administration's attempt to withhold Housing and Urban Development (HUD) grants from 34 cities and counties identified as "sanctuary cities." These cities had policies limiting cooperation with federal immigration enforcement. The ruling prevents the administration from stripping hundreds of millions of dollars in funding, expanding protections for these municipalities. This decision marks a significant legal setback for the Trump administration's efforts to compel local governments to align with its immigration policies.</p>

Its strong focus on science, technology, engineering, and math (STEM) fields contributes to high post-graduation salaries. Recognized by Forbes as a "new Ivy," Georgia Tech fosters a supportive academic environment, prioritizing student success and collaborative learning.</p>

          <p>College athletics are undergoing a significant transformation, moving from casual club sports to a highly professionalized industry generating substantial revenue. Recent court decisions now allow athletes to receive compensation from advertisers, fans, and their schools, fundamentally altering their status and the nature of college-level sports. This shift has sparked debate about the future of niche sports and the potential for increased player compensation. The article explores the meaning of school sports in this new era, questioning whether the changes will lead to a more equitable system or further commercialization.</p>

          <p>Restaurateur Tommy Fello, 72, regained significant function in his left arm and hand after a stroke, thanks to the Vivistim System, an FDA-approved vagus nerve stimulation technology. After traditional therapies yielded minor improvements, Fello became the first Cleveland Clinic patient to receive the implant, which enhances neuroplasticity during rehabilitation. The device delivers gentle pulses to the vagus nerve while patients perform tasks, leading to two to three times greater improvement compared to rehab alone.

          <p>The CEO of the Angola rail project, LAR, stated that the initiative is purely commercial and not aimed at countering China's influence, despite planned links that could connect the Atlantic and Indian Oceans. LAR maintains strong commercial ties with China, serving Chinese-owned mining companies and relying on Chinese manufacturing for equipment. The project, which includes a planned greenfield railway to Zambia and Tanzania, is seen by the CEO as a logistics component, emphasizing its economic rather than geopolitical motivations. This clarification comes amid U.S. officials' announcements about the cross-continental railway.</p>

          <div class="timestamp">2025-08-23 08:00:02 EDT</div>
        </div>
        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>The impending "great wealth transfer" includes an estimated $25 trillion in real estate, presenting both financial and emotional challenges for wealthy families. Wealth advisors recommend strategic planning to minimize taxes, maintenance costs, and family disputes over inherited properties, especially vacation homes. Gifting real estate through wills or trusts at death can help heirs avoid significant capital gains taxes. Utilizing LLCs and trusts can also shield assets from lawsuits and allow parents to outline usage rules, preventing conflicts among siblings. Financial experts stress the importance of setting aside liquid assets for upkeep and preparing for the possibility that some heirs may want to cash out (not investment advice).</p>

          <p>Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy's choice of a black canvas blazer and collared shirt, rather than his usual bunker-chic Henley, for a White House meeting with President Trump, sparked discussions on "wardrobe diplomacy." This attire change followed a combative previous meeting where Trump criticized Zelenskyy's casual dress. Fashion experts suggest the more formal, yet still tie-less, look aimed to convey seriousness for "high-stakes endgame diplomacy." The shift in presentation was noted positively by observers, including Trump himself, suggesting that clothing can play a subtle yet significant role in political communication and international relations.</p>

          <p>South Park's new season is achieving record ratings with its direct and "vicious" satire of the Trump administration, targeting figures like Homeland Security Secretary Kristi Noem and Vice President JD Vance. The show's creators, Matt Stone and Trey Parker, are known for equal-opportunity offending but are now specifically focusing on Trump's actions and his administration. This aggressive critique comes as Paramount Pictures, Comedy Central's parent company, has faced scrutiny from the Trump administration, yet the show's massive streaming deal and high viewership suggest business interests are protecting its creative freedom. The article highlights South Park's unique position in the current media landscape.</p>

          <p>Florida is actively rebuilding and innovating for a future with more intense climate-driven storms, exemplified by communities like Babcock Ranch designed for hurricane resilience. Residents like the Blancetts, displaced by Hurricane Ian, are moving inland to "storm-proof" towns, while others rebuild existing homes with hurricane-resistant features, often with nonprofit assistance. Despite the clear return on investment for preventive measures, federal support for mitigation is declining under the Trump administration, which has cut FEMA grants and even proposed shutting down the agency. This leaves states and communities to navigate costly rebuilding efforts and increasing climate risks with less federal aid.</p>

Chairman Doug King emphasized that owning the CBS Arena ensures the club's long-term stability and allows for investment in facilities, fan experience, and community opportunities. This purchase ends years of uncertainty for supporters, who have endured multiple stadium owners and home grounds since leaving Highfield Road in 2005. The move is celebrated as a significant step towards the club's ambition to return to the Premier League, promising better revenue streams and player recruitment.</p>

          <p>A wave of younger, social-media savvy Democratic candidates is launching primary challenges against long-serving incumbents, driven by frustration with what they see as an ossifying party establishment. These challengers, like Liam Elkind and Everton Blair, argue that party elders have failed to act with urgency against Trump's policies and have grown complacent. The movement emphasizes generational change, energy, and a willingness to "fight" rather than "fold," seeking a full-scale reimagining of Democratic messaging and vision beyond just opposing Trump. While costly, these primaries are seen by some as a necessary path to renew the party and prevent a "dystopia."</p>

          <p>Eddie Horne, a 75-year-old survivor of severe abuse at Florida's notorious Dozier School for Boys, has finally received his high school diploma, fulfilling a decades-long personal goal. Horne's education was derailed by the "horrible" physical and sexual abuse he endured as a teenager at the state-run reform school, which closed in 2011 after investigations confirmed widespread mistreatment. He pursued his diploma through a compensation program for Dozier victims, established by the Florida legislature. Horne hopes his story inspires others to overcome life setbacks, demonstrating resilience and the enduring pursuit of personal milestones.</p>

          <p>A recent Empower report indicates surveyed Americans ideally wish to retire at age 58, significantly younger than the current average retirement ages of 64 for men and 62 for women. Financial advisors caution that early retirement requires substantial savings to cover potentially 30-40 years of non-working life, especially considering rising healthcare costs before Medicare eligibility at 65. Many Americans, 58%, retire earlier than planned due to health or employment issues, not financial stability. Experts emphasize aggressive early savings, understanding retirement expenses, and the potential benefits of working longer to avoid outliving funds (not investment advice).</p>

        </div>
        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Tinted sunscreens provide an important benefit that regular sun protection lacks: defense against visible light radiation, which contributes to hyperpigmentation and melasma, particularly in darker skin tones. While standard sunscreens focus on UV protection, visible light penetrates deeper and can damage pigment cells. Research shows tinted sunscreens, which contain iron oxide for color, outperform non-tinted products in blocking visible light. Dermatologists advocate for more research and standardized recommendations for visible light protection, urging companies to develop a wider range of tints to accommodate diverse skin tones, as current options are still limited.</p>

Becker emphasizes that Earth is uniquely suited for human life and that resources should be focused on making our planet better, rather than pursuing a "delusion" of off-world survival.
