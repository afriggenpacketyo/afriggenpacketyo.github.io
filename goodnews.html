          <p>Pep Guardiola has confirmed that Erling Haaland is 'ready and fit' to return from injury. Guardiola has led City to six Premier League titles since joining the club in 2016.

The 54-year-old called it the "most difficult" campaign in his time in coaching. Relevant context: City beat rivals Manchester United to claim the Community Shield last summer but between October and December the side endured a run of one victory in 13 games, which included nine defeats.</p>
