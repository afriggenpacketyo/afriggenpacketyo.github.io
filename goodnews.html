          <p>Britain and India have finalized a trade agreement aimed at bolstering economic ties between the two nations. The deal, expected to increase bilateral trade by ¬£25.5 billion, involves India reducing tariffs on 90% of goods, with most becoming tariff-free within a decade; duties on British whiskey and gin will be halved, and car tariffs will be significantly reduced. British Prime Minister Keir Starmer hailed the agreement as a new era for trade and the economy, while Indian Prime Minister Narendra Modi described it as ambitious and mutually beneficial. The New York Times article notes this agreement arrives as many countries seek to strengthen alliances amid global trade uncertainty. Optimism score: 75</p>
