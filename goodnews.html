        </div>
        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>The Supreme Court ruled 7-2 against the Trump administration, siding with Venezuelan nationals who sought to block their removal from the U.S. under the Alien Enemies Act. The court determined that the detainees were not given sufficient time or resources to challenge their deportations, emphasizing the importance of due process. While the ruling acknowledges national security interests, it insists on constitutional consistency in pursuing those interests. The case now returns to a lower court to determine the appropriate level of notice required for those targeted for removal, offering only temporary relief while the case returns to the U.S. Court of Appeals for the Fifth Circuit to sort out the question of how much notice is due to those being targeted for removal.</p>

          <p>Moody's Ratings downgraded the U.S. credit rating from Aaa to Aa1, citing concerns over increasing government debt and interest payment ratios. The agency noted that successive administrations and Congress have failed to address large annual fiscal deficits and growing interest costs. Moody's expects federal deficits to increase from 6.4% of GDP in 2024 to 9% by 2035, driven by rising interest payments and entitlement spending. Despite the downgrade, the outlook was changed from negative to stable, acknowledging the U.S. economy's strengths and the dollar's role as a global reserve currency.</p>

Surviving for weeks without supplies, she relied on leeks, boiled snowmelt, and tea made from pine needles, eventually finding refuge in a cabin.

          <p>A CDC study estimates that hundreds of drowning deaths could be prevented annually through increased use of life jackets and better pool fencing. The modeling found that improved pool fencing could have prevented 51 deaths, and life jacket use could have prevented 297 deaths in 2022 alone. The researchers, part of the agency's now-eliminated National Center for Injury Prevention and Control, estimated the economic cost of these preventable deaths at $4.5 billion.

          <p>Consumer Reports found that Kroger shoppers are frequently overcharged due to price tag errors, including expired discounts. The investigation, prompted by employee allegations, revealed over 150 instances of overcharging, averaging $1.70 per item. While Kroger disputes the findings, claiming they represent a small fraction of transactions, consumer advocates emphasize the importance of accurate pricing. Similar issues have been reported at other retailers, but the Kroger case is notable due to its prevalence in areas with limited grocery options and a history of customer complaints.</p>
