          <p>Reform UK leader Nigel Farage has formally urged Prime Minister Sir Keir Starmer to permit him to appoint peers to the House of Lords. Farage contends that this move is crucial to rectify the "democratic disparity" in the upper chamber, highlighting his party's substantial support from over 4.1 million votes in the general election and recent local government successes, despite having no current peers. He pointed out that smaller parties like the Green Party and Liberal Democrats possess numerous peerages, advocating for the Lords to better reflect the significant changes in British politics. This request aims to bolster Reform UK's influence in parliamentary scrutiny and legislative processes, ensuring their growing political presence is acknowledged.</p>

          <p>Researchers at Tsinghua University in China have reportedly broken a 40-year-old mathematical barrier in theoretical computer science, potentially revolutionizing computer speed. The team, led by Associate Professor Duan Ran, devised a new approach to the "single-source shortest-paths" problem (SSSP), a fundamental challenge in network optimization. Their method bypasses the traditional sorting process of Dijkstra's algorithm, significantly reducing calculation time by focusing only on the most crucial points. This development, published on arXiv and recognized with the Best Paper Award at the ACM Symposium on Theory of Computing, promises to greatly enhance computational efficiency.</p>

          <p>Chinese President Xi Jinping has issued a strong directive for the immediate and thorough implementation of policies aimed at protecting and fostering the private sector, emphasizing "no delay" or compromise. Xi acknowledged that despite various relief measures, many private businesses have seen limited tangible benefits, urging for enhanced policy precision to ensure concrete assistance. His call underscores Beijing's commitment to guaranteeing a level playing field for private firms, safeguarding entrepreneurs' lawful rights, and resolving long-standing issues such as overdue payments. This move reflects an ongoing effort to bolster confidence and growth within China's vital private economy.</p>

          <p>Oil prices saw a slight dip in early European trading Friday, ahead of the highly anticipated meeting between U.S. President Donald Trump and Russian President Vladimir Putin in Alaska. Brent crude and West Texas Intermediate futures both declined, as investors hope the talks could lead to an end to sanctions limiting Russian oil supply. While an immediate breakthrough is uncertain, the summit is seen as a significant indicator for U.S.-Russia relations and the Ukraine war. Gold prices also edged higher due to investor caution, as inflation data tempered hopes for larger Federal Reserve interest rate cuts. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>Indian Prime Minister Narendra Modi, on India's 78th Independence Day, asserted the nation's commitment to self-reliance in energy and defense, seemingly defying U.S. threats of additional tariffs. Speaking from New Delhi's Red Fort, Modi underscored that true independence requires reducing dependence on other countries for energy needs, implicitly addressing U.S. pressure regarding Russian oil purchases. He also warned Pakistan against future threats and hinted at continuing the unilateral suspension of the Indus Water Treaty. Modi's speech championed India's agricultural interests and signaled a firm stance on national security and economic autonomy.</p>
