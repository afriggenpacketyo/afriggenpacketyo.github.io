          <p>The Women's Rugby World Cup final between top-ranked England and second-ranked Canada transcends a mere sporting contest, representing a clash between vastly different funding models. England boasts a fully professional setup with significant financial investment, leading to dominant performance since 2019. In contrast, Canada's team operates on a fraction of England's budget, relying on crowdfunding and players leveraging England's professional league for game time. This article explores how Canada's potential victory could challenge assumptions about the necessity of full professionalism, yet also underscores the immense sacrifices Canadian players make without comparable institutional support. The outcome carries significant implications for the future investment and structure of women's Test rugby globally.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Rachel Reeves, the UK Shadow Chancellor, is advocating for an "ambitious" youth migration deal with the EU to improve public finances ahead of the autumn Budget. She believes a time-limited exchange scheme for young workers, aged 18 to 30 with no right to remain, would benefit the economy, growth, and businesses. Reeves also urges the Office for Budget Responsibility to factor the scheme's potential economic impact into its forecasts, hoping to reduce the need for spending cuts or tax rises. This article notes that the proposal, criticized by some as a partial return to freedom of movement, aims to counter the economic downturn attributed to the original Brexit deal.
