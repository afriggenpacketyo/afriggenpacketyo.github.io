          <p>Kilauea Volcano on Hawaii's Big Island has erupted for the 25th time since December, spewing lava fountains over 330 feet high. The latest eruptive episode was preceded by gas-pistoning, a process where gas accumulates at the top of a lava column. The USGS has set up livestream videos to monitor the eruption, which has been pausing and resuming since December 23rd. The USGS warned of high levels of volcanic gas that can cause respiratory problems, as well as the hazard of volcanic fragments falling near the eruptive vents.</p>

          <p>Council tax in the UK is projected to increase by 5% annually to fund local services, according to documents in the Spending Review. Bills are also expected to rise further to support increased police funding. While local authorities can choose to implement lower increases, the Spending Review assumes the maximum increase. Chancellor Rachel Reeves clarified that the 5% increase is a cap, not a requirement, and that the funds are intended for services such as social care and policing.</p>

          <p>Senator John Fetterman (D-PA) issued a "DO" and "DO NOT" list, emphasizing his anti-violence stance following recent unrest in Los Angeles. The list encourages peaceful protest and organizing to win elections, while condemning looting, arson, and assaults on law enforcement. Fetterman's statement follows his earlier criticism of the "anarchy and true chaos" in LA, where he argued that his party loses moral ground by failing to condemn violence. Republican colleagues have expressed agreement with Fetterman's sentiments.</p>

          <p>China plans to remove tariffs on nearly all goods from Africa, excluding eSwatini, as both criticize US trade moves. This measure aims to provide African nations with duty-free access to the world's largest consumer market. The announcement was made at a meeting in China with African ministers, where representatives accused the United States of disrupting the global economic and trade order. The plan expands on a policy announced at the 2024 FOCAC summit, granting zero-tariff treatment to least-developed African countries.</p>
