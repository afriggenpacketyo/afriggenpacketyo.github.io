          <p>Abercrombie & Fitch's shares increased significantly on Wednesday, despite the retailer lowering its profit forecast due to an anticipated $50 million impact from tariffs. The company now projects full-year earnings per share between $9.50 and $10.50, down from the previous range, and reduced its operating margin forecast. While the guidance includes the impact of tariffs on imports from China and other countries, Abercrombie reported fiscal first-quarter results that surpassed Wall Street's expectations for both earnings and revenue, with sales rising to a record high of $1.10 billion. The company is diversifying its sourcing network and seeking expense reductions to offset the tariff impact. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>HP's shares dropped 15% after the company reported second-quarter results that exceeded revenue estimates but fell short on earnings and guidance, partly due to tariffs imposed by President Donald Trump. The company's outlook reflects added costs driven by these tariffs, though HP is working to mitigate them by expanding its manufacturing footprint outside of China. HP's CEO, Enrique Lores, stated that the company has increased production in Vietnam, Thailand, India, Mexico, and the U.S., expecting to fully mitigate the trade-related costs by Q4. The company reported a revenue increase of 3.3% year-over-year, but net income decreased from the previous year. (not investment advice)</p>

Despite political tensions, Nvidia's growth is fueled by the demand for its AI chips, essential for applications like OpenAI's ChatGPT.

This success, along with Ghost's No. 1 LP "Skelet√°," suggests a resurgence of metal in mainstream music, driven by devoted fanbases and streaming numbers comparable to pop artists. Industry experts attribute this trend to the bands' ability to build online communities and create immersive experiences, appealing to a new generation of genre-agnostic listeners. The rise of these bands may also reflect a broader cultural shift towards escapism and a reaction against overexposure in the digital age.</p>

          <p>Charlie Woods, the 16-year-old son of Tiger Woods, clinched his first American Junior Golf Association (AJGA) title at the Team TaylorMade Invitational. Woods won by three shots, finishing at 15 under par after shooting a 6-under 66 in the final round. He is following in the footsteps of his father, who also had a successful junior golf career. The elder Woods has been sidelined since undergoing surgery in March to repair a ruptured achilles tendon.</p>
