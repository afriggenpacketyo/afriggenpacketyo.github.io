          <p>Daichi Kamada played a key role in Crystal Palace's 1-0 victory over Manchester City in the FA Cup final, marking the club's first major trophy since 1861. Kamada, previously a Europa League winner with Eintracht Frankfurt under current Palace manager Oliver Glasner, assisted in Eberechi Eze's winning goal. Dean Henderson's penalty save further secured the win for Palace. The victory also means Crystal Palace will play in next season's Europa League, while Manchester City finishes the season without a trophy for the first time since 2016-17.</p>

          <p>A rare dust storm swept across northwest Indiana and north-central Illinois, causing near-zero visibility and prompting the National Weather Service to issue warnings. The storm, originating near Bloomington, Ill., was caused by strong winds from thunderstorms lifting dry soil from parched farmland. Visibility dropped dramatically in Chicago, creating hazardous conditions. Similar dust storms have occurred in the past, including a deadly 2023 incident involving a 72-vehicle pileup. Experts attribute the severity of the storm to exceptionally dry soil conditions in the region.</p>

          <p>Hundreds of Rwandan refugees, who fled to eastern Congo after the 1994 genocide, have returned home after living in exile for decades. The repatriation, facilitated by the U.N. refugee agency, comes as Rwandan-backed rebels have seized key parts of the region. The returnees, mostly women and children, were transported to a transit center for assistance and reintegration. The refugees had fled Rwanda following the genocide, with many joining Congo's army, leading to decades of conflict in the mineral-rich region.</p>

          <p>The article highlights the challenges faced by Lieutenant Kateryna, Ukraine's only female combat pilot, as she navigates sexism within the military while flying helicopter missions against Russian troops. Despite an increase in women serving in the Ukrainian armed forces, stereotypes and marginalization persist. Lieutenant Kateryna, inspired by her father's military service, hopes to encourage more women to pursue combat roles, emphasizing the need for gender equality training and overcoming deeply rooted biases within the ranks.</p>

          <p>Britain and the European Union are set to hold a summit to reset their relationship, potentially including a defense pact, in response to the United States' retreat from global leadership. The two sides are expected to announce a defense and security agreement to bolster military security in Europe, as well as relax some trade rules and deepen energy cooperation. The summit aims to address common problems in an increasingly uncertain geopolitical environment, particularly in light of the Trump administration's policies.</p>

          <p>Chinese researchers have developed a fibre-optic gyroscope designed to improve navigation stability for aircraft, ships, and oil rigs. The device, created by the Tianjin Navigation Instruments Research Institute and Jinan University, measures orientation and turning rates without external signals, offering immunity to interference. Fibre-optic gyroscopes, including the interferometric type (IFOG), are utilized in military, civilian, and autonomous vehicle applications due to their simple structure and high resolution.</p>

          <p>The popularity of live shows in China and Hong Kong is fueling a tourism spending spree, as fans travel across the country to attend concerts and music festivals. Local governments are capitalizing on this trend by bundling concert tickets with discounted hotel, dining, and tourist bookings. This strategy aims to boost domestic consumption, which is a priority on Beijing‚Äôs economic agenda. For example, tickets to see Liu Yuxin in Chengdu granted concertgoers a 50 percent discount to see the famed Taoist mountain Qingchengshan.</p>
