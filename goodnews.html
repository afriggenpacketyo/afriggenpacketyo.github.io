        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Japan's Nikkei 225 stock index climbed to a new record high, crossing the 44,000 mark for the first time. The rally followed the resignation announcement of Prime Minister Shigeru Ishiba, which has fueled investor optimism for a new wave of fiscal stimulus to support the economy. Technology stocks, including Advantest and Tokyo Electron, led the gains. Analysts suggest that while short-term political uncertainty may cause volatility, the leadership change could lead to greater long-term stability and a pro-growth environment for Japanese equities.

        </div>
        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>For the first time, NHS trusts in England have been ranked in public league tables, with specialist institutions like Moorfields Eye Hospital taking the top spots. The new system, which will be updated quarterly, categorizes trusts into four performance tiers based on metrics such as waiting times and financial health. Health Secretary Wes Streeting stated the tables will help identify where support is needed, but the initiative has faced criticism. NHS Providers and the Nuffield Trust have raised concerns that the rankings may not accurately reflect quality of care and could lead to trusts focusing on metrics over patient needs.</p>

        </div>

          <p>A recent study indicates a 46% increase in cannabis use among Americans aged 65 and older between 2021 and 2023, as the stigma surrounding marijuana diminishes with widespread legalization. Many seniors are turning to cannabis for medicinal purposes, such as managing chronic pain and PTSD, as well as for relaxation. While users tout its benefits, some medical professionals express caution. Experts warn that THC, the main psychoactive compound, may pose cardiovascular health risks, including an increased chance of stroke and heart disease, regardless of whether it is smoked or ingested through edibles.</p>

          <p>Infielder Max Muncy has been activated from the injured list and was immediately placed back in the cleanup spot for the Los Angeles Dodgers. His return is seen as a significant boost for the team, which has been struggling offensively in his absence, posting a losing record while he recovered from an oblique injury. Muncy's presence is expected to add depth and power to the lineup. He is the first of several key players anticipated to return soon, including pitcher Alex Vesia and utility player Tommy Edman, as the Dodgers gear up for their playoff push.</p>

          <p>A port operator in northeastern China is establishing a new fruit transit center and a dedicated shipping service dubbed the "durian express" to accelerate imports of the popular fruit from Southeast Asia. The initiative aims to reduce shipping times to Dalian from as much as twelve days down to just six, ensuring greater freshness for consumers. This move targets the growing demand for durians in China's northeast, a market of roughly 100 million people that has been historically difficult to supply due to logistical challenges and its distance from traditional southern entry points.</p>

          <p>The California legislature has passed a bill aimed at closing a loophole that allows online dealers and brokers to sell dogs from commercial puppy mills. The legislation, AB 519, specifically bans online marketplaces and middlemen who misrepresent themselves as small, local breeders from selling puppies to California consumers. This move strengthens the state's 2019 law that prohibited pet stores from selling commercially bred dogs, extending protections to the growing online pet market. The bill, which now heads to the governor, is intended to increase transparency and prevent families from unknowingly purchasing sick or poorly bred animals.</p>

          <p>The FDA has approved this year's updated COVID-19 vaccines with narrower eligibility criteria, primarily targeting adults aged 65 and older and younger individuals with specific medical conditions that increase their risk of severe illness. While officials state that anyone can receive a vaccine after consulting a doctor, this shift may limit access for people who were previously eligible. The changes have created uncertainty regarding insurance coverage for those who do not meet the new criteria. Health care providers may still administer the vaccine "off-label," but this could be more difficult to access, particularly at pharmacies.</p>

As part of the agreement, Elkann and his two siblings will collectively pay €183 million to the tax agency, and he will perform one year of community service. The case relates to the estate of his grandmother, Marella Caracciolo. According to his lawyer, the settlement does not constitute an admission of liability and provides an opportunity to bring the matter to a definitive close, with prosecutors now seeking to drop the criminal case.</p>

A temporary order will also restrict the airspace over Windsor, prohibiting non-police drones and small aircraft from flying in the area during the visit.

McCullum clarified that the strategy is about creating an environment where players can handle the immense pressures of international cricket without being restricted. He emphasized that the goal is to unleash talent, not to be careless, and that the entire team is deeply determined to succeed.</p>

          <p>Norwegian Prime Minister Jonas Gahr Stoere has won a second term after his Labour Party emerged as the top vote-getter in the country's parliamentary election. With around 28% of the vote, Labour will be able to form a majority government with the support of four other left-leaning parties, securing a narrow majority of 87 seats in the 169-seat parliament. The election campaign was dominated by domestic concerns such as the rising cost of living, as well as the tumultuous state of international politics. The populist right-wing Progress Party also saw significant gains, doubling its score from the 2021 election.</p>

          <p>On his show, Jim Cramer reviewed several recent instances of market negativity that he believes were overhyped and ultimately proven wrong. He focused on pessimistic theories about major tech companies, such as the fear that Alphabet would be punitively broken up by a monopoly ruling, which did not happen. Cramer also noted that concerns about Amazon's web services falling behind and Apple's weak AI strategy have largely subsided as the market moved on to focus on other positives. He concluded that while it is easy to find something to worry about, these fears are often overblown. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>China has achieved significant environmental improvements alongside continued industrial growth, a strategy described as "industrialisation-driven decarbonisation." Over the past decade, the country has seen a dramatic reduction in air pollution, with average PM2.5 levels falling by over 35%, a feat that took the United States three decades to accomplish. This success is attributed not to deindustrialization but to massive investments in green technology, cutting-edge real-time environmental monitoring, and the widespread deployment of green infrastructure. Water quality has also seen substantial improvements, with over 90% of monitored sections now rated as good or fair.</p>
