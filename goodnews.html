          <p>President Donald Trump met with Syrian President Ahmed al-Sharaa in Saudi Arabia, a day after the U.S. lifted sanctions on Syria. The meeting, overseen by Saudi Crown Prince Mohammed bin Salman and joined by Turkish President Recep Tayyip Erdogan via phone, focused on Syria's potential to achieve historical progress. Trump encouraged al-Sharaa to sign onto the Abraham Accords, remove foreign terrorists, deport Palestinian terrorists, help prevent the resurgence of ISIS, and take responsibility for ISIS detention centers. The meeting signifies a shift in U.S. policy towards Syria.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>As part of a trade truce with the US, China is moderately relaxing export controls on some rare earth minerals, which are vital for hi-tech and aerospace hardware. This move reflects China's willingness to de-escalate tensions while maintaining control over these critical metals. The deal includes pausing or removing non-tariff countermeasures imposed since April 2, alongside lowering most tariffs for 90 days. This strategic relaxation is intended to provide the US with some breathing room without relinquishing China's control over these key resources.</p>

          <p>A radar image in Koniz, Switzerland, captured a duck speeding at 52 km/h in a 30 km/h zone. Authorities noted that a similar incident occurred in the same spot seven years earlier, leading them to believe the duck is a "notorious racer and repeat offender." Despite initial skepticism, officials confirmed the radar system's accuracy and the impossibility of image manipulation. The municipality humorously pondered the curious coincidence and the maximum flight speed of ducks.</p>
