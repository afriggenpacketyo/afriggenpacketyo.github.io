          <p>Nvidia plans to restart selling its H20 AI chips to Chinese clients after receiving assurances of license grants from the U.S. government. The move follows a halt in April for these chips, which were specifically designed to comply with export controls. This development is part of a broader preliminary trade agreement between Washington and Beijing, where the U.S. relaxes tech export controls in exchange for China resuming rare earth exports. Nvidia's CEO has been actively lobbying against the controls, citing a significant loss in market share.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>China's economy expanded by 5.2% in the second quarter, slightly exceeding market forecasts despite facing deflationary pressures and a housing downturn. However, key indicators like retail sales growth slowed, signaling insufficient domestic demand and underlying fragility in the consumer sector. The growth comes as Beijing implements stimulus measures to counter the impact of U.S. tariffs and support its export-oriented industries. Economists remain cautious, suggesting that further fiscal stimulus and structural reforms are necessary to ensure sustainable growth. (not investment advice)</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>The BBC's annual report on top earner salaries often omits many of its biggest stars due to a significant loophole in its disclosure rules. Presenters and actors on many popular shows are not directly employed by the BBC but by independent production companies, including the BBC's own commercial arm, BBC Studios. Because these entities compete in the commercial market, their talent payments are not subject to the same transparency requirements. This means the earnings of stars from shows like "Strictly Come Dancing" and "The Traitors" remain undisclosed to the public.</p>

          <p>A U.S. appeals court has issued a temporary stay, preventing the Trump administration from terminating the Temporary Protected Status (TPS) for thousands of Afghans residing in the country. The order comes in response to an emergency motion from an immigration advocacy group, which is challenging the administration's decision to end the protective status. The Department of Homeland Security had argued in April that conditions in Afghanistan no longer warranted the protection for the more than 70,000 Afghans who arrived after the 2021 Taliban takeover. The court's block will remain in effect while it considers the case further.</p>

          <p>The Los Angeles County Sheriff’s Department has recovered an assault rifle and ammunition that went missing after likely falling from a moving patrol car. The department issued a public appeal for help, detailing the route the deputies had taken when the weapon was lost. A resident in the Lennox area found the black hard-shelled case, initially thinking it might contain a musical instrument, and responsibly turned it in to a local sheriff's station. The department expressed deep gratitude for the community member's honesty and integrity in returning the powerful weapon.</p>

          <p>Chinese researchers have developed a new manufacturing technique that could significantly improve the performance of its aircraft engines, a critical component for its next-generation fighter jets. The team at Dalian University of Technology created a method for rapidly cooling forged superalloy turbine discs, which are essential for engine power and durability. These discs must withstand extreme temperatures and pressures, and improving their quality has been a long-standing challenge for China's aerospace industry. This could help close the gap with Western countries in high-performance military aircraft.</p>

          <p>The U.S. Department of Justice has formally urged the Supreme Court to deny Ghislaine Maxwell's appeal of her sex-trafficking conviction. Maxwell, who is serving a 20-year sentence, argued that a 2007 non-prosecution agreement with Jeffrey Epstein should have barred her own prosecution. However, the DOJ contends that the agreement was limited to a specific Florida district and did not have the authority to bind other federal jurisdictions. Prosecutors also stated that Maxwell was at most an incidental beneficiary, as her central role was not fully known when the deal was made.</p>

          <p>The Port of Los Angeles experienced its busiest June on record, driven by a surge of imports as businesses raced to get goods into the U.S. ahead of President Trump's tariff deadlines. Port officials described the 8% year-over-year increase as a "tariff whipsaw effect," with companies trying to avoid higher costs on Chinese goods. While the spike boosted current traffic, executives predict a slowdown in the coming months once new tariffs are in place, reflecting ongoing uncertainty in global trade. Importers noted the significant financial burden the tariffs have already placed on their businesses. (not investment advice)</p>
