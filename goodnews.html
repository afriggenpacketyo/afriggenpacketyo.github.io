          <div class="timestamp">2025-08-16 09:20:21 EDT</div>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Samsung's share of the U.S. smartphone market has increased, narrowing the gap with industry leader Apple. This shift is largely attributed to the growing popularity of Samsung's innovative foldable phones, such as the Z Fold and Z Flip models, which offer new form factors compared to the traditional iPhone design. While tariffs and a wider range of price points also contribute to Samsung's gains, analysts suggest Apple may respond with its own foldable device in the coming years to reclaim momentum and explore higher price points. The renewed competition highlights a significant challenge for Apple in the domestic market for the first time in over a decade. (not investment advice)</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Columbia University-trained psychologist Becky Kennedy suggests three practical steps for developing emotional endurance, which is the ability to withstand stress without being overcome by negative emotions. She advises using a visual aid to understand that learning and growth occur in the often-frustrating space between knowing and not knowing. Kennedy also emphasizes the power of positive self-talk to reframe internal dialogues and build confidence, even if it feels unnatural at first. Finally, she recommends taking on small, manageable experiments that push you out of your comfort zone to incrementally build tolerance for discomfort.</p>

          <p>Following his meeting with Russian President Vladimir Putin in Alaska, President Donald Trump announced he will meet with Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy at the White House on Monday. Trump stated on Truth Social that the goal is to pursue a direct "Peace Agreement" rather than a temporary ceasefire, which he claims often fails. The announcement came after the Alaska summit concluded without a concrete deal, though Trump described it as "very successful." European leaders were briefed on the Putin meeting and expressed support for U.S. involvement in providing security guarantees for Ukraine as part of any potential peace deal.</p>

        </div>
        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>A recent Gallup survey reveals that only 54% of Americans report drinking alcohol, the lowest percentage since the question was first asked in 1939. This trend is accompanied by a decline in reported drinking frequency and growing public concern over alcohol's health impacts, with a majority now viewing even moderate consumption as unhealthy. The article highlights that this shift is particularly pronounced among underage individuals, where drinking rates have fallen sharply since the 1990s. While reduced alcohol consumption has significant public health benefits, some concern exists that it may be linked to a broader decline in social interaction.</p>

          <p>Activist investment firm Engine Capital has taken an approximately 3% stake in life sciences company Avantor and is publicly urging its board to implement significant changes to address chronic underperformance. In a letter, Engine Capital outlined a plan that includes focusing on operational excellence, reducing costs, optimizing the company's portfolio through divestitures, and refreshing the board of directors. The activist firm argues that self-inflicted mistakes, poor capital allocation on overpriced acquisitions, and a lack of leadership accountability have destroyed shareholder value. Engine suggests that if a standalone turnaround is not viable, the board should consider an outright sale of the company. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>The Prince and Princess of Wales, William and Catherine, are planning to move to a new residence, Forest Lodge, located in Windsor Great Park. The eight-bedroom home is a short distance from their current main residence, Adelaide Cottage, and will allow their three children to continue attending the nearby Lambrook School. The family moved to Adelaide Cottage from Kensington Palace in August 2022. Forest Lodge, which underwent a £1.5 million restoration in 2001, features original stonework and elaborate historical details. The move marks another adjustment in the royal family's living arrangements.</p>

          <p>Grace Chambers, a 97-year-old from Belfast, has set a new European record by becoming the oldest person to complete 250 Parkrun events. She achieved the milestone at Ormeau Park just four weeks after undergoing heart surgery, demonstrating remarkable resilience and determination. Chambers began participating in the 5k community runs in 2016 at the age of 88 and has since become a beloved local figure, inspiring fellow runners. Her cardiologist and local volunteers praised her incredible spirit, though Chambers herself humbly downplayed the achievement, hoping it simply inspires others to start running.</p>

          <p>Yara Souza, an American student from Newcastle University, discovered a rare gold artifact dating back to the 9th century during her very first archaeological excavation. The find occurred in Redesdale, Northumberland, near the route of a major Roman road. The decorative object, about 1.5 inches long, is believed to have been used by elites for religious or ceremonial purposes and may be part of a pair with a similar item found nearby in 2021. Archaeologists involved in the dig described the discovery as exciting and of exceptional quality, offering new insights into the use of the ancient thoroughfare long after the Roman era.</p>

          <p>A Ukrainian weapons company called Fold is developing a new generation of first-person-view (FPV) drones connected by a fiber-optic cable, making them immune to Russian electronic warfare jamming. The company aims to extend the drone's range to nearly 100 kilometers, a significant increase from current models, to strike high-value targets located further behind the front lines. This technology is crucial as the nature of the battlefield has shifted, with a wider "gray zone" between forces. While longer cables present technical challenges, the development represents a key innovation in Ukraine's effort to maintain a technological edge in the ongoing conflict.</p>

          <p>Baltimore has achieved a dramatic reduction in violent crime, with its homicide rate falling to the lowest level in five decades. This success is attributed to a comprehensive, data-driven strategy that moves beyond traditional policing to focus on targeted intervention. The city's approach identifies individuals most at risk of violence and offers them intensive support services, such as housing and job training, coupled with the credible threat of law enforcement action if they refuse help. This "carrot and stick" model, combining social work with focused deterrence, has produced a 95% non-revictimization rate among participants.</p>

          <p>According to a recent survey, Americans on average believe that 27 is the ideal age to begin saving for retirement, with a goal of retiring by 58. However, certified financial planners recommend starting even earlier to fully leverage the power of compound interest. While starting in one's late 20s is considered doable, it requires more aggressive savings to meet retirement goals. The article notes that many older Americans regret not starting to save sooner, and data shows younger generations like Gen Z and millennials are beginning to save earlier than their predecessors, emphasizing that time is a critical factor.
