          <p>The Los Angeles Dodgers suffered a 3-0 loss to the Arizona Diamondbacks, highlighting their offensive struggles despite entering a favorable stretch of their schedule. Blake Snell, the Dodgers' starting pitcher, gave up three runs, while the offense managed only three hits against Zac Gallen. The Dodgers' inability to capitalize on opportunities against the Diamondbacks' bullpen further contributed to the defeat, snapping their four-game winning streak. Despite the loss, Freddie Freeman and Alex Call returned to action after missing a previous game due to injuries, providing a slight boost to the team.

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>A federal judge has temporarily blocked the Trump administration from expanding the use of expedited removal for undocumented migrants detained in the U.S., a setback to Trump's deportation plans. Judge Jia Cobb argued that the expanded use of expedited removal may infringe on due process rights, stating that the government's argument that undocumented migrants are entitled to no process under the Fifth Amendment is startling. The ruling halts the fast-track deportation of migrants who have been in the U.S. for less than two years, a policy expanded by the Trump administration. Cobb's decision mandates that the government must afford due process to those subjected to expedited removal, a ruling that could benefit hundreds of thousands of people.

The brothers beat the previous record of 162 days, set by Fyodor Konyukhov in 2014, and raised over £700,000 for clean water projects in Madagascar.

          <p>A 10-mile stretch of Angeles Crest Highway has reopened to the public after being closed for years due to storm damage, just in time for Labor Day weekend.

New guardrails, retaining walls, and drainage systems were installed at a cost of approximately $7.9 million.

          <p>Live-fire military training has sparked hundreds of wildfires across the UK countryside since 2023, with unexploded shells often hindering firefighting efforts. Figures show that 385 out of 439 wildfires on Ministry of Defence (MoD) land were caused by present-day army maneuvers. Locals near the sites feel the MoD needs to do more to prevent fires, including banning live fire training in the driest months. The MoD stated it has a robust wildfire policy and monitors risk levels, but old unexploded ordnance from previous maneuvers makes fighting the fires more challenging.
