          <p>Historian Martin Powers explains how examining Chinese art provides unique insights into historical societal norms and political ideas, often clarifying what textual records alone cannot. He argues that art "participates" in political debate, illustrating how images of authority in aristocracies, both Eastern and Western, depict dominant figures over subordinates, reflecting concepts like Montesquieu's "honor" and arbitrary privilege. This article delves into the enduring relevance of ancient Chinese political thought for understanding contemporary Western societies. Powers emphasizes that such visual evidence reveals widespread cultural understandings that might otherwise be overlooked, demonstrating art's critical role in conveying ideas about intergroup relations and power structures across different eras.</p>

          <p>Market analyst Jim Cramer discusses the current speculative bull market, noting its resilience even against government shutdowns and the "post-Liberation Day" rally following a brief market dip after Trump's tariff announcements. He attributes the market's strength to a new generation of buyers chasing high-growth, often unprofitable, future-oriented stocks, and the exceptional performance of companies like Nvidia, which he calls the "greatest stock of all time." Despite the perceived "year of magical investing," Cramer advises investors to take some profits off the table, suggesting it's prudent to secure gains even when confidence is high and the market seems unstoppable. He emphasizes that even magic can eventually fade. (not investment advice)</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>The UK government has announced significant housing market reforms aimed at cutting costs, reducing delays, and halving failed property sales, which currently cost the UK economy an estimated £1.5 billion annually. Housing Secretary Steve Reed stated the changes would "fix the broken system" and save first-time buyers an average of £710, while shortening typical property transaction times by up to four weeks. Proposals include legally requiring sellers and agents to provide key property information upfront, and potentially introducing binding contracts to prevent late withdrawals. This article highlights the government's commitment to boosting professional standards across the sector and building 1.5 million new homes as part of its broader housing strategy.</p>

          <p>This opinion article argues that China, having been the world's largest exporter for 16 years, should now pivot its economic strategy to become the world's largest importer within the next five to ten years. The author suggests this shift would mark a pivotal evolution, moving towards a consumption-driven economy and addressing structural imbalances that historically prioritized investment and exports over domestic demand. This strategic reorientation is presented as crucial for China's goal of becoming a "modern socialist country" and would carry profound geopolitical and economic implications globally. The article highlights that the upcoming 15th five-year plan offers a critical opportunity for Beijing to chart this new course, focusing on "consumed in China" rather than "made in China."</p>

          <p>A federal judge in Oregon, Karin Immergut, temporarily blocked the Trump administration's deployment of the National Guard to Portland, ruling that the president lacked a "colorable basis" for the action. The judge, a Trump appointee, found that protests at the Portland immigration facility were "not significantly violent or disruptive" and that the president's determination was "untethered to the facts." This article highlights the court's emphasis on constitutional principles regarding federal-state relations and military involvement in domestic law enforcement, stating that the decision goes "to the heart of what it means to live under the rule of law." The ruling was praised by Oregon officials, while the White House indicated an appeal.</p>

          <p>At their annual conference in Manchester, the UK Conservative party is extensively invoking Margaret Thatcher's legacy to inspire a political comeback, celebrating 100 years since her birth. Leader Kemi Badenoch, facing low poll numbers after a recent election defeat, is reportedly studying Thatcher's early years for inspiration. The article explores how contemporary Tories are debating applying Thatcherite principles to modern challenges, such as reining in "lanyard classes" in government bodies and addressing the energy industry's reliance on public subsidies. This strategy aims to rebuild the party's reputation for economic competence and distinguish itself from rivals like Labour and Reform UK, focusing on economic policy as their "unique selling proposition."</p>
