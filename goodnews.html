In Hong Kong, the Hang Seng index rose, boosted by a strong debut from automaker Chery and gains from Xiaomi after it unveiled new devices.

He created a brew named 'Paris Gold' to manifest his goal of winning at the recent Paralympics, a feat he successfully achieved while also setting a new world record. Now, Pembroke is working with a commercial brewery to scale up his home brewing, with plans for a new beer themed around the upcoming Milan Winter Games.

          <p>A woman whose body was found in Spain over 20 years ago has been identified as 31-year-old Russian national Liudmila Zavada, thanks to an international police initiative. Her body was discovered in July 2005 near Barcelona under suspicious circumstances, but her identity remained unknown until now. The breakthrough came through 'Operation Identify Me,' an Interpol-led campaign that publicly releases information on unidentified bodies to generate new leads. Turkish police matched her fingerprints to a national database, and a DNA match with a relative in Russia subsequently confirmed her identity, reopening the investigation into her death.</p>

          <p>Liverpool midfielder Ryan Gravenberch is being hailed as one of Europe's best in his position following a remarkable transformation under manager Arne Slot. After a challenging season at Bayern Munich and an indifferent start at Liverpool, Gravenberch has flourished, becoming a key player in the team's perfect start to the season. Slot has utilized him in a holding role while granting him more attacking freedom, leading to a significant increase in his offensive contributions. Pundits credit Slot's trust and tactical adjustments for unlocking the Dutch player's full potential, fulfilling the promise he showed as a young talent at Ajax.</p>

The state's active purchasing is seen as a key factor in a major stock benchmark reaching a decade high, reflecting the government's emphasis on financial stability.

          <p>The Los Angeles Dodgers secured a 5-4 extra-innings victory over the Arizona Diamondbacks, reducing their magic number to clinch the division title to one. The win was marked by an unconventional strategy that saw starting pitchers Roki Sasaki and Clayton Kershaw deliver crucial scoreless innings from the bullpen. After the traditional relievers surrendered a three-run lead in the eighth inning, Kershaw made his first relief appearance since 2019 to get the game to extras. A timely RBI single from Tommy Edman in the 11th inning ultimately sealed the resilient win for the team.</p>

          <p>A federal judge has ruled that the Trump administration cannot constitutionally require states to cooperate with federal immigration enforcement as a condition for receiving certain FEMA grants. The ruling is a victory for 20 states that sued the administration, arguing that critical emergency preparedness funding was being illegally withheld to punish so-called "sanctuary" jurisdictions. U.S. District Judge William Smith found the policy to be "arbitrary and capricious and unconstitutional," stating that the potential loss of disaster funds would cause irreparable harm. The decision marks a significant legal setback for the administration's efforts to compel local cooperation on immigration.</p>
