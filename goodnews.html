          <p>After being secretly filmed by a cyclist while jogging in Cologne, Yanni Gentsch confronted the man and recorded the encounter, which went viral. Discovering that German law doesn't criminalize filming clothed body parts for sexual purposes, she launched a petition to change the criminal code. The petition has garnered over 125,000 signatures and has initiated a national conversation, earning the support of regional justice ministers who are now expected to discuss amending the law to better protect victims of voyeurism.</p>

          <p>Nottingham Forest's return to European football after a 30-year absence will see them face Swedish club Malmo in the Europa League's league phase.

In the tournament's 36-team league format, each club will play eight games, four at home and four away, before the knockout stages begin.</p>

          <p>As the Formula 1 season resumed after its summer break, McLaren driver Lando Norris topped the timesheets in the first practice session for the Dutch Grand Prix. He led a one-two for the team, finishing just under three-tenths of a second ahead of his teammate, Oscar Piastri. The performance suggests a strong start for McLaren, with Norris appearing to have an advantage in both single-lap pace and longer race simulations. Aston Martin's Lance Stroll secured an impressive third-fastest time, slightly ahead of his teammate Fernando Alonso.</p>

          <p>Beginning in January of next year, all young children in the UK will be offered a free chickenpox vaccine on the National Health Service. The vaccine will be administered in two doses at 12 and 18 months of age, combined with the existing MMR jab. This public health initiative aims to protect children from the rare but severe complications of the virus and to reduce the economic impact of parents taking time off work. Previously, parents had to pay up to £200 for the vaccine privately.</p>

          <p>Elon Musk's legal team has filed a motion to dismiss a lawsuit from the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC). The lawsuit alleges Musk illegally saved about $150 million by failing to disclose his growing stake in Twitter (now X) within the required 10-day timeframe in 2022. Musk's lawyers argue the lawsuit is a waste of resources, claiming there was no investor harm, no ongoing violation, and that the late filing was corrected immediately. They also accuse the SEC of selectively targeting Musk due to his criticism of the government.</p>

          <p>Alibaba reported better-than-expected net income for its June quarter, largely driven by a 26% year-on-year revenue increase in its cloud computing division fueled by strong AI demand. The Chinese tech giant also saw continued recovery in its domestic and international e-commerce businesses, although overall revenues slightly missed analyst forecasts. However, profitability in its core commerce unit declined due to heavy investment in the highly competitive "instant commerce" space, reflecting the company's strategy of balancing growth initiatives with market pressures.

          <p>India's economy demonstrated robust growth in the first quarter of the 2026 fiscal year, expanding at an annual rate of 7.8%. This figure significantly exceeded the 6.7% growth that economists had forecasted in a Reuters poll. The strong performance was attributed to solid results in the manufacturing, construction, and service sectors. This continues a trend of strong growth for the nation, which had expanded at 7.4% in the preceding quarter, reinforcing its position as a rapidly growing major economy. (not investment advice)</p>

This push aligns with President Trump's recent embrace of the digital asset industry, where he has branded himself as the first "crypto president" and filled his administration with crypto advocates.

The actions are a response to Trump administration policies that organizers say attack workers' rights and benefit the wealthy. Protests will target measures such as attempts to rescind collective bargaining for federal workers and cuts to minimum wage requirements. The widespread mobilization aims to channel strong public support for unions into a visible opposition movement.</p>

The hotline, staffed by the Legal Council for Health Justice, will assist with legal needs such as healthcare access and changing gender markers on documents, sending a message that Illinois is committed to protecting its LGBTQ+ residents.</p>

          <p>Higher-income households return a larger percentage of their retail purchases compared to middle- and lower-income shoppers, according to a new report from the Bank of America Institute. In 2025, wealthy shoppers refunded 5.3% of their purchases, likely due to a practice called "bracketing," where they buy multiple variations of an item with the intent to return most of them. This behavior is easier for those with more disposable income. The trend comes as retailers, facing high costs associated with returns, are increasingly tightening their policies by charging fees or shortening return windows.</p>

          <p>A growing number of large, historic "trophy" ranches in the American West are being put on the market for the first time in generations. High-end real estate brokers report that as family trees expand, heirs are often scattered geographically and disagree on the future of the properties, choosing to sell and cash out instead. These legacy ranches are in high demand from wealthy buyers seeking privacy and a rural lifestyle, fueled in part by the "Yellowstone" effect. The trend marks a significant transfer of generational wealth and iconic real estate.</p>
