          <p>Zijin Gold's shares experienced a surge of over 60% during their Hong Kong trading debut, following the company's nearly $3.2 billion IPO. This made it the second-largest IPO globally this year, trailing only CATL. The debut was initially delayed due to Super Typhoon Ragasa. The surge in Zijin Gold's valuation is attributed to the rising gold prices amid safe-haven demand and global economic uncertainties, with spot gold reaching a new all-time high. Zijin Gold's IPO contributes to Hong Kong's IPO market resurgence, and the company is the overseas gold-mining arm of China's Zijin Mining, with investors including GIC, HHLRA, and BlackRock Funds.

          <p>Asia-Pacific markets exhibited mixed trading patterns as China's manufacturing activity contracted for the sixth consecutive month, according to official data, although the contraction was less severe than anticipated. The Manufacturing Purchasing Managers' Index (PMI) came in at 49.8, slightly above expectations. Investors are closely monitoring the Reserve Bank of Australia's (RBA) upcoming interest rate decision, with expectations leaning towards a steady cash rate at 3.6% due to persistent high inflation. Shier Lee Lim of Convera noted that any shift in the RBA's tone could impact AUD crosses, especially after recent volatility in building approvals. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>China's official gauge for manufacturing activity indicated a contraction in September, although the contraction was smaller than expected, reflecting Beijing's efforts to curb industrial overcapacity. The Manufacturing Purchasing Managers' Index (PMI) came in at 49.8, slightly above Reuters' poll expectations of 49.6. China's official manufacturing PMI has remained below the 50-benchmark since April, as manufacturers grapple with tepid domestic demand and the impact of higher U.S. tariffs. Private surveyor RatingDog's manufacturing purchasing managers' index, however, showed expansion, coming in at 51.2 for September.</p>

          <p>Stef Reid, a Paralympic athlete who had her right foot amputated after a boat accident, is advocating for major brands like Nike, Adidas, and Puma to sell single shoes instead of pairs. Reid argues that this change would benefit amputees and individuals with different-sized feet, reducing waste and costs associated with buying two shoes when only one is needed. She notes that while brands often display models with prosthetic blades, they don't cater to the actual buying needs of athletes like herself. Reid's campaign aims to align inclusive imagery with practical purchasing experiences for people with disabilities.</p>

          <p>An opinion piece argues that situating the UN's Asia headquarters in Hong Kong could aid the organization's reforms and bolster Beijing's vision of global governance. The article suggests that Hong Kong, with its adoption of English, common law practices, and low corporate taxes, is uniquely positioned to facilitate China's engagement with the UN. It highlights the International Organisation for Mediation as an example of Hong Kong's potential. The piece suggests that instead of focusing on telling China's story to the world, Hong Kong should bring the world to China.</p>

          <p>A federal judge has temporarily suspended the Trump administration's plan to eliminate hundreds of jobs at the U.S. Agency for Global Media, which oversees Voice of America. Judge Royce Lamberth ruled that the agency cannot implement a reduction in force eliminating 532 jobs, preserving the status quo until he rules on a motion to block the cuts. The judge accused the administration of showing "concerning disrespect" toward the court in response to earlier orders. Employees who sued to block the dismantling of VOA argued that the planned cuts would hinder the judge's ability to enforce his injunction.</p>

          <p>Mumbai's new Navi Mumbai International Airport (NMIA) is set to open soon, aiming to ease congestion in India's financial capital, where the existing airport has reached its capacity. NMIA, spread over 1,100 hectares, is connected to Mumbai by India's longest sea-bridge and will eventually handle 90 million passengers per year. The airport is designed to be a hub with advanced technology for check-in, security, and baggage handling, but faces challenges regarding connectivity and regulatory issues. Analysts expect strong airline uptake for NMIA's parking slots, but inconvenience to passengers due to its distance from the city and regulatory hurdles could impede its ambition to become an international hub.</p>

          <p>The NFL has announced that Bad Bunny will headline the Super Bowl LX halftime show, a decision that has sparked criticism from conservative commentators. Critics have pointed to Bad Bunny's predominantly Spanish-language music, his support for Kamala Harris, and his stance against immigration sweeps as reasons for their disapproval. Bad Bunny's decision to join the Super Bowl lineup follows his statements about not including U.S. dates on his tour due to concerns about ICE agents targeting his fans. The NFL partnered with Jay Z's Roc Nation in 2019 to produce its Super Bowl halftime shows.</p>

In distinguishing China’s approach from that of the US toward trade with Global South countries, Xie highlighted that “China also offered zero-tariff treatment, or 100 per cent tariff refunds, to all least-developed countries maintaining diplomatic relations with it.”</p>

The plan focuses on optimizing the industrial structure to achieve an average annual growth rate of about 5% in value-added output. The plan also calls for advances in the exploration of key metals and enhanced recycling of used batteries and solar panels.</p>
