        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>The United States and China have reportedly established a framework deal concerning the social media platform TikTok. Treasury Secretary Scott Bessent confirmed the commercial terms have been agreed upon between the private parties involved. President Donald Trump and Chinese President Xi Jinping are scheduled to meet on Friday to finalize the details. This development comes amid a looming deadline for TikTok's parent company, ByteDance, to divest its U.S. operations or face a nationwide ban, a measure that has been repeatedly postponed by executive orders.</p>

          <p>Despite geopolitical tensions and other challenges, there are signs that younger Europeans are increasingly considering career opportunities in China. This renewed interest is driven by the country's rapid growth in technology and infrastructure, particularly in cities like Shenzhen and Shanghai. The article suggests a generational divide, with younger individuals being more curious and open to the prospect of working in China's dynamic environment compared to older generations. This trend marks a cautious reversal of the foreign exodus seen during the country's stringent COVID-19 restrictions.</p>

          <p>Following widespread, youth-led anti-corruption protests that resulted in the prime minister's resignation, former chief justice Sushila Karki has been appointed as Nepal's first female interim prime minister. The 73-year-old is known for her integrity and lifelong pursuit of justice, making her a consensus choice among protest leaders and civil society. Her immediate challenges include overseeing the rebuilding of public structures destroyed in the unrest and ensuring fresh elections are held on schedule. The international community has broadly welcomed her appointment as a stabilizing force.</p>

        </div>
        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>With the Federal Reserve expected to cut interest rates, mortgage experts are offering guidance to prospective homebuyers. They recommend immediately getting a fresh pre-approval to reflect increased buying power and promptly comparing offers from multiple lenders to secure the best terms. Conversely, they advise against assuming rates will continue to fall, which can backfire, and warn against overextending one's budget simply because a lower rate allows for a larger loan. Disciplined and prompt action is key to navigating the competitive market that often follows a rate cut. (not investment advice)</p>

          <div class="timestamp">2025-09-15 09:46:17 EDT</div>
        </div>
        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>President Donald Trump has suggested that U.S. companies should move from reporting earnings every quarter to every six months. In a social media post, he argued that a semiannual system would save money and encourage corporate managers to focus on long-term strategy rather than short-term profits. The idea echoes previous proposals from business leaders like Warren Buffett and Jamie Dimon, who have criticized the unhealthy focus on short-term results prompted by quarterly guidance. Any such change would require approval from the Securities and Exchange Commission or an act of Congress. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>Ford Motor Co. is moving its world headquarters to a new innovation campus in Dearborn and plans to demolish its current iconic headquarters, known as the "Glass House."

This move is part of a broader strategy to modernize and optimize Ford's extensive real estate portfolio in the Detroit area.

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>While a majority of job seekers now use AI in their application process, career coaches are cautioning against its uncritical use for creating resumes and cover letters. Experts note that AI tools are prone to "hallucinating" or fabricating information to match job descriptions and often produce generic, keyword-stuffed text that lacks authenticity. They advise applicants to write their own drafts first and use AI for polishing and proofreading, rather than generation, to avoid embarrassing errors and ensure they can speak confidently about every point on their resume during an interview.</p>

The race is shaping up to be a contest between the city's political establishment and its ascendant progressive wing, testing whether Mejia's outsider appeal remains potent now that he is the incumbent.</p>

This clean energy segment is expanding rapidly, with a project backlog nearly equal to its current capacity. This focus on wind and solar power is what fuels the company's impressive 10% annualized dividend growth, distinguishing it from more traditional, slower-growing utility stocks.

          <p>A data analysis shows that African nations are increasingly vital to the global supply of critical minerals essential for green technologies, such as cobalt, platinum, and manganese. This resource wealth could boost the continent's GDP by 12% over the next 25 years, representing a transformative economic opportunity. However, the report also highlights significant challenges, including fragile governance, environmental degradation from mining, and inequitable revenue sharing. Currently, African countries are estimated to be generating only about 40% of the potential revenue from the extraction of these valuable minerals.</p>

          <p>Germany has launched a €100 million pilot project to address the massive environmental threat posed by 1.6 million tons of World War II ammunition rusting on the floors of the Baltic and North Seas. The decaying munitions are leaking toxic substances, such as TNT, into the marine ecosystem and also pose a risk of spontaneous explosion. A specialized mobile platform is being used off the coast of Boltenhagen to test methods for safely recovering the ordnance. The long-term goal is to develop automated, sea-based systems to recover and destroy the ammunition.</p>
