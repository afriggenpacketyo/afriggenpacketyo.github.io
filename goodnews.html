          <p>Several Afghan families have successfully arrived in Germany from Pakistan after a prolonged wait for visas, despite a tougher immigration stance from the current German government. These arrivals include former employees of German institutions and others at risk of persecution by the Taliban. The Merz government had previously paused resettlement plans, but a court ruling affirmed its right to stop issuing visas, suggesting those who arrived may have succeeded through legal challenges. This development occurs as Chancellor Friedrich Merz campaigns in North Rhine-Westphalia ahead of local elections, downplaying their significance as a test for his federal coalition.</p>

          <p>Actor Dwayne Johnson has detailed his physically and emotionally demanding transformation to portray MMA fighter Mark Kerr in the new sports drama, "The Smashing Machine." Johnson admitted to feeling genuine fear about his ability to perform the role, a feeling he hadn't experienced in his career for a long time. He underwent hours of prosthetic application daily to embody Kerr, whose struggles with addiction resonated with Johnson's own experiences losing friends. The film, which also stars Emily Blunt, explores the volatile relationship between Kerr and his then-girlfriend, Dawn Staples.</p>

          <p>Liverpool has reached an agreement with Crystal Palace to sign 25-year-old England center-back Marc Guehi, who will finalize the move after a medical in London. The deal comes as part of a significant spending spree for the Premier League champions, pushing their summer transfer total to a record-breaking £451.2 million. Guehi's signing is intended to bolster Liverpool's defense, which has appeared vulnerable in early-season matches. The defender captained Palace in his final game, scoring in a 3-0 victory over Aston Villa on Sunday.</p>

          <p>German Foreign Minister Johann Wadephul is visiting India to deepen bilateral cooperation in trade, technology, and security, framing India as a crucial strategic partner in the Indo-Pacific. Amid global economic shifts and US trade policies, Germany aims to bolster a relationship that has seen trade grow to a record $33 billion in 2024, though this figure is still dwarfed by German-Chinese commerce. Discussions are expected to cover migration, research, and defense, including a potential deal for Germany to help build six advanced submarines for India, signaling a significant shift in their strategic engagement.</p>

          <p>The Shanghai Cooperation Organisation (SCO) has approved a development strategy extending to 2035, aimed at promoting a multipolar world order and strengthening security and economic cooperation among its member states. Speaking after a summit in Tianjin, Chinese Foreign Minister Wang Yi stated the plan sets a clear direction for the bloc, which includes China, Russia, and India. The summit's joint declaration emphasized opposition to unilateral actions and bullying, an implicit criticism of U.S. trade and sanctions policies. The strategy comes as the regional bloc acknowledges increasing threats posed by escalating geopolitical tensions.</p>

          <p>A solar eruption over the weekend is expected to create a geomagnetic storm, potentially making the aurora borealis, or northern lights, visible across parts of Canada and 18 U.S. states on Monday night into early Tuesday. According to NOAA's Space Weather Prediction Center, the colorful display could be seen in states as far south as Illinois and Oregon. While not predicted to be as intense as the major storms of 2024, it offers a prime viewing opportunity. For the best chance of seeing the lights, experts recommend finding a dark location away from city lights between 2 a.m. and 5 a.m. ET.</p>

          <h2>Financial Coach Argues Against Homeownership if a 15-Year Mortgage is Unaffordable</h2>

        </div>
        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Self-made millionaire and financial coach Bernadette Joy advises that prospective homebuyers who cannot afford the payments on a 15-year mortgage are not truly ready for homeownership. She argues that with a traditional 30-year mortgage, homeowners build very little equity in the initial years as most of the payment goes toward interest. Joy also cautions against underestimating the hidden costs of owning a home, such as furnishing larger spaces, higher utility bills, and unexpected maintenance, which average over $8,800 annually. She recommends a budget where total living expenses, including a mortgage, do not exceed 50% of income. (not investment advice)</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>ScotRail, the government-owned operator in Scotland, has permanently scrapped peak-time fares, meaning passengers will no longer pay higher prices for travel on busy weekday trains. The move aims to encourage more commuters to switch from cars to trains and is expected to reduce some fares, like Edinburgh to Glasgow, by nearly 50%. The policy follows a pilot scheme in 2023 that was initially deemed too costly to continue but was revived by First Minister John Swinney. The government anticipates the scheme will cost £40m to £45m annually, which will be covered by the ScotRail budget if not offset by increased passenger revenue.</p>

          <p>Amid concerns of a potential crisis in the UK government bond (gilts) market, an analyst outlines several bold measures the government and the Bank of England could take. The article notes that UK long-term bond yields have risen more than their US counterparts, creating a puzzle for investors. To restore confidence and avoid a "doom loop," the author suggests credible fiscal projections, significant tax reform such as a land tax, pro-growth policies like rejoining the EU customs union, and allowing the Bank of England to set its own inflation target.

The only new face on the 12-man team is Rasmus Hojgaard, who replaces his twin brother Nicolai.

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>As interest rates show signs of potentially falling, financial experts suggest that short-term Certificates of Deposit (CDs) are currently offering the most attractive returns for savers. Six-month CDs are identified as a "sweet spot," often providing higher Annual Percentage Yields (APYs) than longer-term options, which is a reversal of historical trends. For those with a longer time horizon, experts recommend a CD laddering strategy, which involves spreading funds across multiple CDs with varying maturities to lock in current high rates while maintaining periodic access to cash.

          <p>During a meeting at the Shanghai Cooperation Organisation summit, Indian Prime Minister Narendra Modi and Russian President Vladimir Putin discussed deepening bilateral cooperation in all sectors. This signals that New Delhi is unlikely to reduce its crude oil imports from Russia, despite significant pressure and recent tariff hikes from the United States. Modi described the meeting as "excellent" and highlighted discussions on trade, fertilizers, and security. The continued strong relationship comes as Putin is expected to visit India in December for their annual summit, while a planned U.S. presidential visit has reportedly been canceled over the oil issue.</p>

          <p>Scientists have confirmed that humans can build rapport with cats by mimicking their "slow blink" behavior, an expression often interpreted as a cat's smile. A 2020 study published in Scientific Reports conducted two experiments which found that cats are more likely to slow-blink back at and approach humans who first narrow their eyes and blink slowly at them. This applies to both familiar cats and strangers, suggesting the gesture is a positive form of cat-human communication that signals friendliness. The technique offers a simple way for owners and others to enhance their bond with felines.</p>
