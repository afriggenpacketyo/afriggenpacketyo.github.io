          <p>Three brothers from Edinburgh, Jamie, Ewan, and Lachlan MacLean, have successfully set a new world record by rowing unsupported across the Pacific Ocean in 140 days. Their 9,000-mile journey from Peru to Australia broke the previous record of 162 days. The brothers overcame significant challenges, including violent tropical storms that forced detours and even swept one of them overboard, though he was safely recovered. The record-breaking feat also served as a fundraiser, raising over £700,000 for clean water projects in Madagascar.</p>

          <p>A 10-mile section of the Angeles Crest Highway in Southern California has reopened to the public just before Labor Day weekend after a prolonged closure. The scenic route was shut down due to significant damage from slope failures, rock slides, and collapsed pavement caused by severe winter storms in 2022 and 2023, as well as the Bridge fire in 2024. The $7.9 million repair project included installing new guardrails, retaining walls, and drainage systems. The reopening is expected to restore access to popular hiking trails and alleviate overcrowding at other trailheads in the Angeles National Forest.</p>

          <p>A significant rally in Chinese stocks, which recently hit a 10-year high, is drawing back overseas investors and encouraging domestic savers to shift funds into equities. Asset managers are increasingly optimistic, citing China's push for technological innovation in areas like advanced manufacturing and AI as a key driver for future growth. With yields on fixed-income products at record lows, the nation's US$22 trillion in savings presents a potent force for the market. Analysts believe Chinese equities have substantial room for growth compared to other global markets trading near historical highs. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>A charity-run mentoring program is helping anxious and disengaged teenagers improve their school attendance by pairing them with toddlers from local nurseries. The project aims to build confidence, communication skills, and a sense of responsibility in the teens, who act as role models for the younger children. Participants have reported significant improvements in their confidence and school attendance, with one student's attendance more than doubling. The initiative comes as schools grapple with a sharp rise in persistent absenteeism since the pandemic, which can severely impact academic outcomes.</p>

          <p>Following the engagement announcement of Taylor Swift and Travis Kelce, experts are weighing in on what their highly anticipated wedding might look like. Planners suggest the event will be intensely private, likely held at a location with personal significance rather than a typical venue, and require strict non-disclosure agreements from all involved. Given Swift's history of fan engagement, she may sprinkle "Easter eggs" for her followers while keeping the core details secret. Fashion experts predict her gown will be romantic and statement-making, possibly from an international designer, reflecting her red-carpet style.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Major coffee chains such as Costa Coffee are reportedly struggling as consumer tastes, particularly among younger generations, shift towards new trends like matcha. Costa's owner, Coca-Cola, is said to be exploring a sale of the chain for significantly less than its 2019 purchase price. Analysts suggest that the rise of smaller, trend-focused cafes like Blank Street Coffee, which appeal to "Gen Z" with colorful, social-media-friendly drinks, is challenging the dominance of traditional brands. The combination of changing preferences, cost-of-living pressures, and the popularity of home coffee machines has created a difficult market for established players.</p>

          <p>Prince Harry is scheduled to return to the UK in early September, prompting speculation about a potential meeting with his father, King Charles III.

Recent signs, including a meeting between the communications teams for both sides, suggest a slight easing of tensions. However, trust remains a significant issue, and the rift between Harry and his brother, Prince William, is reportedly still wide.</p>

          <p>China is streamlining its national research laboratories into highly focused, mission-driven institutions designed to advance its strategic goals in the global technology competition. The old model of loosely defined research is being replaced by a system with clear mandates, centralized funding, and direct accountability to Beijing's agenda for scientific supremacy. A recent ceremony in Hong Kong, where the science and technology minister presented plaques to revamped labs, highlighted the city's role in this national strategy. This restructuring involves approximately 500 labs nationwide, now tasked with supporting national development through targeted innovation.</p>

          <p>Following a third-round loss to Elena Rybakina at the US Open, British tennis player Emma Raducanu reflected on her Grand Slam season. She noted that all four of her major tournament defeats this year have come against top-ranked opponents. Raducanu believes that the world's best players have an extra "point to prove" when they face her and consequently raise their level of play. As she looks to close the gap, she is focused on improving her serve and continuing her work with new coach Francisco Roig, who previously coached Rafael Nadal.</p>
