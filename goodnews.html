          <p>Home Depot plans to absorb tariff costs rather than raise prices for consumers, according to company executives. While some individual product options may disappear from shelves, the chain is leveraging its market power and diversified supply chain to maintain steady prices. The company has been pushing suppliers to diversify their sourcing since Trump imposed tariffs, aiming for no more than 10% of products from any single foreign country by mid-2026. This strategy aims to attract shoppers from competitors who are raising prices due to tariffs.</p>
