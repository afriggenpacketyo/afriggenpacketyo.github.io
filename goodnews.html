          <p>The market for technology initial public offerings (IPOs) is experiencing a significant revival, with recent successful debuts from companies like Bullish, Figma, and Circle. After a nearly three-year slowdown caused by inflation and high interest rates, investor confidence has returned, pushing the Nasdaq to record levels and creating a backlog of high-value startups preparing to go public. While Wall Street is optimistic, some analysts caution that the market could be overheating, drawing comparisons to the dot-com bubble of the late 1990s. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>A parenting book checked out from the San Antonio Public Library in July 1943 has been returned nearly 82 years late. The book, "Your Child, His Family, and Friends," was discovered among a deceased man's possessions by his child, who mailed it back from Oregon. A letter included with the book explained that the borrower was likely the man's grandmother, who moved to Mexico City for an embassy job shortly after checking it out. Fortunately for the family, the library eliminated late fees in 2021, waiving a potential fine of nearly $900.</p>

          <p>Jeff Bezos-backed Slate Automotive is promoting an American-made electric pickup truck with a minimalist design, aiming for a price point around half the U.S. average. The company's strategy involves a basic, two-seat vehicle that owners can customize with over 100 accessories, including a kit to convert it into an SUV. However, the expiration of federal EV tax credits poses a challenge, potentially raising the truck's price from under $20,000 to nearly $28,000, a level where it would face more competition from established models.</p>

          <h2>Salesforce Stock Rises Amid Speculation of Renewed Activist Investor Pressure</h2>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Salesforce shares experienced a rally as investors speculate that the company may face a new round of pressure from activist investors. The speculation was fueled by a securities filing showing that Starboard Value, an activist hedge fund, significantly increased its stake in Salesforce during the second quarter. A previous activist campaign in 2022-2023, which Starboard initiated, successfully pushed the company to focus on efficiency and profitability, leading to a major stock recovery. Analysts believe this renewed interest could signal another push for changes at the software giant. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>In a significant development for opponents of Atlanta's new police training center, a judge has dismissed domestic terrorism charges against protester Jamie Marsicano. The DeKalb County judge ruled that the state violated Marsicano's constitutional right to a speedy trial by failing to secure an indictment two and a half years after the initial arrest. The ruling noted that the state's delays appeared intentional and had caused "actual prejudice" to the defendant, who has been unable to obtain a law license due to the pending charges.</p>

          <p>Tropical Storm Erin has strengthened into the first hurricane of the 2025 Atlantic season, with forecasters predicting it could become a major hurricane early next week. As of Friday, the Category 1 storm was located east of the Leeward Islands and was moving west-northwest. While people in the Caribbean are urged to monitor its progress, current forecast models show Erin is expected to curve northward, keeping it offshore and away from the U.S. East Coast. Tropical storm watches have been issued for several islands in its potential path.</p>

          <p>The common kitchen spice cloves, used for centuries in traditional medicine, may offer several health benefits according to various studies. Research indicates that eugenol, a compound in cloves, possesses antibacterial properties that can improve gum health and may also help lower blood sugar levels. Cloves are also a source of essential minerals like calcium, magnesium, and potassium. However, experts caution that clove oil and its primary compound, eugenol, can be harmful in concentrated amounts and should be consumed with care.</p>

          <p>The new horror film "Weapons," from director Zach Cregger, is being praised for its daring narrative, which provides clear answers to its central mystery about a group of children who mysteriously vanish. The article explores how the film successfully builds suspense before revealing a supernatural villain, leading to a satisfying and cathartic climax where the antagonist is defeated. However, the review also highlights that the movie subverts simple resolution by showing that vanquishing evil does not erase the profound trauma and grief experienced by the characters and their community.</p>

          <p>A new analysis by the Tax Foundation projects the state-by-state impact of President Trump's recent tax legislation, revealing significant variation in benefits for taxpayers. In 2026, the average individual taxpayer is expected to save $3,752, with residents in states like Wyoming, Washington, and Massachusetts seeing the largest average cuts. The report also highlights that high-income areas, such as resort towns like Jackson Hole, Wyoming, could see disproportionately large tax breaks, while rural counties and lower-income households may experience smaller benefits or even financial shortfalls.

          <p>This article fact-checks President Trump's recent claims that crime is "out of control" in Washington, D.C., which he used to justify placing the city's police force under federal control. While D.C. did have a high homicide rate in 2023 compared to U.S. states, it was not the highest among major cities, and the rate has fallen significantly in 2024. Data from the city's police department and independent analyses show a notable decrease in violent crime this year, suggesting that the president's characterization overstates the current situation by focusing on past peaks.</p>

          <div class="timestamp">2025-08-15 13:15:00 EDT</div>
        </div>
        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>This article delves into Muriel Spark's classic novella, "The Prime of Miss Jean Brodie," highlighting the author's profound understanding of adolescence and moral development. The story centers on a charismatic but manipulative teacher in 1930s Edinburgh and the lasting impact she has on a select group of her students, particularly one named Sandy. The review explores how Spark uses the narrative to investigate themes of influence, betrayal, and the search for authority, ultimately framing a young person's religious conversion as a final, complex act of separation from a powerful childhood mentor.</p>
