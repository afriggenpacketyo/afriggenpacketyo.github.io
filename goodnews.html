          <p>U.S. airline Breeze Airways, founded by JetBlue's David Neeleman, will launch its first international routes early next year, connecting several U.S. cities with popular vacation spots like Cancun and Montego Bay. This expansion marks a significant milestone for the airline, which has focused on underserved domestic routes since its 2021 debut. The carrier has now received the necessary FAA certification to operate internationally, a first for a new U.S. passenger airline since Virgin America. The new routes are intended to attract sun-seeking travelers with competitive introductory fares.</p>

As part of the settlement, Amazon, which admitted no wrongdoing, must make its enrollment and cancellation processes more transparent.

          <p>Starbucks has announced a $1 billion restructuring plan that includes closing underperforming North American stores and laying off 900 corporate employees. CEO Brian Niccol stated the move is a necessary part of his "Back to Starbucks" turnaround strategy, which aims to improve profitability and customer service by reallocating resources. The company has faced six consecutive quarters of declining same-store sales, and this plan is intended to manage expenses and restore operating margins. The changes have drawn criticism from the workers' union, which cited a lack of barista input in major decisions. (not investment advice)</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>The escalating cost of senior care, with nursing homes now averaging over $120,000 annually, is making long-term care insurance an increasingly relevant consideration for retirement planning. Many Americans mistakenly believe Medicare covers these expenses, but it only provides limited, short-term skilled nursing care, not the custodial care most seniors need. With about 70% of seniors expected to require long-term care, insurance can protect retirement savings from being depleted. Securing a policy is easier and cheaper when applicants are younger and in good health, making proactive planning essential.</p>

          <p>The UK government has announced its "Pride in Place" program, a £5 billion investment initiative aimed at revitalizing 339 communities across the country. The funds are designated for local projects such as improving high streets, parks, and public spaces, with spending decisions to be guided by community input. The program also aims to empower councils to save local assets like pubs and libraries and block the opening of unwanted shops. This long-term investment is seen as part of the Labour government's strategy to address regional inequalities and foster local pride.</p>

          <p>Actor Billy Crudup reflects on his career, noting that his Emmy-winning role as network executive Cory Ellison on "The Morning Show" was an unexpected success late in his professional life. Crudup, who initially pursued acting after being inspired by Broadway, consciously avoided typical leading man roles, opting for more complex characters. He credits his challenging stage work, particularly a one-man show where he played 19 different characters, with giving him the confidence for his current role. That performance also caught the attention of executive producer Jennifer Aniston, ultimately leading to his casting.</p>

          <p>The Social Security Administration (SSA) will stop issuing paper checks to its nearly 70 million beneficiaries starting September 30, completing a transition to fully electronic payments. Recipients will now receive their benefits via direct deposit or a prepaid debit card. The SSA states this move will improve efficiency, enhance security, and reduce costs, noting that paper checks are significantly more likely to be lost or stolen. While the transition was mandated by a 2025 executive order, exceptions will be made for individuals who have no other means of receiving payments.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>HSBC, in collaboration with IBM, has successfully used quantum computing to enhance its algorithmic bond trading, a development the bank calls a "ground-breaking world-first." In a trial, the combination of classical computing with IBM's Heron quantum processor resulted in a 34% improvement in the accuracy of bond price predictions. This advancement allows for a better estimation of the likelihood that a trade will be filled at a quoted price, potentially increasing margins and market liquidity. The trial provides some of the first empirical evidence of quantum computing's practical application in finance.</p>

          <p>U.S. golfer Bryson DeChambeau has expressed hope that an appearance by Donald Trump at the Ryder Cup will inspire the American team to victory against Europe. Trump is expected to attend the first day of the tournament at Bethpage Black in New York. DeChambeau believes the former president's presence will be an "electric" and positive force for the U.S. side. In contrast, European player Robert MacIntyre downplayed the visit, stating Trump is "just another spectator" and that his team remains focused on the competition. The visit is accompanied by a significant security operation.</p>

          <h2>Fear of Tariffs and Expiring Tax Credits Provides Temporary Boost to U.S. Car Sales</h2>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>U.S. new vehicle sales have received an unexpected lift as consumers rush to buy cars before potential price hikes from tariffs and the expiration of EV tax credits. Cox Automotive has raised its 2025 sales forecast to 16.1 million units due to this stronger-than-expected demand. However, analysts warn this is likely a temporary "pull-ahead" effect, with sales expected to slow in the fourth quarter and into the next year. The trend has disproportionately benefited larger automakers like General Motors and Toyota, while smaller brands have seen their market share decline. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>The Indian government has signed a $7 billion contract with state-owned Hindustan Aeronautics (HAL) to acquire 97 locally made Tejas Mk-1A fighter jets. This move is part of Prime Minister Narendra Modi's "Make in India" initiative, aimed at boosting the domestic defense industry and modernizing the nation's armed forces. The new aircraft are intended to replace India's aging, Soviet-era MiG-21 fleet, which is being retired. The deal reflects the government's confidence in its indigenous aerospace capabilities as it seeks to reduce reliance on foreign military hardware.</p>
