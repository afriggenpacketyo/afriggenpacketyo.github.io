          <h2>US and Japan Announce Major Trade Agreement Lowering Auto Tariffs</h2>
          <div class="timestamp">2025-07-23 03:31:48 EDT</div>
        </div>
        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>The U.S. has announced a significant trade deal with Japan, which President Trump described as "massive." The agreement lowers the tariff on Japanese auto exports to the U.S. from 25% to 15%, a key concession for Japan's economy. In return, Japan will reportedly invest $550 billion in the United States and further open its markets to American goods, including vehicles and agricultural products. The deal is seen as a political victory for Japanese Prime Minister Shigeru Ishiba, who faces domestic pressure. (not investment advice)</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>The new trade agreement between the United States and Japan has sparked optimism in the European automotive sector, leading to a rally in stock prices for major carmakers like Volkswagen, BMW, and Mercedes-Benz. The deal, which reduces U.S. tariffs on Japanese vehicles to 15%, has raised hopes that the European Union could secure a similar breakthrough in its own trade negotiations with Washington. The EU has been trying to avoid a threatened 30% tariff on its auto exports to the U.S. This development is seen as a potential blueprint for future agreements. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>Tennis legend Venus Williams has made history by becoming the oldest woman to win a WTA Tour-level singles match since Martina Navratilova in 2004. At 45 years old, Williams defeated world number 35 Peyton Stearns, who is 22 years her junior, in the first round of the Washington Open. This victory marks a significant comeback for the seven-time Grand Slam champion, who had not played a singles match since March 2024. Williams asserted that she is playing for herself and has nothing to prove, demonstrating her enduring passion and commitment to the sport.</p>

          <p>Singapore's headline inflation remained steady at a four-year low of 0.8% in June, coming in below economists' expectations. The core inflation rate, which excludes transport and accommodation costs, also held firm at 0.6%. These soft inflation figures provide the Monetary Authority of Singapore (MAS) with the flexibility to potentially ease its monetary policy to support the nation's export-dependent economy amid global trade uncertainty. The MAS has expressed concerns about a subdued domestic growth outlook for the second half of the year, despite strong GDP figures earlier in 2025. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>In a challenging retail environment that has seen many London stores close, a chain of shops called Duck World is successfully staying afloat by selling only rubber ducks. With four locations in prime London real estate, the stores offer a wide variety of collectible ducks, appealing to tourists, gift-seekers, and millennial collectors. Despite pressures from inflation and rising costs, the business model leverages the "treatonomics" trend, where consumers buy small, affordable luxuries. Analysts suggest the high-margin, low-cost nature of the products contributes to their surprising resilience in the struggling U.K. retail sector.</p>

Both artists commanded the stage, stripping back gimmicks to focus on their extensive and celebrated back catalogues. The show's highlight was Lamar's performance of his Drake diss track "Not Like Us," which created an electric atmosphere, solidifying the tour as a massive success for two artists at the peak of their powers.</p>

          <p>Scientists analyzing a 13-million-year-old fossil have discovered evidence of a battle between two of South America's ancient top predators. The fossil, a leg bone from a large, flightless "terror bird," features distinct teeth marks that have been matched to a giant, five-meter-long crocodilian species called Purussaurus. Researchers believe the massive reptile likely ambushed the formidable bird at the water's edge in what was then a swampy region of Colombia. The finding provides rare insight into the predator-prey dynamics of the Miocene epoch, suggesting even the fearsome terror birds were vulnerable to attack.</p>
