        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>China's box office is experiencing a subdued Dragon Boat Festival, with revenues lower than previous holidays, reflecting the country's struggle to stimulate domestic consumption. Despite this, the Hollywood film "Mission: Impossible ‚Äì The Final Reckoning" topped ticket presales, outperforming domestic animated features. This comes after Beijing's announcement of a curb on American film imports, seen as retaliation for US tariffs. While China's film market declined last year, observers remain optimistic about its long-term resilience due to improved domestic productions. Optimism remains that the film industry can rebound in the long-term.</p>

The road was closed for about 24 hours to allow the bees to return to their hives, and authorities corrected the initial estimate of 250 million bees. The incident raised concerns for those allergic to bee stings, with authorities directing them to the State Department of Health webpage for guidance.</p>

          <p>Taiwan's main opposition party, the Kuomintang (KMT), is preparing for a leadership election in September while facing a mass-recall campaign by the ruling Democratic Progressive Party (DPP). The KMT hopes a new party chair can lead it back to power after years on the political sidelines. Analysts warn that failure to contain the recall challenge could derail the KMT's leadership transition and fracture the party. KMT chairman Eric Chu Li-luan has signaled his intention to step down, suggesting Taichung mayor Lu Shiow-yen as a potential successor.</p>

          <p>A new trend on TikTok suggests that a "McMigraine Meal" consisting of full-fat coke and salty fries can help alleviate migraine symptoms, but experts caution against relying on it as a cure. While some migraine sufferers find relief from the caffeine and sugar in coke or the salt in fries, these effects are not universal and can even trigger migraines in some individuals. Experts emphasize that migraine is a complex neurological condition that cannot be cured by fast food and recommend consulting with healthcare professionals for effective management strategies. The article highlights the desperation of migraine sufferers and the need for further research into effective treatments.</p>

          <p>The skulls of 19 Black patients, who died in a New Orleans hospital in the 1870s and were sent to Germany for racist phrenological studies, have been repatriated and laid to rest. The University of Leipzig acknowledged the skulls were acquired unethically and returned them to New Orleans. A multi-faith memorial service and jazz funeral honored the deceased, with Dillard University students reading their reconstructed biographies. The repatriation is a significant international restitution, addressing the legacy of racist scientific practices and honoring the lives of those exploited.</p>
