          <p>China has issued a statement asserting that its military activities are conducted in full compliance with international law. This announcement comes amid increasing scrutiny and concerns from neighboring countries and international bodies regarding China's military actions in disputed territories and strategic waterways. The statement did not specify particular military activities, but it generally emphasizes China's commitment to acting within the boundaries of international legal frameworks. The declaration is likely aimed at reassuring the global community and addressing criticisms of China's growing military presence.</p>

          <p>Despite ongoing trade tensions between China and the United States, Chinese companies are continuing to expand their presence in the US market. Camera company Insta360, for instance, recently raised a significant amount of capital and counts the US as one of its largest markets. This trend reflects a broader strategy among Chinese firms to build international brands and establish a global presence, driven partly by slower growth in the domestic Chinese market. Chinese companies are increasingly looking to establish international brands with offices in different regions, hiring local employees, and building global supply chains to offset tariff risks.

          <p>South Korea's military has ceased its propaganda broadcasts along the border with North Korea, marking a step towards easing tensions between the two nations. The broadcasts, which included anti-North Korea messages and K-pop songs, were resumed last year in response to North Korea's balloon campaign. President Lee Jae-myung ordered the halt as part of efforts to restore trust and promote peace on the Korean Peninsula. The move follows calls for civilian activists to stop flying anti-North Korean leaflets across the border, as South Korea seeks to improve relations with Pyongyang.</p>
