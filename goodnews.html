          <p>The CNBC Investing Club is considering reducing its holdings in custom AI chipmaker Broadcom after a significant rally pushed its stake above a 5% portfolio threshold. The stock's recent gains were bolstered by Mizuho raising its price target, citing strong future AI revenue forecasts and expansion to new clients like OpenAI. The broader market remains relatively stable as investors anticipate the Federal Reserve's upcoming interest rate decision. This article also highlights a buying opportunity in Boeing following a stock pullback and notes upcoming investor events for DuPont and CrowdStrike. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>Stablecoin issuer Tether is launching a new U.S.-regulated token, USAT, and has appointed Bo Hines, a former White House advisor, as CEO of its new U.S. division. This move signals a strategic effort by Tether to engage more closely with American regulators and institutions, especially following the pro-crypto stance of the Trump administration. The new USAT token is specifically designed for U.S. businesses and will operate under the GENIUS Act, distinguishing it from the globally focused USDT. The initiative aims to solidify the U.S. dollar's dominance in the digital age by providing a compliant stablecoin option for the domestic market.</p>

          <p>Amazon's Alexa Fund has invested in Fable, a San Francisco startup that developed Showrunner, an AI platform allowing users to generate animated TV episodes from simple text prompts. The company aims to transform passive entertainment into a co-creative experience, billing its platform as the "Netflix of AI." Fable, led by VR veteran Edward Saatchi, is initially focusing on animation, which is less complex for AI to generate than photorealistic video. The investment highlights a growing trend in AI-powered entertainment, empowering everyday users to become creators and storytellers without needing a Hollywood-sized budget or production crew.</p>

          <p>The Federal Aviation Administration (FAA) is launching a new pilot program to expedite the deployment of electric vertical takeoff and landing (eVTOL) aircraft, commonly known as air taxis. Key industry players Joby Aviation and Archer Aviation are participating in the initiative, which will establish public-private partnerships to promote the safe integration of this new technology. The program follows a recent executive order from President Trump aimed at fostering eVTOL development in the U.S. Both companies praised the announcement as a critical step toward commercial air taxi services, with supervised trials potentially beginning as early as next year.</p>

        </div>
        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>This article reviews Lee Lai's new graphic novel, "Cannon," which explores the experience of debilitating panic attacks and anxiety through its protagonist, Lucy. Unlike traditional narratives, the book visualizes Cannon's internal turmoil as a growing flock of menacing magpies that only she can see. The story follows her journey as she navigates stress from her job, caregiving for her grandfather, and strained friendships, culminating in a moment of explosive release rather than implosion. The review praises the novel's spare yet emotional art and lived-in dialogue, highlighting it as a joyful and cathartic story about learning to manage and express deep-seated fears.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>The CNBC Investing Club is capitalizing on a recent drop in Boeing's stock price by purchasing an additional 80 shares, viewing the pullback as a strategic buying opportunity. The stock fell after CEO Kelly Ortberg acknowledged delays in the 777X aircraft certification at an industry conference. However, the club's investment thesis remains intact, as such delays are not uncommon and are not expected to alter the company's long-term cash flow trajectory. This move is part of a strategy to build a new position in the aerospace giant by acquiring shares at progressively lower prices. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>The United Nations General Assembly has overwhelmingly passed a resolution supporting a two-state solution for Israel and Palestine that explicitly excludes the involvement of Hamas. The "New York Declaration," backed by France and Saudi Arabia, calls for Hamas to free all hostages, end its rule in Gaza, and surrender its weapons to the Palestinian Authority. With 142 votes in favor, the resolution urges "tangible, timebound, and irreversible steps" toward establishing a sovereign Palestinian state. The vote precedes a UN summit where several leaders are expected to formally recognize a Palestinian state, increasing pressure on Israel to end the ongoing conflict.</p>

          <p>Major technology companies including Apple, Google, and Meta are advancing real-time language translation, turning a long-standing science fiction concept into reality. Apple recently showcased its "Live Translation" feature for the new AirPods Pro 3, which can translate spoken Spanish into English for the listener in near real-time. This innovation is part of a broader industry trend, with Google's Pixel phones offering a similar feature that preserves a speaker's voice inflections, and Meta integrating translation into its smart glasses. These advancements, spurred by generative AI, are set to reshape communication and could significantly impact industries reliant on human interpreters.</p>

          <p>This article presents an excerpt from "We the People: A History of the U.S. Constitution," a new book by Harvard professor and historian Jill Lepore. The introduction reflects on the Constitution not as a static, stone-like relic, but as a living document born from an "explosion of ideas." Lepore emphasizes that while the physical parchment and ink are subject to decay, the concepts within it endure and evolve over time. The document's genius, she argues, lies in its inherent ability to account for the passage of time and adapt to a changing nation, a theme central to her historical exploration of its amendments and interpretations.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>The widespread use of GLP-1 weight-loss drugs like Ozempic is causing a noticeable shift in the apparel industry, dubbed the "Ozempic effect." Clothing resellers are seeing a surge in donations of larger-sized clothing, altering inventory dynamics that previously saw smaller sizes as more common. In response, some retailers are reducing the in-store stock of extended sizes, making them online-only offerings. While the demand for plus-size clothing remains, it is shifting toward smaller plus-sizes as consumers downsize. Fashion experts caution against abandoning the plus-size market entirely, noting it has historically been underserved and still represents a majority of American consumers.</p>

For "Play," Sheeran wrote hundreds of songs, ultimately selecting tracks that made him feel good and prioritized artistic expression over commercial appeal.
