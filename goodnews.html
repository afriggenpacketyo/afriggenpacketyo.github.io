          <h2>Washington Grapples with 'Debanking' Amidst Political Divide</h2>
          <div class="timestamp">2025-05-15 19:02:27 EDT</div>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>A political debate is brewing in Washington over the issue of 'debanking,' where financial institutions close accounts or deny services based on political positions or risk assessments. While conservatives and religious groups claim political discrimination, banks cite risk management and profitability concerns. President Trump, Treasury Secretary Scott Bessent, and Senator Elizabeth Warren have all raised concerns, but consensus on solutions remains elusive. The Trump administration is considering measures like an executive order and reviving a 'fair access' rule, while the Federal Reserve is also reviewing its policies regarding crypto clients. The issue traces back to the 2008 financial crisis and Obama's Operation Choke Point, highlighting the complexities of balancing free-market principles with fairness and access to financial services.</p>

          <p>Walmart, the largest retailer in the United States, has announced that it will be raising prices due to President Trump's tariffs. Despite reporting solid sales growth, especially in its e-commerce division, the company cautioned that the tariffs would push them to start raising prices soon. CEO Doug McMillon stated that while they will try to keep prices as low as possible, the magnitude of the tariffs makes it impossible to absorb all the pressure. The price increases could be seen as soon as the end of the month, with consumers likely noticing the uptick on discretionary items first.</p>

According to the FAA, there was no loss of separation between airplanes during the outage. The FAA is investigating the incident, during which both main and backup frequencies failed.

          <p>This fall, COVID-19 vaccinations may be recommended only for older Americans and those with chronic health problems, contingent on vaccine availability. Scientific advisors to the CDC are considering a risk-based strategy similar to practices in other countries. New clinical testing requirements for vaccines could delay the release of updated shots. The FDA has requested additional clinical data from Novavax before approving its COVID vaccine. Officials are also questioning COVID's impact on children under 12, potentially ending vaccine use in that age group. Some experts fear these changes could undermine vaccine use, while others support focusing on high-risk individuals.</p>

While the US does not recognize Taiwan as an independent state, it opposes any attempt to take the island by force and is committed to arming it.

          <h2>Judge Dismisses Trespassing Charges Against Immigrants Crossing US-Mexico Border</h2>

          <p>A federal judge in New Mexico dismissed trespassing charges against dozens of immigrants caught in a new military zone on the US-Mexico border. Judge Gregory Wormuth ruled that the immigrants did not know they were entering the military zone and therefore could not be charged. The immigrants still face charges accusing them of crossing the border illegally. The so-called New Mexico national defense area was established in April, and US army troops were authorized to detain immigrants entering the area from Mexico.</p>

He has increased his income through endorsements and sponsorships, backed by his large social media following. Stephen Curry climbed to second place with $156 million, and British boxer Tyson Fury moved to third with $146 million. Lionel Messi has fallen to fifth place. Ronaldo moved to the Saudi Pro League with Al Nassr in December 2022, which has generated greater income for him.</p>
