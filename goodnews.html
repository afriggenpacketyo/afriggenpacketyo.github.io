          <p>Several German states are contemplating banning smartphones from classrooms, with one high school already piloting the initiative. The Dalton High School requires students to leave their phones turned off in their bags during the school day. The goal is to reduce distractions and encourage more interaction among students. While some remain skeptical, many teachers believe that students adapt quickly to the ban, leading to a more relaxed and focused learning environment.</p>

          <p>Two major scientific societies, the American Meteorological Society (AMS) and the American Geophysical Union (AGU), are collaborating to produce peer-reviewed research on the climate crisis's impact. This initiative follows the Trump administration's dismissal of contributors to the National Climate Assessment. The AMS and AGU aim to sustain momentum on climate research, creating a mechanism for continued scientific work. The collaboration will produce over 29 peer-reviewed journals covering various aspects of climate change.</p>
