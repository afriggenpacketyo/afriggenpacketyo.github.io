          <p>Following the first detection of West Nile virus in UK mosquitoes, a Nottingham virologist, Prof Jonathan Ball, has urged the public to remain calm, while acknowledging the likelihood of mosquito-borne diseases increasing in range due to climate change. Fragments of the virus were found in a wetland in Retford, Nottinghamshire, prompting increased mosquito surveillance in the area. Prof Ball emphasized that while most infected individuals show mild symptoms, severe disease is possible in rare cases. He advises taking precautions against mosquito bites as a general trend of tropical viral diseases expanding northward is observed.</p>
