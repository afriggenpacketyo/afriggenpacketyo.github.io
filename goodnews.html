          <p>SpaceX has again postponed the 10th test flight of its Super Heavy-Starship rocket, this time due to an electrically charged anvil cloud near the launch pad, after an earlier scrub caused by an oxygen leak. This milestone mission aims to demonstrate fixes and upgrades following three previous catastrophic failures, with a third attempt potentially scheduled for Tuesday. A successful flight is crucial for enabling faster launch cadences and testing autonomous Starship-to-Starship propellant transfers, which are vital for NASA's planned moon landing by 2027 and future Mars missions. Despite challenges and expert skepticism about the 2027 moon landing timeline, SpaceX founder Elon Musk and NASA's acting administrator remain confident in the company's ability to overcome engineering hurdles and achieve its ambitious goals.</p>

          <p>Tropical Storm Fernand is expected to continue its trajectory over the central Atlantic Ocean for the next couple of days, with forecasters confirming it poses no immediate threat to land. The storm began weakening Monday night, located approximately 550 miles east-northeast of Bermuda with maximum sustained winds of 50 mph. Fernand, the sixth named storm of the 2025 Atlantic hurricane season, is predicted to further diminish and potentially become a post-tropical cyclone before dissipating on Wednesday. This follows an above-normal hurricane season forecast by NOAA, which anticipated 13 to 18 named storms, highlighting the ongoing activity in the Atlantic basin.</p>

A single winner would have the option of a lump sum payment of about $338.6 million before taxes or an annuity over 29 years. There has not been a Powerball jackpot winner since May 31, contributing to the growing prize. The odds of winning the top prize are 1 in 292.2 million, as drawings occur three times a week across 45 states, the District of Columbia, Puerto Rico, and the U.S. Virgin Islands.</p>

          <p>Surgeons in China have successfully performed a pig-to-human lung transplant, demonstrating the procedure's feasibility, though further extensive testing is required. Scientists at the National Clinical Research Center for Respiratory Disease in Guangzhou reported that the genetically altered pig lung, transplanted into a brain-dead human recipient, maintained viability and functionality for 216 hours without infection or rejection. This advancement in xenotransplantation addresses the global organ shortage, despite the unique challenges lungs present due to their anatomical complexity and direct exposure to air. The study highlights progress in genetic modifications and immunosuppressive strategies, paving the way for potential clinical translation while acknowledging remaining hurdles.</p>

          <p>Scientists in Singapore have made significant strides in industrializing the production of remote-controlled cyborg cockroaches, envisioning a future where these tiny robots assist in disaster search missions. The team improved the control of the robotic cockroach, increasing its turning ability from 70 to over 80 degrees, and validated this precision through various experiments. This pioneering concept of an "insect robot factory" was detailed in an article in Nature Communications. The work demonstrates meaningful progress in insect-computer hybrid robots, promising to reduce mass production time and cost for practical applications in critical situations like disaster relief.</p>

          <p>The Cleveland Browns have traded veteran quarterback Kenny Pickett to the Las Vegas Raiders for a 2026 fifth-round NFL Draft pick, resolving their crowded quarterback room. The Raiders, in urgent need of a backup for Geno Smith after Aidan O’Connell fractured his wrist, gain a player with 25 NFL starts. Pickett, who previously played for the Steelers and backed up Jalen Hurts on the Super Bowl LIX-winning Eagles, was competing for the Browns' backup role with Joe Flacco, Dillon Gabriel, and Shedeur Sanders. His hamstring injury during training camp hindered his ability to compete, leading to this unexpected move as NFL teams finalize their 53-man rosters.</p>

          <p>The Transportation Security Administration (TSA) has clarified new restrictions on cordless hairstyling tools, requiring those powered by lithium-ion batteries or gas/butane fuel to be packed exclusively in carry-on bags. This policy aims to mitigate fire hazards, as these batteries can overheat and combust, posing a significant risk if they ignite in the plane's cargo area where incidents might go unnoticed. Plug-in tools remain unrestricted for both carry-on and checked luggage. Passengers must also ensure a safety cover is securely fitted over the heating element of any cordless tool. This regulation is part of broader efforts to address the 644 verified incidents of lithium battery-related fires or extreme heat on flights between 2006 and 2025.</p>

          <p>The Trump administration has agreed to restore over $6.8 billion in education funding to U.S. schools following a multi-state lawsuit challenging its abrupt decision to freeze the congressionally-allocated funds. The withheld money, which affected after-school programs, teacher training, and support for English-learners, had caused widespread uncertainty for communities and school districts. States, led by California's attorney general, accused the administration of illegally impounding funds, citing the U.S. Constitution and the Impoundment Control Act of 1974. The agreement marks a reversal for an administration that has sought to reshape public education to align with its right-wing social beliefs, previously threatening to withhold funds over policies related to transgender athletes and sex education.</p>

          <p>Los Angeles Fire Department crews successfully halted a brush fire that scorched approximately nine acres in Sherman Oaks, near Haskell Creek, on Monday afternoon. While the fire's progression was stopped, full containment requires heavy equipment to extinguish burned material along the control lines, with operations expected to continue into the evening. Fire officials reported no injuries but cautioned the public about potential delays on the 405 Freeway and advised using alternative routes. The incident coincides with a 10.2-mile repavement project on the 405, involving overnight lane closures, adding to traffic challenges in the area.</p>

          <p>Dr. Xand van Tulleken, a medical expert, challenges the traditional advice of always sitting perfectly straight, suggesting that much of what is believed about good posture is outdated and potentially harmful. He offers three key rules for improving back health: prioritize movement, build strength, and adopt a healthier mindset. Emphasizing that posture is dynamic, Dr. Xand advises against remaining locked in one position for extended periods, advocating for regular breaks and stretches. He also highlights that strong core and back muscles, developed through simple exercises like yoga or Pilates, are crucial for self-support, and stresses the importance of addressing stress and emotional factors that contribute to back pain.</p>

This decision follows months of campaigning and marks the first time students will leave Gaza to study in the UK since the Hamas-Israel war began in 2023. However, the plan faces significant logistical hurdles, including the need for Israel's approval for each student to exit the territory and the complex process of conducting visa biometric checks in a third country. This initiative coincides with UK plans to evacuate critically ill and injured Gazan children for medical treatment.</p>

          <p>Ismael 'El Mayo' Zambada, the notorious Mexican drug lord and co-founder of the Sinaloa Cartel, has entered a guilty plea to two drug smuggling and conspiracy charges in a New York court, marking a significant end to his long criminal career. Zambada, 77 and reportedly in poor health, apologized for his actions, acknowledging the harm caused by illegal drugs and admitting that his organization corrupted police, military, and politicians in Mexico. This plea comes after he was arrested in Texas last year following an alleged double-cross by the sons of his former ally, Joaquín 'El Chapo' Guzmán. By pleading guilty, Zambada is expected to receive a more lenient sentence, likely spending the rest of his life in a U.S. federal prison.</p>
