          <p>Former White House national security advisor Mike Waltz was seen using a modified version of the Signal app during a Cabinet meeting, raising concerns about security protocols. The app, reportedly a "fork" of Signal from a company called TeleMessage, adds archiving capabilities but may undermine Signal's end-to-end encryption, according to reports. While the White House claims Signal is an approved app for government use, Signal representatives have stated they cannot guarantee the privacy or security of unofficial versions. This incident follows previous controversies involving Waltz's use of Signal to discuss pending military strikes, adding to the debate over secure communications within the Trump administration.</p>

          <p>Reform UK, led by Nigel Farage, has made significant gains in English local elections, positioning itself as a major challenger to Britain's traditional parties. The party won 677 seats, seizing control of eight authorities from the Conservatives and one from Labour. Farage declared that Reform UK has surpassed the Tories as the main opposition to Labour, while acknowledging his party would seek to "reduce excessive expenditure" in local government. These results highlight the continuing fragmentation of the British political landscape, with both Conservatives and Labour experiencing losses.</p>

          <p>A high-ranking Chinese official is reportedly seeking discussions with the Trump administration regarding chemicals used in the production of fentanyl, amidst ongoing trade tensions between the two nations. China is a major producer of fentanyl precursors, which are then used by Mexican drug cartels to manufacture fentanyl and smuggle it into the United States. The official's inquiry suggests a potential willingness from Beijing to address the fentanyl crisis and improve relations with the U.S. Trump has imposed tariffs on China over its role in the fentanyl epidemic, with Beijing retaliating with tariffs on American goods.</p>

The timing and White House involvement have sparked speculation that Trump is using the Army's anniversary to stage a grand military parade.

          <p>Durga Chew-Bose's remake of Fran√ßoise Sagan's "Bonjour Tristesse" offers a visually appealing adaptation set on the French Riviera, but it struggles to capture the breezy intrigue of the original novel and Otto Preminger's film. While the film boasts dreamy scenery and an attractive cast, it delves too deeply into the characters' motivations, resulting in hyperaware dialogue and an over-intellectualization of the narrative. Chlo√´ Sevigny stands out for her portrayal of Anne, embodying emotional susceptibility and intelligence, but the film ultimately feels more clinical than revelatory.</p>

          <p>Tim Friede, a man who let venomous snakes bite him some 200 times, is now the subject of a paper in the journal Cell where researchers say that thanks in large part to the antibodies that Friede has developed over nearly a quarter century of self-envenomation, they've done just that. Every year, venomous snake bites kill tens of thousands of people globally and permanently disable several hundred thousand more, according to the World Health Organization (WHO). He's found them easier to understand than people, and has a clear relationship with them. (They want to kill him, he wants to survive.)</p>

          <p>Boaz Barak, a professor of computer science at Harvard University, expresses concerns about the erosion of trust in higher education due to the blurring of lines between scholarship and activism. He emphasizes the importance of maintaining professionalism and objectivity in the classroom, stating that students should learn fundamental capabilities and limitations of computing devices rather than political ideologies. He argues that universities have contributed to this erosion of trust by allowing the blurring of the lines between scholarship and activism. (not investment advice)</p>
