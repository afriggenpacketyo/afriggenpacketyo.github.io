        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>A growing trend sees pet dogs playing prominent roles in weddings, often serving as ring bearers, flower girls, or honored guests. Couples like Ellie and Brad, who involved their sheepadoodle Newton in their ceremony, highlight the joy and emotional support pets bring to such special occasions. Dog chaperone services are expanding to meet this demand, helping integrate pets seamlessly into the day's events, from meet-and-greets to mini-grooming. This reflects a broader societal shift where dogs are increasingly viewed as integral family members, with their presence often stealing the show.</p>

        </div>
        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Europe's prolonged and intense summer heatwave, driven by global warming, has led to a nearly 60% surge in Chinese air conditioner exports to the continent in July. Capitals like Madrid and Paris experienced record temperatures, exposing Europe's general unpreparedness for such extreme heat. This demand boom is significantly benefiting Chinese brands, which already dominate approximately 80% of the global AC market. The article underscores how climate change is reshaping consumer markets and international trade dynamics, creating new opportunities for manufacturers.</p>

          <p>The owner of OnlyFans, Leonid Radvinsky, received $701 million in dividends last year as the subscription-based content platform prepares for a potential multibillion-dollar sale. The UK-based company reported a 9% revenue increase to $1.4 billion and a 4% rise in pre-tax profit to $683.6 million in its 2024 financial year. User and creator accounts saw substantial growth, driving the platform's "significant growth and profitability." This large payout adds to over $1 billion Radvinsky has already received, highlighting the platform's lucrative model as it considers a sale for an estimated $8 billion.</p>

          <p>Asia-Pacific markets largely saw gains on Friday, with investors keenly awaiting U.S. Federal Reserve Chair Jerome Powell's speech at the Jackson Hole symposium for indications on future interest rate paths. South Korea's Kospi and Kosdaq rose, while Japan's Nikkei 225 remained flat, and Australia's S&P/ASX 200 dipped after reaching a record high. Japan also reported slightly higher-than-expected core inflation for July, though rice prices eased. The cautious optimism in Asian markets reflects global anticipation for the Fed's stance amidst varying regional economic data. (not investment advice)</p>

          <div class="timestamp">2025-08-22 03:23:04 EDT</div>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>U.S. President Donald Trump has scaled back his threat of high tariffs on pharmaceuticals and semiconductors from the European Union, agreeing to limit them to 15% in a newly detailed trade deal. This decision provides relief to sectors like Ireland's pharmaceutical industry, which previously faced potential tariffs as high as 250%. The agreement, however, stipulates that the EU must first pass legislation to reduce its own tariffs on U.S. industrial goods to zero before the 27.5% tariff on European car exports is lowered to 15%. This deal aims to bring stability to the world's largest trading partnership, despite some disappointments, such as the exclusion of wine and spirits. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>India's Supreme Court has revised its earlier directive on stray dogs in New Delhi, now mandating that captured animals be sterilized and immunized before release, unless they are rabid or aggressive. The court also prohibited public feeding of strays, instructing civic bodies to establish designated feeding zones and warning of legal action against violators. This modification follows an initial order for widespread removal and relocation to shelters, which drew protests from animal rights activists. The court cited a surge in dog bite cases and aims to frame a nationwide policy to address the issue.</p>

          <p>Japan's core inflation rate decreased to 3.1% in July, down from 3.3% the previous month, though it remained slightly higher than economists' expectations. This marks the lowest headline inflation since November 2024, with rice inflation notably easing after two months of significant price surges. The Bank of Japan's closely watched "core-core" inflation held steady at 3.4%. Despite signs of moderation in food prices, the 3.1% headline inflation is the 40th consecutive month above the BOJ's 2% target, prompting some analysts to suggest the central bank is "behind the curve" in raising interest rates.

          <p>Controversial billionaire and former Thai Prime Minister Thaksin Shinawatra has been acquitted by a Bangkok court of charges of insulting the monarchy, a crime that could have carried a 15-year jail sentence. The charge stemmed from a 2015 interview where he commented on the 2014 military coup, which prosecutors argued defamed the monarchy. This verdict offers significant relief to the Shinawatra family's political movement, which has dominated Thai politics for decades. Critics often view Thailand's strict lese majeste law as a political tool to silence opposition, making this acquittal an unusual outcome.</p>

This initiative follows a successful pilot that recouped £17 million in less than a year by stopping payments to 2,600 ineligible claimants.

Honda similarly attributed price changes to added feature content and its high percentage of American-made vehicles. While Japan faced 25% tariffs on automobiles, later lowered to 15%, these companies assert their strategy has been to absorb tariff impacts to maintain affordability and competitiveness.
