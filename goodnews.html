          <p>Prime Minister Keir Starmer is set to unveil stricter immigration policies in response to growing voter discontent over high immigration levels. These measures include limiting skilled visas to graduate-level jobs and restricting lower-skilled visas to sectors critical to the industrial strategy. Businesses will also be required to invest more in training British workers, and the care sector will no longer be able to recruit workers from abroad using visas. The government aims to tighten control over work, family, and study visas, raise English language requirements for adult dependents, and increase enforcement to reduce overall migration numbers, responding to concerns about strained public services and ethnic tensions.</p>

          <div class="timestamp">2025-05-12 06:00:00 EDT</div>
        </div>
        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Two new studies on chimpanzee communication have identified key building blocks of human speech in our closest relatives. The research indicates that chimps use both rhythmic structures in their drumming and combinations of calls, mirroring essential elements of spoken language. These findings support the idea that human language may have evolved from existing primate communication methods. One study analyzed drumming patterns, revealing that different chimp populations use distinct rhythmic structures, similar to regional accents. Another study found that chimps combine calls to alter meanings, suggesting a shared motivation for communication rooted in social navigation.</p>

          <p>A contributor argues that burned lots in L.A. will remain vacant for decades unless Congress modifies the tax code to provide relief for fire victims. Current tax laws discourage fire victims from selling their properties due to income tax implications and also deter potential buyers. The proposed reforms include exempting fire victims from income taxes on insurance proceeds and lot sales, and allowing buyers to defer income taxes on the sale of a principal residence if the proceeds are used to rebuild in the fire areas. These changes aim to incentivize rebuilding and restore the tax base in affected communities.</p>
