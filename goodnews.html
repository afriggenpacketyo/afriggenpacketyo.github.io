          <p>Alibaba's instant commerce platform, Taobao Shangou, has reportedly overtaken its primary competitor, Meituan, in daily orders within China's on-demand delivery market. The shift occurred after Meituan ceased a promotional subsidy campaign, allowing Alibaba's heavily subsidized service to gain the top spot. Analysts from Morgan Stanley predict this signals a move from a "near-monopoly" for Meituan to a "near-duopoly," forecasting that both companies could hold nearly equal market shares by 2030. The competition highlights the effectiveness of aggressive subsidy strategies in China's highly competitive tech landscape. (not investment advice)</p>

Despite a reported 30% decline in net income, largely due to its reliance on Chinese manufacturing, CEO Tarang Amin remains confident, pointing to 26 consecutive quarters of net sales growth. The company, known for its affordable "dupe" products popular with younger consumers, is challenging legacy brands and expanding its market presence. The Rhode deal will bring E.l.f. into Sephora stores, a strategic move analysts are cautiously optimistic about. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>As temperatures rise, pet safety becomes a critical concern, with experts offering guidance on how to protect animals from the heat. The RSPCA warns that exercise is the most common cause of heatstroke in dogs and advises against walks during the hottest parts of the day, suggesting a "pavement test" to check if the ground is too hot for paws. Key signs of heatstroke include excessive panting, confusion, and collapse, requiring immediate cooling and veterinary attention. To keep pets safe, owners should provide ample shade and water, use cooling mats, and never leave an animal in a locked vehicle.</p>

          <p>The United States and China have extended their trade truce for another 90 days, delaying the reimposition of higher tariffs that were set to take effect. President Trump signed an executive order to maintain the pause until November 10, keeping the U.S. levy on Chinese imports at 30% and China's tariff on American goods at 10%. The extension provides more time for negotiations aimed at resolving trade imbalances and what the White House calls "unfair trade practices." However, some U.S. business owners expressed frustration, stating that the continued uncertainty makes it impossible to plan for the future.</p>

          <p>British heavyweight boxer Dillian Whyte has endorsed the idea of a fight between two-time world champion Anthony Joshua and YouTuber-turned-boxer Jake Paul. Speaking ahead of his own match, Whyte stated that if the matchup "makes sense and does numbers," there is no reason it shouldn't happen, suggesting Joshua could earn more from it than some of his title fights. Whyte, who lost to Joshua in 2015, also expressed his own desire for a rematch to "right my wrong." The discussion highlights the increasing influence of celebrity boxing and its financial appeal within the sport.</p>

          <p>Artificial intelligence is rapidly becoming a standard tool in K-12 education, with a significant number of teachers using it to save time on administrative work like creating assignments and grading. Platforms like MagicSchool AI are now used by millions of U.S. teachers, while some large school districts are officially rolling out chatbots like Google's Gemini for classroom use. This adoption is occurring alongside student use of AI for both sanctioned help and cheating, creating a complex new reality for educators. The trend is being encouraged by government initiatives and partnerships between tech giants and teachers unions to promote AI integration in schools.</p>

          <p>Former Las Vegas Raiders coach Jon Gruden has won a significant legal victory against the NFL, as the Nevada Supreme Court ruled his lawsuit can proceed in a civil court. The 5-2 decision prevents the case from being moved to an arbitration hearing, where the NFL commissioner could have designated the arbitrator. Gruden is suing the league, alleging it maliciously orchestrated the leak of his private emails containing offensive language, which led to his resignation in 2021. His attorney stated the ruling vindicates Gruden's reputation and clears a path to holding the NFL accountable for its actions.</p>

          <p>Germany, while appearing liberal in some aspects, maintains a set of quirky and strictly enforced regulations, particularly concerning Sundays and public holidays. For instance, a "Tanzverbot," or dancing ban, is enforced in most states on Good Friday, with potential fines reaching €10,000 in regions like Bavaria. Other unusual rules include prohibitions on mowing lawns or using power tools on Sundays, a ban on building large sandcastles on certain erosion-prone beaches, and it even being an offense to run out of fuel on the Autobahn. These laws reflect a deep-seated tradition of "Ruhezeit" (quiet time) and public order.</p>

          <p>A newly reissued photography book by Adrienne Salinger, titled "In My Room," offers a nostalgic glimpse into the private worlds of American teenagers during the 1980s and '90s. Salinger's work captures her subjects in their bedrooms, spaces that served as personal sanctuaries for constructing identity before the era of social media. The portraits reveal an inflection point between childhood and adolescence, with rooms decorated with a mix of stuffed animals, band posters, drug paraphernalia, and academic brochures. Through her process, Salinger not only documented these spaces but also allowed the teens to see their own lives in a new light.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>India's headline consumer inflation rate fell to 1.55% in July, marking the ninth straight month of decline and its lowest level since June 2017. The continued easing, driven by a drop in food price growth, was below economists' expectations and comes after the Reserve Bank of India held interest rates steady last week. The central bank has noted a more benign inflation outlook, which could provide room for a looser monetary policy to support the economy. However, analysts note the central bank remains cautious, and potential U.S. tariffs could impact future economic performance. (not investment advice)</p>
