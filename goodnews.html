          <p>KindlyMD, a healthcare company focused on opioid addiction treatment, saw its shares skyrocket after merging with Nakamoto Holdings, a bitcoin investment firm led by David Bailey, a crypto advisor to Donald Trump. The newly formed company secured substantial funding through convertible debt and private investment. Nakamoto, under Bailey's leadership, will concentrate on acquiring and holding bitcoin, mirroring a strategy popularized by Michael Saylor's Strategy. While KindlyMD will continue its healthcare operations, the merger signifies a shift towards integrating bitcoin into corporate balance sheets, reflecting a broader trend in the financial sector.</p>

          <p>The 78th Cannes Film Festival is set to showcase a star-studded lineup, including Wes Anderson and Spike Lee, but is overshadowed by potential 100% tariffs on foreign-made films proposed by President Trump. The tariffs could significantly disrupt the film industry, making it harder to produce independent films. Many anticipated American films heading to Cannes were shot abroad, potentially making them targets of the tariffs. Despite the uncertainty, the festival promises a diverse range of films, including those from dissident Iranian director Jafar Panahi and German filmmaker Fatih Akin.</p>

          <p>California Governor Gavin Newsom is escalating efforts to address homelessness by urging cities and counties to ban homeless encampments on public property. While Newsom cannot force municipalities to adopt his model ordinance, he is offering over $3 billion in state housing funds to incentivize its implementation. The ordinance aims to outlaw encampments on sidewalks and parklands, but it does not specify criminal penalties, leaving that decision to local authorities. This move reflects a shift in the Democratic party's approach to homelessness, amid rising frustration among Californians regarding the persistence of encampments.</p>

          <p>President Trump plans to reinstate a controversial policy that aims to lower U.S. drug prices by aligning them with lower prices in foreign countries. The executive order, reviving the "most favored nation" policy, targets "unreasonable and discriminatory policies" abroad that suppress drug prices. It directs HHS to set targets for price reductions and negotiate with the pharmaceutical industry. The order also explores expanding drug imports from developed nations and directs DOJ and FTC to enforce anti-competitive actions.

          <p>President Trump's upcoming trip to the Middle East will focus on securing deals for American AI chipmakers like Nvidia and AMD. The U.S. dominance in AI chips has become a source of leverage, with Gulf states eager to build data centers but reliant on U.S. approval for chip purchases. The Trump administration is expected to use access to AI chips to secure strategic bonds and investment in the United States. The administration is revising regulations on AI chip exports, potentially favoring U.S. companies in building data centers abroad.</p>

          <p>Following the recent trade truce between the U.S. and China, U.S. customers may experience expedited approval of rare earth export permits from Beijing. Although China is unlikely to remove export controls entirely, the Ministry of Commerce could accelerate the licensing process for U.S. clients. China added seven rare earths and related items to a control list in April as retaliation against U.S. tariffs. This development comes as the United States seeks to secure its supply of critical minerals.</p>
