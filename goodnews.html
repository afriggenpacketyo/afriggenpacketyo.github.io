          <p>A federal court has blocked many of President Trump's tariffs, stating he overstepped his authority. The ruling, if upheld, would impact tariffs on goods from Canada, Mexico, and China, with investors reacting positively. Trump has expressed frustration with Russia's progress in Ukraine peace negotiations, but remains hesitant to impose new sanctions. American and European conservatives are convening in Hungary, viewing Viktor Orban's leadership as an inspirational model, although critics cite concerns about democratic institutions. The article also touches on maintaining friendships and a photographer's documentation of Indian American communities.</p>

The company's strong numbers have made it a bellwether for the semiconductor industry and artificial intelligence-related stocks. Despite writing off $4.5 billion in H20 chip inventory due to export restrictions to China, Nvidia's financial results surpassed market expectations, allaying fears of dwindling demand for its graphics processing units. The US has ordered companies producing chemicals and design software for semiconductors to halt shipments to China without a license.</p>
