          <p>Vogue argues that the word "chic" has lost its essence, being co-opted to cover monied strains of taste rather than unique style. The article suggests rehabilitating alternatives like "snazzy," "trendy," and "swish" to add linguistic plurality and make life more interesting. The author expresses finding "chic" less objectionable than "luxurious" but acknowledges its ubiquity. Despite the call for change, the article anticipates that "chic" will outlive us, with cockroaches complimenting each other on their shells in the burning wasteland. The tone is lighthearted and humorous.</p>

          <p>WorldPride is being held in Washington, D.C., this year, causing mixed emotions within the LGBTQ community due to concerns about the Trump administration's policies. While some fear for their safety and question the appropriateness of attending, others view it as an opportunity to take a stand. The Trump administration has rolled back protections for LGBTQ individuals, particularly trans people. Despite the federal government's stance, the District of Columbia is largely democratic, aligning the event with the city's citizens but creating tension with the national political landscape.

          <p>As the Senate debates President Trump's tax and spending package, changes to the child tax credit are being considered.

          <p>California is considering regulations that would prohibit almost all plants within 5 feet of homes to reduce wildfire risk. Scientists argue that well-maintained plants can protect homes from embers and slow fire spread. The proposed "ember-resistant zone" goes further than existing guidelines by prohibiting grass, shrubs, and many trees. Researchers emphasize the importance of well-watered vegetation and home hardening measures, like gutter covers and ember-resistant vents, to mitigate fire risk. The article suggests that a focus on maintenance rather than removal is a more effective approach to wildfire safety.</p>

          <p>California is moving towards mandating phonics-based reading instruction in schools, a significant shift after decades of debate. The proposed law, supported by Gov. Gavin Newsom, aims to improve reading scores by implementing the "science of reading" approach. This approach focuses on phonemic awareness, phonics, fluency, vocabulary, and comprehension. Several districts, including Los Angeles Unified and Long Beach Unified, have already started to embrace structured phonics learning, seeing improvements in test scores. The change is driven by research indicating that children learn best by starting with foundational skills like sounding out and decoding words.</p>

          <p>Lee Jae Myung, the presidential candidate of South Korea's Democratic Party, is projected to win the country's snap presidential election. The election was triggered by the impeachment and removal of President Yoon Suk Yeol. Lee is currently leading in opinion polling and has shifted his stance to the political center. His election could impact South Korea's trade negotiations with the U.S. and policies on China and North Korea. The article implies this is not investment advice.</p>

          <h2>Pennies To Be Phased Out Soon</h2>

          <p>The U.S. Treasury Department announced it will phase out production of the 1-cent coin beginning in early 2026 to comply with a February order from President Donald Trump, who cited costs. Pennies currently in circulation will remain legal tender, but retailers may eventually start rounding prices to the nearest nickel. The production of pennies costs nearly 4 cents each, resulting in an estimated annual loss of $68 million. Existing pennies will continue to be worth their face value. The tone is relatively neutral, as the article is simply conveying information.</p>
