          <div class="timestamp">2025-05-18 08:45:45 EDT</div>
        </div>
        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Moody's has downgraded the U.S. credit rating from Aaa to Aa1, citing concerns over rising government debt and a widening budget deficit. The agency criticized U.S. politicians for failing to address the country's fiscal challenges, anticipating continued large deficits due to increasing entitlement spending. While some investors expect a contained market impact, the downgrade may lead to higher yields on treasuries as investors demand greater compensation for risk. The White House has criticized the move, while some investors maintain that the U.S. dollar's status as the global reserve currency mitigates default risks. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>This article explores the evolving role of college chaplains in meeting the spiritual needs of students, particularly as fewer young people identify with established religions. Chaplains are increasingly offering counseling, support for basic needs, and inclusive spiritual practices to foster a sense of belonging, meaning, and purpose. They address a range of student concerns, from faith and relationships to housing insecurity and mental health, while also collaborating with mental health professionals to provide comprehensive care. This adaptation reflects a broader trend of universities prioritizing student wellness and recognizing the importance of spiritual development.</p>

          <p>A new CDC study indicates a significant decline in RSV hospitalizations among babies under seven months old, attributed to the widespread availability of vaccines during pregnancy and monoclonal antibody treatments. Hospitalizations decreased by as much as 56% compared to pre-pandemic seasons, with newborns experiencing a drop of up to 71%. Emergency physicians have also observed that young children requiring emergency care for RSV often need lower levels of intervention. The study suggests that these preventative measures are highly effective in protecting young infants from severe illness.</p>

          <p>Two volumes of the 2,300-year-old Zidanku Silk Manuscripts, considered the earliest known in China, have been returned to Beijing from the United States after 79 years abroad. These ancient classics, dating back to the Warring States Period, were illegally excavated in 1942 and later acquired by an American collector. The repatriation followed diplomatic efforts and a new ethical returns policy by the Smithsonian Institution. Efforts are underway to secure the return of the third volume, which remains in private ownership.</p>
