          <p>Nintendo's Switch 2 gaming system has seen a record-breaking launch, selling over 3.5 million units in its first four days, leading to "out of stock" notices at major U.S. retailers. The company aims to sell 15 million units in the fiscal year ending March 2026, but analysts predict even higher sales due to strong demand. The Switch 2 has been met with enthusiasm, with fans lining up for midnight releases, and Nintendo expressing gratitude for the positive response. Despite the successful launch, Nintendo's Tokyo-listed shares experienced a slight dip on Wednesday.</p>

          <p>Asian countries are increasingly moving away from reliance on the U.S. dollar due to geopolitical uncertainties and the dollar's potential use as leverage in trade negotiations.

Investors are also hedging their U.S. dollar exposures, increasing demand for local currencies. While the U.S. dollar remains dominant, its share in global foreign exchange reserves has been declining, signaling a gradual shift towards de-dollarization. (not investment advice)</p>
