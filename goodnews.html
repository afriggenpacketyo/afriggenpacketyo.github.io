          <p>Andy Farrell's British and Irish Lions began their 2025 tour with a defeat against Argentina, highlighting issues with cohesion and execution. Despite creating opportunities through sharp passages of play, the Lions struggled with offloads and passing accuracy. Two-time Lion Tadhg Beirne expressed surprise at the lack of immediate cohesion, considering the presence of "world class" players. Farrell acknowledged the team compounded too many errors, hindering their ability to dictate the pace of the game. The team will need to sharpen up before hitting Australian shores. </p>

          <p>President Trump suggested he may strike a deal with Harvard University to resolve their ongoing dispute over international student visas. This follows a federal judge's decision to block the administration from revoking Harvard's ability to enroll international students. The Department of Homeland Security had previously threatened to revoke Harvard's certification due to alleged failures in addressing campus antisemitism. Trump has indicated that the potential deal could be "mindbogglingly" historic and beneficial for the country. The legal battle has significant implications for Harvard, where a substantial portion of the student body is international. </p>

          <p>Rhode Island's state House has approved legislation that would ban the sale and manufacturing of certain semiautomatic rifles, commonly referred to as assault weapons. The bill now goes to Governor Dan McKee, who has voiced his support for assault weapons bans. The law only applies to the sale and manufacturing of assault weapons, not possession, similar to Washington state's law. Critics argue the bill does little to curb mass shootings and penalizes law-abiding citizens. Gun control advocates have been pushing for such a ban in Rhode Island for over a decade. </p>
