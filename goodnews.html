          <p>President Donald Trump declared Washington D.C. a "crime-free zone" on Truth Social, attributing the change to his federal crackdown. This article reports on Trump's posts, which cited recent arrest figures, including an MS-13 gang member and individuals for assault on federal officers and sexual assault. The declaration follows his invocation of a public safety emergency two weeks prior, placing the Metropolitan Police Department under federal control and deploying National Guard troops and federal agents. Preliminary data reportedly showed a 40% drop in robberies and auto break-ins, reflecting a substantial increase in enforcement activity.</p>

          <p>Matcha, the traditional Japanese green tea powder, is experiencing a global boom, turning it into a lucrative commodity but also straining production. This article highlights how surging demand, fueled by its "superfood" reputation and post-pandemic tourism, has led to significant price increases and supply shortages even in Japan. The Japanese government is considering subsidies to encourage more tencha cultivation, the tea used for matcha, as farmers face labor-intensive processes. The "matcha mania" reflects a cultural export success but also poses challenges for sustainable production and affordability, with concerns about future harvests due to climate.</p>
