          <p>Nvidia CEO Jensen Huang lauded China's generative artificial intelligence models, such as those from DeepSeek, Alibaba, Tencent, and Baidu, praising them as world-class and significant contributors to global AI development. Speaking at a Beijing supply chain expo, Huang's comments arrived as Nvidia prepares to resume H20 chip shipments to China, a decision following U.S. government assurances after previous export controls had severely impacted the company's revenue. He highlighted China's open-source AI approach as a catalyst for international progress and a key factor for AI safety and cooperation. Huang also pointed to AI's extensive integration into major Chinese consumer technology platforms, showcasing its pervasive influence across the nation.</p>

          <p>Nicholas Burns, who served as the U.S. ambassador to China under former President Joe Biden, indicated that the United States and China are gradually moving towards a trade agreement, driven by mutual economic interests. Speaking at the Aspen Security Forum, Burns unexpectedly supported former President Trump's tariff approach, refuting claims that China had a negotiating advantage. He underscored the interdependent economic ties, pointing to over 10,000 American companies operating in China and the U.S. being China's largest export market. This development occurs during a 90-day trade truce, with a deadline approaching in August for a more lasting resolution.</p>

          <h2>Trump Announces Crypto Regulation Bills Now Have Support for Passage</h2>
          <div class="timestamp">2025-07-16 00:29:41 EDT</div>

          <p>President Donald Trump announced that critical cryptocurrency regulation bills, which had previously failed to clear a procedural hurdle in the House, now have the necessary votes to move forward after a White House meeting with Republican representatives. The proposed legislation includes the GENIUS Act, designed to regulate stablecoins, and the CLARITY Act, which would establish rules for classifying digital assets as securities or commodities. Trump's swift intervention underscores his significant influence within the Republican party and his strategic push to position the U.S. as a global leader in digital assets. This legislative progress is intended to provide regulatory certainty for the crypto industry and prevent the creation of a central bank digital currency. (not investment advice)</p>

This action aims to unify regulations across states, following the NCAA's 2021 decision to permit athlete compensation from endorsements and appearances, a move that significantly altered collegiate sports. The order comes as a House subcommittee also advanced a bill, the "SCORE Act," on the same issue. This initiative reflects Trump's continued focus on the future of sports, especially after a recent federal judge-approved settlement allowing schools to directly pay student athletes.</p>
