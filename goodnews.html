          <p>Following a historic election loss for the Liberal-National coalition in Australia, Sussan Ley has been elected as the first female leader of the Liberal Party. Ley, a seasoned politician who has held the seat of Farrer since 2001 and served in various senior ministerial roles, aims to rebuild the party's relationship with Australians, especially women and young people who felt neglected. She plans to review all party policies, including those related to nuclear energy and net-zero emissions, emphasizing a fresh approach and collaborative decision-making. The appointment comes as Anthony Albanese was sworn in as Prime Minister after his Labor Party's landslide victory.</p>

          <p>A China-led international research team has analyzed seismic data from NASA's InSight lander, revealing a zone in Mars' crust that suggests the presence of liquid water locked in rock just a few kilometers beneath the surface. This discovery, if confirmed, could indicate a significant amount of water, potentially matching what scientists believe to be Mars' missing water. The findings offer new insights into Mars' water cycle and the potential for habitable environments on the planet, using data collected by the InSight lander's seismometer between 2018 and 2022.</p>

          <p>The article discusses how German companies, significant investors in the United States, are rethinking their investment strategies due to trade tensions and tariffs. While German firms have long had a strong presence in the U.S., recent surveys indicate a pullback in investment and a more pessimistic outlook. The German Chamber of Commerce and Industry noted a decline in sentiment among German companies with U.S. factories since tariffs were introduced. Simultaneously, there's increased interest in investing within Germany, spurred by a new government focused on reducing bureaucracy and investing in infrastructure.</p>

          <p>China's increasing investment in STEM fields is attracting top international mathematicians and fostering original research, according to Professor Mok Ngaiming. The shift from rote learning to encouraging innovation, coupled with growing international collaborations, is drawing mathematicians from countries like Australia, France, and the United States. These academics cite talented students, better work opportunities, and China's growing strength and investment in the field as reasons for moving. The return of overseas-trained talent is also contributing to the development of mathematics in China.</p>
