          <p>The Vera Rubin Observatory in Chile, equipped with the world's largest digital camera, has released its first images of star nurseries and galaxies, showcasing unprecedented clarity. The observatory's telescope and camera will conduct detailed images of the southern hemisphere sky for a decade, creating an ultra-wide, ultra-high-definition, time-lapse record of the cosmos. Among the first images are composite photos of the Trifid Nebula and the Lagoon Nebula, both star birthplaces within the Milky Way, as well as the Virgo Cluster, which comprises up to 2,000 galaxies. The observatory will begin its Legacy Survey of Space and Time later this year, tracking asteroids and interstellar objects.</p>

        </div>
        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Researchers in China have found the first evidence that subatomic particles from cosmic rays may be affecting the efficiency of error correction techniques in quantum computing. The scientists monitored superconducting quantum chips alongside muons, fundamental subatomic particles produced by cosmic rays, and gamma ray-induced particle disturbances. They observed quasiparticle bursts leading to correlated errors induced by muons, separating the contributions of muons and gamma rays. These findings could be significant for the scaling of quantum processors and the design of fault-tolerant quantum computing systems, potentially improving the stability and accuracy of quantum computations.</p>

          <p>Aaron Wolf, a Tokyo Olympic judo gold medalist, has announced his transition to a professional wrestling career, joining New Japan Pro Wrestling. The 29-year-old, who retired from judo earlier this month, won gold in the men's 100-kilogram judo event at the 2021 Tokyo Olympics and finished seventh at the Paris Games. Wolf, born to a Japanese mother and American father, is already a popular media personality and follows in the footsteps of Naoya Ogawa, who also transitioned from judo to professional wrestling after winning a silver medal at the 1992 Barcelona Olympics. His move into professional wrestling marks a new chapter in his athletic career.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>NATO allies are expected to pledge to increase their defense spending, potentially reaching 5% of their gross domestic product (GDP), driven by pressure from the U.S. The 5% target includes 3.5% for pure defense and 1.5% for security-related infrastructure like cyber warfare capabilities. While some member states are committed to reaching this milestone, others struggle to meet the existing 2% threshold agreed upon a decade ago. The U.S. is seeking concrete plans and commitments, while some European allies may attempt to dilute the pledges, leading to potential clashes at the upcoming summit. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>An NHS Lothian psychiatrist is hoping to establish a ketamine clinic by the end of the year to treat severe depression, offering an alternative to electroconvulsive therapy (ECT). This move follows the opening of a private clinic in Lanarkshire that provides ketamine-assisted therapy for treatment-resistant depression. While ketamine is not licensed for routine depression treatment, it can be used 'off-label' by doctors. The potential NHS clinic aims to provide an additional option for patients who have not responded well to multiple antidepressants and other treatments, potentially improving their quality of life.</p>
