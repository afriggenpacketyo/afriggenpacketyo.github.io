          <p>The Japanese government has announced a 100 billion yen policy package aimed at attracting foreign researchers, particularly those potentially leaving the United States due to research funding cuts. The initiative seeks to establish an elite research environment in Japan, focusing on competitive fields like artificial intelligence and semiconductors. The government intends to utilize profits from a 10 trillion yen investment fund to support internationally competitive research at universities. Science and technology policy minister Minoru Kiuchi emphasized Japan's commitment to becoming the most attractive destination for researchers worldwide, aiming to improve Japan's standing in scientific research and technological advancement.</p>

          <p>With one year until the FIFA World Cup 2026, co-hosted by the U.S., Mexico, and Canada, significant preparations are underway, though challenges remain.

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>In response to reciprocal tariffs imposed by the United States, Beijing is promoting the use of domestic letters of credit (L/Cs) to help Chinese exporters shift their focus to the domestic market. Domestic L/Cs serve as a financial guarantee, ensuring payment security and enhancing credit for Chinese firms. While international L/Cs are limited to physical goods transactions, domestic L/Cs can also be used for trade in services, providing greater flexibility for businesses. This initiative aims to mitigate the impact of trade tensions by facilitating increased domestic sales and supporting Chinese exporters.</p>

          <p>Japan is hoping to secure special treatment from the United States in ongoing tariff negotiations, particularly in light of President Donald Trump's indication of a potential increase in import levies on automobiles. Tokyo's top negotiator, Ryosei Akazawa, expressed confidence that Japan would receive distinct treatment once a bilateral deal is finalized. Trump's threat to raise auto tariffs aims to incentivize greater investment in American manufacturing. Akazawa is visiting Washington to advance talks ahead of a possible meeting between Prime Minister Shigeru Ishiba and Trump during the G7 summit in Canada.</p>

          <p>A senior market strategist at the World Gold Council argues that cryptocurrencies like Bitcoin are not a viable alternative to gold and do not pose a threat to its role as a safe-haven investment. John Reade emphasizes that long-term demand for gold remains strong due to concerns over US dollar assets, trade tensions, and economic fallout from tariffs. He points out that cryptocurrencies tend to move with equities, unlike gold, which acts as a hedge during market volatility. He concludes that digital assets do not present any significant risks or comparison to gold.</p>
