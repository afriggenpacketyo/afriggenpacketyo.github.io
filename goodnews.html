        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>The pharmaceutical industry is experiencing relief after President Trump's administration struck a deal with Pfizer, which includes a three-year exemption from drug-specific tariffs in exchange for lower U.S. drug prices and domestic manufacturing investments. This agreement is seen as a template for other major drugmakers, many of whom have already announced new U.S. investments. The deal provides much-needed certainty, signaling a potential shift away from punitive tariffs and toward negotiated pricing agreements. As a result, shares for Pfizer and several other pharmaceutical companies rose following the announcement.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>General Motors and Ford both reported an approximate 8% increase in overall U.S. auto sales for the third quarter, largely driven by record sales of electric vehicles. Consumers appeared to rush purchases to take advantage of a $7,500 federal EV incentive that expired in September. GM's EV sales more than doubled, while Ford's increased by 30% compared to the same period last year. Industry analysts expect a temporary slowdown in EV sales following the incentive's expiration, but some automakers like Hyundai are already offering new discounts to maintain momentum.</p>

          <p>The Supreme Court has ruled that Federal Reserve Governor Lisa Cook can continue in her role while it considers a case regarding her potential termination by President Donald Trump. The decision defers the administration's request to fire Cook until after oral arguments are heard in January 2026. President Trump has sought to remove Cook based on unproven allegations of mortgage fraud, which she denies, raising concerns about political interference with the Federal Reserve's independence. This ruling allows Cook to participate in upcoming Federal Open Market Committee meetings, where key decisions on interest rates will be made.</p>

          <p>Walmart has announced a plan to remove synthetic dyes and over 30 other ingredients, including certain artificial sweeteners and preservatives, from its private-label food products by 2027. The change will affect approximately 1,000 items across brands like Great Value and is a response to growing consumer demand for simpler, more familiar ingredients. This move by the nation's largest grocer reflects a broader industry trend towards cleaner food labels, with companies like Kraft Heinz and General Mills also removing artificial dyes. Consumer advocacy groups have praised the decision, noting it will have a significant impact on the food supply for millions of Americans.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Following the Federal Reserve's recent interest rate cut, the average rate for a 30-year fixed mortgage has fallen to a three-year low of 6.13%. For a $600,000 mortgage, this translates to a monthly principal and interest payment of approximately $3,648, which is about $360 less per month compared to rates seen at the beginning of the year. This reduction in borrowing costs offers significant savings for potential homebuyers and current homeowners considering refinancing. The article highlights how Fed policy directly impacts consumer finances, making homeownership more manageable amid rising inflation. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>Neptune Insurance Holdings, the largest private flood insurance company in the U.S., made its debut on the New York Stock Exchange in what is considered opportune timing. The company's IPO occurred on the first day of the federal government shutdown, which has halted operations for the government-run National Flood Insurance Program (NFIP). As the NFIP cannot process new applications or claims, Neptune remains open for business, potentially capturing customers who need flood insurance to close on home purchases. The company utilizes AI and advanced technology to assess risk, offering an alternative to the federal program as more properties seek private coverage.</p>

          <p>As of today, every general practitioner's office in England must provide patients with the ability to book appointments online throughout the workday, from 8:00 AM to 6:30 PM. The government-mandated change is designed to end the "8am scramble" where patients rush to get through on busy phone lines. However, the British Medical Association (BMA), the doctors' union, opposes the move, warning that an "online triage tsunami" could overwhelm practices and potentially put patients at risk. The BMA has formally entered a dispute over the system, which could lead to protest actions by GPs.</p>
