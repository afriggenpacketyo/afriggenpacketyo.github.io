          <p>U.S. Treasury Secretary Scott Bessent indicated that the United States could extend a 90-day pause on implementing steep tariffs on goods from major trading partners if negotiations continue "in good faith." Bessent noted ongoing talks with 18 important trading partners, including Japan, ahead of a meeting between Prime Minister Shigeru Ishiba and President Donald Trump. Trump later suggested that an extension might not be necessary. The pause applies to country-specific tariffs under the reciprocal scheme, but not to baseline duties or sector-specific tariffs.</p>

The 86-million-year-old skeletons belong to the closest known ancestor of all tyrannosaurs, including the T. rex. Khankhuuluu represents an evolutionary shift from small hunters to formidable giants, weighing about 750kg. The species also exhibits early stages of features key to tyrannosaurs' dominance, such as skull anatomy that enabled a strong jaw.</p>
