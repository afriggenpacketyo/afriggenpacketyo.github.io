          <p>The World Bank has cleared Syria's $15.5 million debt after Saudi Arabia and Qatar made the payments, allowing the bank to re-engage with Syria to address the nation's development needs following years of conflict. This move follows President Trump's surprise announcement to lift sanctions on Syria, signaling a shift in U.S. policy and easing Syria's diplomatic isolation. DP World, a Dubai-based port operator, has also signed an $800-million memorandum of understanding to develop the Mediterranean port of Tartus, indicating growing confidence in Syria among international investors. Despite these positive developments, Syria faces significant challenges, including damaged infrastructure, displaced populations, and sectarian violence that threatens long-term stability.</p>

          <p>Calligraphy created by Ahn Jung-geun, a South Korean independence activist who assassinated Japan's first prime minister, Ito Hirobumi, while awaiting execution, is fetching record prices at auction in Seoul. Ahn, revered for his efforts against Japanese encroachment, created the calligraphy in his prison cell, often at the request of Japanese officials. Despite assassinating Ito, some Japanese officials preserved his calligraphy, reflecting the cultural and political contradictions of early 20th-century East Asia. The piece "Green Bamboo" was sold last month for $674,098 to the family of South Korea's LS Group, who intend to share it with the public.</p>

          <p>Mark Cuban, along with veteran sports executives Rashaun Williams and Steve Cannon, has launched Harbinger Sports Partners (HSP), a $750 million private equity fund focused on acquiring minority stakes in U.S. sports franchises. HSP will use a data-driven approach to identify undervalued sports assets, seeking positions of 1% to 5% in 92 franchises with deal sizes ranging from $50 million to $150 million. The move comes as professional sports leagues increasingly open the door to private equity investment, with the NFL recently approving stakes of up to 10% by select firms. Cuban sold his majority stake in the Dallas Mavericks in December 2023 but retains a 27% minority stake.</p>

          <p>Staff employees at the Kennedy Center for the Performing Arts are seeking to unionize due to job uncertainty and layoffs following changes implemented by the Trump administration. More than 150 employees across various departments aim to secure collective bargaining rights and restore a sense of security, transparency, and communication from leadership. The unionization effort follows the installation of President Trump as the chairman of the Board of Trustees and the dismissal of key executive leaders. Employees report a lack of communication, declining ticket sales, and recent layoffs, leading them to seek unionization with the UAW to protect jobs and ensure the future of the Kennedy Center in a non-partisan manner.</p>

          <p>The LA Galaxy have extended head coach Greg Vanney's contract for three years through the 2028 season, making him one of the highest-paid coaches in MLS despite the club's disastrous 0-10-3 start to the season.

The club lauded Vanney's "vision" for the road ahead, despite the team's current struggles.

          <p>The Federal Reserve plans to reduce its headcount by 10% over the next couple of years, according to a memo from Chair Jerome Powell. The reduction will include offering deferred resignation to some older employees.

The memo comes as the Trump administration has pushed for cost cuts across civil service agencies, although Powell's memo did not mention DOGE as a factor in the decision to shrink headcount.</p>
