          <p>Stock prices for Warner Bros. Discovery and Paramount Skydance surged significantly following reports that the latter is preparing a takeover bid for the entire Warner Bros. Discovery business. This potential acquisition would consolidate major media assets, including CNN, HBO, and the Warner Bros. film studio, under the leadership of David Ellison. The move signals further consolidation in a media industry being reshaped by streaming and comes as companies face increased scrutiny from the Trump administration. While no formal offer has been made, Warner Bros. Discovery shares closed up 29% on the news.</p>

          <p>A majority of justices on a Brazilian Supreme Court panel have voted to convict former President Jair Bolsonaro on multiple charges, including attempting to orchestrate a coup to unlawfully remain in power after his 2022 election loss. The landmark ruling found the far-right leader guilty of being the instigator of a criminal organization that sought to undermine democratic rule. The conviction, which could result in a lengthy prison sentence, has deepened political divisions within Brazil and prompted criticism from U.S. President Trump. Bolsonaro's legal team has stated they will appeal the verdict to the full 11-member Supreme Court.</p>

Michelle and John Wylie were baffled by the man's presence at their 2021 ceremony and had no luck identifying him through friends or family. The man, Andrew Hillhouse, came forward and explained that he had accidentally attended the wrong wedding after his partner gave him the incorrect venue name. He realized his mistake only when the bride walked down the aisle and, not wanting to cause a disruption, stayed through the ceremony and was inadvertently included in a group photograph.</p>

          <p>Newcastle United's new £55m striker, Yoane Wissa, has had a remarkable journey to the Premier League, marked by resilience after surviving a horrific acid attack in 2021. The assault, which occurred at his home in France just before he joined Brentford, could have ended his career and his sight. A former manager noted Wissa's immediate determination to recover and succeed, a trait that has defined his career. His recent, and somewhat controversial, push to leave Brentford for Newcastle is seen by those who know him as another example of his unwavering focus on achieving his goals, no matter the obstacles.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>A potential acquisition of Warner Bros. Discovery by Paramount Skydance would create a media titan with an immense portfolio of valuable intellectual property and sports broadcasting rights. The deal would combine Paramount's franchises like 'Star Trek' and 'Mission: Impossible' with Warner's iconic assets, including the DC superhero universe, 'Harry Potter,' and 'Game of Thrones.' Furthermore, it would merge Warner's rights to broadcast MLB, NHL, and March Madness with Paramount's new exclusive deal for UFC events. This consolidation would create a content library and sports arsenal powerful enough to compete directly with industry giants like Disney.</p>

          <p>English golfer Matt Fitzpatrick experienced a bizarre incident at the BMW PGA Championship that he believes ultimately worked in his favor. After his tee shot on the 18th hole went into the bushes just before a weather delay, his ball could not be found upon resumption of play. Eyewitnesses reported seeing two individuals run off with a golf ball from that area, leading Fitzpatrick to conclude it was stolen. This allowed him to take a penalty drop instead of playing a provisional ball from a worse position, a situation he feels saved him at least one stroke and contributed to his strong opening round score.</p>

          <p>Manchester United has sent goalkeeper Andre Onana to Turkish club Trabzonspor on a loan deal for the remainder of the 2025-26 season. The move comes after Onana, who was signed from Inter Milan for £47.2 million in 2023 to be the team's primary keeper, failed to appear in the club's first three Premier League matches of the new season. His only game time this year was during a surprising loss in the Carabao Cup. The loan provides an opportunity for the Cameroonian international to secure regular playing time while United moves forward with other options in goal.</p>

          <p>The conviction of former President Jair Bolsonaro for attempting a coup marks a pivotal moment for Brazil, a nation with a history of political instability and military rule. This article explains that the trial, which was widely broadcast, has been seen by critics as a necessary step to uphold democratic principles and set a precedent against undermining elections. Evidence presented included alleged assassination plots and systematic efforts to cast doubt on the voting system. While Bolsonaro's supporters, including President Trump, decry the trial as political persecution, the verdict is viewed by many as a crucial defense of Brazil's young democracy.</p>

Bessent has recently held discussions with former Fed officials Lawrence Lindsey, Kevin Warsh, and James Bullard. The process is part of a broader consideration of economists and market strategists to lead the central bank when current Chair Jerome Powell's term expires. Alongside the interviews, Bessent is reportedly advocating for a reform agenda at the Fed, including a reduction of its large bond portfolio and overall economic footprint.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Average 30-year mortgage rates have fallen to 6.35%, their lowest point in almost a year, creating a potential opportunity for prospective homebuyers and those considering refinancing. The decline is attributed to expectations of an interest rate cut by the Federal Reserve and a cooling 10-year Treasury yield. This article advises consumers to weigh the risks of waiting for potentially lower rates against the possibility of them rising again. For current homeowners, it suggests that if today's rates are at least a percentage point below their existing mortgage rate, exploring a refinance could be a financially beneficial move.

This arrangement will continue until Japan has fully recouped its initial $550 billion investment. After that threshold is met, the profit-sharing model will shift dramatically, with the United States receiving 90% of future profits and Japan receiving the remaining 10%, ensuring a long-term financial benefit for America.</p>

          <p>A debate is growing in Germany over whether classic literary works by authors like Goethe should remain central to the high school curriculum. Proponents of reform argue that the current required reading lists are dominated by historical male authors and fail to reflect the diversity of modern Germany, where a large percentage of students have immigrant backgrounds. They contend that contemporary and diverse voices would be more relevant and engaging for today's youth. Conversely, defenders of the classics stress their importance in understanding history and developing critical thinking, suggesting a blended approach that includes both classic and modern works.</p>
