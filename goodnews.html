        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Chipmaker Nvidia's market capitalization surpassed $4 trillion for the first time, a historic milestone for any public company. The surge is driven by immense investor demand for its graphics processing units (GPUs), which are essential for powering the ongoing generative artificial intelligence boom. This achievement solidifies Nvidia's position as the world's most valuable company, having overtaken tech giants Microsoft and Apple. The company's value has grown exponentially, crossing the $2 trillion mark in February 2024 and the $3 trillion mark just last month in June. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>The Bank of New York Mellon, the nation's oldest bank, will act as the primary custodian for the reserves backing Ripple's new U.S. dollar-pegged stablecoin, RLUSD. This partnership aims to enhance the stablecoin's regulatory compliance and institutional credibility amid growing interest in digital assets from traditional finance. The move comes as major companies reportedly explore stablecoin usage, signaling a broader trend of institutional adoption. Ripple recently launched RLUSD and has also applied for a national banking charter to further its integration with the financial system. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>An expedition exploring the ancient Antikythera shipwreck, which dates to the first century, has successfully retrieved significant artifacts and portions of the vessel's hull. Divers recovered a rare set of wooden planks and framing, offering valuable new insights into ancient shipbuilding techniques. The team also discovered fragments of a marble statue of a nude male and a terracotta mortar used for food preparation. These findings add to the rich history of the site, where numerous statues, jewelry, and even human remains have been found since its discovery in 1900.</p>

          <p>Amid intensified immigration enforcement under the Trump administration, several viral social media claims about the U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE) have been debunked. One unproven claim alleged that deportees were being thrown from planes into the ocean, a theory for which a leading flight-tracking expert found no evidence. Another misleading post used out-of-context images from migrant tragedies in Libya and Bangladesh to depict U.S. deportations. Additionally, a widely viewed video purporting to show an ICE raid on a farm was identified as a fake created with Google's AI video generator.</p>

          <h2>Analysis Shows New US Spending Bill Provides Tax Deduction, Not Elimination of Social Security Tax</h2>
          <div class="timestamp">2025-07-09 09:35:46 EDT</div>
        </div>
        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Contrary to some claims, President Trump's recently passed "big, beautiful bill" does not eliminate federal income taxes on Social Security benefits. Instead, the legislation introduces a new, temporary tax deduction of up to $6,000 for seniors aged 65 and older with incomes below a certain threshold. While the White House states this will result in nearly 90% of beneficiaries paying no tax on their benefits, policy experts clarify this is due to the new deduction, not a direct change to how benefits are taxed. The deduction, which expires in 2028, applies to all income, not just Social Security. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>The Danish parliament has overwhelmingly approved a Defense Cooperation Agreement (DCA) that grants the U.S. military broad access to its territory. The ratification proceeded despite recent statements from President Trump about potentially occupying Greenland for U.S. national security reasons, which has caused public unease. Analysts suggest Denmark had little choice but to approve the deal, as it relies on U.S. military support for its own security commitments within NATO. The agreement is seen as a necessary measure to ensure rapid U.S. aid in an emergency, solidifying a strategic partnership despite political friction.</p>

          <p>Democratic socialist Zohran Mamdani secured a stunning victory in the New York City mayoral primary, largely attributed to his sophisticated and modern social media campaign. The 33-year-old candidate utilized platforms like TikTok and Instagram with influencer-style videos, celebrity cameos, and a distinct visual brand to engage a younger, online electorate. His strategy, endorsed by progressive figures like Rep. Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez, focused on radical proposals such as government-run grocery stores and a rent freeze. Mamdani's win signals a potential generational and ideological shift within the Democratic Party in New York.</p>

          <p>In an economy with persistent inflation, Certificates of Deposit (CDs) offer a way for savers to earn returns that can outpace the loss of purchasing power. Top CD accounts currently provide rates higher than inflation, with the added security of being able to lock in those rates for a fixed term. While national average yields for one-year CDs are around 2.01%, competitive online banks are offering much higher rates, with some one-year terms reaching 4.40% APY. Experts suggest considering short-term CDs and exploring online banks to find the most competitive returns available in the current market. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>When facing a tax debt with the IRS, taxpayers must decide between handling it themselves or hiring a professional. For smaller debts under $10,000 and simple situations, a do-it-yourself approach, such as setting up an online payment plan, may be sufficient. However, for larger debts over $10,000, complex situations involving unfiled returns, or when seeking an Offer in Compromise, enlisting a tax professional is highly recommended. Experts warn that failing to get professional help when needed can lead to more costly outcomes and severe collection efforts like tax liens or levies. (not investment advice)</p>
