          <h2>Judge Affirms Musk's Leadership Role in DOGE as 'Continuing and Permanent'</h2>

        </div>
        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>A federal judge has ruled that Elon Musk's role leading the Department of Government Efficiency (DOGE) is "continuing and permanent," rejecting the White House's attempt to downplay his influence in a lawsuit brought by 14 states. The states argue that Musk lacks the legal authority to make sweeping changes to the federal government because he is not a Senate-confirmed officer, and DOGE was never authorized by Congress. The judge, Tanya Chutkan, found that Musk's reach extends throughout the executive branch, giving the states a credible argument to move forward with their case. The lawsuit alleges that DOGE gained "unauthorized access" to "private and proprietary information," leading to the decision to allow the case to proceed, while Trump was dismissed as a defendant.</p>

          <p>Toyota Motor is targeting significant growth in plug-in hybrid electric vehicles (PHEVs), twenty-five years after introducing hybrid vehicles to the American market with the Prius. Unlike traditional hybrids, PHEVs can function as all-electric vehicles for a certain number of miles before needing a gas-powered engine and require charging with a plug. Toyota plans to increase PHEVs from 2.4% of its U.S. sales volume last year to roughly 20% by 2030, though this could change based on regulations, customer acceptance, and affordability. This expansion comes amid regulatory uncertainty and slower-than-expected adoption of all-electric vehicles, with the company continuing to invest billions in both technologies.</p>

          <p>A judge has ruled that a team from the Department of Government Efficiency (DOGE) can now access a sensitive Treasury Department system that controls trillions of dollars in federal payments. Judge Jeannette Vargas granted permission for four DOGE employees to access the Bureau of the Fiscal Service, which serves as the checkbook for the federal government. This ruling marks a win for the Trump administration and DOGE, which faced legal challenges in February when it initially sought access to the Treasury Department‚Äôs payment systems. The attorneys general did not object to allowing DOGE‚Äôs access if the employees were properly trained.</p>

          <p>This article discusses the potential implications of the U.S. government demanding ‚Äúgolden shares‚Äù in foreign acquisitions of strategic American companies, such as the proposed Nippon Steel acquisition of U.S. Steel. A golden share would grant the U.S. government veto power over certain corporate functions and board appointments, which is extraordinary for such a transaction and goes beyond typical national security reviews. The article explores whether this could become a new blueprint for foreign direct investment in the U.S., particularly in strategic sectors, and raises concerns about potential retaliatory measures from other countries. It also considers the risk of future administrations using golden shares for politically driven mandates.</p>

          <p>Elon Musk has criticized the Republican spending bill, stating that it undermines the work he's been doing to reduce wasteful government spending as head of the Department of Government Efficiency (DOGE). Musk expressed disappointment, saying the bill increases the budget deficit rather than decreasing it, thereby undermining DOGE's efforts to save taxpayer money. DOGE claims to have saved $170 billion since January by targeting government waste and redundancy, including staff reductions and agency streamlining. Musk has pulled back from his DOGE work to focus on his companies, noting that the federal bureaucracy is "much worse than I realized."</p>
