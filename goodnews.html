          <p>The United States has accepted a Boeing 747 jet as a gift from Qatar, intended for potential use as the new Air Force One, raising concerns about security and improper influence. The article reports that the plane, valued at around $200 million, will require extensive modifications to meet security standards, including missile defense systems and protection against electromagnetic pulses. Members of Congress worry that President Trump may pressure the Air Force to expedite the work, potentially compromising security. Qatar's prime minister rejected accusations of bribery, asserting the gift is a gesture of respect and partnership between the two countries, as the plane is meant to replace the current aging Air Force One planes.</p>

The author argues that these distractions drive stock prices down, allowing investors to buy quality companies at lower prices. He highlights the importance of focusing on the underlying companies rather than short-term market fluctuations. The author notes current distractions include the president's focus on domestic manufacturing, tax bill uncertainties, tariff threats, and concerns about the data center industrial revolution.

          <p>The NFL's spring league meetings decided against banning the "tush push," a play popularized by the Philadelphia Eagles, after a proposal by the Green Bay Packers failed to reach the required majority. The Eagles posted on X, formerly Twitter, a graphic of the "tush push" with the words "push on." The Packers cited player safety and pace of play as reasons to ban the play, though the NFL has previously said that no injuries have been reported on the tush push. Eagles owner Jeffrey Lurie delivered a "passionate but fair" speech at the spring league meetings, and former Eagles center Jason Kelce also spoke in defense of the play.</p>

          <p>The Senate passed a surprise 'no tax on tips' bill, prompting a discussion on its potential effects on workers. The bill allows workers to deduct all "qualified tips" from 2025 through 2028, requiring tips to be reported to qualify. Experts note that the policy primarily benefits moderate to middle-income workers, as lower-income tipped workers often don't pay federal income tax due to their earnings falling under the standard deduction. Concerns are raised about potential issues, such as the introduction of tips in new occupations and the misclassification of income as tips. (not investment advice)</p>
