          <p>Super Bowl champion Brandon Graham, who retired after 15 seasons with the Philadelphia Eagles, is reportedly considering a return to the team. The potential comeback follows the unexpected retirement of fellow defensive player Za’Darius Smith, which depleted the team's defensive depth. Graham, the longest-tenured player in franchise history, would provide a significant boost to the Eagles' pass rush if a contract is finalized. The 37-year-old veteran retired with 76.5 career sacks and was a key member of two Super Bowl-winning teams, making his experience highly valuable.</p>

          <p>Figures from the world of cricket, including Sir Geoffrey Boycott and Michael Vaughan, attended the funeral of legendary umpire Dickie Bird in Barnsley. Bird, who passed away at 92, was remembered for his eccentric personality and fairness on the field, where he officiated in 66 Tests and three World Cup finals. After a playing career with Yorkshire and Leicestershire was cut short by injury, he became one of the sport's most recognizable umpires. The funeral procession paused at his statue in Barnsley, honoring a figure celebrated for his immense contribution and passion for the game.</p>

The 20-year-old, known as the "Quad God," successfully landed five quadruple jumps in his free skate, solidifying his status as a top contender for the upcoming Winter Olympics. His victory extends an unbeaten streak that has lasted nearly two years, and he achieved it without attempting his signature quadruple axel. The event also saw French ice dancer Guillaume Cizeron win gold with his new partner, Laurence Fournier Beaudry.</p>

          <p>J.D. Power has released its 2025 North American Airport Satisfaction Study, ranking the best "mega airports," which serve 33 million or more passengers annually. The study evaluates passenger satisfaction across seven key areas, including ease of travel, terminal facilities, and food and retail options. For the second consecutive year, the top three airports remained unchanged, with their success attributed to strong performance in fundamental services like cleanliness and TSA efficiency. An expert noted that while the ongoing government shutdown is affecting air travel, it has not yet had a major impact on these satisfaction rankings.</p>

          <p>An excerpt from actor Tim Curry's upcoming memoir, "Vagabond," offers a glimpse into his perspective on his career and identity. Curry, known for iconic roles like Dr. Frank-N-Furter in "The Rocky Horror Picture Show," embraces the term "vagabond" to describe his life of constant movement and reinvention. He recounts a humorous anecdote about being mistaken for an imposter at a "Rocky Horror" screening, using it to explore the nature of his profession. The memoir also touches upon the 2012 stroke that has limited him physically but left his memories intact, promising a reflection on his life rather than a typical Hollywood tell-all.</p>

          <p>Madrid's city center was filled with the sounds of bleating and bells as thousands of sheep and goats were herded through the streets for the annual Transhumance Festival. The event celebrates the ancient pastoral tradition of moving livestock between seasonal grazing grounds and highlights its modern environmental benefits, such as using livestock to clear flammable undergrowth and reduce wildfire risk. Organizers led approximately 1,100 Merino sheep and 200 goats along historic droving routes that predate the city itself. The festival draws large crowds of tourists and locals, connecting Spain's urban present with its rural heritage.</p>

          <p>Pakistan and the Taliban-led government in Afghanistan have agreed to an immediate ceasefire following more than a week of deadly fighting along their shared border. The agreement, mediated by Qatar and Turkey, aims to establish mechanisms for lasting peace and stability in the region. The clashes, the most severe since the Taliban's return to power in 2021, were fueled by Pakistan's accusations that the Taliban harbors militant groups that attack its territory. Both sides have agreed to halt hostile actions, with further talks scheduled in Istanbul.</p>

          <p>The UK government has unveiled a strategy to generate 400,000 new jobs by 2030 by expanding the country's clean energy sector. The plan targets 31 priority occupations, including plumbers, electricians, and welders, to support growth in renewable, wind, solar, and nuclear energy. To facilitate this, the government will establish five "technical excellence colleges" and launch programs to match military veterans and others with careers in the green economy. Energy Secretary Ed Miliband stated the initiative is crucial for lowering energy bills long-term and creating well-paid, secure jobs in industrial heartlands. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>A commentary piece commends two federal district court judges for their decisions to block the deployment of the National Guard to Portland and Chicago. The article argues that the judges courageously challenged the president's justifications, which one judge described as "untethered to the facts." The author contrasts this judicial fortitude with what they characterize as deference from the Supreme Court's conservative majority. The piece concludes that these rulings uphold the rule of law over potential executive overreach and are a crucial defense against the normalization of using military forces in civil affairs.</p>

This comes as the government faces pressure to fulfill its pledge to lower average energy bills. Miliband reiterated that the long-term solution is transitioning to home-grown clean energy to reduce dependence on volatile fossil fuel markets. (not investment advice)</p>
