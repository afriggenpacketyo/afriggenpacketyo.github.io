          <p>President Trump's suggestion to convert Alcatraz back into a federal prison has been met with disbelief and criticism, with tourists and local officials questioning the practicality of the idea. The former prison, now a popular tourist attraction, is in a state of disrepair, lacking basic amenities and requiring extensive renovations. Critics point out the high costs associated with running a prison on an island and the vulnerability to escape attempts. The article notes that the city of San Francisco, already facing a budget deficit, relies heavily on tourism revenue from Alcatraz, making the proposal even more unpopular. </p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>A newly declassified memo confirms that U.S. intelligence agencies rejected President Trump's claim that the Venezuelan government controls the Tren de Aragua gang, which was used to justify deporting Venezuelans under the Alien Enemies Act. The memo states that while Venezuela's environment allows the gang to operate, the Maduro regime does not direct their actions or movement to the U.S. The release of the memo further undermines the Trump administration's rationale and raises questions about the criminal investigation opened against media outlets that reported on the intelligence findings. The administration defends the policy, stating that it works to deport violent criminals to keep America safe.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Texas Governor Greg Abbott signed a $1 billion school choice bill into law, allowing taxpayer money to be used to help qualifying students pay for private school tuition. The bill provides $10,000 per year for most students attending accredited private schools, up to $30,000 for students with disabilities, and $2,000 a year for home-schooled students. Democrats argue that the legislation hurts public schools by siphoning funds to benefit wealthier students already in private schools. The bill's passage marks a significant victory for school choice advocates and a historic shift in Texas education policy.</p>

          <p>A federal judge has ordered the North Carolina Board of Elections to certify the results of a contested State Supreme Court race, rejecting efforts from the Republican challenger to throw out thousands of votes.
