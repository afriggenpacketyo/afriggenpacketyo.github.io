        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Recent reforms to a UK civil service summer internship program, now restricted to applicants from lower socio-economic backgrounds, have caused division among students. The changes are intended to make the civil service more representative of society, with some students praising the new opportunity it provides. However, others from modest but not technically "working-class" backgrounds feel unfairly excluded, arguing the criteria are too rigid and could discourage them from public service careers.</p>

          <p>A consumer trend dubbed "treatonomics" is on the rise, where people spend on small, affordable luxuries and memorable experiences to boost their morale during uncertain economic times. This behavior, an evolution of the "lipstick effect," involves consumers cutting back on daily essentials while splurging on items like concert tickets, high-end cosmetics, or collectibles. Economists note this trend reflects a shift in values, as people seek moments of guilt-free joy and self-expression when traditional milestones like homeownership feel unattainable.
