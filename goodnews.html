          <p>Independent MP Rupert Lowe has publicly apologized after misidentifying a team of charity rowers off the coast of Norfolk as "illegal migrants" in a social media post. After alerting authorities, it was revealed the crew was rowing from Land's End to John O'Groats to raise money for Motor Neurone Disease research. The rowers, which included a former Royal Marine, found the situation amusing. In response to the mix-up, Lowe pledged to donate £1,000 to their cause, while still maintaining his stance on deporting illegal immigrants.</p>

          <p>Hundreds of Buddhist monks, joined by nuns and laypeople, gathered in Phnom Penh, Cambodia, to pray for peace and honor soldiers killed in recent border clashes with Thailand. The ceremony was organized to show support for a ceasefire that ended five days of fighting and to appeal for peaceful coexistence between the neighboring Buddhist nations. The conflict, which displaced over 260,000 people, was part of a decades-old territorial dispute. While a ceasefire is in effect, tensions remain as the underlying issues are unresolved and captured soldiers have not yet been released.</p>

          <p>French firefighters have successfully brought a giant wildfire in the southern Aude region under control after it burned for several days. The blaze, the largest in the area in decades, consumed over 17,000 hectares (42,000 acres), resulting in one death, 13 injuries, and the destruction of dozens of homes. While the fire is contained, approximately 2,000 firefighters remain on site to manage hotspots, and the area will not be declared fully extinguished for several more days. The region is bracing for another heatwave, prompting the national railway to cancel some train services as a precaution.</p>

          <h2>Experts Discuss Smartphone Addiction and the Rise of 'Dumbphones'</h2>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Cultural critics and producers discuss the pervasive issue of smartphone addiction, noting that over half of American adults feel they spend too much time on their devices. Studies show that a phone's mere presence can diminish cognitive capacity, even when it is silent and face down. In response, some people, particularly young adults, are turning to simpler "dumbphones" or older models like BlackBerrys to escape addictive design and constant notifications. The conversation suggests that overcoming phone dependency requires more than just willpower, advocating for creating intentional time away from screens and fostering real-world connections.</p>

          <p>Scientists are studying a unique group of individuals known as "SuperAgers," who are over 80 years old but possess the memory capabilities of people decades younger. While healthy brains naturally shrink and slow with age, the brains of SuperAgers shrink at a significantly slower rate, allowing them to resist the cognitive decline often associated with aging, including Alzheimer's disease. Researchers at Northwestern University's SuperAging Program have been investigating this phenomenon for over two decades. Their work aims to uncover the secrets behind this resilience to better understand and potentially combat dementia.</p>

          <p>After a period of dormancy, the market for space company IPOs is showing signs of life, with several firms successfully going public this year.

This resurgence comes amid a fluctuating global IPO landscape influenced by geopolitical tensions and trade policies. Analysts suggest that space companies are well-positioned due to their alignment with national priorities and innovation, though they remain vulnerable to supply chain issues and intense competition.

          <p>The British government is drafting legislation to impose new restrictions on serious violent and sexual criminals upon their release from prison. The plan would confine offenders to specific, designated geographical areas, a shift from the current system of exclusion zones which only bar them from certain locations. Monitored by enhanced electronic tagging, this system aims to provide victims with greater peace of mind, allowing them to move freely without fear of encountering their attacker. However, critics raise concerns that the new policy will place additional strain on an already overburdened probation service.</p>
