          <p>New England Patriots quarterback Drake Maye praised head coach Mike Vrabel's hands-on approach after Vrabel jumped into a practice pile to break up a scuffle and emerged with a bloodied face. The incident occurred during a joint practice with the Washington Commanders. Maye stated that the coach's intensity sets the tone for the team's desired mentality, even comparing Vrabel's appearance to that of Donald Trump after a past assassination attempt. The brief melee did not result in any player ejections from the practice session.</p>

          <p>A record number of 18-year-old students in the UK are likely to be accepted into their first-choice university this year, even if they narrowly miss their required grades. The head of the admissions service, Ucas, stated that universities are keen to enroll UK undergraduates to ensure financial stability amidst uncertainty over international student numbers. This increased flexibility is seen as a positive development for domestic applicants. The trend comes as tuition fees for students in England and Wales are set to rise for the 2025-26 academic year.</p>

          <p>Dodgers star Shohei Ohtani showcased his rare two-way talent, pitching four strong innings and hitting his 39th home run of the season in a game against the St. Louis Cardinals. Despite his excellent performance, the team's bullpen could not secure the win, giving up four runs in a 5-3 loss. The article notes the challenge of maintaining elite performance in both hitting and pitching, a feat not consistently achieved since Babe Ruth. Ohtani's offensive numbers have seen a dip since he began pitching for the Dodgers this season.</p>

          <h2>Bank of England Widely Expected to Announce Interest Rate Cut</h2>
          <div class="timestamp">2025-08-06 19:02:10 EDT</div>
        </div>
        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>The Bank of England is anticipated to cut its main interest rate from 4.25% to 4%, marking the fifth reduction since last August and bringing borrowing costs to a two-year low. This move would provide relief for some mortgage holders but would result in lower returns for savers. The expected cut comes despite UK inflation remaining above the Bank's 2% target, but signs of a cooling labor market may be influencing the decision. The Bank will also release new economic forecasts, which could highlight challenges for the UK economy. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>New archaeological research indicates that people returned to live in Pompeii after the ancient Roman city was destroyed by the eruption of Mount Vesuvius in AD 79. Evidence suggests that survivors, possibly joined by others seeking shelter, established a precarious settlement among the ruins that lasted until the 5th century. These inhabitants likely lived in the upper floors of buried buildings, using the lower levels as cellars and scavenging for valuable materials. This discovery challenges the long-held belief that the site was completely abandoned after the cataclysmic event.</p>

It explains that while these accounts currently offer high rates, often above 4%, their variable nature makes precise long-term calculation impossible. Assuming a constant rate of 4.35%, a $20,000 deposit could earn approximately $214 in three months and nearly $900 in one year. The article advises that savers who want to capitalize on the current high-rate environment should consider opening an account soon. (not investment advice)</p>
