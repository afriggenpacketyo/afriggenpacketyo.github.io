        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Taiwan has added China's Huawei and SMIC to its trade blacklist, further aligning its policies with U.S. trade restrictions amidst growing tensions with Beijing. The two Chinese chip firms are now on Taiwan's "Strategic High-Tech Commodities Entity List," requiring domestic firms to obtain licenses before shipping products to them. Taiwan's International Trade Administration cited national security concerns and involvement in arms proliferation activities as the reason for the blacklisting. This move reinforces existing U.S. export restrictions and aims to tighten loopholes, potentially increasing penalties for breaches in the future. Companies like TSMC already adhere to U.S. export controls, but this action solidifies Taiwan's commitment to restricting technology transfers to these Chinese entities. </p>

          <p>Premier Li Qiang has signaled further support for China's property sector, reflecting Beijing's concerns about its impact on overall economic growth and domestic demand. A State Council meeting emphasized the need to optimize existing policies and enhance systematic synergy to stabilize expectations, stimulate demand, and mitigate risks. Specific measures include a thorough stocktake of ongoing projects and land supplies, with urban-renewal projects receiving more land and financing aid. The ultimate goal is to halt the decline and stabilize the sector, which has been a drag on the economy. This intervention comes as China grapples with external turmoil and seeks to bolster domestic sentiment. </p>

          <p>Los Angeles Dodgers star Shohei Ohtani will make his return to the mound as a pitcher against the San Diego Padres, marking his first MLB pitching appearance since August 2023. Ohtani underwent right elbow surgery following his last pitching outing, keeping him off the mound until now. The Dodgers announced the news on their X account, moving up his expected return date due to injuries within the team's bullpen. Ohtani recently had a successful live batting practice, striking out six in three simulated innings, and he also performed well as a batter in a recent game. </p>

          <p>Protesters in Barcelona and Mallorca used water pistols against tourists as part of coordinated demonstrations against overtourism, which they believe is fueling a housing crisis and eroding the character of their cities. Demonstrators rallied in several Spanish cities, as well as in Venice and Lisbon, demanding a reevaluation of the current economic model. Residents claim that tourism has led to increased rents, the displacement of traditional stores, and a decline in their quality of life. Some tourists targeted by the water blasts laughed it off, while others expressed understanding of the protesters' concerns. </p>

          <p>Japan is shifting from a reactive to a preemptive cyber defense posture, urging private firms to take proactive steps to protect key systems and sensitive data. New legislation allows the government to track online communications and take early action to shut down harmful servers. With most of Japan's infrastructure run by private firms, the government stresses that private-sector cooperation is vital.

          <p>China's retail sales in May grew at their fastest pace since December 2023, boosted by government subsidies, but analysts are calling for stronger policy support to sustain the recovery. Retail sales jumped 6.4% year-on-year, beating estimates, while industrial output slowed to 5.8%. The improvement in consumption is attributed to the ongoing consumer goods trade-in program, online shopping, and a rise in foreign tourists. However, challenges remain, including heightened uncertainty in trade policies and a slump in the real estate market. </p>
