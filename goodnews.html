Delegations from Haiti and St. Lucia, both Caribbean nations that recognize Taiwan, attended the China-Community of Latin American and Caribbean States (Celac) Forum in Beijing. This highlights China's strategy of not necessarily requiring countries to sever ties with Taiwan to engage in cooperation with Beijing.

          <p>This article from DW examines the upcoming presidential election in Poland and its potential impact on the pro-European, center-left government led by Donald Tusk. The election pits left-wing liberal Rafal Trzaskowski, backed by Tusk, against national-conservative Karol Nawrocki, supported by the opposition Law and Justice (PiS) party. The outcome will determine whether Tusk can advance his reform plans, which have been hindered by the current president's vetoes and referrals to the constitutional court. The article also discusses the positions of other candidates and the potential for a runoff election.</p>

          <p>A rare dust storm swept through Chicago, causing visibility to drop to zero in some areas and prompting the National Weather Service to issue its second-ever dust storm warning for the region.

Residents described the experience as surreal, with dirt filling the air and coating surfaces. The skies cleared within 30 to 45 minutes after the storm passed, highlighting the event's brief but intense impact.</p>
