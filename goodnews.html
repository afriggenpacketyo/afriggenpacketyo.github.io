          <p>MicroStrategy's bitcoin treasury strategy, which propelled its market cap beyond $80 billion, is inspiring other companies, including meme stock firms and media conglomerates, to adopt similar approaches. Trump Media and GameStop have announced plans to allocate significant portions of their assets to bitcoin. Michael Saylor, Chairman of MicroStrategy, believes this trend signifies a global shift in corporate finance, driven by the increasing popularity of bitcoin as a long-term store of value. The Trump administration has also taken steps to treat bitcoin as a strategic asset, establishing a U.S. Strategic Bitcoin Reserve funded through seized assets and Vice President JD Vance has voiced his support for crypto as a hedge against inflation.

          <p>Afghanistan and Pakistan have decided to appoint ambassadors in each other's capitals, signaling a thaw in their strained relationship. This decision follows a trilateral meeting in Beijing where the foreign ministers of Afghanistan, Pakistan, and China discussed improving bilateral ties. Relations between the two countries have been tense due to accusations of harboring the Pakistani Taliban and Pakistan's deportation of Afghan refugees. The move is expected to pave the way for enhanced cooperation in multiple domains, with China expressing willingness to assist in improving Afghanistan-Pakistan relations.</p>

Separately, President Trump lauded Nippon Steel as a "great partner" for U.S. Steel, offering support for the Japanese company's $14 billion investment into the American producer, and Japan and the U.S. are reportedly making progress towards a potential tariff deal as early as June.</p>

          <p>A rare, gold-colored lobster was saved from being cooked at a restaurant in Charlestown, Rhode Island, after a cook noticed its unusual coloring. The lobster, named Calvin, has a genetic mutation that occurs in only about one in 30 million lobsters, resulting in a yellowish-orange shell. The restaurant donated Calvin to the Biomes Marine Biology Center in North Kingstown, where it is now on display. Despite the rarity of gold lobsters, the center director noted that he has encountered about 10 in his career, underscoring the vast number of lobsters caught.</p>

          <p>The debate over women serving in combat roles continues, with Defense Secretary Pete Hegseth advocating for gender-neutral fitness standards for all combat jobs. This shift follows the 2015 decision to open all combat jobs to women, leading to the development of specific fitness standards for roles like infantry. Emelie Vanasse, one of the first women to serve as an Army infantry officer, discusses her experience at Ranger School, emphasizing that she met the same standards as the men. She argues that lethality in combat extends beyond physical fitness, encompassing tactical skills, decision-making, and leadership.</p>
