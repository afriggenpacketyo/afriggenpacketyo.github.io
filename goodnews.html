The company reported adjusted earnings of $1.99 per share on revenue of $22.39 billion, showing a 3% increase in net sales compared to the previous year. Despite the positive results, P&G issued a warning about the potential impact of higher costs stemming from tariffs, signaling future financial headwinds for the corporation.

          <p>Scientists have confirmed the discovery of the Jinlin crater in China's Guangdong province, marking the fifth confirmed impact crater in the country and the first in its southern region. Research published in the journal *Matter and Radiation at Extremes* suggests the crater was formed by an asteroid impact approximately 10,000 years ago. The energy released from this event is estimated to be equivalent to 600,000 tons of TNT, which is comparable to the blast from about 40 atomic bombs.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Philip Pullman's latest book series, "The Book of Dust," serves as a companion to his controversial "His Dark Materials" trilogy and delves into the concept of dangerous ideas. The new narrative centers on books that promote a form of moral relativism, causing the protagonist Lyra to become estranged from her soul, metaphorically speaking. This theme ironically reflects the past criticisms from religious groups who claimed Pullman's own work was spiritually dangerous, creating a complex commentary on censorship, the power of literature, and the ongoing culture wars over which ideas are appropriate for children.</p>

          <p>A court in Turkey has dismissed a corruption case brought against the main opposition party, the Republican People's Party (CHP), ruling that the lawsuit lacked legal merit. The case had sought to nullify the party's 2023 congress, where a new leader was elected, by alleging procedural violations and vote-buying. The CHP has maintained that the legal action was a politically motivated attempt by President Erdoğan's government to undermine the opposition, and the dismissal is seen as a move that could ease political tensions.</p>

          <p>A dedicated team of scientists at the Fort Worth Zoo is leading a sophisticated assisted reproduction program to save the critically endangered Houston toad from extinction. By using techniques like hormone injections and carefully managed genetic pairing, they have produced millions of embryos for release into protected habitats. This conservation effort also relies on partnerships with private landowners in Texas, who receive tax incentives to restore their property into suitable environments, representing a multi-faceted approach to bringing the rare amphibian back from the brink.</p>

          <p>Zohran Mamdani's potential election as New York's first Muslim mayor is the culmination of over two decades of political organizing within the city's Muslim community following the 9/11 attacks. In response to widespread suspicion and government surveillance, young Muslim New Yorkers built local political institutions to counter Islamophobia and fight for their civil rights. Mamdani's success is an expression of this movement, which has leveraged growing voter turnout and a focus on broad-based issues like housing and transit to become a significant progressive force in city politics.</p>

          <p>Lionel Messi has just completed arguably the best individual season in Major League Soccer history, yet his presence has not translated into the massive surge in league-wide interest that many had anticipated. While his individual highlights are popular globally, MLS attendance has dipped, and viewership growth is ambiguous, failing to capture the broader American sports conversation. The narrative of the world's greatest player dominating a perceived "retirement league" lacks compelling drama, leaving his tenure as a potential footnote rather than a transformative moment for the sport in the U.S.</p>

          <p>Consumers are altering their Halloween candy purchases this year due to a dramatic spike in the price of cocoa, which has nearly doubled since last year. Record-high cocoa costs, driven by poor harvests in West Africa, have forced major brands like Hershey and Mars to raise prices and, in some cases, reduce the amount of chocolate in their products. As a result, shoppers and manufacturers are increasingly turning to more affordable non-chocolate options like gummies and other fruity treats to manage their Halloween budgets.</p>

The story focuses on a small group of nurses living in trailers to protect their families, capturing their exhaustion, isolation, and the profound emotional toll of their work. Praised as the "bard of overlooked California," Straight uses her deep connection to the region and its diverse communities to create a moving narrative about interdependence, sacrifice, and resilience.</p>
