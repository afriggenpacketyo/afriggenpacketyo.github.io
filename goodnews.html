        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>A bipartisan bill, the Dignity Act of 2025, has been introduced in the House by Reps. Maria Elvira Salazar and Veronica Escobar. The legislation would offer a seven-year renewable legal status and work authorization to immigrants who have been in the U.S. since before 2021, provided they pay restitution and have good conduct. The bill explicitly offers no path to citizenship or federal benefits and is designed to be funded by participant fees, not taxpayer money. It also aims to enhance border security, mandate E-Verify for employers, and address labor needs amid the Trump administration's deportation policies.</p>

          <p>At a summit at Carnegie Mellon University, President Trump announced that 20 leading technology and energy companies will invest over $90 billion in Pennsylvania. The initiative aims to develop a new artificial intelligence economy by building energy-intensive data centers and an energy innovation training center in the Pittsburgh region. The investments, which include plans for new nuclear reactors and support for the U.S. Steel-Nippon Steel partnership, are expected to create tens of thousands of jobs. The announcement follows a recent $20 billion investment by Amazon for data centers in the state, signaling a major push to establish Pennsylvania as a hub for AI and energy.</p>

          <p>Adelita Grijalva has won the Democratic primary for Arizona's seventh congressional district, a seat previously held by her late father, Raúl Grijalva. A Pima County supervisor, the 54-year-old Grijalva defeated 25-year-old activist and social media influencer Deja Foxx in a race that highlighted a generational divide within the party. Foxx had challenged Grijalva on her 'legacy last name,' while Grijalva emphasized her extensive experience in local politics. The district is heavily Democratic, making Grijalva the strong favorite to win the general election and succeed her father in Congress.</p>

          <p>Nvidia CEO Jensen Huang stated at an expo in Beijing that artificial intelligence and robotics will power the world's factories within the next ten years. He emphasized that AI is becoming fundamental infrastructure, revolutionizing supply chains by changing how goods are built and moved, particularly in replacing humans in repetitive or hazardous jobs. Huang, visiting China for the third time this year, also noted that Nvidia is poised to resume shipments of its made-for-China H20 chips. He applauded the progress of Chinese tech firms, highlighting how AI has empowered major platforms like WeChat, Taobao, and Douyin.</p>

          <p>President Trump is expected to sign an executive order to create national standards for the NCAA's Name, Image, and Likeness (NIL) program. This move follows the advancement of the 'SCORE Act' by a House subcommittee, which aims to supersede varied state laws governing how college athletes can be compensated. The NIL rules, enacted in 2021, have allowed student-athletes to earn millions from endorsements and other activities, significantly altering the landscape of college sports. While the initiative has bipartisan support, concerns remain that it could grant excessive power to the NCAA without sufficiently protecting the athletes' interests.</p>

          <p>President Trump announced a preliminary trade deal with Indonesia, which he stated will set a 19% tariff on Indonesian goods exported to the U.S. in exchange for American firms gaining tariff-free access to the Indonesian market. In a social media post, Trump added that the agreement includes Indonesian commitments to purchase $15 billion in U.S. energy, $4.5 billion in agricultural products, and 50 Boeing jets. The announcement follows a pattern of the administration using tariff threats to negotiate new trade terms, with similar recent deals struck with Vietnam and the UK. Indonesian officials have not yet publicly confirmed the specific terms of the deal.</p>

          <p>After a procedural vote on cryptocurrency regulation bills failed in the House, President Trump held a meeting with 11 of the 13 Republican holdouts. Following the discussion, Trump announced on social media that the members had agreed to reverse their position and would now vote to advance the legislation. The package includes the GENIUS Act for stablecoin regulation, the CLARITY Act for defining digital assets, and a bill to prevent a central bank digital currency. The initial failure was a rare temporary setback for Trump's influence, but the quick reversal highlights his strong control over the Republican conference on key policy priorities.</p>

          <p>The Pentagon has announced the release of 2,000 California National Guard members from their federal deployment in Los Angeles, a month after they were activated by President Trump. The deployment, which was made over the objections of Governor Gavin Newsom, was intended to address protests against Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE) actions. The Pentagon stated the drawdown is possible because 'lawlessness in Los Angeles is subsiding.' Governor Newsom responded by calling for the remaining 2,000 Guard members to also be returned to state control, asserting they were being used as 'political pawns' without a clear mission.</p>

          <p>The U.S. House is considering the 'Genius Act,' a bipartisan bill that aims to establish a regulatory framework for stablecoins, a type of cryptocurrency pegged to assets like the U.S. dollar. The legislation, which has already passed the Senate, would create rules and consumer protections, potentially paving the way for banks and credit unions to issue their own stablecoins. Proponents argue that regulated stablecoins could facilitate faster and cheaper financial transactions. The bill is part of a broader 'Crypto Week' push by Republican lawmakers and President Trump to foster the digital asset industry in the United States.</p>

The piece, released on the opening day of a major supply chain expo, compiles his statements on the topic since 2012. Xi spoke out against the rise of unilateralism and protectionism, explicitly rejecting 'building walls and barriers' and 'unilateral sanctions.' This declaration positions China as a champion of free trade, in stark contrast to the more protectionist policies being pursued by the United States under President Donald Trump.</p>

          <p>An article in the Communist Party's official newspaper, People's Daily, has called on China's local governments to use their legislative powers as a 'propeller' for economic and social development. The piece argues that tailored local laws create a stable and open system, allowing market entities to operate effectively within a rule-of-law framework. Since 2015, legislative authority was expanded from 49 large cities to nearly 300 cities and 30 autonomous prefectures. The article highlights this shift as a crucial tool for governance, moving from reliance on top-down directives to using localized laws to address economic challenges and adapt to development needs.</p>

          <p>A growing number of central banks are buying gold directly from local mines in their own countries rather than on the international market. According to the World Gold Council, this strategy allows them to acquire the precious metal at a discount, support local industry, and build reserves without depleting foreign currency holdings like the U.S. dollar. Countries like Ghana, Tanzania, and the Philippines are among those using this approach to bolster their reserves as gold prices reach record highs. The trend is driven by a desire to hedge against geopolitical risks and strengthen monetary buffers. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>An independent review of the NHS in England has recommended that 'physician associates' (PAs) and 'anaesthesia associates' (AAs) should be renamed 'assistants' to prevent patients from confusing them with doctors. The review, authored by Prof. Gillian Leng, also suggests standardized uniforms and badges to clearly distinguish their roles and states they should not be diagnosing patients. The recommendations follow a heated debate over the responsibilities of these roles and concerns from families of patients who died after being treated by PAs they believed were doctors.

A key part of the plan involves the complex process of moving 1,300 tropical plants, including a 250-year-old cycad that weighs over a tonne.

The ad suggested its cucumber and mint drink, which contains magnesium and other supplements, could 'help you feel calm' and reduce stress and anxiety. The watchdog found these claims were not on the official register of permitted health claims for food and drink products and were therefore in breach of advertising rules. The ASA also found a claim of '0g added sugar' to be inaccurate. Trip has been ordered not to run the ad again in its current form.</p>
