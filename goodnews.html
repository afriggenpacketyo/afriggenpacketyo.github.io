          <p>United Launch Alliance (ULA) postponed the second flight carrying Amazon's Project Kuiper internet satellites due to an issue with the Atlas V rocket's booster engine. With roughly 30 minutes left in the countdown, ULA announced it was scrubbing the launch due to an elevated purge temperature within its Atlas V rocket's booster engine. The company said it will provide a new launch date at a later point, with ULA CEO Tory Bruno stating they need to stand down to sort out the issue.</p>

          <p>Shares of Advanced Micro Devices (AMD) experienced a significant increase after analysts at Piper Sandler raised their price target, citing optimism about the chipmaker's latest product announcements. The analysts anticipate a "snapback" for AMD's graphics processing units (GPUs) in the fourth quarter, following the bulk of charges related to new U.S. license requirements for semiconductor exports to China. AMD recently unveiled its next-generation artificial intelligence chips, the Instinct MI400 series, including a full-server rack called Helios, which is expected to be crucial for AI customers. Piper Sandler raised its price target for AMD's share price from $125 to $140. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>Investing $400,000 in an immediate fixed annuity at age 65 can provide monthly income ranging from approximately $2,246 to $2,590, varying based on gender and payout option. Factors such as gender, interest rates, annuity type, and optional features influence the monthly payments, with women typically receiving lower payments due to longer life expectancy. The current higher interest rate environment makes annuity purchases more appealing, but it is essential to consider individual financial situations, liquidity needs, and retirement goals before investing. Annuities provide guaranteed income but come with trade-offs like illiquidity and potential loss of higher investment returns. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>The U.S. Army is restructuring its approach to technology acquisition and policy to expedite the adoption of new technologies and cut costs. The Army Transformation Initiative, approved by Defense Secretary Pete Hegseth, will shift defense dollars to products that can be made quickly and cheaply, reflecting the increasing importance of autonomous systems and the vulnerability of traditional weapons. The 1st Brigade of the 101st Airborne Division is serving as a "transformation in contact" brigade, equipped with AI-enabled platforms, SpaceX Starlink internet connectivity, retrofitted autonomous vehicles, and drones.
