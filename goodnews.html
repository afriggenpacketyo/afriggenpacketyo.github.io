          <p>Tesla's new car sales in Norway surged by 213% in May, contrasting with a downward trend in other European countries, primarily driven by the revamped Model Y. While Tesla's European sales have been impacted by reputational damage linked to CEO Elon Musk's rhetoric and political activities, Norway's strong EV incentives and infrastructure have supported Tesla's growth. The Norwegian EV Association suggests that Musk's political views may deter some buyers, but the Model Y's value and suitability for Norwegian needs contribute to its popularity. Norway is recognized as a leader in sustainable transportation, aiming to eliminate gasoline and diesel cars from its new car market.</p>

The winner of a record 45 elite-level championships will officially retire on June 9 following more than a year of uncertainty about the fate of the scandal-hit Miyagino stable that he oversaw as stablemaster. The stable was closed indefinitely in April 2024 after Hakuho took responsibility for one of his proteges physically abusing younger wrestlers. Having retired from competition just four years ago, the all-time great's departure feels both premature and a missed opportunity to impart his wealth of knowledge to new generations of wrestlers.</p>

Strategies for securing a good CD rate include considering online banks, which often have lower overhead costs, and opting for short-term CDs, which currently offer competitive interest rates. Laddering CDs, by buying some with one-year, two-year, and three-year terms, can help savers take advantage of high rates while saving for the long term. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>Manchester City's manager, Pep Guardiola, has identified Rayan Ait-Nouri as his top target to address the team's left-back position. The team has been without a dedicated left-back since Benjamin Mendy's departure. Guardiola is keen to resolve this issue during the summer transfer window, with Ait-Nouri being his preferred choice. No agreement is currently in place for the Algerian international, but sources express confidence that a deal will be reached. The transfer would need to be finalized before June 10 for Ait-Nouri to be eligible for the Club World Cup group stage.</p>
