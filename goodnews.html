          <p>Progressive groups are planning over 1,500 'No Kings Day' events across the United States to protest the Trump administration and counter a military parade in Washington, D.C., marking the U.S. Army's 250th birthday. Indivisible and other organizing groups initiated the protests in early May, but interest surged following President Trump's response to protests against Immigration and Customs Enforcement in Los Angeles. Organizers emphasize nonviolent assembly and de-escalation tactics. They aim to highlight that power in a democracy flows from the people, not a single leader, and the protests will occur in various locations to avoid confrontations in D.C.</p>

          <p>Electric vehicle sales in Europe are experiencing a strong rebound in 2025, with registrations climbing by 20% from January to April compared to the previous year. The recovery is attributed to corporate sales driven by EU emissions mandates and attractive leasing deals. However, consumer skepticism, charging infrastructure gaps, and competition from Chinese brands remain challenges. Tesla's sales have declined, while Chinese automakers like BYD are gaining market share. The rollback of emissions targets could slow the EV transition.</p>

          <p>David Lammy and Europe Minister Stephen Doughty met with Gibraltar's chief minister Fabian Picardo and his cabinet to discuss rules governing the border between Spain and Gibraltar. The talks aim to finalize arrangements for a lasting relationship between Gibraltar and the EU/Spain. The territory's status and its border with Spain have been a key sticking point since Brexit. Sticking points in negotiations have reportedly included the role of Spanish officials operating Schengen checks at Gibraltar airport and the territory's port.</p>

          <p>German start-up Proxima Fusion has raised 130 million euros ($148 million) in a Series A funding round, the largest private fusion investment round in Europe to date. Investors are hopeful that the company can soon develop the world's first commercial nuclear fusion power plant. Proxima Fusion's chief executive described nuclear fusion as the 'ultimate' source of clean energy. If nuclear fusion can be replicated at an industrial scale, the International Atomic Energy Agency says the technology could provide virtually limitless clean, safe and affordable energy.</p>

          <h2>Seattle Balances Tree Preservation and Housing Density</h2>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Seattle is grappling with balancing the need for more housing and preserving trees that mitigate the impacts of climate change. A new state law mandates increased housing density, but not more trees, creating a tension between development and tree preservation. One solution is building density with trees, as seen in the Bryant Heights development, which saved over 30 trees while adding 86 housing units. Seattle has also updated its tree protection ordinance to keep trees on private property from being cut down during development. The city aims to reach 30% canopy coverage by 2037.</p>

          <p>Homeowners are saving on insurance by upgrading their houses to be more resistant to disasters, such as hurricanes and wildfires. States are developing insurance discount programs, modeled after Alabama's, as a way of addressing the growing insurance crisis. Alabama's FORTIFIED Roof standard has led to over 50,000 roofs being strengthened, with homeowners qualifying for discounts of 20% to 35% off the wind portion of their insurance. California also offers discounts, but they are generally lower than those in the Gulf States. The article emphasizes the importance of retrofitting homes to withstand extreme weather and for insurance companies to account for these improvements.</p>

          <p>A demonstration in Anaheim showcased the effectiveness of wildfire defense strategies, with one home burning and another remaining unscathed. The unprotected home was built to typical standards, while the fire-protected home employed fire-mitigation techniques such as metal gutters, fiber cement siding, and a 5-foot perimeter of cement pavers and gravel. The demonstration emphasized the importance of defensible space and fire-resistant materials in protecting homes from wildfires. The Insurance Institute for Business & Home Safety recommends clearing out Zone 0, the first five feet surrounding a structure, to prevent fires from spreading.</p>
