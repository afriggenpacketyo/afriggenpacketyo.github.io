          <p>Brazilian police thwarted a planned bomb attack at a free Lady Gaga concert on Copacabana beach in Rio de Janeiro, attended by over two million people. The suspects, who identified as Lady Gaga fans, aimed to gain notoriety on social media by spreading hate speech against children, adolescents, and the LGBTQIA+ community. Authorities arrested the alleged mastermind for illegal firearm possession and detained a teenager for storing child pornography, seizing electronic devices and materials in multiple states. The concert, intended to revitalize Rio's economy, was secured by 5,000 officers, metal detectors, drones, and facial recognition cameras.</p>

          <p>Nicaragua has withdrawn from UNESCO after the UN cultural body awarded the Guillermo Cano World Press Freedom Prize to exiled Nicaraguan newspaper La Prensa. UNESCO Director General Audrey Azoulay expressed regret, stating the decision would deprive Nicaraguans of cooperation benefits, especially in education and culture. La Prensa, operating in exile due to President Daniel Ortega's crackdown, was accused by Nicaraguan authorities of promoting US interventions. This withdrawal is a setback for UNESCO, which faced similar criticism from the US under President Trump but rejoined under the Biden administration.</p>

Experts emphasize the importance of identifying funds with unique approaches and not overreacting to short-term market swings. Investors are advised to remain invested, as timing the market can negatively impact long-term portfolio returns, and advisors are allocating clients to active ETFs for income and downside protection.

          <p>Residents of a Texan town near the Mexican border, home to Elon Musk's SpaceX, voted to rename their community 'Starbase' and incorporate it as a city. The move separates the town from Cameron County, which had previously rejected plans for additional housing for SpaceX employees. With 212 residents voting in favor and only six against, the newly named Starbase covers approximately 3.75 square kilometers. The decision enables Starbase to control its building and permitting processes, collect taxes, and enact local laws, though some critics raise concerns about environmental impacts.</p>

          <p>An excerpt from Mark Whitaker's "The Afterlife of Malcolm X" examines the artistic choices made by Spike Lee and Denzel Washington in their 1992 biopic. The book delves into the creation of the opening scene in Roxbury, Boston, and the challenges of filming Malcolm's assassination. Lee's use of dialogue, music, and camera work aimed to convey Malcolm's premonition of his death, with Washington's performance capturing a sense of relief rather than fear. The film underscores Malcolm's fatalistic state of mind and the impact of his legacy.</p>

          <p>This month marks the 100th birthday of Malcolm X, the charismatic Black leader whose influence has continued to grow since his assassination in 1965. Once a spokesman for the Nation of Islam preaching racial separatism, Malcolm evolved into a human rights leader advocating for self-defense and Black pride. His famous phrase "By any means necessary" is seen as a call for self-reliance, and his piercing questions about Black identity and racial injustice still resonate today. Scholars compare him to Martin Luther King Jr., with Malcolm serving as the political sword and King as the political shield.</p>

This comparison undermines a partner's sense of worth, leading to insecurity and questioning of their ability to meet expectations. The phrase is often a symptom of deeper issues, such as fear of openly expressing needs or frustrations.
