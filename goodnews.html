          <p>Caught between the US-China trade war, Asean is strategically positioning itself by leveraging a new free-trade agreement with China and potential tariff discussions with the US. The upgraded trade agreement with China aims to deepen economic integration through digital trade, green initiatives, and supply chain connectivity, while Malaysia's Prime Minister Anwar Ibrahim seeks trade fairness for Asean's export-driven economies. Asean aims to foster a neutral, inclusive trade ecosystem that prioritizes regional resilience and strategic autonomy by capitalizing on the US-China rivalry. The bloc's ability to navigate internal divisions and external pressures will be critical in shaping trade rules and asserting its role as a key player in global trade and geopolitics.</p>

          <p>Top tennis players are increasingly voicing concerns about the unsustainable physical demands of the current tennis calendar. Australian world number nine Alex de Minaur attributed his early French Open exit to burnout, while Britain's Jack Draper raised fears about the "mental" schedule. Five-time major champion Iga Swiatek also feels the demands are "pretty exhausting," and Casper Ruud criticized the rankings "rat race." The ATP and WTA Tours have acknowledged these concerns, stating that player health and wellbeing are a priority, though solutions to alleviate the strain remain under discussion.</p>

The initiative aims to enhance convenience for inbound travelers by expediting the immigration process at Haneda, Fukuoka, Gimpo, and Gimhae airports until June 30. This marks the first instance of a Japanese airport designating a lane for a specific nation, with eligibility extended to individuals who have visited either country within the past year and have pre-registered.

          <p>Premier League clubs are navigating financial constraints imposed by Profit and Sustainability Rules (PSR) as they plan for summer transfers. PSR limits clubs to losses of ¬£105m over three years, with deductions for time spent outside the top tier, affecting their ability to spend freely. While some clubs can invest significantly, others face restrictions due to past losses and financial fair play regulations. Football finance expert Kieran Maguire analyzes each club's financial situation to assess their potential transfer spending power, highlighting the challenges of balancing ambition with financial responsibility.

          <p>A new study indicates that parents, compared to childfree individuals, experience a greater sense of meaning in life but report lower levels of life satisfaction, particularly among mothers. The findings, based on data from the European Social Survey, reveal that this discrepancy is influenced by factors such as living situation and family policies in different countries. Scandinavian countries exhibit smaller differences in life satisfaction between parents and non-parents due to robust childcare, financial support, and parental leave policies. The study emphasizes the importance of societal support and gender equality in improving parental well-being.</p>

          <p>Despite the potential impact on its medal prospects, skateboarding powerhouse Japan has welcomed the new Olympic age limit restricting competition to athletes 14 and older from the 2028 Los Angeles Games. Governing body World Skate instituted the limit, which would have ruled some of Japan's previous Olympic medal-winning skateboarders ineligible. Japan's street skateboarding head coach Daisuke Hayakawa endorsed the restriction against the backdrop of increasingly severe injuries reported among growing children as the technical difficulty of tricks rises, and Hayakawa believes the average age of the Japan national team would naturally not go any lower.</p>
