          <p>Reddit, celebrating its 20th anniversary, is facing a significant challenge from AI chatbots that scrape its vast repository of user-generated content. The company is actively defending its data, recently suing AI firm Anthropic for unfair business practices related to unauthorized data scraping. In a dual strategy, Reddit is also leveraging AI for its own "Reddit Answers" feature, which provides responses based solely on platform discussions. This approach aims to offer more authentic, human-centric information than generic AI models, preserving the value of its community conversations while adapting to the new AI-driven internet landscape.</p>

        </div>
        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>A new trade deal between the United Kingdom and the United States has officially commenced, reducing tariffs on key exports like British cars and aerospace products. In exchange, the UK has eliminated tariffs on American beef and ethanol imports, a move that has sparked concern within the UK's bioethanol industry. However, a significant point of contention remains, as UK steel and aluminum are still subject to a 25% US tariff. This rate could double to 50% if a separate agreement is not reached by the July 9 deadline, creating major uncertainty for British producers. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>Hong Kong's market for initial public offerings (IPOs) experienced a dramatic resurgence in the first half of 2025, with funds raised soaring eightfold to US$13.5 billion. This surge propelled the city's stock exchange back to the number one position globally for capital raising for the first time since 2019, surpassing both Nasdaq and the New York Stock Exchange. The revival is attributed to renewed international investor interest and strong post-listing performance, which has provided an average return of over 30% for IPO investors. This marks the best first-half performance for Hong Kong since 2021. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>This opinion article posits that the second Trump administration is implementing a clear grand strategy centered on American interests, correcting what it calls the flawed designs of previous presidents. The author argues that Trump's approach has transformed relations in the Middle East by focusing on trade and cooperation, leading to the isolation of Iran. The piece defends recent military strikes against Iranian facilities as calculated moves to support allies like Israel and demonstrate a preference for diplomacy backed by strength. It concludes that this doctrine has successfully created new opportunities for collaboration and has dispelled caricatures of the administration as being either isolationist or warmongering.</p>

          <p>A coalition of major Democratic groups, including the DNC, is launching a new initiative called "Organizing Summer" to drive voter engagement ahead of the 2026 midterm elections. The program aims to move the party's focus from Washington D.C. into the states, recruiting thousands of volunteers to connect with voters in non-political settings and provide direct feedback. This effort is seen as a response to the party's 2024 election defeats and recent internal disputes. A key focus will be to message against the Republican agenda, particularly the "One Big Beautiful Bill" currently making its way through Congress.</p>

          <p>Homicide rates are falling dramatically across the United States, with a drop of at least 14% in 2024 and further declines expected in 2025. While policing tactics play a role, crime analysts point to a primary driver: the end of the societal disruptions caused by the COVID-19 pandemic. Researchers argue the pandemic removed vital support systems by shrinking the local government workforce, which includes teachers, counselors, and community program staff. As public services and community engagement return to pre-pandemic levels, it creates more stable environments that help interrupt cycles of violence among at-risk youth.</p>

The move is intended to restart trade negotiations with the United States after President Donald Trump called off talks, describing the tax as a "blatant attack." The 3% tax would have affected giants like Amazon, Meta, and Google, with Canada's finance minister stating a preference for a multilateral agreement.

The system has been implemented by 530 local governments, a significant surge over the past three years, with nearly 10,000 couples registered. Despite this widespread adoption, Japan remains the only G7 nation that has not legalized same-sex marriage. The partnership certificates are not legally valid and do not grant couples the same rights as married heterosexuals, such as inheritance or co-parenting rights, prompting ongoing calls for full marriage equality.</p>

          <p>Final qualifying for The Open Championship features several compelling storylines, including Ryder Cup veteran Ian Poulter competing against his 21-year-old son, Luke, for a spot at Royal Portrush. They are among hundreds of professionals and amateurs battling across four UK venues for just 20 available places in golf's oldest major. Other notable players attempting to qualify include LIV Golf members Lee Westwood and Graeme McDowell, the latter of whom is desperate to play in his hometown. The high-stakes, 36-hole events highlight the raw, cut-throat nature of earning a place in the prestigious tournament.</p>
