          <p>The two-time defending champions, Oval Invincibles, solidified their top position in the men's Hundred tournament with a decisive seven-wicket win against the Southern Brave. The team's bowlers were instrumental, dismissing the Brave for 133 runs, with standout performances from Jason Behrendorff and Rashid Khan. In response, a powerful partnership between Jordan Cox (56) and Sam Curran (50 not out) guided the Invincibles to victory with 11 balls remaining. This win places them four points clear at the top of the table, strongly positioning them for the final stages of the competition.</p>

          <p>Labor Day, a federal holiday celebrating the achievements of American workers, will be observed on Monday, September 1, marking the unofficial end of summer for many. The holiday originated from the labor movement in the late 19th century to secure better working conditions and rights. While government offices, banks, and the U.S. Postal Service will be closed, most major retailers, grocery stores, and fast-food chains are expected to remain open, though some may have reduced hours. The day is now commonly associated with travel, family gatherings, and retail sales, providing a final long weekend before autumn begins.</p>

          <p>Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy's meeting with President Donald Trump concluded without the explosive conflict that marked their previous encounter, largely due to a managed and cautious approach. Trump focused more on exaggerating his own peacemaking achievements than on confronting the Ukrainian leader. The presence of several European leaders, including those from the UK, France, and Germany, appeared to serve as a moderating influence, steering the conversation toward a unified European stance. While few concrete details on a peace plan emerged, Zelenskyy successfully avoided a public diplomatic breakdown, navigating the high-stakes summit with a mix of flattery and composure.</p>

          <h2>Retail Accounting Method May Obscure True Impact of Tariffs on Profitability</h2>
          <div class="timestamp">2025-08-18 15:38:31 EDT</div>
        </div>
        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>A common accounting practice known as the retail inventory method (RIM), used by major retailers like Walmart and Target, could temporarily overstate profitability as new U.S. tariffs take effect. RIM uses an average cost-to-retail price ratio across broad categories rather than tracking the actual cost of each item, which can delay the full financial impact of rising import costs. This accounting nuance means that initial earnings reports may not fully reflect the pressure on gross margins from tariffs. While this effect normalizes over several quarters, it creates a potential disconnect between a company's operational efforts to mitigate costs and its reported financial results.

          <p>The new musical "& Juliet," now playing at the Ahmanson Theatre, offers a vibrant and empowering alternative to Shakespeare's classic tragedy. The show's premise has Juliet choosing not to die and instead embarking on a journey of self-discovery in Paris, set to a soundtrack of hit songs by producer Max Martin. With a clever book by David West Read, the production transforms the story into a high-energy dance party that celebrates female empowerment and second chances. Critics praise the show for its wit, spectacular staging, and powerful vocal performances, particularly from lead actress Rachel Webb, creating a feel-good theatrical experience.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>While there are no strict federal age limits for purchasing annuities, individual insurance companies often set their own caps, typically between 80 and 85 years old for immediate annuities. These limits are based on risk assessment, as the buyer's age and life expectancy directly impact the product's pricing and payout structure. Financial advisors often suggest that the optimal time to consider an annuity is in one's late 50s to mid-60s, balancing the potential for growth with favorable rates. However, purchasing later in life can result in higher monthly payments, making the decision dependent on individual health, financial goals, and overall retirement strategy.

The majority of cases occurred in unvaccinated individuals, particularly in Gaines County, which has low vaccination rates.

Zelenskyy humorously noted the change, engaging in light-hearted banter that contrasted with the tense atmosphere of the prior meeting.
