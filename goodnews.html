          <p>Tesla shares have rebounded after a dip caused by a feud between Elon Musk and President Trump, fueled by the unveiling of robotaxi testing in Austin, Texas. Musk shared a video showcasing Tesla's driverless vehicles operating without human supervision, signaling progress in the company's autonomous driving technology. Tesla is listed as "testing" on Austin's official autonomous vehicle website, joining other companies like Waymo and Amazon's Zoox in the city. The stock's recovery reflects investor optimism regarding Tesla's potential in the robotaxi market and a possible reconciliation between Musk and Trump. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>Former New York City Mayor Michael Bloomberg has endorsed former Governor Andrew Cuomo in the Democratic mayoral primary. Bloomberg cited Cuomo's management experience and government know-how as key factors in his decision. The endorsement comes as Cuomo seeks a political comeback after resigning from office in 2021 amid multiple scandals, including sexual harassment accusations and investigations into his handling of the COVID-19 pandemic. Bloomberg's support highlights a divide within the Democratic Party, as progressive candidate Zohran Mamdani has gained traction with an endorsement from Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez.</p>

          <p>The Nintendo Switch 2, priced at $449.99, refines the original Switch's hybrid design with improvements like a 1080p screen, magnetic Joy-Con connections, and mouse capabilities for the controllers. While it lacks a large launch lineup, the console offers enhanced versions of older games and new chat features, including an optional camera for video overlay. Battery life may be a challenge, lasting about two hours in handheld mode with demanding games. Upgrading from the original Switch is relatively easy, with data transfer handled through a Nintendo account and the promise of new games to come, making it a worthwhile investment for those seeking a fresh gaming experience.</p>

          <p>General Motors (GM) plans to invest $4 billion in three American assembly plants, including the relocation of production for the Chevrolet Blazer and Equinox from Mexico to the United States. This decision comes as trade talks between the Trump administration and Mexican leaders show little progress, with tariffs implemented on imported vehicles and auto parts. GM's investment will enable the assembly of over two million vehicles per year in the U.S., a move likely to be seen as a win for Trump's trade policies. GM CEO Mary Barra emphasized the company's commitment to American innovation and manufacturing expertise.</p>
