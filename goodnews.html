        </div>
        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>LeBron James expressed his frustration with the emphasis on championship rings in evaluating NBA players' legacies, arguing that it overshadows the accomplishments of players like Allen Iverson, Charles Barkley, and Steve Nash who never won a title. He pointed out that this level of scrutiny is not as prevalent in other sports, citing Dan Marino and Barry Bonds as examples of great athletes who are still highly regarded despite not winning championships. James emphasized that winning a ring is a team accomplishment and that individual achievements should be appreciated more. The conversation surrounding rings often impacts how James's own career is viewed. </p>

          <p>Amazon Web Services (AWS) is updating its Graviton4 chip with increased network bandwidth, positioning it as a strong competitor against traditional semiconductor players like Intel and AMD. The real competition, however, is with Nvidia in the AI infrastructure space, where AWS is investing heavily. AWS is backing startup Anthropic with $8 billion and using its Trainium2 GPUs to power Project Rainier, an AI supercomputer designed to reduce AI training costs. This move aims to provide an alternative to Nvidia's expensive graphics processing units and challenge Nvidia's dominance in the AI market. </p>

          <p>UK Prime Minister Sir Keir Starmer explained that he quickly picked up papers dropped by US President Donald Trump at the G7 Summit to prevent intervention by White House security. Starmer noted the strict rules regarding proximity to the president and feared potential reactions if someone else had tried to help. The incident occurred during a discussion about a newly signed UK-US trade deal, which Starmer highlighted as a significant relief for Jaguar Land Rover workers due to tariff removals. The deal, however, did not address steel import charges, which remain under negotiation. </p>

          <p>James Gunn, co-head of DC Studios, attributes the movie industry's struggles to unfinished screenplays, a rule he enforces at DC Studios, where he scrapped a project due to an inadequate script. He believes Marvel Studios was "killed" by Disney's demand for increased output, a mandate DC Studios does not share, allowing them to prioritize quality. Gunn addressed rumors that Matt Reeves' "The Batman" sequel is canceled, confirming it is still in development but delayed to October 2027 due to the need for a finished script. Gunn also reflected on his past scandal, stating it changed his approach to creating content. </p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Members of Parliament in England and Wales have voted to decriminalize abortion for women, marking the most significant change to abortion laws in nearly 60 years. The amendment, introduced by Labour MP Tonia Antoniazzi, passed with a majority of 242 votes, preventing women who terminate their pregnancies outside legal guidelines from facing police investigation. The law will still penalize those who assist a woman in getting an abortion outside the current legal framework. The new clause does not change any law regarding the provision of abortion services within a healthcare setting, including the time limit or the requirement for two doctors' approval. </p>

          <p>Jane Dorotik's conviction for the 2001 murder of her husband, Bob Dorotik, was overturned after she spent two decades in prison. New testing of evidence, conducted with the Loyola Project for the Innocent, revealed inconsistencies and foreign male DNA on items from the crime scene. The prosecution conceded that the new DNA evidence cast doubt on the verdict, leading to the overturning of the conviction. Though the case was initially dismissed without prejudice, meaning charges could be brought again, Dorotik is now working to rebuild her life and help other incarcerated women. </p>
