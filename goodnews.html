          <p>Japan's parliament has elected ultraconservative Sanae Takaichi as the nation's first female prime minister, ending a period of political uncertainty. Her premiership was secured after her Liberal Democratic Party (LDP) formed a new coalition with the right-wing Japan Innovation Party, shifting the governing bloc further to the right. A protégé of the late Shinzo Abe, Takaichi is expected to pursue a hawkish agenda, including strengthening the military and revising the pacifist constitution, though her government's stability remains uncertain.</p>

          <p>Arsenal midfielder Declan Rice has successfully transitioned from a traditional holding midfielder to a more dynamic box-to-box player, significantly boosting his attacking contributions. The summer signing of deep-lying midfielder Martin Zubimendi has further enabled this evolution, allowing Rice to leverage his running power to join attacks while still starting from a deeper position. This tactical shift has made him a leader in key offensive metrics for the team and has been praised by observers as making him a "complete midfielder."</p>

          <p>Three-time Olympic medallist Matt Richardson has praised the "magic" of the British Cycling program after his high-profile switch of allegiance from Australia to Great Britain. The 26-year-old sprinter, who was born in the UK, described the British program as being on another level, comparing it to "Hogwarts." Since the move, Richardson has already set a new world record in the flying 200m and is now preparing for the World Championships, aiming to finally defeat his main rival, Dutch champion Harrie Lavreysen.</p>

This shift is partly driven by Chinese-led infrastructure projects abroad, which encourage the use of the yuan and support Beijing's efforts to internationalize its currency.

The theory is now attracting academic debate, with scholars suggesting it helps explain contemporary geopolitical tensions and fosters intellectual discussion about China's global position.</p>
