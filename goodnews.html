          <p>U.S. President Donald Trump announced an agreement between Israel and Hamas on the first phase of a peace plan for Gaza, confirmed by Israeli officials, Hamas, and mediator Qatar. This preliminary deal aims to end the two-year conflict, facilitate the release of approximately 20 Israeli hostages in exchange for nearly 2,000 Palestinian prisoners, and allow aid into the region. While the agreement signifies a diplomatic breakthrough, contentious issues like demilitarization and Gaza's future governance remain unresolved. The initial steps include an Israeli troop withdrawal to an agreed line and the start of hostage releases.</p>

          <p>SoftBank's shares surged by 13% after announcing a $5.4 billion deal to acquire the robotics division of Swiss engineering firm ABB, further expanding its footprint in Artificial Intelligence. This strategic acquisition aligns with SoftBank founder Masayoshi Son's vision for "Physical AI," aiming to integrate Artificial Super Intelligence with robotics. The deal means ABB will no longer pursue a spin-off of its robotics business. This news, alongside other market activities like HSBC's bid for Hang Seng Bank and Graphcore's investment in India, contributed to a dynamic day in Asian markets, with Japan's Nikkei 225 and Australia's ASX/S&P 200 seeing gains.

          <p>Hang Seng Bank shares surged by nearly 30% following parent company HSBC's proposal to take the Hong Kong-based lender private in a deal valuing it at over $37 billion. HSBC, which currently owns about 63% of Hang Seng Bank, aims to acquire the remaining shares at HK$155 apiece, a 33% premium over recent trading averages. HSBC Group Chief Executive Georges Elhedery stated the move is an opportunity to grow both banks while preserving Hang Seng's brand and investing in its services. This privatization bid underscores HSBC's confidence in Hong Kong's financial center role, despite Hang Seng Bank's recent uptick in bad loans tied to the region's real estate sector.

Leveraging existing and future infrastructure investments, an Olympic bid would not only showcase the region's advancements but also reshape inter-city engagement.

          <p>President Trump's 20-point plan, backed by Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu, aims to end the Israel-Hamas war, outlining an immediate ceasefire, hostage-prisoner exchange, and phased Israeli troop withdrawal. The proposal details the demilitarization of Gaza under independent monitors and the establishment of a "technocratic, apolitical Palestinian committee" for governance, overseen by a "Board of Peace" chaired by Trump. It also calls for substantial aid, economic development, and an "International Stabilization Force" for security. While it acknowledges Palestinian statehood as an aspiration, it does not provide a clear roadmap, and Hamas's full response remains pending.</p>

Justices questioned the standing of a winning candidate to sue and the broad implications of allowing any candidate to challenge election rules.

While the county denied her claims, attributing her dismissal to performance, Lesley feels vindicated and hopes the settlement sends a message about the strength of the First Amendment and anti-discrimination values.

          <p>President Donald Trump is slated for a "routine yearly checkup" at Walter Reed national military medical center, his second since April. The White House press secretary stated he would also meet and speak with troops during his visit. This checkup follows a previous comprehensive exam in April that included cognitive and cardiology tests, with his physician declaring him "fully fit" despite a diagnosis of chronic venous insufficiency. Recent public speculation about a bruise on his hand was attributed to frequent handshaking and aspirin use. The president's health has been a subject of public interest, particularly given his age.</p>
