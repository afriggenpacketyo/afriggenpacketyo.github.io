          <h2>US and China Reportedly Reach Trade Truce After Geneva Talks</h2>
          <div class="timestamp">2025-05-11 13:04:32 EDT</div>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Treasury Secretary Scott Bessent announced that the United States and China have made significant progress in trade talks held in Geneva, with details to be released soon. The potential trade truce aims to ease concerns about a sharp downturn in the global economy, which has been rocked by tariffs imposed by both nations. While specifics of the agreement are unclear, U.S. Trade Representative Jamieson Greer suggested that the deal addresses national security concerns related to China's trade practices, but did not confirm whether tariffs would be reduced. The article highlights the disruptive impact of the tariffs on global supply chains, with American companies facing bankruptcy and Chinese factories seeking alternative export routes, and warns of potential economic consequences such as slowed global growth and inflation.</p>

          <p>In an excerpt from his new memoir, "Who Knew", TV, film, and media executive Barry Diller discusses the importance of instinct over data in making creative and business decisions. Diller argues that relying solely on data can be harmful and that structured information can narrow one's perspective. He highlights examples from his career, such as the making of the TV movie "Brian's Song" and "The Night Stalker", where trusting his gut led to significant success. Diller emphasizes that too much information can obscure the essence of a good idea and that common sense is crucial.</p>
