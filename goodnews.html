          <p>Frederick M. Nicholas, a decorated WWII veteran, attorney, and real estate developer who was a pivotal figure in shaping Los Angeles's cultural landscape, has died at the age of 105. Known as "Mr. Downtown Culture," he was instrumental in the development of major institutions like the Museum of Contemporary Art (MOCA) and the Walt Disney Concert Hall. Beyond the arts, Nicholas founded Public Counsel in 1970, which grew to become the nation's largest pro bono law firm, providing legal aid to vulnerable populations. His immense contributions to both the arts and public service have left a lasting legacy on the city of Los Angeles.</p>

          <p>A federal judge in Brooklyn has temporarily blocked the Trump administration from ending Temporary Protected Status (TPS) for approximately 521,000 Haitian immigrants before its scheduled expiration. The Department of Homeland Security, under Secretary Kristi Noem, had moved to terminate the program on September 2, but the judge ruled this action was unlawful as it did not follow the congressionally mandated process. The court found that the interests of the Haitian TPS holders, who can legally live and work in the U.S., far outweigh potential harm to the government. This ruling provides a temporary reprieve for Haitians amid ongoing gang violence and instability in their home country.</p>

          <p>U.S. soccer star Christian Pulisic, after facing criticism for skipping this summer's Gold Cup, appeared at an event in Culver City to open a new youth soccer facility. Pulisic stated he needed a mental and physical break after a grueling season, a decision that drew censure from former national team players but which he defended as necessary ahead of next year's World Cup. Interacting with young players, he emphasized the joy of the game and the importance of inspiring the next generation. The event, part of a partnership with Puma, provided a refurbished space for a non-profit club dedicated to making soccer more accessible for children.</p>

          <p>A new medical device, a magnetic extractor, is having a life-saving impact on the front lines in Ukraine by enabling surgeons to safely and quickly remove shrapnel from complex wounds. With shrapnel injuries now accounting for up to 80% of battlefield trauma, these tools allow for minimally invasive procedures, even on delicate organs like the heart. Developed by a volunteer-led initiative, the modernized magnets are more precise and powerful than historical counterparts, reducing surgery time and risk. Over 3,000 units have been distributed to hospitals and field medics, representing a significant advancement in warzone medical care born from necessity.</p>

          <p>CNBC's Jim Cramer has identified Microsoft, Nvidia, and Meta as the standout performers among the "Magnificent Seven" tech stocks, as all three reached all-time highs to close out the first half of the year. Cramer attributed Microsoft's success to its strong Azure cloud growth and Nvidia's rally to its unrivaled dominance in AI chips and persistent demand. He suggested Meta's impressive run was fueled by its powerful advertising business, which blew past earnings estimates. Cramer dubbed the trio the "M-N-Ms," suggesting they are the most resilient names in a challenging market. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>Despite navigating turbulent U.S. trade policies, China's economy demonstrated considerable resilience and steady growth through the first half of 2025, likely keeping it on track to meet its 5% annual GDP growth target. However, economists warn of significant challenges ahead for the remainder of the year. While diversified trade partnerships have helped offset declining shipments to the U.S., analysts forecast that export growth will slow or even contract in the second half. This is attributed to the front-loading of orders and a projected slowdown in U.S. consumer spending. (not investment advice)</p>

The Bank's chief cashier emphasized that banknotes are a symbolic representation of national identity and that she is keen to hear the public's ideas.

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>California has passed the most significant reforms to the California Environmental Quality Act (CEQA) in decades, a move aimed at spurring housing development. Pushed through by Governor Gavin Newsom as part of the state budget, the new legislation waives CEQA's extensive environmental review process for most low- and mid-rise housing projects in urban areas. This eliminates a tool that project opponents, including neighborhood groups and labor unions, have long used to delay or block construction through lengthy studies and lawsuits. The change signals a major political shift, prioritizing housing abundance over the procedural hurdles that have stifled building in the state.</p>
