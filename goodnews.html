          <h2>Ancient Native American Agricultural Site Discovered in Michigan</h2>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Archaeologists have uncovered what is believed to be the largest intact remains of an ancient Native American agricultural site in the eastern United States, located in northern Michigan. Using drone technology, researchers mapped parallel rows of earthen mounds across 300 acres, revealing raised gardening beds used by ancestors of the Menominee Indian Tribe of Wisconsin to grow crops like corn, beans, and squash. The scale of the agriculture is surprising given the relatively poor growing conditions and the proximity of wild rice, raising questions about the community's motivations. The discovery highlights the extent of indigenous agriculture prior to European colonization and the sophisticated farming practices employed by Native American societies.</p>

          <p>Former England football captain David Beckham is reportedly set to be awarded a knighthood in King Charles' Birthday Honours list. Beckham, who was previously appointed an officer of the Order of the British Empire (OBE) in 2003, is expected to receive further recognition for his football career and contributions to British society. He played 115 times for his country and has been an ambassador for Unicef and the King's Foundation. Beckham was reportedly first nominated for a knighthood in 2011, but leaked emails in 2017 revealed his criticism of the honors system.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>A team of scientists has discovered evidence of the world's earliest known matrilineal society in what is now Shandong, eastern China, dating back around 4,500 years. The community, which farmed millet and raised animals, maintained a stable lineage through the female line for at least 10 generations over 250 years. Researchers analyzed ancient DNA from 60 individuals to confirm the existence of this Neolithic society that traced descent through the maternal line. The findings support the hypothesis that early matrilineal systems could emerge and persist in communities without strong mechanisms for wealth accumulation, shedding light on early human social structures.</p>

          <p>With the United States set to host the 2026 FIFA World Cup and the 2028 Olympic Games, questions arise about the potential impact of President Donald Trump's new travel ban. The policy places restrictions on citizens of 12 countries and partial constraints on seven others. However, the order contains an exemption that could apply to participants in the upcoming sporting events. Organizers of the Los Angeles 2028 Olympics express confidence that the ban will not disrupt the Games or preparations, citing recognition from the federal government that the Olympics require special consideration.</p>

          <p>Tesla shares rebounded in premarket trading after a day of significant losses triggered by escalating tensions between CEO Elon Musk and President Donald Trump. The feud, stemming from Musk's criticism of Trump's economic policies, led to a $152 billion drop in Tesla's market capitalization. Trump's initial praise for Musk's role in the Department of Government Efficiency (DOGE) shifted after Musk's disapproval of Trump's "big, beautiful bill." The stock's recovery suggests investor confidence remains despite the public spat, but the incident highlights the potential impact of political tensions on market sentiment.

The plan focuses on addressing aging infrastructure and specifies 326 measures to be taken by government bodies from fiscal 2026 through 2030. The plan was created in light of prolonged water outages following the Noto Peninsula earthquake and a sinkhole in Saitama Prefecture. The funds will be allocated for maintenance of vital services, disaster prevention infrastructure, and enhancing disaster preparedness, including installing air conditioners at schools used as evacuation centers.</p>
