          <p>The Powerball jackpot has escalated to an estimated $1.3 billion for Wednesday night's drawing, following no winners in Monday's $1.2 billion prize. This monumental sum now ranks as the fifth-largest Powerball jackpot ever, offering a cash value of roughly $589 million before taxes. Wednesday's event marks the 41st drawing without a grand prize winner since May 2025, highlighting the formidable odds of 1-in-292.2 million. Prospective winners face a choice between a single lump-sum payment or an annuity spread over 29 increasing annual installments, fueling anticipation across participating states and jurisdictions.</p>

          <p>The Shanghai Cooperation Organization (SCO) summit in Tianjin concluded with strong signals of member states' desire for closer ties, amidst global turbulence caused by U.S. trade policies. Chinese President Xi Jinping used the platform to advocate for a more "just and balanced international governance framework," implicitly criticizing U.S. actions. Key outcomes included a thawing of India-China relations, a symbolic Xi-Putin-Modi troika, commitments to AI cooperation, and discussions about a new SCO development bank to reduce reliance on the U.S. dollar. These developments underscore Beijing's ambition to position itself as an architect of a China-led global framework.</p>

          <p>Chinese shipping companies are strategically forming alliances with global partners and exploring new regional markets to mitigate the impact of impending steep U.S. port fees, set to take effect in October. Shipping giants like Cosco Shipping Holdings are actively expanding services in emerging and intra-Asia markets, reporting significant year-on-year growth in these areas. While direct references to the U.S. port fees are sometimes implicit, their interim reports clearly indicate a forward-looking response to market changes. This proactive approach aims to reduce U.S. exposure and capitalize on diverse international opportunities in a rapidly evolving global shipping landscape. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>While pickleball continues its surge in the U.S., the sport is just beginning to take off in China, with online sales of equipment skyrocketing more than six-fold this year to $1.2 million monthly. This growth is attributed to social media influencers and a resurgence of tennis, notably after a Chinese player won an Olympic gold medal. The sport's accessibility is a key appeal, leading to a rapid increase in pickleball courts, often built by for-profit businesses. This consumer spending trend provides a positive counterpoint to otherwise subdued retail sales in China, signaling a broader shift towards active lifestyles.</p>

          <p>Utah is grappling with a severe housing affordability crisis, prompting Governor Spencer Cox to set an ambitious goal of building 35,000 lower-cost starter homes within five years. The median age of first-time U.S. homebuyers has reached a record 38, highlighting the challenge. Despite state incentives like low-interest construction loans, builders have been slow to meet targets, partly due to resistance to zoning changes that would allow smaller lot sizes. However, some developers, like Nilson Homes, are finding success by partnering with counties to build aesthetically pleasing, affordable homes, offering a glimmer of hope for young families to achieve homeownership.</p>

          <p>Democratic Rep. Jerry Nadler, the longest-serving New Yorker in the House, has announced his retirement from Congress in 2026, emphasizing the "necessity for generational change" within the party. His decision was notably influenced by former President Joe Biden's withdrawal from the 2024 election, as Nadler believes a younger successor could be more effective in confronting challenges such as "Trump and his incipient fascism." A prominent figure, Nadler, 78, chaired the House Judiciary Committee and served as a manager for Trump's first impeachment, consistently advocating for civil rights and democratic principles. House Minority Leader Hakeem Jeffries praised Nadler as a "relentless fighter for justice," acknowledging his substantial and impactful legislative career.</p>

          <p>A Chinese research team from the China Astronaut Research and Training Centre has engineered an innovative, compact washing machine tailored for astronauts, addressing the persistent challenge of laundry in space. This detergent-free device utilizes only 400ml of water per cycle, dispensed as an ultra-fine mist through ultrasonic atomization, and employs ultraviolet light to produce ozone for sterilizing clothes. Weighing a mere 12kg and comparable in size to a carry-on suitcase, this groundbreaking technology offers a highly practical solution for cleaning up to 800 grams of clothing, significantly conserving water—a critically limited resource during space missions.</p>

          <p>Marie Tidball, a Labour MP with a congenital disability, has publicly highlighted significant accessibility challenges within the Houses of Parliament, including issues with heavy doors, inaccessible handles, and distant accessible toilets. Despite the Equalities Act being passed in these very buildings 15 years ago, she argues that the historic Palace of Westminster remains largely inaccessible to many, including MPs. Tidball is advocating for comprehensive modernization, emphasizing the need for Parliament to reflect the 22% of the voting-age population who are disabled. While some minor changes are underway, a full report with larger reforms is anticipated later this year.</p>
