        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Coastal rail service connecting Orange and San Diego counties is set to resume on June 7 after nearly six weeks of repairs to reinforce tracks vulnerable to landslides and coastal erosion. The California Coastal Commission approved emergency construction, involving the placement of 5,900 tons of boulders and 240,000 cubic yards of sand to stabilize the rail line. The Orange County Transportation Authority (OCTA) is also constructing a 1,400-foot-long catchment beside the rail, with the total project cost estimated at $300 million. The OCTA acknowledged the recurring interruptions to passenger rail service due to eroding bluffs in San Clemente.</p>

          <p>Cambridge Associates suggests global investors are re-evaluating their portfolios, shifting focus from US-heavy investments to undervalued equities in Hong Kong and mainland China. Despite aggressive Trump tariffs, Asian equities have outperformed, with Chinese and Hong Kong stocks offering attractive valuations compared to expensive US stocks. The firm noted that monetary easing and signs of policy coordination between Beijing and Washington support this diversification. This sentiment follows an agreement to reduce most tariffs, easing geopolitical risks and potentially attracting more foreign investment.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>The SEC has formally dropped its lawsuit against Binance and founder Changpeng Zhao, ending one of the last remaining crypto enforcement actions brought by the agency. The original complaint accused the crypto exchange of violations including illegally serving U.S. users, inflating trading volumes, and commingling customer funds. The dismissal marks a symbolic end to one of the most aggressive crypto crackdowns in U.S. history, and comes as the Trump administration makes a concerted effort to prove that it's an ally to the industry. Binance is the largest digital assets exchange in the world by volume.</p>
