          <p>Xabi Alonso, currently managing Bayer Leverkusen, is rumored to be returning to Real Madrid as a replacement for Carlo Ancelotti. Alonso's successful tenure at Leverkusen, including an undefeated Bundesliga title win, has made him a top candidate. His departure could influence key players like Florian Wirtz to also leave Leverkusen. Potential replacements for Alonso at Leverkusen include Erik ten Hag, Imanol Alguacil, Xavi Hernandez, and Cesc Fabregas, with the club possibly favoring another Spanish coach due to the success of Alonso and the Spanish managing director.</p>

        </div>
        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Chevron's stock experienced a downturn following a report of declining profits, primarily due to the sharp decrease in oil prices this year, exacerbated by President Trump's tariffs impacting demand and OPEC+'s plans to increase supply. The company plans to reduce its stock buybacks in the second quarter to between $2.5 billion and $3 billion, down from $3.9 billion in the first quarter, though overall repurchase guidance for the year remains unchanged. Chevron's net income fell by more than 30% to $3.5 billion, aligning with Wall Street estimates when excluding one-time items.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Temu is transitioning to a "local fulfillment model" in the U.S., ending direct shipments from China due to the closure of the "de minimis" duty-free rule for low-value packages. This rule, which allowed retailers to ship packages under $800 without duties or taxes, is being eliminated due to concerns about damage to American businesses and the smuggling of illegal goods. Temu claims its pricing for US consumers will remain unchanged as it recruits US-based sellers. The change is expected to impact other Chinese retailers like Shein, who have already seen operating expenses rise due to global trade rule changes.</p>

          <p>Prime Minister Ishiba stated that Japan will prioritize its national interests during ongoing tariff negotiations with the United States, despite aiming for a mutually beneficial agreement as early as June. While acknowledging "very positive and constructive" talks, Ishiba noted existing gaps between the two nations, emphasizing the need for maximum effort from both sides to reach a deal. Japan seeks to avoid undermining its interests in favor of speed, with currency not being a topic of discussion during the negotiations. Finance Minister Kato suggested using Japan's holdings of U.S. Treasuries as a bargaining chip.</p>
