          <h2>Bitcoin Reaches Record High Amid Anticipated US Regulatory Changes</h2>

          <p>Bitcoin recently achieved an unprecedented valuation, surpassing $120,000, fueled by substantial inflows into exchange-traded funds and the ongoing "Crypto Week" in the U.S. Congress. Lawmakers are actively considering new legislation, such as the Genius Act, to establish a clearer regulatory framework for the digital asset industry, a move widely supported by industry players and President Trump. This legislative momentum is seen as a key factor in boosting investor confidence and attracting further institutional capital into the cryptocurrency market. Experts anticipate continued growth, with some projecting Bitcoin could reach $140,000-$160,000 by year-end, though Federal Reserve policies remain a risk. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>A new brand named Jams, founded by 26-year-old Connor Blakley, is challenging Smucker's Uncrustables in the frozen peanut butter and jelly sandwich market. Backed by prominent athletes like Alex Morgan and C.J. Stroud, Jams emphasizes health-conscious ingredients, boasting no seed oils, artificial flavors, or high-fructose corn syrup, and offering more protein per ounce. The product, slightly larger and pricier than Uncrustables, aims to appeal to athletes and consumers seeking healthier, convenient snack options. Despite Smucker's dominance and plans for over a billion dollars in Uncrustables sales by 2026, Jams hopes to carve out its niche through a focus on nutritional value and athlete endorsement.</p>

          <h2>Florida Ranks First Nationally in Religious Liberty Protections</h2>
          <div class="timestamp">2025-07-14 15:54:57 EDT</div>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Florida has achieved the top ranking nationwide in religious liberty protection, as reported by the First Liberty Institute's annual Religious Liberty in the States (RLS) index. This significant improvement is credited to key legislation, including a 2023 law strengthening religious protections for healthcare providers to refuse participation in certain procedures, and a 2022 act protecting houses of worship during emergencies. Governor Ron DeSantis lauded this recognition, emphasizing Florida's leadership in safeguarding religious freedoms. The RLS report suggests that states proactively implementing such laws are advancing, contrasting with others like Illinois and Colorado, which have seen their rankings decline due to a lack of new protections.</p>

          <h2>Meta Combats Spam by Removing Millions of Impersonating Facebook Profiles</h2>
          <div class="timestamp">2025-07-14 15:53:48 EDT</div>

          <p>Meta has disclosed the removal of around 10 million Facebook profiles during the first half of 2025, specifically targeting accounts that impersonate prominent content producers. This action is part of a larger company-wide effort to combat "spammy content" and enhance the authenticity and relevance of the Facebook feed. Meta is also rolling out stricter policies to prioritize original posts from creators and diminish the distribution of unoriginal or repetitive content, including that generated by artificial intelligence. This initiative aligns with Meta's significant investment in AI, as CEO Mark Zuckerberg plans to allocate hundreds of billions of dollars towards AI compute infrastructure, including bringing a supercluster online next year.</p>

          <p>President Donald Trump has declared that the Club World Cup trophy, which has been a conspicuous fixture in the Oval Office, will permanently reside there, asserting that FIFA produced a replica for the winning team, Chelsea. This announcement follows Trump's attendance at the tournament's final, where he co-presented the trophy with FIFA President Gianni Infantino, marking another instance of his involvement with the global football organization. The trophy's initial placement in the Oval Office in March signified a growing connection between the U.S. presidency and international sports. Trump also lightheartedly suggested a potential executive order to officially rename soccer as football in the United States, emphasizing the sport's role in fostering global unity.</p>

          <p>Former New York Governor Andrew Cuomo announced he will remain in the New York City mayoral race as an independent candidate, despite losing the Democratic primary. He proposed a plan to unite non-Mamdani candidates, agreeing to abide by a mid-September poll where the lowest-polling contenders would withdraw to prevent splitting the vote against presumptive Democratic nominee Zohran Mamdani. Cuomo criticized Mamdani's platform, vowing to campaign vigorously and earn voter trust. However, incumbent Mayor Eric Adams and Republican Curtis Sliwa have expressed skepticism and defiance, criticizing Cuomo's past actions and the polling gambit, indicating a contentious general election ahead.</p>

The toy's popularity has led to long lines at stores, high resale values, and even a market for knockoffs.

          <p>Jofra Archer made a successful and impactful return to Test cricket for England against India at Lord's, after 1,597 days away due to multiple injuries. The 30-year-old fast bowler, who underwent surgeries for elbow and back stress fractures, silenced doubters by taking 5-107 across the match, the most by any England bowler. His performance, including crucial wickets and sustained high pace, was lauded by captain Ben Stokes and former players. Archer's ability to endure long spells and maintain his speed throughout the five-day game suggests a promising return to form, although England faces a decision on his immediate future workload in the series.</p>

Supporters believe it will bolster trust, encourage competition, and cement the U.S. dollar's global dominance.

          <p>Meta's newly formed superintelligence lab is reportedly discussing a significant strategic shift towards developing a closed artificial intelligence model, potentially abandoning its powerful open-source model, Behemoth. This move would mark a substantial philosophical change for Meta, which has traditionally made its AI code public for wider development. The internal discussions, though preliminary and requiring CEO Mark Zuckerberg's approval, come after Behemoth's delayed release due to poor internal performance. This potential shift highlights the evolving strategies within major tech companies as they compete fiercely in the high-stakes AI development landscape, balancing innovation with control over their advanced models.</p>

          <p>This article clarifies the "age 75 rule" for annuities, explaining it's a common belief suggesting waiting until 75 to purchase an annuity for higher payouts. While true that payouts increase with age due to shorter life expectancy, the article argues this isn't always the best strategy. It highlights that waiting could mean needing income earlier, missing out on longevity risk protection, or facing limited options due to health changes. The optimal time to buy an annuity depends on individual retirement goals, other income sources, risk tolerance, and health expectations, emphasizing that there's no universal "right" age.
