          <p>Retired Supreme Court Justice David Souter, appointed by President George H.W. Bush in 1990, passed away at his home in New Hampshire at the age of 85. Souter often sided with liberal justices, frustrating Bush and other Republicans, and his relatively early retirement allowed President Barack Obama to appoint Sonia Sotomayor to the Supreme Court. Chief Justice John Roberts noted that Souter served the court with great distinction and wisdom for nearly 20 years, continuing to serve on the U.S Circuit Court of Appeals for the First Circuit after his retirement. Justice Souter's death marks the end of a long career in public service.</p>

          <p>A Soviet-era spacecraft, Kosmos 482, launched in 1972, is expected to make an uncontrolled reentry into Earth's atmosphere. Due to a rocket malfunction, the spacecraft never reached its intended destination of Venus and has been orbiting Earth for over five decades. Experts predict that parts of the spacecraft, built to withstand Venus's harsh atmosphere, may survive reentry, potentially resulting in a half-ton metal object falling from the sky. While the risk of the spacecraft hitting someone is low, space debris crashing back to Earth could pose a growing problem for aircraft.</p>

          <p>Japan Rugby League One is planning to alter its player registration rules to ensure domestic players receive more playing time. Starting from the 2026-27 season, at least eight of the fifteen players on each team must meet certain conditions, such as being Japanese-born, and be on the pitch simultaneously during a match. The new system will divide Category A players into "A1" and "A2," with A1 players being from Japan and A2 potentially including players from other countries, even those who have played for the Brave Blossoms. This change aims to promote the development and visibility of Japanese rugby talent within the league.</p>

          <p>David H. Souter, a Republican appointed to the Supreme Court by President George H.W. Bush, died at 85, having served for 19 years and becoming a key member of the court's liberal wing. Souter, a private and intellectual man, retired at 69 to return to New Hampshire, allowing President Barack Obama to appoint Sonia Sotomayor to fill his seat. He surprised conservatives with his alignment with liberal justices, leading to disappointment among Republicans who had hoped for a more conservative vote. Despite being appointed by a Republican president, Souter's judicial philosophy emphasized a Constitution that could evolve over time to encompass concepts not explicitly mentioned in the text, such as the right to privacy.</p>

          <p>Director Ava DuVernay called on artists and historians to resist President Trump's policies, labeling him a "criminal" and highlighting the importance of truth during a time when it is being revised. DuVernay made the remarks while receiving an award at the Smithsonian National Museum of American History, against the backdrop of Trump's efforts to purge "anti-American ideology" from the institution. She emphasized the need to confront contradictions in America's founding and illuminate the fault lines in its systems. DuVernay stressed the importance of remembering and teaching the full American story, including its injustices, to ensure a more inclusive future.</p>

          <p>The U.S. has granted refugee status to 54 white Afrikaner South Africans, who are expected to arrive in Washington D.C. and be welcomed by government officials. This decision follows an executive order directing the government to grant refugee status to Afrikaners, descendants of Dutch and French colonizers, citing discrimination. The process was expedited, with officials arranging a charter flight for their arrival. Critics argue this prioritizes a privileged group while vulnerable people from other parts of the world are denied asylum. The move comes amidst claims of discrimination against white South Africans, amplified by Trump and his advisors.</p>

          <p>President Trump described the U.S.-Canada border as an "artificially drawn line," suggesting it should be erased, during a meeting with Canadian Prime Minister Mark Carney. Trump's comments downplay the border's complex history and importance to everyday life, according to historians. The U.S.-Canadian border is the longest international border globally, shaped by treaties between 1783 and 1925, largely following the 49th parallel. While technically man-made, the border has real-world consequences and is actively monitored in many areas, with historical significance to Indigenous territories and trade routes.</p>

The Chinese government and official media have largely remained quiet, with a foreign ministry spokesman stating he was "not familiar" with the reports.
