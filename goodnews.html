          <p>Karol Nawrocki, a conservative candidate backed by President Trump, narrowly won Poland's presidential runoff election with 50.89% of the vote, defeating liberal Warsaw Mayor Rafa≈Ç Trzaskowski. The outcome suggests Poland will likely take a more populist and nationalist path under Nawrocki's leadership, which has been lauded by Hungarian Prime Minister Victor Orban. EU Commission President Ursula von der Leyen expressed confidence that the EU would continue its cooperation with Poland. Nawrocki, a 42-year-old historian, succeeds Andrzej Duda and is expected to influence foreign policy and legislation. </p>

          <p>The UK government is set to announce the creation of the UK Airspace Design Service (UKADS) to redesign flight paths over UK airspace, potentially leading to quicker flights and fewer delays for passengers. The modernization aims to allow planes to climb quicker during takeoff and descend more smoothly, reducing aviation's climate change impacts and paving the way for new technologies like flying taxis. The plans represent the largest redesign of UK airspace since the 1950s, with UKADS expected to be fully operational by the end of the year. A community aviation group has warned that the plans could result in new flight paths over previously unaffected areas. </p>

          <p>South Korea's opposition party leader, Lee Jae Myung, is projected to win the country's snap presidential election, following the impeachment and removal of former president Yoon Suk Yeol. Lee, who narrowly lost the 2022 election to Yoon, holds a significant lead in opinion polls and is expected to pursue a more left-leaning agenda if elected. His key challenges will include reviving South Korea's economy and finalizing a trade agreement with the U.S., with potential shifts in tariff negotiations. Goldman Sachs noted similarities between Lee and his rival Kim Moon Soo in their goals for economic growth and financial stability, but highlighted differences in their economic policy platforms. </p>
