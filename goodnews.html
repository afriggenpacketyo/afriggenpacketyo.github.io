          <p>Doan's Bakery in Los Angeles has recalled two of its cakes, including the White Chocolate Coconut cake famously gifted by actor Tom Cruise to his friends. The recall was initiated due to a labeling error where the products may contain undeclared wheat and milk, posing a risk to individuals with allergies. The issue was discovered during a routine FDA inspection, and the bakery has since updated its labeling. No illnesses or allergic reactions have been reported in connection with the cakes, which were shipped nationwide.</p>

This move makes the high-demand drugs more accessible and affordable, aligning with Costco's strategy of offering discounted goods and services.

          <p>One year into CEO Elliott Hill's turnaround plan, Nike has been steadily increasing prices on its footwear and apparel, with some categories seeing double-digit percentage hikes. The price adjustments are part of a strategy to reinforce brand value and improve profitability, while also navigating external pressures like an estimated $1.5 billion in tariff-related costs. Data analysis shows significant price increases began in early 2025, suggesting Nike is leveraging its pricing power in core performance categories. The company is attempting to balance profitability with consumer perception as it works to recover from a recent sales downturn. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>Billionaire investor Paul Tudor Jones stated that current market conditions are primed for a significant rally, potentially mirroring the explosive growth seen before the dot-com bubble burst in 1999. He noted that the present fiscal and monetary policies, including a 6% budget deficit, create a more potentially explosive environment than two decades ago. Jones advised that while the greatest gains often occur in the final 12 months of a bull market, investors must be prepared for a severe correction afterward. He suggested a strategy of owning gold, cryptocurrencies, and Nasdaq tech stocks to capitalize on the anticipated surge. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>The U.S. Supreme Court has rejected Ghislaine Maxwell's appeal, upholding her conviction and 20-year prison sentence for sex trafficking. The court declined to hear the case without providing an explanation, effectively ending her primary legal avenue to overturn the verdict. Maxwell was convicted in 2021 for her role in recruiting and grooming underage girls for abuse by the late financier Jeffrey Epstein. Her legal team expressed disappointment but stated they would continue to explore other legal options to challenge the outcome of her trial.</p>

          <p>Argentina's government has implemented stricter quality standards for sorghum exports, a move aimed at solidifying its position as a key supplier to China. The new rules, which set minimum weights and limit impurities, are designed to prevent cargo rejections and enhance the country's reliability in demanding markets. This strategic shift aligns Argentine standards with those of its primary buyer, China, which has become a crucial market for the grain. The policy could potentially create friction with the United States, which was previously a major sorghum supplier to China before trade dynamics shifted.</p>

          <p>Despite a widespread push from major corporations for employees to return to the office, work-from-home rates have remained stable since 2023. Stanford research suggests a 'growing compliance gap,' where employees engage in passive resistance, often with the tacit approval of middle managers who are reluctant to enforce strict attendance rules. Workers are also adopting strategies like 'coffee badging'—showing up for only a few hours—and 'micro-shifting' to maintain flexibility. This trend indicates that while companies are mandating a return, many workers are successfully retaining hybrid arrangements on their own terms.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Recent tax legislation has introduced changes that may impact how individuals approach year-end charitable donations. Starting in 2026, a new tax break will be available for non-itemizers, allowing them to deduct up to $1,000 for single filers and $2,000 for joint filers, potentially incentivizing some to delay smaller gifts. Conversely, higher earners may see their charitable deduction benefit reduced in 2026 due to a new deduction floor and a cap for those in the top tax bracket. Financial experts suggest that these changes warrant a multi-year approach to charitable planning, with some high earners potentially benefiting from accelerating donations in 2025.</p>

          <p>The Supreme Court's decision in Mahmoud v. Taylor, which allows parents to opt their children out of classroom content on religious grounds, is viewed by the article's author as a chance to recommit to educational pluralism. While the ruling on LGBTQ-themed books in a Maryland school district creates administrative burdens, it underscores that inclusion should not mean coercion. The author argues that public schools must serve all families, including those with deep religious convictions, through reciprocity and accommodation rather than ideological imposition. The decision challenges liberals to practice a more generous form of pluralism to maintain public education as a shared civic institution.</p>
