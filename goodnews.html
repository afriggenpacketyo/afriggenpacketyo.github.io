          <p>The world transfer record in women's football has been shattered five times in 2025, reflecting a significant influx of money into the sport's elite tiers, particularly in the English WSL and American NWSL. While experts see this as a positive sign of a growing and more professional ecosystem, they also warn of a widening financial and competitive gap. Leagues such as Germany's Bundesliga are finding it difficult to keep pace, as the broadcast and sponsorship deals fueling the boom are heavily concentrated in the Anglo-American markets.</p>

In contrast, South Korean and Taiwanese markets posted gains, while India's Nifty 50 rose after the country's central bank decided to hold interest rates steady, with mainland China and Hong Kong markets closed for a public holiday.

          <p>Following a surprising victory at the 2024 T20 World Cup, New Zealand cricketer Melie Kerr is confident that her team has the talent to be a dominant force in the sport for the next decade. Heading into the 50-over World Cup, New Zealand is not widely considered a favorite, a status Kerr says the team can use to its advantage by playing without the weight of external expectations. She believes the current group is exciting and poised to show its best cricket in the coming years.</p>

          <p>The Reserve Bank of India has opted to hold its key policy rate steady at 5.5%, a decision that was in line with economists' forecasts. This pause allows the central bank to evaluate the economic effects of previous rate cuts while navigating challenges such as moderating inflation and potential slowdowns linked to global trade uncertainties. The Monetary Policy Committee emphasized prudence, citing recent tax adjustments and trade issues as factors in their unanimous decision to wait before making further policy changes.

          <p>A ban on multibuy promotions, such as "buy one, get one free," for foods high in fat, salt, or sugar has taken effect in England for supermarkets and other large retailers. This measure is a key part of the government's broader strategy to tackle the country's rising obesity rates, particularly among children. Although its implementation was previously delayed due to cost-of-living concerns, public health officials have welcomed the move as a necessary step to curb impulsive purchases of unhealthy products.</p>

          <p>In his first year leading NATO, Mark Rutte's primary challenge has been managing the alliance's relationship with the re-elected U.S. President Donald Trump, who had previously expressed skepticism about American commitments. Rutte has been praised for his diplomatic efforts, successfully lobbying member nations to increase defense spending, which was instrumental in ensuring Trump's constructive participation in a recent summit. Foreign policy experts generally view his tenure as a success so far, crediting him with maintaining alliance unity and buying time for European members to enhance their own security.</p>

          <p>To alleviate the morning rush for medical appointments, all general practitioner practices in England are now required to offer online booking services throughout the entire workday. The new government mandate aims to modernize the NHS by allowing patients to request non-urgent appointments and submit queries digitally, freeing up phone lines for more urgent cases. Despite initial concerns from the British Medical Association about potential risks, the government has implemented the plan as part of its effort to improve patient access and convenience.</p>

However, a near-collapse in the eighth inning, where the team's struggling bullpen allowed three runs, underscored a significant and persistent vulnerability for the defending champions.</p>

          <p>An increasing number of young Americans are pursuing careers in skilled trades such as electrical work and plumbing, driven by concerns over the high cost of college and the looming threat of AI automating white-collar jobs. Many members of Gen Z view blue-collar professions as more stable and less susceptible to automation compared to entry-level office roles. This cultural shift is leading to renewed interest in vocational education and apprenticeships as a practical and financially viable alternative to a traditional four-year degree.</p>
