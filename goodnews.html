          <h2>Large Crowds Expected for Budapest Pride March Despite Official Police Ban</h2>
          <div class="timestamp">2025-06-28 02:58:00 EDT</div>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Supporters of LGBTQ+ rights from approximately 30 countries are anticipated to participate in the Budapest Pride march, defying a police ban enacted under new legislation. The event has become a symbol of opposition to the government of Prime Minister Viktor Orban, drawing support from over 30 embassies and members of the European Parliament. Despite the risk of fines and potential jail time for organizers, the march is seen as a significant stand for civil liberties in Hungary. The government's actions are viewed by critics as part of a broader crackdown on democratic freedoms ahead of next year's elections.</p>

          <p>Ahead of their Saturday boxing match, Julio C√©sar Ch√°vez Jr. and Jake Paul are both insisting their fight is a legitimate contest with significant career implications, not a staged event. For Ch√°vez Jr., son of a boxing legend, the fight is a chance to revitalize his career after personal struggles and potentially secure more significant future bouts. For Paul, a victory over a former world champion would be a major step toward silencing critics and establishing his credibility in the sport. Both fighters have dismissed skepticism, promising a genuine and competitive match with much at stake for their respective futures.</p>

          <h2>Chinese Economist Claims WeChat and Alipay Provide a 'Comparative Advantage' in Stablecoin Development</h2>
          <div class="timestamp">2025-06-28 02:00:17 EDT</div>
        </div>
        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>According to Peng Wensheng, chief economist at China International Capital Corporation, China's established third-party payment platforms like WeChat and Alipay give the nation a significant edge in the global stablecoin race. He argues that these platforms function similarly to stablecoins by extending legal tender and are backed by a mature regulatory framework that ensures a 1:1 peg with fiat currency. Peng's analysis suggests that the stability of this system is reinforced by strict safeguards, including customer funds being backed by central bank money. This perspective emerges as Chinese state media encourages policymakers to remain proactive in the evolving digital currency landscape. (not investment advice)</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>A recent study from the Japan Institute for Health Security has found a lower rate of depressive symptoms among working-age individuals who consume a Japanese-style diet. The research assessed the benefits of a traditional diet rich in rice, miso soup, soy products, fish, and green tea. The study also looked at a modified version that included fruit and dairy. This is the first study of its kind to specifically link the components of a traditional Japanese diet to mental health outcomes, suggesting a potential nutritional strategy in the fight against depression.</p>

          <p>The British government has announced plans to scrap 201 organizations responsible for overseeing and running parts of the National Health Service (NHS) in England. The move, part of Labour's new 10-year health strategy, will eliminate bodies including patient advocate Healthwatch England and the National Guardian's Office, which supports whistleblowers. Health Secretary Wes Streeting stated the current system is overly complex and needs "more doers and fewer checkers." While the NHS Confederation welcomed potential efficiencies, it urged caution to ensure the vital functions of these bodies, such as protecting patients and staff, are not lost in the restructuring.</p>

          <p>A team from China's Nankai University has successfully completed the first human trial of a brain-computer interface (BCI) implanted through blood vessels, enabling a paralyzed patient to regain some limb movement. This innovative method avoids the need for open-skull surgery, such as the technique used by Elon Musk's Neuralink, thereby reducing surgical risks and recovery time. Surgeons inserted a stent electrode into the patient's intracranial vasculature through a vein in the neck. The breakthrough represents a significant advancement in neurotechnology, offering a potentially safer alternative for treating conditions like paralysis.</p>

          <p>The Los Angeles Dodgers defeated the Kansas City Royals 5-4, extending their winning streak despite what their manager described as a flawed performance. The team overcame a rough four-inning start from pitcher Dustin May and defensive errors, thanks to key offensive plays, including a leadoff home run from Shohei Ohtani and a two-run homer by Max Muncy. The game was ultimately decided by a bases-loaded, game-ending double play in the ninth inning. The victory pushed the Dodgers into sole possession of the best record in the majors, showcasing their ability to win even when not playing at their peak.</p>

          <p>Chelsea manager Enzo Maresca has firmly stated that the club has no plans to sell 19-year-old defender Josh Acheampong, despite interest from other clubs in England and Europe. Maresca emphasized his belief in Acheampong's potential to become a top defender for the team and clarified that the plan is for the academy product to remain at Stamford Bridge. Acheampong, who signed a new five-year contract last year, had a breakthrough season and will only be considered for a loan if it is deemed best for his development. The manager's public backing provides clarity on the young player's future with the club.</p>
