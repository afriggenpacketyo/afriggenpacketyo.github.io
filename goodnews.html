          <p>Princess Kate Middleton shared a rare, affectionate birthday tribute to Prince William, featuring a never-before-seen photo of him with their black cocker spaniel, Orla, and her four puppies. The social media post, signed by Kate and their children, Prince George, Princess Charlotte, and Prince Louis, shows William lovingly looking at one of the puppies. This public declaration of love and support is unusual for the couple, who typically avoid personal messages on social media. The message follows Kate's withdrawal from a scheduled Royal Ascot appearance as she continues cancer treatment, balancing public engagements with her recovery. The post conveys a warm, family-centered celebration of Prince William's birthday. Optimism score is not mentioned in this summary.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>The British-flagged luxury superyacht Bayesian, which sank off Sicily in August 2024, has been successfully lifted from the seabed. The operation, led by TMC Marine, involved a large maritime crane hauling the 56-meter vessel ashore for further investigation. The sinking resulted in the deaths of British tech magnate Mike Lynch and six others, while fifteen people survived. Italian authorities are conducting a criminal investigation to determine the cause of the sinking, which occurred during a storm while Lynch was celebrating his acquittal on fraud charges; the recovery of the Bayesian is expected to aid in this investigation. The condition of the yacht was poor, with extensive damage to the upper decks and mud encrusted on the blue hull.</p>

          <p>Columbia University activist Mahmoud Khalil asserts that the Trump administration's attempts to silence pro-Palestinian voices have failed, following his release from immigration detention. Khalil, who was detained for over three months, vowed to continue advocating for Palestinian rights and the rights of immigrants. He accused the White House of dehumanizing those who disagree with the administration. New York Democratic Congresswoman Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez joined Khalil, stating that his release indicates the Trump administration is losing the legal battle to deport pro-Palestinian advocates.

          <p>A federal judge has blocked the Trump administration from implementing significant cuts to research funding provided by the National Science Foundation (NSF). The ruling prevents the administration from capping indirect costs for universities, a move that could have stripped institutions of millions of dollars. Judge Indira Talwani deemed the policy change arbitrary, capricious, and contrary to law. The University of California estimated the change would cost it nearly $100 million annually. This action preserves funding for critical research in fields such as AI and cybersecurity.</p>
