          <p>Colorado Buffaloes head coach Deion Sanders issued a reminder to his players and staff to prioritize safety and good judgment during the Memorial Day holiday. Sanders cautioned his team to be mindful of their associations and to avoid jeopardizing their professional opportunities. This message follows cryptic posts by Sanders on X, where he addressed "false stories" without providing specific details. The article also touches on the criticism Sanders and his son, Shedeur, have faced, particularly after Shedeur's NFL draft position, and the father's support for his son amidst the negativity. The article emphasizes Sanders' desire to connect with younger generations and address any questions they may have directly.</p>

        </div>
        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Analysts are advising investors to prepare for ongoing volatility despite President Donald Trump's decision to postpone imposing 50% tariffs on the European Union. Trump's delay, following a call with EU Commission President Ursula von der Leyen, provides a brief respite but does not eliminate the potential for a trade war. Experts suggest the six-week window may not be sufficient to resolve all detailed issues, and uncertainty remains regarding the Trump administration's specific demands. The EU is reportedly taking a measured approach to negotiations, but the situation remains precarious, with potential implications for various sectors including tech and industrials (not investment advice).</p>

          <p>This article provides an end-of-season review of the Premier League, highlighting Liverpool's dominant performance and worthy title win in Arne Slot's first season as head coach. Arsenal's season is deemed disappointing despite finishing second and reaching the Champions League semi-final, with a need for a proven goalscorer identified. Manchester City had a desperately disappointing season by their own standards, failing to win a fifth successive Premier League title. Chelsea secured Champions League qualification, although questions remain about Enzo Maresca's style of play.</p>

          <p>French President Emmanuel Macron's office has dismissed an incident where his wife, Brigitte Macron, appeared to push his face away upon arriving in Hanoi, Vietnam. Video footage showed Brigitte placing her hands on Emmanuel's face and giving it a shove as he emerged from the plane. Macron's office initially denied the authenticity of the images before confirming them as genuine, describing the incident as a harmless "squabble." The incident occurred as Macron began a Southeast Asian tour to promote France as an alternative to the United States and China amid trade tensions.</p>

Agencies are creating dedicated wellness units, and state legislatures are mandating and funding wellness initiatives.

          <p>Despite concerns about democratic erosion in the United States, the country possesses several exceptional traits that protect it from a Trump-led assault on democracy. These include a robust network of advocacy groups, a powerful and independent judiciary, a constitutional system that makes executive preferences hard to entrench, a diverse and free private press, a federal system of government, and a uniquely speech-protective legal tradition. While these features may have trade-offs in ordinary times, they provide a clear advantage when democracy is under threat. These elements make the American system easier to defend and contribute to its worth.</p>
