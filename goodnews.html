          <div class="timestamp">2025-07-15 12:56:26 EDT</div>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Citigroup announced second-quarter financial results that surpassed Wall Street estimates, driven by significant revenue growth across its key business divisions. The bank's markets division revenue climbed 16%, while its banking revenue saw an 18% increase, contributing to a 25% rise in net income compared to the previous year. CEO Jane Fraser highlighted the strong performance as evidence of the company's successful transformation plan, even as the bank increased its allowance for credit losses due to a deteriorating economic outlook. The positive report led Citigroup to raise its full-year revenue forecast to the high end of its previous guidance. (not investment advice)</p>

          <h2>Wreckage of Japanese WWII Destroyer Discovered on Pacific Seabed</h2>
          <div class="timestamp">2025-07-15 12:36:19 EDT</div>

          <p>An exploration team has discovered the wreck of the Teruzuki, a Japanese destroyer sunk during a pivotal World War II battle near the Solomon Islands in 1942. Located over 2,600 feet below the surface, the warship was found by a remotely operated vehicle, revealing new details about its final moments. The discovery is historically significant as there are no known photographs of the Teruzuki, and the wreck was found with its munitions, including depth charges, still intact. This finding provides a rare glimpse into the naval warfare of the Guadalcanal campaign and the advanced, secretive Japanese naval technology of the era.</p>

          <p>President Donald Trump announced via social media that the United States has secured a trade deal with Indonesia, just a week after threatening the nation with a 32% tariff on its exports. In his post, Trump described it as a "great deal, for everybody" and mentioned direct dealings with Indonesian President Prabowo Subianto, but he did not provide any specific details about the agreement's terms. This announcement follows a similar pattern to a recent trade declaration with Vietnam, where initial details were sparse, leaving officials and markets awaiting further clarification from the White House.</p>

          <p>A new analysis has identified the U.S. states best equipped with the electrical grid capacity and affordability to support the massive energy demands of the burgeoning artificial intelligence industry. With data centers projected to consume up to 12% of the nation's electricity by 2028, states like Nebraska, Iowa, and Wyoming rank highest due to their reliable power grids, low electricity costs, and significant energy production capabilities. The report highlights that grid reliability and access to inexpensive power have become the most critical factors for companies like Meta and Google when selecting sites for new, power-intensive AI facilities.</p>

          <p>A new Pew Research Centre survey indicates that public opinion toward China is becoming more favorable in several Latin American countries, including Mexico and Brazil. Despite this warming sentiment, the United States continues to be viewed by many in the region as the more important economic partner. This trend sets Latin America apart from many high-income nations, where views of China remain predominantly negative. The survey, conducted before some of President Trump's most recent tariff announcements, suggests a complex and evolving geopolitical dynamic as China's influence grows in a region traditionally aligned with the U.S.</p>
