        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>The Social Security Administration (SSA) has processed over 2.5 million retroactive payments for public servants like teachers and firefighters who were previously restricted from receiving full retirement benefits. This action follows the Social Security Fairness Act, signed into law in January 2025, which eliminates the Windfall Elimination Provision (WEP) and Government Pension Offset (GPO). Beneficiaries should have received a one-time payment by the end of March 2025, with new monthly benefits starting in April. The SSA expects all beneficiary records to be updated by November 2025, and those who haven't received payments should check their information on the SSA website or call the provided number. </p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>The Supreme Court unanimously ruled in favor of Catholic Charities in Catholic Charities v. Wisconsin Labor and Industry Review Commission, focusing on a narrow distinction in Wisconsin law regarding unemployment tax exemptions for nonprofits. The court found that the state cannot favor religious charities that proselytize or serve only co-religionists over those that do not. Justice Sotomayor's opinion avoids a broader fight over when businesses with a religious identity can ignore the law, leaving the definition of "theological" open for future interpretation. The decision does not explicitly undermine previous rulings protecting worker's rights. </p>

          <p>Stellantis is bringing back the V-8 Hemi engine for its Ram 1500 pickup trucks, reversing a previous decision to discontinue it due to fuel economy regulations and a shift towards electric vehicles. Ram CEO Tim Kuniskis acknowledged the cancellation was a mistake and the Hemi will be offered as an option on most models, expected to represent 25% to 40% of Ram 1500 sales. This move is part of a new product turnaround plan that includes 25 product announcements over 18 months, as EV adoption has been slower than expected. The return of the Hemi aims to provide customers with more powertrain choices. </p>

Overall, 582,477 pupils in England attended private schools in January, down from 593,486 the previous year. </p>
