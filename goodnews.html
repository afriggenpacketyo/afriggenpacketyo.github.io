          <p>Black South Africans have responded to President Trump's false claims of genocide against white farmers with humor and disbelief. Trump's announcement of an expedited path for white South Africans to resettle in the United States as "refugees" has been met with anger, given the history of apartheid. Many jokes stem from the idea that Afrikaners are used to a life of privilege made possible by Black workers. Despite President Ramaphosa's attempts to focus on trade, Trump continued to make false claims about violence against white farmers.</p>

The reactivation ensures that Voyager 1, currently exploring interstellar space nearly 15 billion miles away, can continue transmitting data.

          <p>The United Kingdom has signed a deal to transfer sovereignty of the Chagos Islands to Mauritius while securing a strategically important U.S. military base. The U.K. can continue leasing the largest of the islands, Diego Garcia, keeping the military facility in British and American hands for at least 99 years. The deal comes after a lengthy dispute over the islands that has involved questions over Britain's colonial legacy. The prime minister of Mauritius, Navin Ramgoolam, hailed the deal as a "great victory for the Mauritian nation."</p>
