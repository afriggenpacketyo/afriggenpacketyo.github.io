          <p>Shares in French luxury group Kering rose over 9% after the company reported a smaller-than-expected sales decline in its third quarter, signaling a potential turnaround. While sales at its main brand, Gucci, were down, the 14% drop marked a significant sequential improvement from the previous quarter's 25% plunge, beating analyst expectations. This positive development, along with Kering's recent decision to sell its beauty unit to focus on core fashion businesses, has built optimism among investors. Analysts see the results as evidence that management's actions to revive the brand are beginning to show success. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>Swedish automaker Volvo Cars saw its stock price soar by approximately 40% in a single day, marking its best trading performance since its public listing. The dramatic rally was triggered by the company's third-quarter operating income report, which significantly surpassed analyst expectations at 6.4 billion Swedish kronor. The strong financial results were attributed to a successful cost-saving program and several one-off financial items. This performance has provided a major boost to investor confidence in the Geely-owned car manufacturer's financial health and strategic direction.</p>

Both Shapiro and Spanberger are considered moderates within the Democratic Party, and Shapiro's involvement highlights the national significance of the Virginia election. Spanberger is competing against Republican Lieutenant Governor Winsome Earle-Sears to succeed the term-limited Glenn Youngkin. The race has been complicated by a controversy involving the Democratic nominee for attorney general, creating challenges for Spanberger's campaign.</p>

          <p>Over 1,500 police departments across the U.S. and Canada are now utilizing virtual reality (VR) technology to improve officers' split-second decision-making skills in high-stress situations. Tech company Axon's VR program immerses recruits in realistic scenarios involving de-escalation, Taser use, and interactions with individuals in mental health crises. The Aurora Police Department in Colorado reports that the technology frees up training staff and allows multiple recruits to experience the same scenario simultaneously. A recent study found that VR learners train four times faster and show a 275% increase in confidence compared to those with traditional classroom training.</p>

          <p>Manchester City's Joško Gvardiol, one of the world's most expensive defenders, has revealed that he considered quitting football for basketball as a teenager. At age 16, while struggling for playing time in Dinamo Zagreb's youth system, Gvardiol felt unhappy and contemplated pursuing a different sport like his friends. However, he persevered, eventually breaking into the senior team and launching a successful career that led to a £77 million transfer to Manchester City. Now a key player for his club and the Croatian national team, Gvardiol has become an integral part of City's defense.</p>

          <p>China's space agency has announced that its Chang'e-7 lunar mission will be a pioneering effort to search for water ice at the moon's south pole. The mission, slated to be the most complex in China's lunar program history, will deploy an orbiter, lander, rover, and a smaller hopping probe to study the polar environment. Finding water ice is considered crucial for future crewed space exploration, as it could be converted into drinking water, oxygen, and rocket fuel. The landing site will be chosen in an area with over 100 days of continuous sunlight to support long-term operations.</p>

          <p>A metal detectorist has discovered what may be the largest hoard of Roman coins ever found in Wales, unearthing two clay pots containing an estimated 10,000 to 15,000 coins. The discovery was made in an "virtually untouched" area of north Wales by David Moss from Cheshire. After the find, he slept in his car for three days to protect the coins before delivering them to experts at the National Museum Cardiff for analysis. If confirmed, the hoard would surpass the previous Welsh record, with its value to be determined and split between the finder and the landowner.</p>
