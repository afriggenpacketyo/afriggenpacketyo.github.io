          <p>Senator Bernie Sanders joined New York City mayoral candidate Zohran Mamdani for a large town hall event at Brooklyn College. The two progressive politicians addressed a crowd of approximately 1,700, speaking out against the influence of billionaires and corporate interests in politics. Mamdani, a Democratic socialist, outlined his platform which includes rent freezes and higher taxes for the wealthy, while Sanders praised the campaign as a grassroots movement essential for the future of American democracy. The event highlighted the growing progressive wing of the Democratic party and its focus on mobilizing working-class voters against what they term oligarchic control.</p>

The drawing on Saturday night came after 41 consecutive drawings without a jackpot winner, tying a record for the longest streak. The winning numbers were 11, 23, 44, 61, and 62, with a Powerball of 17. A potential winner can choose between an annuitized prize or a lump sum cash payment estimated at $826.4 million before taxes.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>A joint team of US and Chinese researchers has developed an innovative method to launch small, millimeter-scale robots by harnessing the energy from collapsing vapor bubbles. The process, known as cavitation, involves using a laser to rapidly heat light-absorbing materials on a wet surface, causing water droplets to boil and form bubbles. When these bubbles collapse, they release a powerful burst of energy capable of launching tiny jumpers up to five feet into the air. This technique offers a new, efficient launching mechanism that can be precisely controlled by manipulating the laser's light.</p>

          <p>An increasing number of schools across the United States are implementing the Yondr pouch system to enforce bans on student cellphone use during school hours. Students are required to place their phones in the pouches, which are then locked with a magnetic device and can only be opened at designated stations at the end of the day. The measure is a response to widespread concerns among educators about phones being a major classroom distraction. While many educators and some students have welcomed the change, citing increased social interaction and focus, others have expressed frustration and devised ways to circumvent the system.</p>

          <p>The recent Shanghai Cooperation Organisation (SCO) summit in Tianjin served as a platform for China to project its vision for a multipolar global order, presenting itself as an alternative leader for global governance. President Xi Jinping was prominently featured with Russian President Vladimir Putin and Indian Prime Minister Narendra Modi, signaling a powerful alignment of Eurasian powers. The summit aimed to bolster China's geopolitical influence at a time when US global leadership is perceived by some as less reliable. The SCO, which includes Russia, India, and Iran, focuses on security cooperation and economic integration through initiatives like the Belt and Road. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>A young Philadelphia Phillies fan was treated to special gifts after a viral video showed an adult woman taking a home run ball from him during a game against the Miami Marlins. After Phillies outfielder Harrison Bader hit the home run, a man retrieved the ball and gave it to the boy, but a woman confronted them and took the ball for herself. In response, Marlins staff gave the boy a gift bag, and after the game, Bader met the young fan, giving him an autographed bat.

          <p>The Reform UK party is actively promoting new and emerging figures in an effort to demonstrate that its political influence extends beyond its well-known leader, Nigel Farage. At its recent conference, the party highlighted defectors from the Conservative party, such as Westminster councillor Laila Cunningham and Lancashire County Council leader Stephen Atkinson. These individuals, along with other hopefuls, are being positioned to contest future elections as the party aims to expand its electoral footprint significantly. The strategy aims to build a broader base of credible candidates and counter the perception that Reform UK is a "one-man-band."</p>

          <p>A new UK-based organization called Sisters in Service is providing a vital support network for female military veterans who now work in healthcare. Co-founded by Dr. Bex Bennett, a former British Army officer and current NHS psychiatrist, the group helps women connect over shared experiences that are often misunderstood by the public. Members note that female veterans face unique challenges, including outdated perceptions that only men serve on the front lines, making it difficult to discuss their service. The community offers a "cathartic" space for these women to support each other through meetings, social activities, and shared understanding.</p>

          <p>Carlo Acutis, a London-born Italian teenager who died of leukemia in 2006 at age 15, is set to be canonized as the first millennial saint by the Catholic Church. Known for his computer skills, Acutis created websites to document Catholic miracles, earning him the nickname "God's influencer." His path to sainthood was fast-tracked after the Vatican attributed two miracles to his intercession. His story is seen by the Church as a way to connect with and inspire younger generations, blending modern interests like video games and the internet with traditional faith.</p>

          <p>With Dame Anna Wintour stepping down as editor-in-chief of US Vogue after nearly four decades, the iconic fashion magazine faces a critical juncture in maintaining its cultural relevance. Wintour, who will remain as global editorial director, is credited with transforming Vogue by bridging high fashion with mainstream culture, famously featuring pop stars and celebrities on its cover. Her successor, Chloe Malle, takes over in a challenging media landscape where monthly print publications compete with the instant-gratification of social media. The transition prompts questions about whether Vogue's influence was tied more to Wintour's personal brand than the magazine itself.</p>

This marks Harry's first visit since April, and while no official meeting has been confirmed, recent signs suggest tensions may be easing.</p>

          <p>Sean Dickson delivered a stunning late-game performance to lead Somerset to a dramatic victory over the Birmingham Bears in the T20 Blast quarter-final. Needing 19 runs from the final over, Dickson hit two sixes and a four, securing the win with just one ball to spare. His unbeaten 71 from only 26 balls was crucial after Somerset's run chase had faltered. The Bears had set a competitive target of 190, largely thanks to a rapid 71 from captain Alex Davies, but were ultimately denied as Somerset advanced to their record-equalling 11th Finals Day appearance.</p>
