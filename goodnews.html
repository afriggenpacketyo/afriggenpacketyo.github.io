          <p>The Japanese government has started releasing stockpiled rice through direct contracts with retailers to combat soaring rice prices. Major supermarket operator Ito-Yokado Co. and home appliance company Iris Ohyama Inc. were the first to sell the rice, with consumers quickly purchasing the cheaper products. The government's effort aims to alleviate the financial burden on households facing rising rice costs, with 300,000 tons of rice from 2021 and 2022 being made available. The Ministry of Agriculture, Forestry and Fisheries hopes that direct sales to retailers will be more effective in curbing rice prices compared to previous auction attempts.</p>
