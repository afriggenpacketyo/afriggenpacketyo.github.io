          <div class="timestamp">2025-07-29 19:55:00 EDT</div>
        </div>
        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>The U.S. Senate has confirmed Susan Monarez as the new director of the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, a significant appointment as she is the first non-medical doctor in the role in over 70 years. During her confirmation hearing, Monarez affirmed her commitment to science-based public health, explicitly refuting a causal link between vaccines and autism, a view her superior, Robert F. Kennedy Jr., has controversially promoted. She also supported the use of fluoride in drinking water for oral health benefits, despite differing opinions from the Secretary. Monarez's leadership begins amidst a growing measles outbreak and ongoing concerns about the CDC's independence and recent staffing reductions, requiring her to rebuild public trust and modernize infrastructure.</p>

          <p>Accelerated MD programs, which condense medical school into three years, are gaining traction as a potential solution to the projected shortage of up to 40,000 primary care physicians in the U.S. by 2036. These innovative programs, offered at institutions like UMass Chan Medical School, aim to produce doctors faster while maintaining educational quality, with analyses showing no significant difference in medical knowledge compared to four-year graduates. Beyond saving students a year of tuition, estimated at $60,000, they allow future doctors to begin their practice earlier, potentially saving them a quarter of a million dollars over their lifetime. Furthermore, a significant number of graduates are choosing to practice in rural or underserved communities, directly addressing critical healthcare access gaps across the nation.</p>

          <div class="timestamp">2025-07-29 19:16:59 EDT</div>

          <p>The Los Angeles Zoo has welcomed two male Tasmanian devils, Danny Zuko and Crush, marking the first time in five years the species has been at the zoo, thanks to the Australian government. These devils, born at Australia's Aussie Ark conservation organization, are now on view at the Animals of Australia exhibit. Tasmanian devils are unique to Tasmania and are known for their powerful bite and noisy feeding habits. The species is classified as endangered by the International Union for Conservation of Nature Red List, primarily due to threats like human conflict, other predators, and the devastating Devil Facial Tumor Disease. Their presence at the zoo represents a significant step in global conservation efforts and public education about this unique marsupial.</p>

          <p>Professor Michele Dougherty has been appointed the UK's first female Astronomer Royal in the post's 350-year history, marking a significant and historic milestone for women in science. Dougherty, who is currently leading a team sending probes to Jupiter's icy moons to assess their potential for supporting life, hopes her appointment will inspire more women and girls to pursue scientific careers. Her remarkable journey, sparked by building a telescope with her father at age ten, showcases her talent and courage despite not studying science in secondary school. She aims to actively engage with the public, excite them about astronomy, and clearly demonstrate its crucial importance to the UK economy.</p>

          <p>CNBC's Jim Cramer expressed a nuanced view on Figma's upcoming initial public offering, indicating his appreciation for the design software company's underlying business but caution regarding its high valuation. Figma recently upped its expected IPO price range, which would value it at up to $18.8 billion, a figure still below Adobe's previously scrapped $20 billion acquisition offer. While Cramer acknowledged Figma's strong profitability, impressive revenue growth, and robust client retention, he voiced concern over the broader enterprise software market's recent weakness. He also highlighted CEO Dylan Field's comments about significant AI investments potentially impacting profitability for several years, which could affect investor sentiment.

          <p>New Orleans has officially launched its "Crescent City ID" program, a municipal identification initiative specifically designed to promote inclusion for vulnerable residents, including migrant communities and homeless individuals. This program provides an accessible form of proof of identity and enhances access to various city services, a move seen as particularly beneficial amidst the Trump administration's ongoing nationwide crackdown on undocumented people. While the federal government has sued other "sanctuary" cities for implementing similar protective policies, a federal court recently dismissed a lawsuit against Chicago regarding its own program. New Orleans officials plan to store minimal applicant information to protect privacy, signaling the city's firm commitment to supporting its diverse communities despite potential federal challenges.</p>

          <p>Germany is preparing multi-billion euro procurement orders for military equipment, including 20 Eurofighter jets, up to 3,000 Boxer armored vehicles, and 3,500 Patria infantry fighting vehicles. These significant purchases are part of Chancellor Friedrich Merz’s strategy to build Europe’s most powerful conventional army, aiming to reduce reliance on the United States and enhance European security. The defense spending, projected to rise to 83 billion euro by 2026, is exempt from constitutional debt limits, enabling this massive overhaul. This move addresses long-standing neglect of military readiness and signals Germany's commitment to meeting NATO's 3.5% GDP defense spending benchmark by 2029. (not investment advice)</p>
