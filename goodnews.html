          <p>England rugby player Abi Burton made her Rugby World Cup debut, marking a significant milestone after a challenging health battle. Three years prior, Burton was in a medically-induced coma for nearly four weeks due to autoimmune encephalitis, a rare condition where her immune system attacked her brain. She initially lost the ability to walk, talk, read, or write, but underwent intensive rehabilitation to return to elite sport. Her emotional debut, witnessed by her family, underscored a personal triumph far exceeding any match result.</p>

          <p>European stock markets are projected to open higher, aiming to rebound from recent negative sentiment driven by regional fiscal concerns. This follows a period where the U.K.'s 30-year bond yield reached its highest since 1998 and France's 30-year yield hit a 2009 peak, ahead of critical budget votes. Global bond yields have also been rising due to worries over President Donald Trump's trade tariffs and a U.S. court ruling on their legality. Investors are now assessing these factors, alongside upcoming earnings reports and economic data, to gauge market direction.</p>

          <p>The intense atmosphere of the US Open in New York has sparked a debate over on-court tennis etiquette, with incidents involving net cords, underarm serves, and body shots drawing scrutiny. Players like Jelena Ostapenko and Stefanos Tsitsipas have reacted strongly to perceived breaches of courtesy, such as opponents not apologizing for net-cord winners or using underarm serves. While some players, like Cameron Norrie, find a lack of apology for net cords inconsequential, the discussions highlight cultural differences in sportsmanship. The tournament's high stakes and vibrant crowd amplify these contentious moments, making etiquette a recurring talking point.</p>

          <p>Australia's economy expanded more than anticipated in the second quarter, achieving its fastest growth rate since September 2023. The country's GDP grew 1.8% year-over-year, surpassing Reuters' forecast of 1.6%, primarily driven by robust domestic spending from households and the government. Despite global uncertainties, the Reserve Bank of Australia recently cut rates and expressed optimism about avoiding extreme economic outcomes. Analysts anticipate steady, albeit not spectacular, growth for the remainder of the year, with consumer and business confidence showing signs of recovery.</p>

The President stated he was very active over the Labor Day weekend, engaging in media interviews and visiting his Virginia golf course. Speculation about his well-being had circulated on social media, partly fueled by his lack of a public schedule and comments from Vice President JD Vance. Trump expressed frustration at the media's inquiries into his health, reiterating his active engagement in presidential duties.</p>

          <p>California lawmakers have passed a bill requiring K-12 schools, state universities, and community colleges to notify families and teachers when immigration enforcement authorities are present on campuses. Authored by state senator Sasha Renée Pérez, the 'Safe Act' aims to inform and empower school communities amidst the Trump administration's aggressive deportation campaigns. The legislation, now awaiting Governor Gavin Newsom's signature, would take effect immediately if signed and remain active until 2031. This measure is part of a broader effort by Democratic-led states to protect immigrants from federal enforcement activities.</p>

          <p>A woman in Alhambra successfully used a discreet hand signal, popularized on TikTok, to alert a bystander to a domestic violence situation at a 7-Eleven. The signal, involving tucking the thumb into the palm and covering it with four fingers, led to a 911 call and a rapid police response. Officers arrested John Palombi, the alleged abuser, who attempted to flee and was found to have an active warrant and a stun gun. The Canadian Women’s Foundation created the 'signal for help' in 2020 to provide a silent means for survivors to seek assistance during isolation, proving effective in this incident.</p>

          <p>Baroness Sue Gray, former chief of staff to Sir Keir Starmer, has questioned the government's decision to restrict a civil service internship scheme exclusively to students from 'lower socio-economic backgrounds.' Gray, who herself comes from a working-class background, expressed concerns about the 'evidence base' for this change, arguing against limiting exposure to diverse groups. While the government aims to broaden the talent pool and better reflect the country, critics like Baroness Finn argue the new criteria could discriminate against children from other working-class professions. The debate highlights ongoing discussions about meritocracy and social mobility within public service.</p>

          <p>A jury swiftly ruled in favor of Cardi B, finding her not liable in a lawsuit filed by a security guard who alleged the rapper assaulted her. Emani Ellis claimed Cardi B cut her face with a fingernail and spat on her during a heated argument at an obstetrician's office in 2018, while Cardi B's pregnancy was still a secret. Cardi B testified that she feared Ellis would leak her pregnancy news, admitting to an argument but denying any physical contact. The jury deliberated for approximately one hour before clearing the Grammy-winning artist of all allegations.</p>

          <p>Google received a partial victory in a landmark antitrust case, as a federal judge ruled against the most severe penalties proposed by the U.S. Department of Justice. Despite Google being found to illegally hold a monopoly in internet search, the judge allowed the company to retain its Chrome browser. The decision was significantly influenced by the rapid emergence of generative AI technologies like ChatGPT, which has fundamentally altered the competitive landscape. The ruling mandates Google share search data and prevents it from using anticompetitive tactics for its AI products, aiming to foster competition in this evolving market.</p>

          <p>A divided U.S. appeals court reinstated Federal Trade Commissioner Rebecca Slaughter, a Democrat, rejecting President Donald Trump's attempt to remove her from office. The D.C. Circuit Court of Appeals ruled that FTC commissioners cannot be fired by a president without cause, citing nearly a century of clear legal precedent. This decision upholds the independence of regulatory agencies and challenges the president's power to dismiss officials at will. Slaughter expressed eagerness to resume her work, while the White House did not immediately comment on the ruling, which is likely to be appealed to the Supreme Court.</p>
