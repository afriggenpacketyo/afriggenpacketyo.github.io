          <p>World-renowned conservationist Dame Jane Goodall has passed away at 91, leaving behind an extraordinary legacy in science and environmental activism. Her groundbreaking discoveries, particularly observing tool use in chimpanzees and detailing their complex social lives, revolutionized understanding of primate behavior and challenged conventional scientific thinking. Goodall, who began her research in Tanzania without formal qualifications, became a tireless advocate for environmental protection and animal welfare, inspiring millions globally. Tributes from figures like Barack Obama and Leonardo DiCaprio underscore her profound impact, with her work continuing through the Jane Goodall Institute to protect chimpanzees, restore nature, and foster hope for a better world.</p>

          <p>Gold prices have surged globally by over 48% this year, reaching a record high of US$3,883 per ounce, significantly impacting consumers in Hong Kong and mainland China. Despite this steep increase, consumers are gradually adapting to the new price levels, especially for culturally significant purchases like wedding jewelry. In Hong Kong, gold for jewelry reached HK$35,370 per tael, reflecting parallel rises with the international market. This trend highlights the enduring cultural importance of gold in wedding traditions, even as economic realities compel adjustments in consumer spending and expectations for such significant life events.

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>South Korea's Kospi index surged over 3% to an all-time high on Thursday, propelled by significant gains in heavyweight tech companies Samsung Electronics and SK Hynix. This rally follows their late Wednesday announcement of a partnership with OpenAI to supply advanced memory chips, crucial for next-generation AI models. While Samsung shares rose over 4%, SK Hynix saw an impressive jump of over 11%, reaching its highest since 2000. The broader Asian markets also showed gains, with Japan's Nikkei 225 advancing and Hong Kong's Hang Seng Index climbing, reflecting widespread optimism in the tech sector and a positive outlook on the global economy despite ongoing U.S. government shutdown concerns.

          <p>Raymond Cruz, known for his antagonist role in 'Breaking Bad,' will not face criminal charges following a car wash confrontation last month, prosecutors confirmed. The decision came after three women accused the actor of intentionally spraying them with water while he washed his car. Cruz's agent maintained that the actor had merely asked the women to move their vehicle a foot away to prevent them from getting wet, and any water splash was incidental as they began recording him. This outcome brings an end to the legal aspect of the dispute, which had seen Cruz held in police custody for five hours.</p>

          <p>Maxwell House coffee, a 133-year-old brand, launched a viral marketing campaign rebranding itself as "Maxwell Apartment Coffee" to humorously address the US housing affordability crisis. The ad campaign, designed by Rethink, highlights that housing has become so unaffordable that many cannot buy a house, promising the "same affordable coffee you love, now with an even more affordable name." This initiative aims to connect with coffee-loving renters, a growing demographic, by acknowledging the challenging economic realities faced by first-time homebuyers. The median age of first-time homebuyers hit an all-time high of 38 last year.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>A lawsuit against Nirvana, alleging that the iconic 'Nevermind' album cover featuring Spencer Elden as a naked four-month-old baby constituted child pornography, has been dismissed for a second time. Judge Fernando Olguin ruled that no reasonable jury would consider the image pornographic, likening it to a "family photo of a nude child bathing." Elden had initially sued in 2021, claiming sexual exploitation and ongoing personal harm, but the judge found his claims to be time-barred and without merit regarding the definition of child pornography. This decision frees the band's surviving members and photographer from the allegations.</p>

          <p>Tesla CEO Elon Musk has made history by becoming the first person to achieve a net worth exceeding $500 billion, briefly touching $500.1 billion before a slight dip. This unprecedented wealth milestone is attributed to the soaring valuations of his diverse ventures, including electric car company Tesla, AI startup xAI, and rocket company SpaceX. Musk's fortune is closely tied to his substantial stake in Tesla, which has seen its shares rise sharply this year as investors welcome his renewed focus on his companies. The achievement solidifies his position as the world's richest person, significantly ahead of rivals in the global tech sector, despite facing past criticisms over political involvement.

          <p>French asset manager Amundi, overseeing €2.3 trillion in assets, has largely reduced its exposure to China's September equity rally, reallocating holdings towards dividend stocks. This shift reflects lingering doubts about China's economic outlook and concerns that the market rally, driven by AI enthusiasm, has outpaced fundamental valuations. Philippe d’Orgeval, Amundi's deputy group chief investment officer, noted trimming "overvalued" Chinese stocks while selectively increasing onshore equity exposure over Hong Kong-listed shares due to valuation gaps. The firm remains open to rebuilding China exposure if macro conditions become more supportive, highlighting a cautious approach in the current uncertain environment. (not investment advice)</p>

The company is investigating this event, alongside a recent illegal U-turn in San Francisco that also went uncited due to the lack of a human driver. Waymo operates in five cities with plans for expansion, but experts like former NTSB chair Robert Sumwalt argue for higher safety standards before widespread adoption.</p>

          <p>Cleveland Browns rookie quarterback Shedeur Sanders adopted a unique silent protest during a press conference after fellow first-year QB Dillon Gabriel was promoted to the team's starting quarterback, bypassing Sanders. When questioned about remaining the No. 3 QB, Sanders smiled broadly and pantomimed answers without uttering a word, a response believed to be a reaction to critical remarks by analyst Rex Ryan regarding his backup status. Sanders, a former college star for his father Deion Sanders, was drafted in the fifth round after Gabriel, leading to the current depth chart situation.

She also clarifies that modern margarines are healthy, unlike older versions with trans fats, and can reduce bad cholesterol. Forouhi advises using basic olive oil for shallow frying and vegetable or sunflower oil for deep frying, as they withstand higher temperatures better than extra virgin olive oil.</p>
