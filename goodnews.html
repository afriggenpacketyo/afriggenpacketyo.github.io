          <div class="timestamp">2025-07-22 22:21:05 EDT</div>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Shares for major Japanese automakers, including Toyota, Honda, and Nissan, experienced a significant surge after it was reported that the U.S. would lower auto tariffs from 25% to 15%. This development provides substantial short-term relief for Japan's auto industry, a critical sector of its economy that had seen exports to the U.S. decline under the previous tariff structure. The move is part of a broader trade agreement announced by President Trump, which has been met with optimism in Japanese markets, reflecting relief from the recent economic pressure.

          <p>The Trump administration has announced a comprehensive trade deal with Japan, establishing a 15% reciprocal tariff on Japanese exports, including a significant reduction for automobiles. President Trump hailed the agreement as one of the largest ever, stating Japan will also invest $550 billion in the U.S. and open its markets to more American goods like agricultural products. This deal provides a significant boost to Japanese automakers and is seen as a political victory for Prime Minister Shigeru Ishiba, stabilizing trade relations that had been strained by tariff threats.

The win against 22-year-old Peyton Stearns was her first in nearly two years, following a significant period of inactivity due to surgery for uterine fibroids. Williams, a seven-time Grand Slam singles champion, displayed flashes of her classic form, backed by an enthusiastic crowd. Her performance marks a remarkable comeback and a testament to her enduring talent and resilience in the sport.</p>

The announcement with the Philippines came after a White House meeting with President Ferdinand Marcos Jr. These agreements are part of the administration's broader strategy to renegotiate trade relationships ahead of an August 1 deadline.
