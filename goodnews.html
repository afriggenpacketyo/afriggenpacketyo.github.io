This market rotation is driven by growing investor confidence that the Federal Reserve will cut interest rates in September.

          <p>The Port of Los Angeles processed a record-breaking volume of containers in July, a direct result of shippers front-loading goods to get ahead of Trump administration tariff deadlines. The port handled over one million twenty-foot equivalent units, the highest in its 117-year history, with imports also hitting an all-time high. However, industry experts note this early peak season has been uneven, with sectors like retail pulling back, and freight rates have dropped significantly from their June peak.

The article dismisses criticism as politically motivated and argues that ensuring public safety is a government's primary duty, an effort it claims most Americans will support.</p>

          <p>A recently passed budget bill has increased the flexibility of 529 college savings plans, making them a more powerful tool for funding education and career development. Originally designed for higher education, these tax-advantaged accounts can now be used for a wider range of expenses, including vocational programs, required continuing education courses, and professional licensing exams. This expansion aims to reduce parental concerns about unused funds and encourages early saving for a child's future. (not investment advice)</p>

This projection is slightly higher than the 2.5% increase received in the current year. The annual adjustment, designed to help benefits keep pace with inflation, is calculated based on third-quarter inflation data and officially announced in October. Some economists express concern that this modest increase may not be sufficient if inflation rises later in the year. (not investment advice)</p>

Companies like UnitedHealth Group and Eli Lilly posted notable advances, the latter boosted by a series of insider stock purchases following a recent selloff. This rotation comes as investors digest the earnings outlook from data center company CoreWeave, whose unchanged capital expenditure forecast may have tempered enthusiasm in the AI infrastructure space.

          <p>A new analysis of an Incan khipu, a record-keeping device made of knotted cords, suggests the practice may have been more widespread than previously believed. Researchers studying a khipu from around 1498 discovered its primary cord was made of human hair from a person who ate a commoner's diet, not that of the ruling elite. This finding challenges the assumption that only high-status individuals created these records, suggesting a broader literacy and a stronger connection between ancient and modern khipu traditions.</p>

The move comes as rising tariffs spark concerns about higher consumer prices, which Walmart's CFO has acknowledged the company cannot fully absorb.

Success depends on understanding legal rights, recognizing valid settlement offers, and navigating potential negative impacts on taxes and credit scores, areas where professional debt relief companies often provide crucial expertise.</p>
