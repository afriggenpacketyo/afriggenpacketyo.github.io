        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Nicusor Dan, a liberal and pro-EU mayor of Bucharest, secured the Romanian presidency after a politically turbulent period, defeating right-wing nationalist George Simion. Simion had initially won the first round, fueled by anger over the annulled presidential race due to alleged Russian interference. Dan's victory with 53.6% of the vote was celebrated by supporters who desire profound change in Romania, while Simion conceded defeat after initially claiming victory. Dan campaigned on fighting corruption and supporting Ukraine, contrasting with Simion's anti-EU stance and calls to cut aid to Kyiv. Relevant context: The Romanian government had recently collapsed due to its candidate failing to reach the second round, highlighting the country's political instability.</p>

          <p>Professor Benjamin Horton, an earth scientist at City University of Hong Kong, views China as a leader in climate science due to its significant investments in green technology, reforestation, and environmental research. Horton contrasts China's proactive environmental stance with other countries that are reducing their environmental efforts. He chose to work in China because of its status as a superpower that is committed to environmental issues. Horton's previous role was at the Earth Observatory of Singapore, where he studied earthquakes, volcanic eruptions, tsunamis, and climate change in Southeast Asia. The article highlights China's growing role in addressing global environmental challenges.</p>

          <h2>UK Energy Bills Expected to Decrease in July</h2>
          <div class="timestamp">2025-05-19 02:33:24 EDT</div>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Analysts at Cornwall Insight predict that domestic energy prices in the UK will decrease in July, reversing three consecutive increases in the regulator Ofgem's price cap. The annual bill for a typical household using gas and electricity is expected to fall by ¬£129, a drop of nearly 7%. This change would result in a typical annual bill of ¬£1,720 for a dual-fuel customer paying by direct debit. The price cap is based on the cost per unit of energy, meaning total bills still depend on usage.</p>

          <p>Conservationists in Wales are using edible glitter to track endangered water voles in an effort to save them from extinction. Water vole populations have declined by 90% in the past 30 years, prompting the need for innovative tracking methods. The glitter is mixed with apple chunks and fed to the voles, with the hope that it will appear in their droppings, allowing conservationists to monitor their movements and habitat use. This method aims to inform environmental adjustments, such as removing invasive conifers or fencing riverbanks, to support the voles' dispersal and survival.</p>

          <p>Palaeontologists are investigating a mass grave of thousands of Pachyrhinosaurus dinosaurs in Alberta, Canada, to determine the cause of their sudden death 72 million years ago. The site, known as the "River of Death," contains an exceptionally dense collection of bones, with up to 300 bones per square meter. Researchers believe the dinosaurs were migrating together when a catastrophic flash flood swept through the area, killing the herd. The study of these fossils provides valuable insights into dinosaur biology and the ancient ecosystem.</p>
