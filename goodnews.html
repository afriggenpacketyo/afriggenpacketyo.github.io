          <p>Sports broadcaster and cervical cancer survivor Erin Andrews is promoting a new campaign to encourage early cancer screenings after her own diagnosis in 2017 came as a shock despite having no symptoms. Andrews, who credits a routine check-up with saving her life, has partnered with Aflac for the "Check for Cancer" initiative to raise awareness and improve access to screenings. She emphasizes that early detection is crucial, especially as cancer rates are rising among younger Americans, and hopes the campaign will help instill proactive health habits in the public.</p>

          <p>A U.S. circuit court has issued a preliminary injunction blocking the Trump administration from using the 1798 Alien Enemies Act to rapidly deport Venezuelan nationals. The 2-1 decision rejected the administration's claim that a Venezuelan gang's presence constituted a "predatory incursion," a necessary condition for invoking the wartime statute. Legal advocates have hailed the ruling as a significant victory for the rule of law, marking a judicial check on the expansion of presidential power for immigration enforcement during peacetime.</p>

          <p>An analysis of current interest rates reveals a close competition between Certificates of Deposit (CDs) and high-yield savings accounts for maximizing returns on a $25,000 deposit. While a high-yield savings account might currently offer a slightly higher rate, its variable nature means returns could decrease with anticipated Fed rate cuts. In contrast, a CD locks in a fixed interest rate, providing guaranteed earnings over its term, which may make it a more secure option for savers in a cooling rate environment.

          <p>Stephen Miran, President Trump's nominee for a vacant Federal Reserve Governor position, has pledged to maintain the central bank's independence and adhere to its dual mandate of price stability and maximum employment. During his confirmation hearing, Miran, who has previously criticized the Fed's stimulus policies, stated that his decisions would be based on macroeconomic analysis and long-term stewardship. His nomination comes amid concerns that Trump aims to install figures who will push for lower interest rates, but Miran's testimony aimed to reassure senators of his commitment to non-political monetary policy.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Two decades after Hurricane Katrina devastated the Gulf Coast, long-term studies of survivors reveal a surprising psychological phenomenon known as post-traumatic growth. Researchers have found that while many individuals continue to suffer from PTSD and depression, a significant portion also report positive personal transformations, such as a greater appreciation for life, stronger relationships, and increased personal strength. Factors like social support and self-efficacy were identified as key predictors for this growth, offering important lessons for helping communities recover from future climate-related disasters.</p>

          <p>Pharmaceutical company Novo Nordisk anticipates U.S. approval for its daily oral obesity pill by the end of the year, with a planned launch in early 2026. The drug, an oral version of semaglutide, has shown weight loss results comparable to the company's popular Wegovy injection in late-stage trials. Company executives highlight the pill's strong efficacy and safety profile, suggesting it will provide a needle-free alternative for patients and potentially alleviate supply issues that have affected injectable weight loss treatments.</p>

          <p>Experts suggest that mortgage rates could begin to fall even before the Federal Reserve's expected interest rate cut on September 17. Because mortgage rates are influenced by, but not directly tied to, the Fed's policy, lenders often adjust their rates in anticipation of a formal change. With a rate reduction widely predicted, lenders may start offering lower rates to homebuyers and refinancers sooner, a pattern observed in previous rate-cutting cycles. (not investment advice)</p>

The article suggests strategies to supplement retirement income, such as using annuities for a predictable cash flow, considering a reverse mortgage, or delaying benefits to receive a larger monthly check.</p>
