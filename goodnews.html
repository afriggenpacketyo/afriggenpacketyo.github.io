          <p>Financial analysts are observing a shift away from the popular "VOO and chill" investment strategy, where investors passively buy ETFs that track the S&P 500. Experts argue that the index has become imbalanced, with the technology sector accounting for a record 35%, thereby reducing diversification for investors. As a result, traders are showing renewed interest in small-cap stocks, with the Russell 2000 index recently outperforming the S&P 500 and hitting an all-time high. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>Billionaire investor Mark Cuban advises that for the average person, one of the smartest financial moves is not complex stock picking but rather practical, bulk shopping for household consumables. He explains that saving 40% on $2,000 worth of annual necessities like toilet paper and toothpaste yields a guaranteed $800 return, which is often a better outcome than uncertain market investments. Cuban emphasizes that this strategy is only effective if purchases are made with cash, not credit, to avoid accumulating high-interest debt.</p>

          <p>A year after the largest dam removal project in U.S. history, the Klamath River is experiencing a remarkable recovery, with salmon returning to headwaters for the first time in a century and wildlife flourishing. To celebrate, a group of 28 Indigenous teenagers became the first to kayak the river's full 310-mile length, an event that inspired river advocates from around the world. The project's success is now serving as a powerful model for other Indigenous-led environmental restoration movements globally.</p>

          <p>A licensed therapist and child life specialist advises parents on how to say "no" to children in a way that builds connection rather than conflict. The key is to turn the boundary into a teachable moment by explaining the reasoning behind it and offering choices to give the child a sense of autonomy. Being consistent with limits is crucial, as it helps children feel safe and understand expectations, ultimately teaching them valuable skills like emotion regulation and self-control.</p>
