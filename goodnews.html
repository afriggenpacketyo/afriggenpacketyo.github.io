          <p>Kate Middleton's outfit at the Trooping the Colour, King Charles III's birthday parade, channeled the style of Princess Diana.  Her aqua blue Catherine Walker coat and Juliette Botterill hat, along with Queen Elizabeth II's pearl earrings, created a striking resemblance to Diana's 1988 Trooping the Colour look.  Middleton's prominent position alongside King Charles and Queen Camilla marked a significant moment in her royal journey.
