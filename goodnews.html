          <p>American Airlines CFO Devon May indicated that some travelers are opting for alternative airports like LaGuardia, JFK, or Philadelphia due to recent disruptions at Newark Liberty International Airport. The Federal Aviation Administration ordered airlines to temporarily reduce flights at Newark to alleviate congestion caused by air traffic controller shortages, equipment outages, and runway construction. Bad weather has further contributed to the disruptions, though May cautioned that the overall impact is modest.</p>

          <p>Bitcoin has surged to a new record high near $112,000, driven by increasing institutional ownership, corporate adoption, and optimism surrounding U.S. crypto regulation. Despite a recent drop in U.S. equities, bitcoin's price continues to climb, potentially indicating investors are seeking alternative stores of value. Pro-crypto policies from the Trump administration and advancements in crypto legislation, such as the Senate's move on stablecoin regulation, have also bolstered the market. JPMorgan CEO Jamie Dimon, previously a bitcoin skeptic, announced that the bank will allow clients to buy the digital currency. (not investment advice)</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>A study by the Peterson Institute for International Economics found that China's 2019 embargo on fentanyl and precursor chemicals led to a temporary increase in the drug's street price in the US, which reduced fentanyl-related overdose deaths by up to 25% over three to five months. Beijing's strict drug control policy, implemented in May 2019, added all fentanyl-related substances to its list of controlled substances, restricting their export. The study estimates that without China's restrictions, up to 947 more Americans would have died from a fentanyl overdose.</p>

          <p>A recent study published in JAMA Network Open found that breakfast cereals marketed toward children aged 5 to 12 have been getting sweeter, fattier, and less nutritious between 2010 and 2023. The study found that the total fat and sodium content increased, while protein and dietary fiber decreased. The researcher, Shuoli Zhao, suggests these findings contribute to the broader discussion about the overall 'food environment' that children are exposed to, as often times, working families may have limited 'bandwidth' and time on grocery shopping, which leads to unintended suboptimal decisions in food choices.</p>

          <p>The House passed a budget package that includes a provision to raise the tax deduction cap for state and local taxes (SALT) to $40,000 from the current $10,000 limit, which could provide tax savings for homeowners with high property taxes or significant state income tax liabilities. The $40,000 deduction would only be available to filers with household incomes below $500,000.

        </div>
        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>The ability of an annuity to provide a steady income stream for life depends on the type of annuity and the financial health of the insurer. Immediate and lifetime annuities are designed to guarantee income for life, while fixed-term annuities pay out for a set number of years and then stop. Variable and indexed annuities can be tied to investment performance, and their cash value could be depleted if the underlying investments perform poorly. Choosing a lifetime income annuity, diversifying retirement income, researching the insurance company, and monitoring withdrawal habits are strategies to protect against losing annuity payments.</p>
