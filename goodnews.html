        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Chris Brown appeared in Southwark Crown Court in London and pleaded not guilty to an assault charge stemming from an alleged bottle attack at a London nightclub two years prior, where he is accused of attempting to cause grievous bodily harm to music producer Abraham Diaw. Brown also faces charges of assault occasioning actual bodily harm and having an offensive weapon, which were added to his indictment. The judge adjourned arraignment on the additional counts, setting a further plea hearing date for July 11, 2025, with the trial scheduled for October 26, 2026. Brown was arrested last month in Manchester and released after paying a ¬£5m security fee, which allows him to travel for his tour dates while surrendering his passport when not needed.</p>

          <p>Archaeologists in London have discovered a significant collection of painted Roman wall plaster at "The Liberty" development site in Southwark. The fragments, discarded in a pit before A.D. 200, once adorned a high-status Roman building and offer insights into ancient Londinium's artistry and daily life. The reconstruction, led by Han Li at the Museum of London Archaeology (MOLA), reveals vibrant yellow panel designs with motifs of birds, fruit, flowers, and lyres. The findings include what appears to be the first known example of a painter's signature in Roman Britain and ancient graffiti, including a complete Greek alphabet.</p>

          <p>The Los Angeles Lakers are being sold for a record $10 billion to an investment group led by Mark Walter, signaling a shift in sports ownership. This sale illustrates that the best sports properties have become too valuable for individuals or families to control alone, with teams increasingly owned by consortiums of investors and institutions. The Lakers' new owners are expected to benefit from the team's strong market and loyal fanbase, similar to Walter's success with the Dodgers. This trend raises questions about accountability for teams not as successful, as large investor groups may be less visible and harder to hold responsible than individual owners.</p>

        </div>
        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>A new study from the Cornell Lab of Ornithology challenges the long-held acoustic transmission hypothesis, which posits that birds sing at dawn because sound travels farther and more clearly due to humid air and low wind. Researchers analyzed audio recordings of birds in the rainforest and found little evidence to support this theory. The study suggests that dawn singing may be more related to birds marking their territory after being inactive at night and communicating about food sources. While the study doesn't definitively identify the reason for the dawn chorus, it rules out environmental factors as the primary cause.</p>

          <p>Japan has been proactive in securing its rare earth supply chain, reducing its reliance on China from over 90% to below 60% after a 2010 export ban by Beijing. The country has invested heavily in non-China rare-earth projects, particularly Australia's Lynas, and is aiming to further decrease its dependence on Chinese imports to below 50% this year. This approach, including stockpiling, recycling, and promoting alternative technologies, serves as a model for Western nations seeking to diversify their critical mineral sources. China's recent export restrictions on rare earth elements highlight the importance of securing alternative supplies for industries like automotive and defense.</p>
