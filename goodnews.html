          <h2>China Reportedly Avoiding De-Dollarization Despite Trade Tensions with the US</h2>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>According to an Oxford Economics report, China has not significantly reduced its reliance on the U.S. dollar, despite trade tensions and a push to resist Washington's influence. The report suggests that China's export-oriented economy necessitates substantial dollar assets, and the country has few viable alternatives for its $3.2 trillion in foreign exchange reserves. Rather than selling U.S. assets, China is more likely to weaken its currency, the yuan, to support exporters during the trade war, making a disruptive sale of U.S. Treasury holdings unlikely.

          <p>Wales' First Minister Eluned Morgan has pledged to challenge the Labour government in Westminster if its policies harm Welsh communities, emphasizing that her priority is the nation and people of Wales before party allegiance. She cited the winter fuel allowance cuts and the need for Wales to benefit more from wind power via the Crown Estate as key areas of concern. Morgan also called for changes to the Barnett formula, which determines how Wales is funded, to better reflect the country's needs. She insisted that her stance was not a split but a form of grown-up modern government.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Michigan football head coach Sherrone Moore is expected to be suspended for two games next season due to allegations of failing to cooperate in the NCAA's investigation into the program's sign-stealing scandal during Jim Harbaugh's tenure. The suspension is anticipated during the Wolverines' third and fourth games of the season, and the program may also face a self-imposed sanction. The NCAA prohibits schools from sending scouts to opponents' games and using electronic devices to record other teams' signs. Before becoming head coach, Moore was accused of deleting text messages with Connor Stalions, a former staffer allegedly involved in the sign-stealing, though he has stated he is cooperating with the NCAA.</p>

        </div>
        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Consumers are seeing prices decrease for certain goods and services, including airfare, produce, household items, electronics, and gasoline, despite overall inflation not reaching policymakers' target. Analysts attribute these declines to idiosyncratic factors, such as seasonal supply-and-demand dynamics and increased efficiency in manufacturing consumer electronics. Lower diesel fuel costs have also contributed to reduced transportation expenses for produce, though tariffs threaten to reverse these trends. Economists caution that these lower prices may not be sustainable in the long term due to potential tariff impacts and market volatility. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>A new poll reveals that over 90% of Americans use federal science information weekly, including weather forecasts and job market reports, but only 10% are concerned about potential impacts from cuts to federal science funding. The Association of Science and Technology Centers conducted the poll to assess attitudes about science in the U.S., finding that Americans rely on federal data about weather, the economy, and the food supply. The poll also suggests bipartisan agreement on the importance of federal investment in STEM education for future economic prosperity.</p>

          <p>Southern California officials have found success in using sterile male mosquitoes to combat the invasive Aedes mosquito, which is responsible for spreading dengue fever. Vector control districts released thousands of sterile male mosquitoes, leading to significant reductions in mosquito populations in treated areas. Data from one district showed an 82% reduction in the Aedes aegypti mosquito population compared to a control area, and another district saw a 33% overall decrease in invasive mosquito counts. Despite the promising results, scaling the intervention to larger areas and securing funding remain challenges.</p>

          <p>This article discusses the ongoing debate surrounding diversity, equity, and inclusion (DEI) initiatives, noting that both supporters and detractors often misunderstand their true purpose. While conservatives raise concerns about free speech and meritocracy, the left can sometimes engage in virtue-signaling that demonizes flaws and blind spots. The author argues that DEI efforts, when thoughtfully implemented, can improve communication and create a more inclusive environment, but that many DEI efforts are performative at best. The author encourages a focus on tolerance and understanding different perspectives to avoid endless cultural conflict.</p>
