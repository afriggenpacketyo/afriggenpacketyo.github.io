          <p>China's box office is experiencing a slowdown during the Dragon Boat Festival holiday, with revenue lower than previous holidays, despite the popularity of the Hollywood film "Mission: Impossible ‚Äì The Final Reckoning." The industry is grappling with underwhelming performances and broader economic challenges affecting domestic consumption. Last year, China's box office revenue declined significantly, raising concerns about the market's long-term resilience. However, some observers remain optimistic, citing improvements in domestic productions as a potential driver for future growth. The film market is expected to rebound as Chinese productions improve in quality and continue to attract audiences. </p>

          <h2>McMigraine: TikTok "Cure" Examined</h2>

          <p>A viral TikTok trend suggesting that coke and fries can "cure" migraines is being examined for its validity. While there are medical treatments for migraines, there is no cure, and prescription medication does not always work. Experts suggest that caffeine in coke can disrupt nerve activity, and salt in fries may slow down an attack, but these effects are not specific to McDonald's. Neurologists warn against relying on fast food as a regular migraine management strategy and recommend listening to one's body and avoiding triggers.</p>

          <p>Ross Douthat discusses Donald Trump's political resilience, attributing it to his willingness to swerve, backpedal, and contradict himself. This flexibility allows him to reassure swing voters and maintain viability. Trump's recent recovery in poll numbers is linked to his backtracks on China tariffs and his complaints about Vladimir Putin. Voters appreciate Trump's pressure on institutions they distrust, but also expect him to accept counterpressure and retreat.</p>
