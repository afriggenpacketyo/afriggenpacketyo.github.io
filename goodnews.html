          <h2>Americans' Alcohol Consumption Declines Amid Health Concerns</h2>
          <div class="timestamp">2025-08-20 10:38:15 EDT</div>
        </div>
        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>A recent Gallup poll indicates a decline in alcohol consumption among U.S. adults, with only 54% reporting they drink alcohol, marking a record low. This shift is attributed to growing health concerns, especially among younger adults, who increasingly believe that even moderate drinking poses health risks. The trend aligns with updated federal dietary guidelines and a surge of information highlighting alcohol's negative health outcomes, including its link to cancer. Factors such as the desire for genuine social connections and the influence of social media also contribute to this changing perspective, with individuals prioritizing control over their image and long-term health. The data suggests a broader societal move away from the perception of alcohol as harmless, with younger generations leading the charge in recognizing its potential dangers. </p>

          <div class="timestamp">2025-08-20 10:37:17 EDT</div>
        </div>
        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>As inflation shows signs of recent upticks and interest rates remain elevated, many borrowers are experiencing stretched household budgets and higher loan costs. The potential for Federal Reserve rate cuts in the coming months may offer some relief, particularly for homeowners with home equity lines of credit (HELOCs), which typically have variable rates. HELOC interest rates are usually structured as the prime rate plus a margin, meaning that HELOC rates can and often do move with wider rate changes. Experts advise borrowers to understand their loan terms and proactively budget for rate swings in either direction, as well as consider paying down their principal or refinancing to manage HELOC debt effectively. </p>

          <p>Hurricane Erin is forecast to bring coastal flooding, strong winds, and life-threatening rip currents to the East Coast, prompting states of emergency and beach closures. North Carolina's Outer Banks are under tropical storm warnings and storm surge warnings, with possible severe flooding. High surf advisories are in effect from Florida to Massachusetts, with waves expected to reach significant heights. While the hurricane is not expected to make landfall in the U.S., officials are urging residents and visitors to heed warnings and avoid swimming due to dangerous conditions. The storm's center is projected to move over the western Atlantic between the U.S. East Coast and Bermuda. </p>

          <p>Intel is reportedly in discussions with large investors to secure additional equity infusions at a discounted price, following a $2 billion investment from SoftBank. This move comes as Intel faces declining sales and shrinking market share, struggling to capitalize on the artificial intelligence boom. The company is investing heavily in its manufacturing business, which has yet to attract significant customers. With the need for funds to build products that customers demand, Intel's leadership has also seen changes, with Lip-Bu Tan replacing Pat Gelsinger as CEO. The company's efforts to secure funding reflect its ongoing turnaround strategy. </p>

          <p>President Trump has claimed to have ended multiple wars since starting his second term, but BBC Verify examined these conflicts to determine the accuracy of his claims. While the Trump administration has listed several peace deals, some lasted only days, and the long-term viability of others is uncertain. Conflicts examined include those between Israel and Iran, Pakistan and India, Rwanda and the Democratic Republic of Congo, Thailand and Cambodia, Armenia and Azerbaijan, Egypt and Ethiopia, and Serbia and Kosovo. The analysis reveals varying degrees of U.S. involvement and the stability of the peace agreements, with some experts questioning whether the conflicts have truly ended. </p>

          <h2>Experts Predict Factors Influencing Mortgage Rates This Fall</h2>
          <div class="timestamp">2025-08-20 10:11:44 EDT</div>
        </div>
        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Experts suggest that several factors could significantly impact mortgage rates this fall, including the Federal Reserve's policy stance, inflation and labor data, investment activity, and broader geopolitical and economic changes. The Federal Reserve plays a key role through its commentary and projections, with mortgage rates tending to drop ahead of expected rate cuts. Inflation and unemployment data influence the Fed's decisions, while investment activity, particularly in mortgage-backed securities and Treasury bonds, also affects rates. Geopolitical uncertainty and broader economic conditions can also influence mortgage rates, leading experts to largely predict a slight fall in rates as the year progresses.
