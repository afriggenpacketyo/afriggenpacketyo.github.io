          <h2>Experts Say Emotionally Safe Parenting Is More Effective Than Other Styles</h2>
          <div class="timestamp">2025-05-25 13:36:51 EDT</div>
        </div>
        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>After studying over 200 kids, a child expert has concluded that "emotionally safe parenting" is the most effective style. This method prioritizes a deep understanding of a child's emotional needs and teaches parents to foster resilience, trust, and connection through open communication. Unlike other parenting styles, emotionally safe parenting focuses on emotional attunement, self-awareness, and inner healing. Emotionally safe parents accept their child's emotions, respond without shame, view misbehavior as a signal for support, and take responsibility after conflicts by apologizing and reconnecting.</p>

          <p>Tommy Paul secured a first-round victory at the French Open and celebrated regaining possession of his truck, which had been repossessed due to missed payments. Paul explained that he had changed banks and inadvertently failed to update his automatic payment settings, resulting in the repossession. He learned about the incident from his trainer and was able to retrieve the vehicle after resolving the payment issues, adding a humorous soundtrack of Celine Dion's "My Heart Will Go On" to footage of the tow.</p>

          <h2>Army Spouse Julie Moore Remembered for Changing Military Protocol</h2>

          <p>Julie Moore, an Army spouse, is remembered for her efforts to change military protocol regarding casualty notifications, ensuring that families receive personal support rather than telegrams. During the Vietnam War, Moore took it upon herself to comfort Army wives, working with the local Western Union office to provide support when telegrams arrived. Her advocacy led to the Army implementing a system where service members personally notify families and offer assistance. Moore's legacy endures, with service members now providing comfort and support to grieving families, and a base being renamed in her honor.</p>
