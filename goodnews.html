          <p>Carlos Vela, LAFC's first-ever player and record holder in multiple categories, has announced his retirement from professional soccer after 19 years. Vela will transition into a new role as LAFC's first Black and Gold Ambassador, and the club will honor him at a special event on September 21. During his time with LAFC, Vela led the team to the playoffs in his first season and set the MLS single-season goal-scoring record with 34 goals in 2019, earning him the league's MVP award. He also played on two MLS Cup teams and is one of only 13 players in MLS history to record at least 75 goals and 50 assists.</p>

          <p>Arne Slot, Liverpool's new boss, expressed gratitude to the football community for their support following an incident at Liverpool's title parade. Slot received the Sir Alex Ferguson Trophy and Premier League Manager of the Year award at the League Managers Association (LMA) awards. Due to the incident where a car rammed into crowds in Liverpool, injuring about 50 people, Slot withdrew from the event in solidarity with those affected. Slot signed only one player - forward Federico Chiesa - but still delivered Liverpool's second Premier League title, winning the league by 10 points from Arsenal.</p>

          <p>Tens of thousands of energy customers are set to receive payouts, potentially reaching ¬£1,000, and may have debts written off due to the forced fitting of prepayment meters. Energy companies will distribute over ¬£70m in compensation and support following a review by Ofgem, which found suppliers switched vulnerable customers to prepayment methods without their consent. Eligible customers will receive payments ranging from ¬£40 to ¬£500, with ¬£1,000 payments for "inappropriate installations." The scandal emerged during the cost of living crisis when energy firms switched struggling customers to prepayment methods, leading to public outcry, especially after British Gas agents forced entry into homes.</p>

          <p>Kelly Wakefield, a gardener in St. Albans, Vermont, stumbled upon a metal box containing coins, antiques, a Civil War-era bullet, a map, and a note, which turned out to be a hidden treasure. The treasure was intentionally hidden by Michael Cloherty O‚ÄôConnell, author of history books that lead readers on scavenger hunts around the Northeast. O'Connell created the treasure hunts to engage readers with American history, inspired by other authors who created similar challenges. Wakefield is now planning to go treasure hunting herself after her unexpected discovery.</p>

          <p>A federal judge struck down an executive order from President Trump that sought to sanction the law firm WilmerHale, deeming it unconstitutional. This marks the third time this month a judge has rejected Trump's law firm executive orders. The order against WilmerHale cited the firm's previous employment of former special counsel Robert Mueller, who led an investigation into potential ties between Russia and Trump's 2016 campaign. The ruling underscores the importance of an independent judiciary and bar willing to tackle unpopular cases.</p>

          <p>Puffin populations are thriving on Skomer Island off the Pembrokeshire coast, with a record 43,626 birds counted this year, while global populations are declining. The island's isolation protects the birds from predators and human impact, contributing to its success. Conservationists believe the abundance of food and lack of predators are key factors in the puffins' thriving population. The Wildlife Trust of South and West Wales manages the island and monitors its internationally important seabird populations, including manx shearwaters, guillemots, and razorbills.</p>

          <p>United Airlines is narrowing its check-in window for US flights, effective June 3, requiring passengers with carry-on bags only to check in 45 minutes before departure, aligning with the deadline for those checking luggage. This change aims to provide greater consistency for customers and aligns with policies of other airlines. While most major U.S. carriers offer online check-in systems, the check-in cutoff remains an important step for confirming bookings and issuing boarding passes. Requirements may vary by airline and airport, with international flights typically having earlier deadlines.</p>
