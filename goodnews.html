          <p>Tens of thousands of LGBTQ+ supporters and allies participated in the annual Budapest Pride march, defying a police ban recently enabled by controversial legislation from Prime Minister Viktor Orban's government. Organizers reported a record turnout, framing the event as a broader protest for civil liberties in Hungary. The city's mayor circumvented the national ban by declaring the parade a municipal event, and the march received significant support from numerous international embassies and EU officials, highlighting growing tensions between Hungary and the European Union over democratic values.</p>

          <p>Indian cricketer Smriti Mandhana scored a remarkable maiden T20 international century, leading her team to a 97-run victory over England at Trent Bridge. Mandhana's explosive 112 runs from 62 balls propelled India to a total of 210-5, the second-highest score ever conceded by England in the format. England's batting lineup struggled in response, collapsing to 113 all out, with debutante spinner Shree Charani taking four wickets. The decisive win gives India a strong start in the five-match series and marks England's heaviest T20 defeat by runs.</p>

          <p>The J.M. Smucker Co. has announced its plan to remove all artificial colors from its product lineup by the end of 2027, including from foods supplied to K-12 schools. While many of its popular items like Uncrustables are already free of synthetic dyes, the change will affect certain products such as sugar-free jams and ice cream toppings, as well as items from its recently acquired Hostess brand. This move aligns Smucker with other major food corporations like Nestle and Kraft Heinz, which have also pledged to phase out synthetic dyes amid increased regulatory scrutiny.</p>

          <p>The British and Irish Lions rugby team started their Australian tour with a decisive 50-point victory over the Western Force in Perth, scoring eight tries. However, the win was tempered by an injury to Welsh scrum-half Tomos Williams, who left the field with a tight hamstring, raising concerns about team depth in that key position. Head coach Andy Farrell praised the team's attacking flair, particularly fly-half Finn Russell's creative play, but noted a high penalty count in the first half that needs to be addressed as the tour continues.</p>

          <p>A car dealer at the Stephen Wade Auto Center in Utah successfully foiled a major auto theft scheme by identifying a fraudulent Vehicle Identification Number (VIN) on a pickup truck.

          <p>A real estate agent with a decade of experience suggests homebuyers use the "80-10-10 Rule" to determine if a property is the right fit. This guideline proposes that an ideal house should have 80% of the features a buyer loves and cannot change, like location and size. Another 10% should consist of elements that can be improved over time, such as cosmetic fixtures or paint. The final 10% represents aspects that are not ideal but are livable, ensuring buyers don't get sidetracked by minor imperfections.</p>
