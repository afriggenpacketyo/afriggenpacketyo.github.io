          <p>President Trump's Middle East trip has resulted in multibillion-dollar technology investments from Saudi Arabia and the United Arab Emirates. American chip giants Nvidia and AMD will now be allowed to sell advanced chips to customers in these countries, supporting their ambitions to become AI powerhouses. Venture capitalists David Sacks and Sriram Krishnan, serving as Trump's AI advisors, played key roles in negotiating these deals. However, the agreements have faced scrutiny from security hawks concerned about potential technology transfer to China, leading some Trump officials to consider pausing the deals.</p>

          <p>A rare clue at a 1993 Minneapolis crime scene, bloody bare footprints, ultimately led to the conviction of Jeanie Childs' killer decades later. Investigators initially focused on Arthur Gray, Childs' roommate, but his alibi and footprint analysis cleared him. In 2015, DNA testing revealed an unknown profile, leading to Jerry Westrom through investigative genetic genealogy. Westrom's DNA and footprints matched those found at the scene, resulting in his arrest and subsequent conviction for the murder of Childs.</p>
