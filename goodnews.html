          <div class="timestamp">2025-10-06 10:53:45 EDT</div>
        </div>
        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Over the past year, Nike has significantly increased prices on its footwear, apparel, and equipment, with some categories seeing double-digit percentage hikes. This pricing strategy is part of new CEO Elliott Hill's turnaround plan, aimed at restoring profitability after a sharp sales decline. The increases also coincide with rising tariffs on goods manufactured in Asia, which the company expects to cost it $1.5 billion this fiscal year. While analysts note the company is leveraging its pricing power, some experts question if the price hikes are excessive relative to the actual impact of tariffs.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Despite a recent dip to a three-year low, mortgage interest rates have slightly increased, currently sitting at 6.34% for a 30-year fixed-rate loan. Home lending experts predict that rates will likely remain stable throughout October, as the market has already priced in the anticipation of another potential rate cut by the Federal Reserve. Factors such as inflation data and employment trends are creating a cloudy economic outlook, leading to a reactive market. Prospective homebuyers are advised that significant fluctuations are not expected in the immediate future. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>Shares of Firefly Aerospace surged by 9% following the announcement that it will acquire defense technology contractor SciTec for $855 million in a cash-and-stock deal. The acquisition is aimed at strengthening Firefly's national security offerings by integrating SciTec's software capabilities, particularly in missile warning and tracking. This move comes after a recent rocket explosion during a ground test caused the company's stock to sink. The acquisition of SciTec, which will operate as a subsidiary, is expected to close by the end of the year.</p>

        </div>
        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Financial experts are advising that President Trump's tax legislation could impact strategies for year-end charitable giving. Starting in 2026, a new tax break will be available for non-itemizers, potentially making it advantageous to delay smaller donations until the new year. Conversely, higher earners may see their charitable deduction benefits shrink in 2026 due to a new deduction floor and a cap for top earners. This creates an incentive for some to accelerate their giving, possibly through tools like donor-advised funds, to maximize their tax benefits before the changes take effect.</p>

Shoppers are expected to be highly focused on seeking discounts, with mobile devices anticipated to drive the majority of online sales for the first time.

          <p>The U.S. Supreme Court has rejected an appeal from Ghislaine Maxwell, who is currently serving a 20-year prison sentence for her role in Jeffrey Epstein's sexual abuse of underage girls. Maxwell's lawyers had argued that her conviction was invalid due to a 2008 non-prosecution agreement Epstein made with federal prosecutors in Florida, which they claimed extended to his co-conspirators. With the high court declining to hear the case, Maxwell's legal options are nearly exhausted, leaving a presidential pardon as one of her few remaining hopes for an early release.</p>

As part of the agreement, AMD has issued OpenAI a warrant for up to 160 million shares, which could result in OpenAI owning approximately 10% of AMD.

Jones warned that while the greatest gains often occur in the final 12 months of a bull market, investors must be nimble to avoid the inevitable painful correction.

The 2019 law, which imposed heavy fines on officers who enforced federal regulations without a state equivalent, had been blocked by lower courts. Those courts ruled that the state law violated the U.S. Constitution's Supremacy Clause, which establishes that federal law takes precedence over state laws.
