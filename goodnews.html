          <p>Shares for the buy-now, pay-later company Affirm surged by 12% following the release of its fiscal fourth-quarter results, which greatly surpassed Wall Street's expectations. The company reported strong earnings and a 33% year-over-year revenue increase to $876 million, indicating robust consumer spending and transaction frequency. CEO Max Levchin expressed confidence in the company's performance and its ability to manage loan repayments, dismissing concerns about competition. The impressive growth was bolstered by key partnerships with major retailers like Shopify and Amazon, as well as the increased adoption of the Affirm Card for in-store purchases.

          <p>California Governor Gavin Newsom, legislative leaders, and rideshare companies Uber and Lyft have announced a landmark deal on legislation that would permit drivers to unionize while maintaining their status as independent contractors. This compromise involves advancing a bill that grants collective bargaining rights to hundreds of thousands of drivers, a key goal for labor unions. In exchange, a separate bill backed by Uber and Lyft will also move forward, which significantly reduces the insurance coverage the companies are required to carry. The agreement marks a major breakthrough in the long-running conflict between labor advocates and gig economy companies over worker classification and rights in the state.</p>

In separate business news, Home Depot received its final regulatory approval from Canada's Competition Bureau for its $4.3 billion acquisition of GMS Inc.

          <p>A federal appeals court has blocked the Trump administration's attempt to terminate Temporary Protected Status (TPS) for approximately 600,000 people from Venezuela currently living and working in the U.S. The Ninth U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals upheld a lower court's ruling, finding that the Department of Homeland Security likely overstepped its authority by trying to end the protections. The court stated that Congress designed the TPS system to be predictable and insulated from political shifts. This decision maintains the legal status for Venezuelans who fled their country due to political unrest, mass unemployment, and a prolonged humanitarian crisis.</p>

          <h2>South Korean President's First Summit with Trump Seen as a Cautious Success</h2>

          <p>South Korean President Lee Jae Myung's first summit with President Trump has been viewed as a positive initial step, marked by friendly exchanges and personal rapport. President Lee's careful preparation, which included studying Trump's book "The Art of the Deal," appeared to successfully avoid potential conflict over trade and defense issues. However, analysts caution that it is too early to declare a definitive win, as several key issues remain unresolved. Details of a recent trade deal have yet to be formalized, and disagreements persist over a major South Korean investment fund and the contentious issue of defense cost-sharing for U.S. troops stationed in the country.</p>

          <h2>A Guide to Qualifying for Various Debt Relief Options</h2>
          <div class="timestamp">2025-08-29 12:29:47 EDT</div>
        </div>
        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>With U.S. credit card debt surpassing $1.2 trillion, many consumers are seeking debt relief solutions to manage their financial burdens. Qualifying for these programs depends on the specific type of relief being pursued and an individual's financial situation. Options like traditional debt consolidation loans often require a good credit score, while debt consolidation programs run by relief companies may have more flexible requirements. For those facing severe financial hardship, debt forgiveness programs can negotiate a reduction in the total amount owed. Other avenues include debt management plans from credit counseling agencies, temporary forbearance from card issuers, and, in extreme cases, bankruptcy. (not investment advice)</p>

          <h2>Increasing Number of Legacy Trophy Ranches Are Being Sold by Heirs</h2>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>A growing trend is seeing multigenerational, high-end "trophy" ranches being put on the market as heirs opt to sell rather than manage the vast properties. Brokers report a significant increase in listings for these legacy ranches, some of which have been in the same family for over a century and are now available for the first time. The demand for these sprawling properties remains strong, partly fueled by the "Yellowstone" effect, with wealthy buyers seeking privacy and a connection to nature. Disagreements among scattered family members and a lack of interest from younger generations in the ranching lifestyle are key drivers behind these sales.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>YouTube and Fox have successfully negotiated a new distribution agreement, ensuring that Fox channels like Fox News and Fox Sports will remain available on the YouTube TV streaming platform. The deal was reached after a short-term extension prevented a potential blackout that could have occurred amid contentious negotiations. YouTube had previously stated that Fox was demanding significantly higher fees than comparable partners. The resolution means YouTube TV's 9.4 million subscribers will not miss out on major sporting events, including the upcoming college football season and the NFL, which are broadcast on Fox Sports.</p>

          <p>North Korean leader Kim Jong Un is set to visit China to attend a military parade, marking his first gathering with foreign leaders and a rare event featuring the heads of North Korea, Russia, and China together. The parade commemorates the end of World War II, an event China's Foreign Ministry frames as a victory over "Japanese aggression." This visit is seen as a significant move to mend relations between China and North Korea, especially as Kim has recently strengthened ties with Russia. Analysts suggest Kim may be recalibrating his diplomatic position, potentially anticipating reduced leverage with Moscow and considering future engagement with the United States.</p>

          <p>The American Gaming Association estimates that Americans will legally wager a record $30 billion on the upcoming NFL season, an 8.5% increase from last year. As the season begins, major sportsbooks like FanDuel and DraftKings are preparing for a surge in customer activity. However, the legal market faces significant competition from unlicensed offshore betting sites, which are estimated to cost states billions in tax revenue. In response, law enforcement is increasing its efforts to crack down on these illegal operations, with prosecutors filing lawsuits and attorneys general urging the Justice Department to step up enforcement.
