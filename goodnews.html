          <p>John Edward Bruce, a prominent Black journalist and Pan-Africanist pioneer born into slavery, will finally receive a headstone at his unmarked grave in Yonkers, New York. Known as "Bruce Grit," he founded several newspapers and was a leading voice in the late 19th and early 20th centuries, but died without the funds for a proper grave marker in 1924. A century later, a coalition of private and public donors, organized by the urban think tank RiseUp, has funded a black granite headstone to honor his legacy. The effort aims to rectify a historical oversight and celebrate a figure who dedicated his life to preserving and acknowledging Black history and culture.</p>

          <p>Following a federal appellate court order, U.S. border agents have been directed to stop summarily deporting migrants under a sweeping asylum ban instituted by the Trump administration. The policy had allowed for the rapid removal of individuals entering the country illegally without an opportunity to claim asylum. The court ruled that while the government can pause access to the asylum system, it cannot ignore other laws protecting migrants from being returned to places where they face torture or persecution. This effectively reopens humanitarian protection screenings, though officials will likely process migrants under expedited removal, which still allows for asylum claims, and continue to limit releases into the U.S. interior.</p>

          <p>Joshua Taylor, a Michigan resident living with a genetic condition that causes incontinence, is leading a campaign to make adult changing tables a standard feature in public spaces. Taylor highlights that teenagers and adults with disabilities often face the indignity of being changed on restroom floors or in cars, or are forced to stay home to avoid such situations. He argues that these facilities are a necessary accommodation, not a mere convenience, for millions of people. Working with the national organization Changing Spaces USA and local officials, Taylor is successfully advocating for the installation of these tables to improve accessibility and allow individuals with disabilities to participate more fully in community life.</p>

          <p>According to CNBC's Jim Cramer, the stock market's recent rebound is primarily due to the strong earnings reports from the "Magnificent Seven" technology companies, including Microsoft, Meta, and Alphabet. He argued that despite a weaker-than-expected labor report and concerns over new tariffs, the financial strength of these tech giants is propping up the market. Cramer highlighted impressive growth in areas like Microsoft's Azure cloud division and broad success across Google's search and AI ventures. He suggested that these cash-rich, diversified companies are proving to be a bulwark against wider economic uncertainty, demonstrating a resilience that investors are rewarding.

          <p>The United Kingdom has enacted tighter controls on firearms licensing, a move praised as hopeful by Emma Ambler, who has campaigned for reform since her twin sister and two nieces were murdered in 2020. The killer, her sister's partner, used a legally held shotgun after lying on his application about his mental health history. The new rules, which came into effect on August 5, require two character references for shotgun applications instead of one and mandate that police interview partners and household members to check for signs of domestic abuse or other risk factors. The changes aim to prevent unsuitable individuals from accessing firearms.</p>

          <p>Dr. Lisa Carchedi, a psychiatrist in Maryland, donated a kidney to her older sister, Gina Warsaw, providing a life-saving second chance. The transplant, which took place on the anniversary of their father's death, has brought the sisters even closer. Warsaw had been suffering from kidney failure, and Carchedi was found to be a perfect match. The kidney was removed using a minimally invasive, single-port robotic technique at the University of Maryland Medical Center, which reduces scarring and recovery time for the donor. Both sisters are recovering well, and the family is celebrating the profound act of love that has transformed their lives.</p>

The actor also reflects on discovering his genetic predisposition for Alzheimer's disease, which he says has motivated him to prioritize his health. While exploring concepts like biohacking, Hemsworth emphasizes a balanced approach, stating his goal is to enjoy life rather than adhere to an extreme regimen, and to embrace the finite nature of human existence.</p>

          <p>California Attorney General Rob Bonta announced that his office has spent over $5 million in the last six months fighting the Trump administration in court, resulting in savings of nearly $170 billion for the state. Bonta claimed a return of $33,600 for every dollar of special funding invested, primarily from successfully blocking a freeze on federal funds. His office has filed 37 lawsuits and numerous legal briefs challenging administration policies on healthcare, education, and the environment. Governor Gavin Newsom praised the results and assured Bonta that his office will continue to receive the necessary resources to counter federal actions perceived as harmful to the state.

          <p>The Chinese province of Hainan is positioning itself to become a major medical tourism hub, with plans to attract over 1.5 million domestic patients annually by 2027. This initiative coincides with South Korea's decision to remove value-added tax refunds for foreign tourists seeking cosmetic surgery, potentially diminishing its appeal. Hainan's strategy includes accelerating the approval of innovative international drugs and medical devices for use within its special medical tourism zone. In the first quarter of 2025, the zone already saw a nearly 30% year-on-year increase in visitors seeking treatment, indicating strong initial momentum for the region's ambitions in the healthcare sector.</p>

          <div class="timestamp">2025-08-04 19:00:10 EDT</div>
        </div>
        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>New guidance from the UK's National Institute for Health and Care Excellence (NICE) advises that patients stopping obesity drugs like Wegovy and Mounjaro should receive structured support for at least a year. Studies show that many people regain a significant portion of the weight they lost after discontinuing the treatments. The advice emphasizes that weight management is a long-term process and recommends that patients develop sustainable behavioral habits, such as healthy eating and exercise, to maintain their weight loss. With an estimated 1.5 million people in the UK using these jabs, mostly through private purchase, the guidance aims to improve long-term outcomes for those treated within the NHS.</p>
