        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Abercrombie & Fitch reported a slowdown in its namesake brand's sales growth for the fiscal second quarter, with sales falling 5% and comparable sales down 11%. However, the company's overall performance was bolstered by a significant 19% growth in its teen-focused Hollister brand, leading to a 7% increase in total sales. The retailer exceeded Wall Street's expectations for revenue and earnings, subsequently raising its full-year revenue outlook to 5% to 7% growth. Despite tariff costs and a weaker profit outlook for the current quarter, Abercrombie remains confident in its growth trajectory, leveraging new categories and partnerships like the NFL.

          <p>China significantly increased its Belt and Road Initiative (BRI) funding in the first half of 2025, with investments and construction contracts totaling $124 billion, surpassing the entire previous year's sum. This surge marks a strategic shift, as funding in Europe, East Asia, and the Middle East has decreased. Kazakhstan emerged as the primary recipient, securing $23 billion, including a major $12 billion aluminum complex project. This move is attributed to China's internal economic pressures and evolving global trade dynamics, highlighting a renewed emphasis on Central Asian partnerships within the BRI framework.</p>

          <p>A federal judge is soon expected to rule on Google's lucrative default search contracts, potentially jeopardizing over $26 billion annually, with a significant portion going to Apple. While this ruling could impact Google's search traffic and revenue predictability, some analysts believe it might ultimately benefit the company by freeing it from costly deals and allowing greater investment in AI. Google's dominance in search remains strong, even in markets where default choices were mandated, suggesting its core appeal persists. The Justice Department is also pushing for restrictions on AI distribution deals and data-sharing mandates, aiming to foster competition and innovation in the evolving tech landscape.

This partnership follows American Eagle's previous successful collaboration with actress Sydney Sweeney. The company aims to leverage celebrity endorsements to boost sales and maintain relevance in a competitive retail landscape, with the stock already up about 20% since mid-July.

The company narrowed its full-year sales guidance and revised its earnings per share outlook upwards. Interim CEO Michael Bender attributed the sales slowdown to lower and middle-income customers trading down but outlined strategies to win back shoppers, including reintroducing petite sections, adding jewelry, and overhauling discount policies. Kohl's also reported improved sales trends throughout the quarter, with July's comparable sales matching the previous year, and noted the success of its Sephora shops in attracting new customers.

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>The German cabinet has approved a new bill to significantly increase the Bundeswehr's active soldier count to 260,000 by the early 2030s, up from 183,000, and double reservists to 200,000. While military service remains voluntary, the law mandates an assessment questionnaire for all 18-year-old men, with medical examinations becoming obligatory from July 2027. The plan aims to address chronic under-recruitment and new NATO commitments, offering increased salaries, free accommodation, healthcare, and travel to recruits. Despite conservative skepticism about meeting targets, Defense Minister Boris Pistorius views it as a major step forward, acknowledging the need for infrastructure rebuilding if conscription were to be reinstated.</p>

          <p>Shares of Canada Goose rose nearly 15% following reports that its controlling shareholder, private equity firm Bain Capital, has received bids to take the winter-clothing maker private. Boyu Capital and Advent International have reportedly made verbal offers, valuing the company at approximately $1.35 billion, which is eight times its 12-month average earnings before interest, taxes, depreciation, and amortization. Bain Capital, advised by Goldman Sachs, is awaiting further offers before making a decision. This potential deal represents a significant return for Bain, which took control in 2013, and could lead to a private ownership structure for the Toronto-listed company. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>Recent significant overhauls to the federal student loan system have made it challenging for borrowers to obtain accurate information from the Department of Education or their loan servicers.

Experts recommend contacting the Federal Student Aid Information Center or their specific loan servicer, ideally early on weekday mornings, and suggest utilizing online chat options.

Wood plans to play one or two County Championship matches for Durham in September and will join an early bowling camp in Perth to acclimatize for the series beginning in November.</p>
