          <p>Trent Alexander-Arnold is set to join Real Madrid on June 1 after Liverpool accepted a transfer fee for the defender's early release from his contract. The agreed payment, reportedly around 10 million euros, allows the 26-year-old England right-back to participate in the Club World Cup. Alexander-Arnold has agreed to a six-year deal with Real Madrid, which includes a 1 billion euro buy-out clause. Shortly after this move, Liverpool finalized the signing of Jeremie Frimpong from Bayer Leverkusen for 35 million euros, filling the gap left by Alexander-Arnold's departure. The move signifies a strategic shift for both clubs as they prepare for upcoming competitions. The team is looking to fortify their defense. The optimism score is a 90.</p>
