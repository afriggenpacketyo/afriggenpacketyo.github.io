        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Following a temporary trade deal between the U.S. and China, retailers and logistics firms anticipate a surge in freight shipments. While tariffs are reduced from 145% to 30%, importers are expected to frontload orders due to uncertainty beyond the 90-day pause, potentially causing container rates to skyrocket. Some businesses had shipments stuck in bonded warehouses due to previous high tariffs, incurring storage costs. The unpredictability of trade policy makes it difficult for businesses to forecast and plan, and higher freight rates may lead to increased prices for consumers. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>The European Commission is analyzing the trade deal between the United States and Britain for implications for the European Union and global trade. The United States and Britain announced a deal to lower tariffs on some goods, with the U.S. cutting levies on cars and steel, and both sides gaining better access to agriculture markets. The EU is in negotiations with Washington on its own trade deal that would replace 20% across the board tariffs on most EU goods and 25% tariffs on steel, aluminium and cars and car parts.</p>

          <p>The White House is working to adopt policies to allow Americans to have more babies, even as it cuts back on federally funded day care. That‚Äôs because they want a stronger family unit, which they argue comes from one parent staying home. Ideas being discussed include giving families more money for each child they have, removing federal tax credits for day care, and opening up federal lands for home construction.</p>

          <p>The United States and China have agreed to temporarily reduce tariffs, signaling a step to defuse their trade war. The Trump administration backed off from its steepest tariffs after facing economic strain. The agreement will suspend tariffs for 90 days and continue negotiations. The United States would reduce the tariff on Chinese imports to 30 percent from its current 145 percent, while China would lower its import duty on American goods to 10 percent from 125 percent.</p>
