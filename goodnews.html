          <p>A man in Byneset, Norway, awoke to find a large container ship had run aground and crashed into his front garden, narrowly missing his house. The 135-meter Cypriot-flagged cargo ship, NCL Salten, carrying 16 people, veered off course in the Trondheim Fjord and ended up meters from Johan Helberg's bedroom window. No injuries were reported, and authorities are investigating the cause of the incident. The ship had previously run aground in 2023, but managed to free itself.</p>

          <p>Energy regulator Ofgem has announced that energy bills in the UK will fall by 7% in July, marking the first decrease in a year. This translates to an annual saving of ¬£129 for a typical household, bringing the average bill down to ¬£1,720. While charities welcome the reduction, they emphasize that many families are still burdened by significant energy debt. The regulator suggests that switching to a fixed deal could offer further savings, though this option may not be available to those with existing debt. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>An investigation is underway following the collapse of a roof at the Fengyang Drum Tower, a tourist site in central China, after recent renovations. The incident, which occurred on Monday evening, prompted questions about the quality of the repair work. The tower, originally built in 1375, underwent extensive repairs in 1995 and further renovations in 2023. Allegations have surfaced that the contractor illegally subcontracted renovations to unqualified personnel.</p>

          <p>Jussie Smollett has agreed to donate $50,000 to a Chicago charity to settle a lawsuit filed by the city, seeking restitution for the cost of investigating his claims of being a hate crime victim. Smollett's conviction for staging a racist and homophobic hate crime against himself was overturned by the Illinois Supreme Court. The donation will be made to Building Brighter Futures Center for the Arts, an organization that provides opportunities for Chicago's underprivileged youth. The city believes the settlement is a fair resolution.</p>
