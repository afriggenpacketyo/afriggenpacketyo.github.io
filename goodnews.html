          <p>Indiana Fever's star rookie, Caitlin Clark, is expected to return to the court for Wednesday's game against the Golden State Valkyries after missing five games. Head coach Stephanie White indicated Clark should be available if she experiences no setbacks following recent practices. Clark expressed excitement about rejoining her teammates, though her exact playing time remains undecided, with Clark hoping for significant minutes. The Fever have managed a 3-2 record during her absence, showing improved defensive energy and ball movement.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>The Transportation Security Administration has officially ended its mandatory shoe removal policy for travelers at all domestic U.S. airports, a rule that has been in place since 2006. Homeland Security Secretary Kristi Noem announced the change, which was implemented to streamline the security process while maintaining safety standards with improved technology. While the change is expected to shorten security lines, TSA officers retain the discretion to request shoe removal for additional screening. The policy shift had already been phased in at several airports prior to the official nationwide announcement.</p>

          <p>Amazon founder Jeff Bezos recently sold nearly three million shares of Amazon stock, valued at approximately $665.8 million, over a two-day period in July. This transaction is part of a pre-announced plan to sell up to 25 million shares by May 2026. Bezos, who remains Amazon's largest shareholder and chairman, also sold over $736 million in stock in late June. The sale comes shortly after his high-profile wedding in Venice, and he still holds over 900 million shares in the company he founded.</p>

          <p>Researchers have discovered the severed bow of the USS New Orleans, a famed U.S. warship, resting deep in the Solomon Islands' Iron Bottom Sound. The bow was torn off by a Japanese torpedo during the Battle of Tassafaronga in November 1942, an attack that killed over 180 crew members. Despite the catastrophic damage, the crew heroically managed to save the ship, which was later fitted with a new bow and returned to service. The discovery was made using advanced seafloor mapping technology and confirmed by a global team of experts, offering a poignant reminder of the crew's sacrifice and resilience.</p>

Her sudden arrest in June from her New Orleans home, which came a day after U.S. airstrikes on Iran, sparked a community outcry and a letter-writing campaign. The efforts drew the attention of House Majority Leader Steve Scalise, who intervened on her behalf. Kashanian, who has no criminal record and a U.S. citizen husband and daughter, had been allowed to stay in the country for decades under court supervision prior to her unexpected detention.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>With a Federal Reserve meeting approaching at the end of July, savers are being advised to strategically manage their certificate of deposit (CD) accounts before potential interest rate changes. Key recommendations include carefully calculating deposit amounts and term lengths to avoid early withdrawal penalties and shopping at online banks, which often offer higher rates. Once a high-rate CD is found, experts urge savers to lock in the rate promptly, as comments from the Fed could shift the rate climate even if no immediate cut occurs. This proactive approach allows individuals to maximize earnings while current CD rates remain relatively high. (not investment advice)</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>The new "Superman" movie, directed by James Gunn, reboots the iconic hero with a pop-punk sensibility that is entertaining but ultimately feels shallow. David Corenswet's Superman is portrayed as impulsive and somewhat dim-witted, a stark contrast to the traditional earnest hero, which makes it difficult for his personality to shine. The film is packed with entertaining side characters and chaotic action sequences, but it struggles with sincerity and a consistent tone. While the plot involves Lex Luthor's schemes and introduces other heroes, the central character comes off as an overwhelmed figure in a movie that seems unsure how to handle earnestness.</p>

          <div class="timestamp">2025-07-08 15:14:50 EDT</div>
        </div>
        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>The new "Superman" film from director James Gunn offers a brilliant and consciously sincere take on the character by surrounding him with other super-powered individuals. This approach, a departure from previous films where Superman is unique, helps to define his exceptionalism through his steadfast, regular-guy altruism rather than just his powers. David Corenswet's portrayal is earnest and grounded, and the film embraces a lighthearted, whimsical tone reminiscent of Saturday-morning cartoons. By building modern society's skepticism of inherent goodness into the plot, the movie successfully makes a case for why this classic, corny hero is still relevant and necessary today.</p>
