          <h2>An Excerpt from Ron Chernow's New Biography on Mark Twain</h2>
          <div class="timestamp">2025-07-05 14:56:48 EDT</div>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>A new biography by Pulitzer Prize-winning author Ron Chernow explores the life of Samuel Langhorne Clemens, better known as Mark Twain. This excerpt from the book details Twain's 1882 return to the Mississippi River, a journey undertaken to gather material for his book "Life on the Mississippi." Traveling incognito, Twain reflects on the changes to the river and its towns, the decline of the steamboat era, and the profound, nostalgic joy he felt being back in a pilot house. He considered it the only place of true freedom he had ever known, a sanctuary from the world's constraints.</p>

          <div class="timestamp">2025-07-05 14:47:08 EDT</div>

          <p>As per his own instructions, Mark Twain's full autobiography was published 100 years after his passing, revealing his unfiltered thoughts on society, politics, and personal matters. The work was dictated rather than written, creating a blog-like, non-linear narrative where Twain could speak freely, knowing the subjects of his criticism would not be alive to be hurt by his words. This archived article discusses the book's creation, Twain's status as a global superstar, and the clever marketing ploy of the century-long embargo, ensuring his voice would once again captivate the world long after he was gone.</p>

          <p>McLaren's Lando Norris predicts an exciting British Grand Prix, suggesting a six-car battle for victory is possible at Silverstone. Qualifying was exceptionally close, with the top six drivers from Red Bull, McLaren, Mercedes, and Ferrari separated by less than a quarter of a second. The teams have opted for different car setups, particularly regarding downforce levels, which creates varied strengths on the straights versus the corners. This strategic diversity, combined with the potential for rain, sets the stage for a highly unpredictable and competitive race among the top teams.</p>

          <p>India is poised for victory in the second Test against England, largely thanks to a masterful century from captain Shubman Gill. Following his first-innings 269, Gill scored another 161, allowing India to set England an improbable target of 608 runs to win. In response, England's top order crumbled, leaving them at 72-3 by the close of day four, with star batsman Joe Root sensationally bowled by Akash Deep. With India's bowlers finding significant movement, England faces the difficult task of surviving the final day to salvage a draw and maintain their series lead.</p>

          <h2>Experts Explain the Science Behind 'Old Person Smell' and How to Mitigate It</h2>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>The phenomenon often described as "old people smell" is a real biological process, not a matter of hygiene, according to health experts. As skin ages, the breakdown of certain fatty acids produces a compound called 2-nonenal, which has a distinct musty or greasy scent and is not easily washed away. This article explains that factors like medications and hormonal changes can also contribute to changes in body odor. While a sudden, significant change in scent could indicate an underlying health issue, experts suggest that a holistic approach including an antioxidant-rich diet and skincare can help manage age-related odors.</p>

          <p>Hamas has issued a "positive response" to the latest U.S.-mediated ceasefire proposal, stating it is prepared to enter negotiations to implement the framework. The proposal reportedly includes a two-month ceasefire, and in response, Israel is expected to send a delegation to Qatar for further talks. President Trump expressed optimism about the development, suggesting a deal could be reached within the next week. However, Hamas is reportedly still seeking guarantees for a complete Israeli withdrawal and an end to the war following the initial truce period.</p>

          <p>In a recent interview, documentary filmmaker Ken Burns reflects on the American Revolution, framing it as a messy, violent civil war from which the nation's highest ideals emerged. He argues that understanding the deep divisions and flaws of the founders, such as their complicated relationship with slavery, does not diminish their achievements but makes them more real and accessible. Burns emphasizes that the U.S. is held together by the words of its founding documents, and that citizenship requires an active, ongoing engagement with this complex history to navigate contemporary divisions and sustain the republic.</p>

        </div>
        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>An inquiry posed to ChatGPT highlights a key nuance in the U.S. tax system: the primary disparity between the wealthy and the middle class lies not in tax rates, but in how income is taxed. While the wealthiest Americans pay an average federal income tax rate of 16%, similar to some middle-class brackets, their wealth grows primarily through investments, which are not taxed until they are sold. The AI explained the "buy-borrow-die" strategy, where billionaires live off tax-free loans against their assets, allowing their wealth to grow largely untaxed, a privilege unavailable to those earning regular wages.</p>

          <p>The proliferation of digital payment systems has led to "tipflation," where customers are increasingly prompted to tip in situations where it was not previously expected, such as at fast-food counters or self-service kiosks. This article explores the psychology behind tipping and how technology is changing social norms, often presenting pre-calculated options of 15-25% that pressure consumers. While tipping is seen as a way to reward good service or supplement low wages, the constant requests are causing confusion and irritation for many.

This sets up a highly competitive group stage where every match will be critical. While England and France are favorites to advance, major tournament debutants Wales have shown they can compete with top teams and will look to cause an upset, particularly in their highly anticipated final group match against the Lionesses.</p>

          <p>A "cortisol cocktail" trending on TikTok, which combines ingredients like coconut water, orange juice, and magnesium, is being promoted as a way to lower the stress hormone cortisol. However, medical experts say there is no scientific evidence to support this claim. Doctors note that cortisol levels fluctuate naturally and are rarely a target for reduction outside of specific medical conditions like Cushing's Syndrome. While the drink is likely harmless for most people and can aid in hydration, its stress-reducing effects are probably due to a placebo effect or the minor relaxation benefits of magnesium.</p>

          <p>A prototype of the MingKwai, an innovative Chinese typewriter designed in the 1940s by linguist Lin Yutang, has been rediscovered after being thought lost to history. The machine was a groundbreaking attempt to solve the challenge of typing a language with tens of thousands of characters instead of an alphabet. Its unique system, which breaks down characters by shape rather than sound, is a conceptual ancestor to modern Chinese, Japanese, and Korean computing input methods. The discovery is significant for scholars studying the history of technology and the politics of language in the 20th century.</p>
