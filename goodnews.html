          <p>Audrey Backeberg, who disappeared from her family's home in Wisconsin in 1962 at the age of 20, has been found alive and well, according to the Sauk County Sheriff‚Äôs Office. The investigation revealed that Backeberg's disappearance was her own choice and not the result of any criminal activity or foul play. The family's babysitter reported that Audrey hitchhiked to Madison, Wisconsin, before taking a Greyhound bus to Indianapolis, Indiana.

          <p>The White House has clarified that President Trump's announcement to rename November 11 as "Victory Day for World War I" will be an additional proclamation and not a full replacement of Veterans Day. Trump also stated his intention to designate May 8 as "Victory Day for World War II." According to the Congressional Research Service, establishing a federal holiday or a patriotic observance requires the passage of a law. This clarification comes after initial reports suggested a complete renaming of Veterans Day.</p>

          <p>A new book reveals that Joe Biden's aides discussed the possibility of him taking a cognitive test in February 2024 amid concerns about his mental acuity as he geared up for re-election. The aides ultimately decided against the idea, fearing it would raise further questions about his mental abilities. Biden eventually stepped down from his re-election campaign in favor of Vice President Kamala Harris after a poor debate performance against Donald Trump. Harris then lost the presidential election to Trump, ushering in the former reality TV star's second term.</p>
