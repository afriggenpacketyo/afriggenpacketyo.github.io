        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>The third round of the US PGA Championship at Quail Hollow was delayed due to adverse weather conditions, specifically thunderstorms. The start was initially set for 8:15 AM local time but was postponed until 4:43 PM BST. This delay affected the tee times of prominent golfers like Rory McIlroy and defending champion Xander Schauffele. The revised schedule will see players teeing off in threesomes from split tees, with the goal of completing the round despite the weather-induced setback. The weather conditions led to a suspension of practice for 17 minutes earlier in the day, underscoring the severity of the weather disruption.</p>

He suggested that Mitchell should demand changes within the team due to the perceived lack of effort and availability from his teammates. The Pacers defeated the Cavaliers in five games, leading to significant scrutiny of the team's performance. (not investment advice)</p>

Haveli Investments, a PE firm founded by former Vista Equity Partners president Brian Sheth, is the largest shareholder in Couchbase with an approximately 9.8% ownership based on its latest 13D filling.</p>

          <p>The United States has experienced a significant decline in drug overdose deaths, with approximately 27,000 fewer deaths in 2024 compared to 2023, marking the steepest single-year decline in 45 years. The trend is widespread, with 45 states recording declines, particularly in Ohio and West Virginia. The increased availability of naloxone, an opioid antagonist, and policies from the Covid-19 pandemic, including telehealth access to addiction treatment, have contributed to the decline. The Trump administration's proposed cuts to naloxone distribution, however, pose a threat to continued progress.</p>

Conservative Party leader Kemi Badenoch has criticized the scheme as "free movement through the back door," while Labour insists it is not a return to pre-Brexit freedom of movement.
