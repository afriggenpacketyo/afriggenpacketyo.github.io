          <p>The Florida Panthers defeated the Edmonton Oilers 6-1 in Game 3 of the Stanley Cup Final, taking a 2-1 series lead. Brad Marchand and Sam Bennett continued their strong play, while Sam Reinhart and Carter Verhaeghe each scored their first goals of the series. Sergei Bobrovsky made 32 saves for the Panthers, while Connor McDavid struggled to get his team on track, and the Oilers took 15 penalties, including a late-game brawl. The game was a lopsided affair after the first two games were closely contested, with the Panthers capitalizing on the Oilers' mistakes. The series is a testament to the cagey veterans on both sides, with Marchand and Corey Perry showcasing their skills.</p>

          <p>The Smithsonian Institution has asserted its independence, stating that it retains authority over personnel decisions, including the director of the National Portrait Gallery. This announcement comes after President Trump publicly announced the firing of the gallery's director, Kim Sajet, citing her partisan views and support for DEI. The Smithsonian's statement emphasized that the Board of Regents and Secretary Lonnie G. Bunch are responsible for the governance and administration of the institution. The move follows a White House proposal to reduce the Smithsonian's funding and an executive order demanding an end to federal funding for exhibitions based on racial themes.</p>

          <p>Top officials from China and the United States are holding a second day of negotiations in London to de-escalate trade and technology tensions that have impacted the global economy. The first round of talks concluded without a deal, but both sides have signaled their expectations. The US is seeking eased export controls and the restoration of critical mineral flows from China. President Trump has authorized the American delegation to negotiate away restrictions on sales of advanced technologies to China. The discussions aim to address ongoing disputes and find common ground amid the complex relationship between the two economic powers.</p>

          <p>Ren Zhengfei, the founder of Huawei Technologies, stated that the company's Ascend chips are still a generation behind those from the US but that state-of-the-art performance can be achieved through other tactics like stacking and clustering. Ren's comments, published in the People's Daily, suggest that Washington's sanctions have not completely halted China's technological progress, especially in AI. He highlighted China's advantages in AI development, including a large young population, sufficient electricity, and a developed information network. Ren's interview comes as the US increases restrictions on China and Huawei, with new guidance suggesting the use of Ascend chips could violate export controls.</p>

          <p>The Japanese government plans to release another 200,000 tons of rice from its stockpiles through direct contracts with retailers in an effort to lower elevated rice prices. This move will reduce the country's rice reserve to 100,000 tons. The released rice will be directed to smaller supermarket operators in addition to major retailers. Rice prices have doubled compared to the previous year, prompting the government to take action. The released rice will consist of harvests from 2020 and 2021, with the 2020 rice expected to be sold at a reduced price. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>The UK government has committed ¬£14.2 billion to build the new Sizewell C nuclear plant on the Suffolk coastline, ahead of the Spending Review. The Treasury said that Sizewell C would create 10,000 direct jobs, thousands more in firms supplying the plant, and generate enough energy to power six million homes. Opponents of the project have criticized the investment, arguing that the money could be spent on other priorities and that the project will add to consumer bills. The government insists that nuclear power provides enormous amounts of low-carbon, non-intermittent energy and is crucial to the government's plans to almost completely eliminate fossil fuels from the UK's energy grid by 2030.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>A group of cross-party MPs has criticized the UK's statutory parental leave system as "one of the worst in the developed world" and having "fundamental flaws." A report published by the Women and Equalities Committee said paternity leave rules "entrench outdated gender stereotypes" and that "bold" action is needed, requiring significant investment. Introduced in 2003, statutory paternity leave allows new fathers to take up to two weeks off work, receiving ¬£187.18 a week or 90% of their average earnings, whichever is lower. The report recommends increasing paternity pay to 90% or more and paternity leave to six weeks in a phased approach, highlighting how other countries offer more generous parental leave policies.</p>
