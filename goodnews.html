          <p>A federal judge has temporarily blocked the Trump administration's ban on Harvard University enrolling international students, following a lawsuit filed by the university. The lawsuit was initiated after the Department of Homeland Security revoked Harvard's ability to enroll foreign students under the F-1 visa program, a move that affected over 7,000 current visa holders, including Princess Elisabeth of Belgium. Harvard argued that the ban was a blatant violation of the First Amendment and a retaliatory measure for the university's rejection of government demands to control its governance and curriculum. The judge's decision provides a temporary reprieve for international students at Harvard.</p>

          <p>The Los Angeles Dodgers are using two planes for their road trips this season, one for players and another for coaches, staff, and other personnel, in an effort to improve team chemistry and player recovery. This initiative, driven by the players themselves, aims to create a more comfortable and restful environment for players, allowing them to arrive at road cities earlier and have a full day off before games. The two-plane system also provides a fail-safe contingency plan in case of mechanical problems, ensuring that players and critical staff can travel as scheduled.

          <p>Harvard professor Steven Pinker argues that the intense criticism and punitive actions directed at Harvard University, including funding cuts and restrictions on international students, constitute a form of "Harvard Derangement Syndrome." Pinker acknowledges that Harvard has serious issues, including a lack of viewpoint diversity and instances of compromised academic freedom. However, he contends that the university is not the "woke madrasa" or "Islamist outpost" that its critics claim, and that the appropriate response is to diagnose and remedy specific flaws, not to cripple the institution entirely. He argues that the nation needs a sense of proportionality in dealing with its educational and cultural institutions.</p>

          <p>A new study has found that contrast-enhanced mammography can detect three times as many invasive cancers in dense breast tissue as ultrasound, offering a more accurate screening method for women with this condition. The study, published in The Lancet, also showed that contrast-enhanced mammography can find tumors that are much smaller than those found by regular mammography, although MRI scans are still better at detecting more tumors overall. While contrast-enhanced mammography is not yet widely used for screening in the United States, experts suggest it could become a standard of care for women with dense breasts and high cancer risk.</p>

          <h2>Navy Reverses Course on DEI Book Ban After Pentagon Review</h2>
          <div class="timestamp">2025-05-23 10:42:19 EDT</div>

          <p>The Navy has reversed its decision to remove 381 books from its libraries, returning almost all of them to the shelves after a Pentagon review using standardized search terms for diversity, equity, and inclusion (DEI) titles. The original removal was based on the Navy's own search terms, which identified titles such as "I Know Why the Caged Bird Sings" and "How to Be an Antiracist." The new review, using the DOD's search terms, found only about 20 books that need to be removed pending a future review by a Department of Defense panel. This action brings the DOD into compliance with a Trump executive order to eliminate DEI programs.</p>
