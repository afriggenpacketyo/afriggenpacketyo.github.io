          <div class="timestamp">2025-07-23 02:00:14 EDT</div>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Singapore's headline inflation remained steady at a four-year low of 0.8% in June, slightly below economists' expectations. Core inflation, which excludes transport and accommodation costs, also held firm at 0.6%, providing the Monetary Authority of Singapore (MAS) with room to potentially ease monetary policy. The MAS has maintained a subdued growth forecast for the second half of the year, citing global economic uncertainty and the potential impact of tariffs on the nation's export-dependent economy. This economic environment suggests a cautious outlook despite recent GDP growth figures. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>Laurent Mekies has taken over as team principal for the Red Bull Formula 1 team following the dismissal of Christian Horner. Mekies, who has extensive experience in F1, stated his initial approach will be to listen and understand the team's dynamics before implementing changes. His primary task is to reverse the team's competitive decline over the past 18 months and navigate a new era without both Horner and former design chief Adrian Newey. The change in leadership marks a pivotal moment for the historically dominant team as it seeks to rebuild its structure and return to the top of the sport.</p>

          <p>A detailed analysis highlights RELX, a global provider of information-based analytics, as one of the UK's most successful and under-the-radar companies, with a market capitalization of nearly £72 billion. Formerly a print publisher, the company has transformed into a digital powerhouse, serving legal, risk, scientific, and business sectors, and is considered a major beneficiary of the AI boom. With consistent growth and high profit margins, RELX exemplifies a "quality compounder" and represents the kind of high-tech, information-driven business shaping the UK's 21st-century economy. The company's success challenges perceptions about the UK's modern economic strengths. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>The U.S. has announced a significant trade deal with Japan, which includes establishing "reciprocal" tariffs of 15% on Japanese exports. As part of the agreement, tariffs on Japanese auto exports to the U.S. will be lowered from 25% to 15%, a key concession for Japan's economy. The deal also involves Japan opening its markets to more U.S. goods, including cars and agricultural products, and a commitment to invest $550 billion in the United States. This agreement could provide a political boost for Japanese Prime Minister Shigeru Ishiba amid domestic challenges. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>A chain of stores named Duck World, specializing in collectible rubber ducks, is successfully operating in prime London locations despite a challenging retail environment. The stores sell over 700 varieties of ducks, appealing to tourists, collectors, and gift-seekers, particularly millennials. While facing pressures from inflation and rising business costs, the business model leverages the high-margin nature of collectibles and the "treatonomics" trend where consumers buy small, mood-boosting luxuries. The company's success highlights how niche, novelty retail can find a foothold even as traditional high-street stores struggle.</p>

Although non-binding, the opinion is expected to set a crucial legal benchmark and could form the basis for future domestic and international climate-related lawsuits.

          <p>A 13-million-year-old fossilized leg bone of a "terror bird" discovered in Colombia shows distinct teeth marks, suggesting the formidable predator was killed by an even larger reptile. Palaeontologists matched the bite marks to an extinct caiman species, which could grow up to five meters long. Terror birds were apex predators themselves, making this a rare glimpse into a battle between two top predators of the Miocene epoch. The lack of healing on the bone indicates the bird died during or shortly after the attack, providing new insights into the ancient ecosystem's food chain.</p>
