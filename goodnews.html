          <p>A business school professor and CEO advises job seekers to ask a specific question during interviews to uncover a company's true values: "What kind of person should not work at this company?" This question often elicits more honest and less rehearsed answers, revealing the actual work culture beyond corporate platitudes. Examples of revealing responses include mentions of weekend work expectations, preferences for specialists over generalists, or a dislike for overly social employees. By asking this, candidates can better assess if a company's real operational values align with their own personal and professional preferences before accepting an offer.</p>

          <p>California has enacted a major overhaul of its landmark environmental law, the California Environmental Quality Act (CEQA), to address the state's severe housing and homelessness crises. Governor Gavin Newsom championed the changes, arguing that the 1970s-era law had become a bureaucratic obstacle to building much-needed housing. The new legislation aims to streamline the approval process for development projects, a move supported by housing advocates but opposed by some environmental groups. This reform was a key condition for Newsom's approval of the state budget, which also included cuts to other progressive initiatives to close a deficit.</p>

Homeowners are also warned against the temptation to overborrow, as the home serves as collateral, and a failure to repay could lead to foreclosure.

          <p>For savers whose certificates of deposit (CDs) are maturing in July 2025, the current lower-interest-rate environment presents new challenges. This article advises against allowing CDs to automatically roll over, as new rates will likely be lower than those secured in previous years. Instead, savers should actively shop for the best available rates, particularly from online banks, before anticipated Federal Reserve rate cuts further depress yields. It also suggests considering long-term CDs to lock in current rates for several years, providing a stable return even if overall market rates continue to decline. (not investment advice)</p>

The company's strategy of leveraging itself to acquire over 528,000 Bitcoin has caused its stock to surge over 3,300% since 2020, far outpacing Bitcoin itself and inspiring other firms to explore similar treasury strategies.

Furthermore, dairy products were attributed to causing nightmares by 22% of those who felt food affected their dreams. The study's authors theorize that this association may be due to gastrointestinal distress from lactose intolerance during sleep, which could negatively impact dream content.</p>
