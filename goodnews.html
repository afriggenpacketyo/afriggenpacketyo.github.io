          <p>At 45 years old, tennis icon Venus Williams is set to make history as the oldest player to compete in the U.S. Open singles tournament since 1981. Williams, a two-time U.S. Open champion, received a wild card invitation to participate in her 25th singles championship at the event. Her participation highlights the longevity seen in professional tennis, where athletes often compete at elite levels well into their 30s and 40s, challenging conventional notions of athletic peaks.</p>

The recordings, made at the very beginning of her career, will be released by Decca, with one single marking the 80th anniversary of VJ Day and others appearing on a new album titled "Hidden Treasures," offering a new glimpse into the early artistry of the "Forces' Sweetheart."</p>

          <p>CNBC's Jim Cramer advised investors not to exit the market, even if it appears "frothy" with speculative behavior in some stocks like recent IPOs. He argues that unlike the dot-com bubble, the current market has enough rational, strong companies with solid fundamentals to balance out the irrational exuberance. Citing positive developments at established companies like Amazon and Eli Lilly, Cramer suggests that the legitimate growth stories are powerful enough to warrant staying invested and that rallies in both good and bad stocks often occur simultaneously.

          <p>As economic growth slows and consumer spending wanes in China's major cities, the nation's smaller, lower-tier county markets are becoming a crucial new engine for consumption. Residents in these areas often have lighter financial burdens and faster income growth, leading to a stronger willingness to spend on goods and services. This untapped potential is fueling a "consumption upgrade" in everything from cars to imported foods, representing a significant shift as China aims to rebalance its economy to be more reliant on domestic demand.</p>

          <p>A federal judge in Maryland has struck down two Trump administration directives that aimed to eliminate diversity, equity, and inclusion (DEI) programs in schools and universities by threatening to cut their federal funding. The ruling found that the Department of Education's guidance, which broadly interpreted a Supreme Court ruling on college admissions, constituted a "sea change" in regulation and violated procedural requirements. This decision marks a significant victory for educational and civil rights groups who argued the administration's actions amounted to illegal censorship and sowed chaos in educational institutions nationwide.</p>

          <p>U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE) has reversed its decision to use expedited removal proceedings against Mirta Amarilis Co Tupul, a Guatemalan woman who has lived in the U.S. for nearly 30 years. After her lawyers filed a lawsuit arguing the process was illegal for a long-term resident, the government agreed to move her to regular deportation proceedings, which grant the right to a court hearing. The case had raised concerns among advocates that the Trump administration was attempting to unlawfully expand its authority to speed up deportations.</p>

          <p>Warren Buffett's Berkshire Hathaway has revealed a new stake in UnitedHealth, acquiring over 5 million shares worth approximately $1.6 billion in the last quarter. The investment is notable given that the health insurer's stock has struggled significantly this year amid a Justice Department investigation and a public backlash against rising healthcare costs. The move aligns with Buffett's history of value investing in troubled companies, and the disclosure caused UnitedHealth's stock to rise sharply in extended trading. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>The American Heart Association and the American College of Cardiology have issued new guidelines for managing high blood pressure, recommending a more aggressive and earlier approach to treatment. The updated advice suggests that individuals with blood pressure in the 130-139 systolic range should start with lifestyle changes, followed by medication if levels don't improve, a shift from the previous 140 threshold. Notably, the new guidelines also recommend complete abstinence from alcohol, citing growing evidence of its negative impact on blood pressure.</p>
