        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>A dual-certified child life specialist and therapist shares six daily practices parents can implement to build trust with their children. These include normalizing discussions about feelings, not avoiding difficult topics, and being honest about personal challenges. The expert also recommends modeling behavior instead of interrogating, incorporating real talk into routines, and teaching coping strategies for handling emotions. Trust is built through consistent small moments of openness and honesty, creating a safe space for children to share and ask questions. These practices help children learn how to navigate their emotions and build stronger connections with their parents.</p>

          <p>A Chinese student's graduation speech at Harvard University, emphasizing "shared humanity" and global unity, has gained significant attention, particularly in light of escalating US-China tensions. The speech was delivered on the same day that a federal judge blocked a Department of Homeland Security order that sought to prevent Harvard from enrolling international students. The Trump administration has pledged to "aggressively" revoke student visas for Chinese nationals with ties to the Chinese Communist Party or those studying in critical fields, raising concerns about espionage and national security. The student's message of unity stands in contrast to the political climate.</p>

          <p>Researchers in China have created an infrared contact lens that allows humans to see in the dark by converting infrared light into visible light. The lens combines conventional soft contact lenses with nanoparticles made of gold, sodium gadolinium fluoride, ytterbium, and erbium ions. While the resulting images are somewhat blurred, the lenses enable users to recognize patterns, letters, and flashing infrared signals, even with closed eyes. Potential applications include surgical procedures, encryption, and rescue operations, though critics argue that night vision devices are more practical and powerful.</p>

          <p>Chinese scientists have identified Yunnan province as the origin of the "ghost ancestors" of modern Tibetans through ancient DNA analysis. The origins of the Tibetan Plateau populations and their migration have been a long-standing mystery. This research verifies that an archaeological site in central Yunnan is one of the origins of populations on the Tibetan Plateau. The findings fill a critical gap in the genetic data of prehistoric populations in East and Southeast Asia, identifying one of the Tibetan Plateau's "ghost ancestors" from a genetic perspective.</p>

          <p>A new French series, Reformed, explores how to make millennia-old rituals matter anew through the eyes of Rabbi L√©a Schmoll, played by Elsa Guedj. The series focuses on the work of rabbi-ing and L√©a's struggle against the nihilism of the modern world and rigid Orthodoxy. The show is roughly based on the book Living With Our Dead, by Delphine Horvilleur, which argues for a more liberal form of Judaism. Reformed explores how religion can still have purpose for those who don't believe, as long as it is never too sure of itself.</p>
