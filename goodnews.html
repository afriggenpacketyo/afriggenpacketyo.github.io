          <p>During a joint practice session with the Minnesota Vikings, Patriots head coach Mike Vrabel was knocked to the ground while attempting to intervene in a fight between players. The incident, which occurred on Vrabel's 50th birthday, was captured on video and circulated on social media. Vrabel, who was not injured, has a history of stepping into practice altercations, having sustained a bloodied cheek in a similar situation earlier in the month. The coach later commented on the game-like intensity of these joint practices.</p>

The orchestra's existence serves as a form of cultural resistance against the Taliban's complete ban on music in Afghanistan. Founded by Ahmad Sarmast, the ensemble uses its performances to protest the regime's oppressive policies, particularly those affecting women, and to preserve the nation's rich musical heritage. Their concerts, streamed online, aim to keep hope alive for a future where arts can once again flourish in their homeland.</p>

          <p>A loud sonic boom was heard across several counties in eastern and southeastern England, startling residents who reported shaking houses. The Royal Air Force (RAF) confirmed that the noise was caused by Typhoon fighter jets scrambled from RAF Coningsby. The jets were launched to intercept and escort a civilian aircraft that had lost communication with air traffic control. Communications were successfully re-established, and the civilian plane was safely escorted to Stansted Airport before the Typhoons returned to base.</p>

          <p>President Donald Trump is considering a wide range of candidates to potentially replace Jerome Powell as the chair of the Federal Reserve. The list includes former Fed officials, economists, and market strategists, many of whom have publicly expressed their views on monetary policy. A common theme among several candidates is the belief that the Fed's benchmark interest rate should be lowered, with some advocating for more fundamental changes to the central bank's operations. The selection will be critical for the future direction of the U.S. economy. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>A recent regulatory filing reveals that Warren Buffett's Berkshire Hathaway acquired a new stake in the beleaguered health insurer UnitedHealth, valued at approximately $1.6 billion. The purchase is notable given UnitedHealth's stock has fallen nearly 50% in 2025 amid public backlash over healthcare costs and a Justice Department investigation. The move aligns with Buffett's history of value investing in troubled companies, and the insurer's stock rose 6% in extended trading following the news. Berkshire also disclosed new smaller stakes in several other companies. (not investment advice)</p>

The FBI stated that no threat remains to the public, though an investigation is ongoing. The building has recently been a site of controversy and protests regarding the detainment of immigrants.</p>

          <p>The UK operations of Chinese fast-fashion retailer Shein saw sales surge by a third to £2.05 billion in 2024, leading to a 57% increase in pre-tax profits. The company continues its rapid growth despite acknowledging that inflation may affect future consumer spending habits. Shein's business model could face challenges from a potential UK government review of tax exemptions on low-value imported packages, a change that has already led to price increases in the US. The strong financial results come as the company reportedly moves closer to a public listing on the London Stock Exchange.</p>

          <p>A former senior Chinese economic official has advised the government to stimulate domestic demand by removing purchase restrictions on items like property and vehicles. Yin Yanlin, previously with a key Communist Party economic body, argued that encouraging affluent groups to spend is the most direct way to drive market demand and create a positive economic cycle. He noted that income levels are not the main barrier, as national savings have been rising significantly. The recommendation comes as Beijing seeks effective strategies to bolster a slowing economy.
