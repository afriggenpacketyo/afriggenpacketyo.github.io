        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Dame Esther Rantzen, who has terminal lung cancer, is appealing to the House of Lords not to block the Terminally Ill Adults Bill, which would give terminally ill adults in England and Wales the right to an assisted death. The bill has already passed the House of Commons, but faces potential opposition in the Lords, with some peers expressing concerns about the potential for coercion of vulnerable individuals. Rantzen argues that the bill includes rigorous safeguards, such as multiple assessments by doctors and experts, to ensure that only those with six months or less to live and who freely choose assisted dying are eligible. The proposed legislation would not allow disability or mental disorder to qualify anyone for assisted dying, only terminal illness.</p>

Suga served as a social service agent and expressed gratitude to fans while apologizing for a drunk driving incident from the previous year. The group has been on a self-described "hiatus" since 2022 as members fulfilled their military duties, during which time the band had a yearly economic impact of roughly $4 billion.

          <p>The National Health Service (NHS) in England plans to map the DNA of every newborn baby to assess their risk of developing hundreds of diseases. This initiative aims to revolutionize prevention by predicting and preventing illnesses before symptoms arise. The testing will involve sequencing the complete DNA of newborns using blood samples from their umbilical cords. The program is part of a broader government effort to invest ¬£650 million in DNA research for all patients by 2030 and to build one of the world's largest research databases with over 500,000 genomes.</p>

          <p>Chinese brands are increasingly gaining popularity in Europe, driven by strategic advertising and sports sponsorships. Xiaomi, for example, is planning to open 500 new retail stores outside China this year, particularly in developed markets, with a goal of 10,000 stores overseas in the next five years. This expansion reflects a shift in perception, as Chinese brands overcome previous concerns about quality and image. The company said the decision to close all its stores in France in 2022 ‚Äúcorresponded to an adjustment in Xiaomi‚Äôs retail strategy, which aimed to respond to the purchasing behaviour of the French‚Äù.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>The UK House of Commons has backed a bill to allow assisted dying in England and Wales, marking a significant social change. The bill now heads to the House of Lords, where its future is uncertain, with some opponents expected to challenge it. The government anticipates a lengthy "commencement period" to prepare for the implementation of the law, with hundreds initially seeking assisted death, potentially rising to 4,000 annually after a decade. Opinion polls indicate strong public support for the change, with over seven in ten Britons in favor of the assisted dying proposals.</p>

          <p>Several towns and cities in eastern Germany are offering free stays to attract new residents and combat depopulation. The "trial living" schemes provide people with the opportunity to live in these areas for up to four weeks without charge, hoping to encourage long-term relocation. Guben, for example, has seen some success with its program, with a number of participants moving to the city. The effort is in response to declining birth rates, emigration of young people, and an aging population in the former East Germany.</p>

          <p>The Rhode Island state House has approved legislation that would ban the sale and manufacturing of certain semiautomatic rifles, commonly referred to as assault weapons. The proposal now goes to Governor Dan McKee, who supports such bans. If signed into law, Rhode Island will join other states with similar prohibitions, although the bill only applies to sales and manufacturing, not possession. Critics argue that the ban will not curb mass shootings and will punish law-abiding citizens, while gun control advocates call the bill the "weakest assault weapons ban in the country."</p>
