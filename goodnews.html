          <p>Phoenix police officers rescued a baby who had been left alone in an apartment for several days after its mother passed away. Authorities were alerted by a concerned neighbor and found the infant visibly emaciated but alive. The child was immediately taken to a hospital for lifesaving care and is now expected to make a full recovery. The cause of the mother's death is currently under investigation by the medical examiner's office, and her identity has not been released.</p>

          <p>According to former Microsoft AI head Harry Shum, China is rapidly catching up to the United States in the field of AI algorithms, despite still lagging significantly in advanced chip technology. Speaking at a summit, Shum noted that the technology race encompasses chips, algorithms, and applications, with computing power being a major hurdle for Chinese firms. He highlighted the success of Chinese start-up DeepSeek, which achieved competitive results with far fewer resources, as evidence of China's potential to innovate and overcome hardware constraints through superior algorithm engineering.</p>

          <p>A federal judge has denied another attempt by former President Donald Trump to dismiss a defamation lawsuit filed by the men wrongfully convicted in the Central Park jogger case. The plaintiffs sued Trump for statements he made suggesting they were guilty, despite their exoneration. The judge ruled that a Pennsylvania state law designed to protect against strategic lawsuits does not apply in federal court, allowing the case to proceed. This marks another legal setback for Trump in his efforts to have the politically charged lawsuit thrown out.</p>

          <p>As the nation marks the tenth anniversary of the Supreme Court's legalization of same-sex marriage, a Maryland couple who were pioneers in the fight reflect on their journey. Gita Deane and Lisa Polyak were lead plaintiffs in a 2004 lawsuit challenging Maryland's ban on same-sex marriage. Although their initial legal battle was unsuccessful, it helped build momentum for change, leading to state-level legalization years later. They express pride in their role but also concern over current legal and political efforts to roll back marriage equality protections nationwide.</p>

          <p>The S&P 500 and Nasdaq achieved new record highs this week, driven by a de-escalation of the U.S.-Iran conflict and a resulting drop in oil prices. Initial fears of a wider war that could impact growth and inflation subsided, allowing markets to rally. Investor sentiment was also buoyed by growing expectations for multiple Federal Reserve interest rate cuts by the end of the year, despite recent inflation data being slightly hotter than anticipated. Energy prices fell sharply, easing concerns about costs for businesses and consumers. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>A new study of skeletons from the ancient city of √áatalh√∂y√ºk in Turkey suggests it may have been a matriarchal society ruled by females over 9,000 years ago. Genetic analysis of more than 130 individuals buried under the city's houses revealed that social structures were organized around maternal lineage. Researchers found that female offspring tended to remain in the family home, while males likely moved to their wife's household upon marriage. The findings challenge traditional assumptions about patrilineal societal structures in the ancient world.</p>

          <p>Tens of thousands of people marched in the Budapest Pride parade, defying legal threats from Prime Minister Viktor Orban's government, which has enacted restrictive "child protection" laws targeting the LGBTQ community. Organizers estimated a record turnout despite a police ban on gatherings deemed to promote homosexuality, with attendees risking fines and organizers facing potential prison sentences. The event drew support from international figures, including EU officials and MEPs, who attended to show solidarity with Hungary's civil society and its fight for fundamental rights.</p>
