          <p>Colorado Buffaloes head football coach Deion Sanders announced he was diagnosed with an aggressive form of bladder cancer, which required the surgical removal of his bladder. Speaking at a press conference alongside his medical team, Sanders emotionally shared that the procedure was successful and he is now considered cancer-free. The revelation explained his recent absence from public view, and he confirmed his intention to continue coaching the team for the upcoming season. He had not previously disclosed the diagnosis to his team or the public.</p>

          <p>A federal judge has ruled that the Trump administration must continue providing Medicaid reimbursements to Planned Parenthood clinics nationwide, blocking a provision in Trump's tax bill aimed at defunding the organization. U.S. District Judge Indira Talwani's order prevents the government from ending Medicaid payments to abortion providers that received over $800,000 from the program in 2023. Planned Parenthood had argued that losing these funds, which cover services like birth control and cancer screenings, would force the closure of nearly 200 clinics and affect over a million patients. The judge stated that restricting these services would likely lead to adverse public health consequences.</p>

          <h2>Falling Home Equity Loan and HELOC Rates Offer New Borrowing Opportunities for Homeowners</h2>
          <div class="timestamp">2025-07-28 13:00:55 EDT</div>
        </div>
        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Interest rates for home equity loans and home equity lines of credit (HELOCs) have recently declined, providing homeowners with more affordable borrowing options. With average rates for both products now sitting just below 8.3%, they present a cheaper alternative to high-interest credit cards and personal loans. Financial experts advise homeowners to carefully compare the two products, as HELOCs offer a variable-rate credit line while home equity loans provide a fixed-rate lump sum. It is also recommended to shop around with multiple lenders and determine the precise amount needed to avoid over-borrowing against one's home. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>Matty Healy, frontman of The 1975, is championing a new festival to support the small UK pubs and bars where many artists begin their careers, warning that the talent pipeline is under threat. The Seed Sounds Weekender will feature events at over 1,000 small venues, which Healy described as the foundation of culture. He cautioned that without these "seed" venues, iconic acts like The Smiths or Amy Winehouse would not have emerged. Organizers highlight the unprecedented economic challenges facing the hospitality sector, which threaten the existence of the very places that cultivate future music headliners.</p>

          <p>The city of Philadelphia has honored the legacy of iconic R&B singer Teddy Pendergrass by renaming a portion of South Broad Street as "Teddy Pendergrass Way." The newly dedicated block is located in the Avenue of the Arts neighborhood, near the former Philadelphia International Records studio where Pendergrass recorded many of his classic hits. Known for his powerful voice as the lead singer of Harold Melvin & the Blue Notes and as a solo artist, Pendergrass was a Philadelphia native. His widow, Joan Pendergrass, described the honor as a humbling culmination of a long journey to recognize his deep connection to the city.</p>

          <p>Chicago's Field Museum is developing a new exhibit to honor the culture of American Samoa, featuring two indigenous artists working on-site to create key pieces. Su'a Uilisone Fitiao is carving an outrigger for a 19th-century canoe, a vessel central to Samoan fishing and travel. His wife, Reggie Meredith Fitiao, is creating a traditional 'siapo,' or bark cloth art, using natural dyes and tools derived from plants. The artists aim to preserve and share their cultural heritage, which will be showcased in the museum's Regenstein Halls of the Pacific when the new exhibit opens in March 2026.</p>

          <p>The California Department of Forestry and Fire Protection (Cal Fire) has opened a new firefighter training center in Merced County to expand its workforce amid growing wildfire threats. The Atwater Training Center is the fourth such facility and will help train about 1,600 firefighters in 2025, with the capacity to support 300 students annually. This expansion is part of a multiyear effort to meet increasing demands, as the state has nearly doubled its authorized fire protection positions since 2017. The opening comes as the federal U.S. Forest Service reportedly faces a significant staffing shortage of over 4,500 firefighting jobs.</p>

          <p>Kathy Ball-Toncic, who escaped the North Tower during the 9/11 attacks, is now preparing to ride in her first Pan-Mass Challenge after surviving two separate cancer diagnoses. Years after fleeing the World Trade Center, she was diagnosed with breast cancer and later colorectal cancer, both of which have been linked to toxic dust exposure at the site. A lifelong runner, Ball-Toncic used marathons as a way to process trauma and give back, but chemotherapy left her too weak for running. Now cancer-free again, she is channeling her resilience into cycling to raise money for cancer research at the Dana-Farber Cancer Institute.</p>

          <p>Boeing is scheduled to report its second-quarter earnings, with investors closely watching for continued progress under new CEO Kelly Ortberg's turnaround plan. The aerospace giant is expected to report a significant revenue increase to $21.68 billion, up from $16.9 billion a year ago, reflecting a recovery from production slowdowns. However, the company is still projected to post an adjusted loss per share as it works to resolve quality control issues with its 737 MAX and 787 Dreamliner jets. Commercial deliveries have already shown improvement, with 150 jets delivered in Q2, signaling that Ortberg's deliberate approach to fixing production is yielding results.</p>

          <p>The West African nation of Benin has granted citizenship to U.S. singer Ciara, making her one of the first to be naturalized under a new law for descendants of enslaved people. The law, passed in September, allows individuals who can trace their lineage to the transatlantic slave trade to claim Beninese citizenship. This initiative is part of Benin's broader effort to reconcile with its historical role in the slave trade, promote 'memorial tourism' to sites like the Door of No Return, and reconnect with the global Black diaspora. The process is open to anyone who can provide proof of ancestry.</p>

          <p>During Disability Pride Month, Berkeley activist and artist Maya Morya Selkie Scott is promoting the "Disability Justice Community Stories Quilt Project." The project invites people to create individual panels that share their personal stories of love, struggle, and resilience, which are then woven into a collective quilt. Inspired by the AIDS Memorial Quilt, the project aims to make the disabled community more visible and honor its history of activism and civil disobedience. The growing quilt has already been displayed at protests and events across the country, serving as an educational tool to advance disability rights and foster connection.</p>

          <p>Following England's victory in the Euro 2025 final, defender Lucy Bronze revealed she played the entire tournament with a fractured tibia, a fact previously unknown to the public. Medical experts suggest the injury was likely a stress fracture, which presents as pain after activity rather than a sudden break, allowing her to continue playing with careful management. Bronze played 598 minutes across six games, a testament to her resilience and the work of the Lionesses' medical team. Manager Sarina Wiegman praised Bronze's "crazy mentality," highlighting the determination that helped lead the team to success despite the significant injury.</p>

At least 18 individuals who led or utilized the network have been convicted, including a lead administrator who received a life sentence. Officials described the network as a sophisticated and sadistic community, and called the operation one of the most successful prosecutions of its kind in history.</p>
