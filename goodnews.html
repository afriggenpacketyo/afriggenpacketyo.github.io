          <p>The 2016 murder of Nicole Vander Heyden in Green Bay, Wisconsin, presented a complex investigation where her boyfriend was initially the prime suspect. However, data from his Fitbit tracker corroborated his alibi, showing minimal activity during the time of the murder, which ultimately led to his exoneration. Investigators then used the suspect's Google Dashboard data, a lesser-known location tracking tool, to place another man, George Burch, at the crime scene. Burch was subsequently convicted and sentenced to life in prison, highlighting how personal technology can be pivotal in both convicting the guilty and clearing the innocent.</p>

          <p>Justin Fulcher, a senior advisor to Defense Secretary Pete Hegseth, has resigned from his position at the Pentagon after a six-month tenure. Fulcher stated the decision was his own and part of his original plan to serve in government for that duration, describing the departure as amicable. During his time, he advised on personnel and policy, contributing to acquisition program reviews and efforts to streamline IT procurement. His departure is noted as part of a broader series of personnel changes within Secretary Hegseth's office, though officials have characterized these as standard transitions. The Pentagon has not yet named a replacement.</p>

          <h2>Number of Missing Persons in Texas County Drastically Reduced After Floods</h2>
          <div class="timestamp">2025-07-19 22:22:22 EDT</div>

          <p>Following devastating floods in early July, officials in Kerr County, Texas, have significantly lowered the number of unaccounted-for individuals from nearly 100 to just three. This reduction is attributed to intensive follow-up work by state and local agencies, which successfully verified that many people initially reported missing were actually safe. At its peak, over 160 people were listed as missing in the county. The update brings a measure of relief to the community, although the overall death toll from the statewide flooding event stands at 134, with 107 of those fatalities occurring in Kerr County alone.</p>

          <p>England's rugby team achieved a decisive six-try victory against the US Eagles in a match in Washington D.C. marked by extreme humidity and two lengthy delays due to lightning. Despite the challenging conditions, the English side, composed mostly of young professionals, demonstrated superior precision and control throughout the game. The US team struggled to maintain pressure and made critical errors, leading to a final score of 38-5. The event, part of a doubleheader, drew a record crowd for the preceding women's game, as World Rugby aims to build American audiences ahead of future World Cups on U.S. soil.</p>

          <p>Following last year's deadly attack in Southport, UK Home Secretary Yvette Cooper has announced plans for a new criminal offense to target individuals who are found preparing for mass killings. This new legislation aims to close a legal gap, allowing police to intervene and charge suspects who plot violent attacks but are not motivated by a specific ideology that would classify them as terrorists. The proposed law would mirror existing counter-terrorism legislation, making it a serious crime to take preparatory steps, such as researching a target, regardless of the motive. The goal is to empower authorities to apprehend violence-obsessed individuals long before they can act.</p>

          <p>A debate is growing in the UK over the possibility of shortening the traditional six-week school summer holiday to address issues like learning loss and the financial strain on parents. Proponents argue a shorter break could help close the learning gap for disadvantaged children and ease childcare burdens, while some suggest spreading holidays throughout the year could lower vacation costs. However, teachers express concern, viewing the long break as essential for rest and preparation. With some school districts already moving to a five-week summer, the discussion reflects a broader re-evaluation of the academic calendar in modern society.</p>

The government plans to launch new advertising campaigns and have banks send targeted messages to savers, aiming to highlight the potential benefits of investing over the perceived safety of cash. This initiative also brings attention to a significant gender gap, with women being more likely to hold cash savings than investments. While the chancellor has paused plans to cut the cash ISA tax-free allowance, the debate continues over how to make the UK a "nation of investors." (not investment advice)</p>
