        </div>
        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Computer-chip designer Nvidia announced a 56% surge in revenue to $46.7 billion for the second quarter, driven by strong demand from major tech firms expanding their AI capabilities. CEO Jensen Huang noted the "AI race is now on," with significant spending increases from companies like Meta and OpenAI. Despite this growth, Nvidia's shares dipped slightly in after-hours trading due to data center revenue missing estimates and ongoing concerns about US-China geopolitical tensions. The company continues to lobby the Trump administration regarding sales of its advanced AI chips to China, a crucial market where US export restrictions are also fueling domestic chipmaking competition.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>The widespread emotional reactions to news of Taylor Swift's engagement have brought the concept of parasocial relationships into the spotlight. Fans expressed intense joy and tears, illustrating how individuals develop strong, one-sided emotional connections with celebrities, influencers, or public figures they don't personally know. Psychologists describe these as "my friend who doesn't know me," fueled by the extensive personal information shared through social media and reality shows. While these relationships can foster a sense of community and connection, especially online, experts caution that they cannot replace the reciprocal nature of real-life friendships, offering emotional "fast food" without true nutritional content.</p>

This marks the second season of the new 36-team league format, with the final set for Budapest in May 2026. Paris St-Germain enters as the defending champions, while Real Madrid tops UEFA's coefficient rankings. Premier League contenders like Arsenal, Chelsea, Liverpool, and Manchester City have made significant squad reinforcements, aiming for European glory. Scottish teams, however, will be absent for the first time since 2021-22 after losing their automatic spot in the competition.</p>

          <p>Sir Keir Starmer is replacing Nin Pandit, his principal private secretary (PPS) at Downing Street, after only ten months in the role. Pandit is the third senior staff member to depart from Starmer's team in less than a year, following the exits of chief of staff Sue Gray and communications director Matthew Doyle. The PPS position is a highly influential civil service role, acting as the prime minister's gatekeeper and controlling information flow. While No 10 contests concerns about Pandit's effectiveness, her departure signals ongoing shifts within the prime minister's inner circle, with a broader reshuffle of junior ministers also anticipated.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Darren Aronofsky's new film, "Caught Stealing," adapted from Charlie Huston's novel, features Austin Butler as Hank Thompson, a former baseball player thrust into a violent crime caper in 1998 Manhattan. After a cat-sitting mishap, Hank endures a brutal beating and finds himself pursued by various criminal factions, including Russian thugs and Hassidic hitmen. The film is described as a bruising bacchanal, celebrating a grimy, energetic pre-millennial New York City. Butler's portrayal of a self-loathing alcoholic struggling with past potential anchors the film's exploration of squandered talent amidst chaotic circumstances, showcasing Aronofsky's affection for the city's darker, humorous corners.</p>

          <p>Chinese retail stock traders are reportedly experiencing a bull run, with some individuals like software engineer Jacky Jia claiming returns of over 30% this year and anticipating further gains. This optimism is fueled by government pledges to stabilize the stock market amidst a shaky economy, with the belief that a rising market can generate a "wealth effect" to spur consumption. Traders are focusing on high-beta stocks in sectors like new-consumer, consumer-electronics, software, and hardware. The market's performance is seen as a crucial tool for economic stimulation, despite underlying concerns about the broader economic health.</p>

          <p>The 70th anniversary of Emmett Till's death is being commemorated with a train ride from Chicago to Mississippi, retracing his fateful 1955 journey. Organized by the Emmett Till Interpretive Center and National Parks Conservation Association, the event includes Till's cousin, Rev. Wheeler Parker Jr., the last surviving eyewitness to his kidnapping. Till, then 14, was brutally lynched after reportedly whistling at a white woman, an event that sparked the modern Civil Rights Movement following his mother's decision for an open-casket funeral. The ride serves as a powerful reminder of past injustices and ongoing efforts for healing in America.</p>

          <p>Florida wildlife officials are deploying 120 robot rabbits in the Everglades as a new tool to lure and eliminate invasive Burmese pythons. These solar-powered, retrofitted toy rabbits emit heat, smell, and make natural movements to mimic real marsh rabbits, which are a primary food source for the pythons. The initiative, costing $4,000 per robot, aims to improve detection rates of the highly camouflaged snakes, which have decimated native mammal populations by up to 95%. While the project is in its early stages, officials are optimistic about its potential to help control the estimated tens of thousands to 300,000 pythons in the region.</p>

          <p>USC has extended a multi-year offer to Notre Dame, hoping to preserve their historic 100-year-old football rivalry beyond the current season. This amended proposal addresses Notre Dame's preference for a long-term deal, following public outcry over the potential end of the series. USC Athletic Director Jennifer Cohen expressed optimism for a swift agreement, despite previous reluctance due to College Football Playoff uncertainties and Big Ten travel demands. The primary sticking point remains the game's date, as USC seeks to move it earlier in the season to better balance its conference schedule, while Notre Dame has less incentive to change the traditional late-season matchup.</p>

The rapper is being sued by a security guard, Emani Ellis, who claims Cardi B assaulted her in 2018. Cardi B reiterated that she never touched or scratched Ellis, accusing her of seeking a $24 million payout. The obstetrician's receptionist, Tierra Malcolm, testified that Ellis cornered Cardi B and reached for her, resulting in a cut on Malcolm's forehead, which she attributed to Ellis. The doctor also stated Ellis had no visible injuries and that he saw Ellis cause Malcolm's injury, supporting Cardi B's denial of physical contact.</p>

          <p>Zhou Xiaochuan, former governor of China's central bank, has called for a "multidimensional assessment" of stablecoins, urging caution amidst their global surge in popularity. He emphasized the need to evaluate their genuine utility and potential systemic risks, rather than solely focusing on market hype. Zhou warned against the excessive use of stablecoins for asset speculation, which could trigger fraud and financial instability. His comments come as the US and Hong Kong develop regulatory frameworks for stablecoins, and speculation grows about China potentially introducing yuan-backed stablecoins to further internationalize its currency.</p>
