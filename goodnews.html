          <p>European stock markets opened higher on Monday, with investors anticipating the U.S. Federal Reserve's upcoming interest rate decision. However, Danish wind energy company Orsted saw its shares fall over 5% after announcing it would raise $9.4 billion by issuing new shares at a significant 67% discount to its closing price. This development contrasts with the generally positive market sentiment in Europe, as major indices in the UK, Germany, and France posted early gains. The market is also closely watching for UK inflation data and a Bank of England meeting later in the week. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>A group of climate scientists and experts, who were dismissed from the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration (NOAA) by the Trump administration, have launched an independent climate information website. The new site, climate.us, aims to restore public access to trusted climate data that was removed or altered on the official climate.gov platform. The original government site was effectively dismantled after staff were fired and content related to diversity, equity, and climate justice was purged under new executive orders. The new nonprofit initiative is funded by public donations and seeks to counteract political interference in climate science communication.</p>

          <p>Despite falling to 0-2 after an overtime loss to the Dallas Cowboys, the New York Giants displayed a newfound offensive vitality that suggests progress for the team. Quarterback Russell Wilson had a standout performance with 450 passing yards and three touchdowns, largely connecting with rookie receiver Malik Nabers. While costly penalties remain a significant issue, the team showed a level of resilience and star potential that was absent in their opening week. The article suggests that although their playoff hopes are slim, the team's entertaining and competitive play could provide fans with a sense of hope for the future.</p>

          <p>Recent data from China's central bank indicates a continued shift of household savings into the country's stock market, suggesting the current equity rally has further potential. Deposits at non-banking financial institutions, such as brokerages and mutual funds, saw a significant increase of 1.17 trillion yuan in August. Analysts attribute this trend to low interest rates on traditional bank deposits, which are pushing investors to seek higher returns in the capital market. With the earnings yield of major Chinese companies outpacing government bond yields, equities are becoming an increasingly attractive asset class for domestic investors. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>Following the successful initial public offering of Swedish payments company Klarna, market analysts are identifying other major financial technology firms that could be next to go public. Companies like the digital payments giant Stripe and the digital banking unicorn Revolut are considered strong contenders, having achieved massive private valuations. Other potential candidates include British digital banks Monzo and Starling Bank, as well as the spend management platform Payhawk. Klarna's positive market debut is seen as a sign that Wall Street is becoming more receptive to large-scale fintech listings, potentially opening the door for these firms. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>China is considering a proposal to repurpose retiring coal-fired power plants into sites for nuclear facilities, a project known as the C2N initiative. Proposed by a top state-owned energy infrastructure company, the plan aims to utilize existing infrastructure in coastal areas to accelerate decarbonization efforts. With approximately 100 gigawatts of coal capacity expected to be retired by 2030, this strategy could offer a direct path to clean energy while preserving valuable assets. The project would involve fourth-generation reactors, which researchers suggest may have a better chance of meeting safety requirements and gaining public acceptance.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>A collaboration between biotechnology firm Allonia and Lundin Mining is testing a new technology that could significantly improve the efficiency and environmental impact of nickel mining. The D-Solve technology uses microbes to selectively dissolve worthless minerals, which initial tests at Michigan's Eagle Mine show can increase nickel purity by 40% and grade by 18%. This innovation is particularly timely as the demand for nickel grows due to its use in clean energy technologies. By improving extraction efficiency, the process could reduce costs, minimize waste, and lower the energy consumption associated with mining critical minerals.</p>
