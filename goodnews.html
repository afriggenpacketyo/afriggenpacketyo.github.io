          <h2>Japan's Assets Attract Record Inflows in April Amid Global Economic Shifts</h2>
          <div class="timestamp">2025-05-16 01:06:23 EDT</div>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Japan experienced unprecedented foreign investment inflows into its equities and long-term bonds in April, as investors sought refuge from perceived instability in U.S. markets due to President Trump's trade policies. The net inflows totaled 8.21 trillion yen, marking the largest monthly increase since 1996, with institutional investors driving the surge. This shift was prompted by concerns over U.S. economic prospects and asset performance, leading to diversification into safer havens like Japan. As the U.S. softens its trade stance, confidence in U.S. assets is being restored, which could impact future investment flows into Japan. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>British newspapers are dominated by the fallout from Albania's rejection of a migrant deal proposed by Prime Minister Starmer, with some papers reporting on new talks with other Balkan countries. The papers also highlight the UK economy's fastest growth in a year and plans to block bonuses for Thames Water bosses. Other headlines include an exclusive interview with the chief suspect in the Madeleine McCann case and a call for assisted dying to be legalized. The Times reports up to nine nations are interested in Starmer's plan to deport failed asylum seekers to so called "return hubs" in other countries which he announced in Albania.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>The Japanese parliament has passed a law enabling preemptive cyberdefense measures, allowing the government to monitor communications data and neutralize hostile servers during peacetime. This legislation mandates operators of key infrastructure sectors to report cyber breaches, aiming to counter increasing cyber threats. While the government will monitor IP addresses used in international communications, it is restricted from surveilling the content of domestic messages. The law also establishes an independent panel for oversight, addressing concerns about potential government overreach and protecting personal rights.</p>

          <h2>Japan's Economy Contracts Unexpectedly Due to Export Decline</h2>
          <div class="timestamp">2025-05-16 00:53:12 EDT</div>
        </div>
        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Japan's economy experienced a contraction of 0.2% in the March quarter, marking the first decline in a year, primarily due to falling exports affected by U.S. trade policies. Despite the overall contraction, domestic demand showed strength, growing by 0.6% and contributing positively to the GDP. The Bank of Japan (BOJ) has warned of potential moderation in the country's economy due to global trade policies, while also indicating a possible continuation of policy rate hikes if inflation targets are met. Experts anticipate a reasonable trade deal with the U.S., which could mitigate the tariff impact.</p>

          <p>The LA 2028 Olympics plans to offer an air taxi service for spectators, partnering with Archer Aviation to provide electric vertical take-off and landing aircraft (eVTOLs). If certified by the FAA in time for the Games, the air taxis would offer 10-20 minute flights to residents and visitors and fly between select destinations, including several of the largest Olympic venues in the region. Archer Aviation hopes it will be certified by the Federal Aviation Administration (FAA) "at similar levels of safety as commercial airliners".</p>

          <p>The commercial crab season in Northern California faces challenges due to migrating humpback whales becoming entangled in crab fishing ropes. Fisherman Brand Little uses a high-tech system with remote-controlled pop-up devices to retrieve crab cages, reducing rope usage and whale entanglements. The California Department of Fish and Wildlife shortened the crab season due to the heightened risk of whale migration. Little hopes his investment in the pop-up technology will allow him to catch more crabs without harming whales.</p>

          <p>Ancient horses repeatedly migrated between North America and Eurasia during the late Pleistocene, when a land bridge connected the two continents. Among the studied fossils are Dalianensis horses, named after the northeastern Chinese city of Dalian, near where they were unearthed. They are shown to have a mixed ancestry from both Eurasian and American populations. The researchers found that horses undertook multiple migrations across the Bering land bridge between 50,000 and 13,000 years ago.</p>
