          <p>Liverpool midfielder Ryan Gravenberch has dramatically transformed into one of Europe's top players in his position under new manager Arne Slot. Following a difficult stint at Bayern Munich and an underwhelming initial season at Anfield, Slot's strategic deployment and increased attacking freedom have been pivotal to his resurgence. Gravenberch, originally envisioned as a holding midfielder, now actively contributes goals and creates numerous chances, establishing himself as a standout performer for the club. This remarkable improvement has earned him widespread acclaim from football experts, who now consider him among the continent's elite midfielders, a significant shift from earlier career uncertainties.</p>

          <p>Swiss pharmaceutical giant Roche is aggressively pursuing a position among the top three global players in the obesity drug market, challenging current leaders Novo Nordisk and Eli Lilly. This ambition comes as its experimental weight-loss injection, CT-388, progresses into a pivotal Phase III trial, the final stage before seeking regulatory approval. Roche, which currently lacks approved obesity drugs, aims for launches across its treatment suite by 2030, including the closely watched Petrelintide. The company has bolstered its pipeline through strategic acquisitions and partnerships, confident that its diverse drug candidates will enhance its competitive edge in this rapidly expanding and lucrative market.</p>

          <p>China's "national team" of state-backed buyers has amassed a substantial US$553.1 billion in yuan-denominated stocks by the end of June, now exceeding holdings by foreign investors. These state buyers account for 4.8% of the market capitalization of publicly traded shares, playing a crucial role in buttressing the current bull run. This significant intervention has propelled a key benchmark of China's onshore stocks to a decade high, reflecting top leaders' commitment to financial stability and promoting the stock market as a means to preserve household wealth amid a property market slump. Analysts widely expect this state support to continue for an extended period, signaling further potential market growth and solidifying its role akin to a stabilization fund.

          <p>China is actively working to accelerate the global deployment of its indigenous BeiDou satellite navigation system, aiming to establish it as a formidable rival to the U.S.-led GPS. Vice-Premier Ding Xuexiang emphasized this commitment at a recent summit, noting BeiDou's remarkable growth over 31 years, which now sees it capturing over 70% of China's domestic consumer market share. Following a significant third-generation launch in 2020, the system is entering a new phase of global development, marked by comprehensive improvements in service performance and widespread expansion of large-scale applications. This strategic initiative underscores China's ambition to create critical new infrastructure that serves global users, thereby enhancing its technological sovereignty and international influence.</p>

          <p>The Los Angeles Dodgers secured a 5-4 extra-innings victory over the Arizona Diamondbacks, reducing their magic number to clinch the National League West to one. This crucial win was significantly aided by two scoreless innings of relief from starters Roki Sasaki and Clayton Kershaw, who stepped into the bullpen role. Sasaki, returning from injury, displayed promising form with a dominant seventh inning, while Kershaw, in his first relief appearance since 2019, retired the side in order in the ninth. Their unexpected contributions were vital after the traditional bullpen faltered, highlighting a new strategy to bolster late-game pitching as the team heads towards the playoffs.</p>

          <p>Leading bank executives in London are calling for increased policy clarity and stability, expressing concern over potential tax hikes in the forthcoming U.K. Autumn Budget. While acknowledging improved corporate profitability and deal-making, bank chiefs from Barclays, Citi, and J.P. Morgan warned that a proposed "windfall tax" on banks could stifle investment, competition, and growth in London's financial sector. They emphasize the need for a consistent approach to bank regulation and taxation to maintain the U.K.'s global competitiveness. The financial services sector, which contributes 10% of Britain's tax income, is seen as crucial for the country's economic growth, with leaders stressing the importance of a stable and competitive tax regime to retain businesses.

          <p>A federal judge has ruled it unconstitutional for the Trump administration to mandate states' cooperation with immigration enforcement as a condition for receiving certain FEMA grants. This legal setback challenges the administration's efforts to withhold funding from "sanctuary" cities and states. U.S. District Judge William Smith sided with 20 states, arguing the policy was "arbitrary and capricious and unconstitutional," and that withholding disaster funds would cause "irreparable harm." The ruling affirms that the federal government cannot prioritize its immigration agenda over essential emergency preparedness and response funding, though the administration plans to appeal, reiterating its commitment to the rule of law.</p>

This strategy allows OpenAI, a non-investment-grade startup, to spread costs over several years and potentially secure better debt financing terms. The deal highlights the "circular nature" of some AI investments, where capital from chip providers directly fuels the acquisition of their own products, raising questions about the sustainability of the AI boom.

          <p>Africa is experiencing a record surge in renewable energy adoption, driven by the rapid influx of Chinese-made solar panels and falling costs. A study by Oxford Economics revealed that the continent imported 9,516 megawatts of Chinese solar panels in the first seven months of this year, a significant increase from the previous year. This growth, led by South Africa, Algeria, and Nigeria, is largely attributed to massive energy plants developed by Chinese firms, such as PowerChina's 342MW De Aar Central Solar Power Plant in South Africa. China's dominance in global solar production makes these imports a key indicator of Africa's accelerating solar capacity, promising a greener and more affordable energy future for the continent.</p>
