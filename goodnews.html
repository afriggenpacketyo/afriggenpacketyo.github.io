          <p>Tropical Storm Fernand, the sixth named storm of the 2025 Atlantic hurricane season, has formed southeast of Bermuda and is projected to continue on a north-northeasterly path over the central Atlantic Ocean. The National Hurricane Center confirms Fernand poses no immediate threat to land, with its maximum sustained winds currently at 50 mph. While some strengthening is possible today, the storm is expected to weaken tonight and become post-tropical by Wednesday, remaining well east of Bermuda. This development follows Hurricane Erin, which formed in a similar area, and aligns with the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration's forecast for an above-normal hurricane season, which predicted 13 to 18 named storms.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>China has increased minimum e-commerce delivery rates in several major centers, including Guangdong province, to counteract "disorderly low-price competition" and prevent harmful price spirals. This adjustment, primarily affecting e-commerce clients, aims to guide companies toward improving product quality and promoting the exit of outdated capacity. The move follows a directive from President Xi Jinping's Central Financial and Economic Affairs Commission, emphasizing the need to lawfully regulate market behavior. This initiative is part of a broader "anti-involution drive" expected to expand across more regions, reflecting Beijing's focus on market stability and quality over aggressive price wars.

          <p>Former German Chancellor Angela Merkel reflected on her controversial 2015 decision to accept hundreds of thousands of refugees, reaffirming that her policy was guided by humanitarian principles and human dignity. In an interview for an upcoming documentary, Merkel acknowledged the immense scale of the challenge and the criticism her "Wir schaffen das" (We can do this) statement garnered. She emphasized that using force to prevent refugees from entering Germany was never an option she would consider. Merkel also conceded that her decision likely contributed to the rise of the far-right Alternative for Germany (AfD) party, yet she continues to stand by her choice as morally necessary.</p>

          <p>The third Social Security payment for August is scheduled for distribution this week, specifically on Wednesday, August 27th, for beneficiaries born between the 21st and 31st of their birth month. However, a significant change is expected for those previously overpaid by the Social Security Administration (SSA), as the agency plans to begin withholding 50% of benefits from individuals who have not yet started making repayments. A February 2025 report from the SSA's Office of the Inspector General revealed that the agency overpaid $13.6 billion in Social Security benefits during fiscal years 2020 to 2023, impacting an unspecified number of recipients.

          <p>This article explores the potential resurgence of left-handed players at the US Open, highlighting Ben Shelton and Jack Draper as key contenders poised to challenge the dominance of top-ranked right-handers. Historically, lefties enjoyed significant success in tennis from the 1970s to early 1980s, but their presence in Grand Slam finals has dwindled since John McEnroe's last US Open title in 1984. The article discusses the inherent advantages left-handers possess due to unique ball trajectories and spins, which often confound right-handed opponents. Shelton, the world No. 6, and Draper, who recently won his first Masters title, are both enjoying strong seasons and possess powerful serves that could be decisive weapons in the tournament.</p>

          <p>South Korean President Lee Jae-myung is set to meet with President Trump in Washington, where he intends to push back against U.S. pressure to refocus their 71-year-old military alliance. The Trump administration seeks to modernize the alliance, potentially deploying U.S. troops away from the Korean Peninsula and requiring South Korean support for challenges beyond North Korea, specifically concerning China. President Lee, however, views North Korea as the main threat and is hesitant to be drawn into a conflict with China. Additionally, Lee faces the formidable task of finalizing a trade deal involving $350 billion in South Korean investments to lower U.S. tariffs, a deal that has seen some disagreement over its terms.

          <p>Twenty years after Hurricane Katrina, New Orleans' public school system has undergone a radical transformation, becoming an almost entirely charter-based model that has led to significant improvements in test scores and graduation rates. This post-storm overhaul, driven by state officials, aimed to empower individual school leaders and introduce competition, yielding impressive academic gains according to researchers. However, the system remains "a work in progress," grappling with challenges such as ensuring equitable access to higher-rated schools and mitigating the painful impact of school closures on students and families. The city's school board is now exploring the possibility of directly running some schools, indicating a potential shift in strategy for continued improvement.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>A popular fitness trend promoting weighted vests for benefits like improved posture, weight loss, and increased bone and muscle growth is largely unsupported by current scientific research. While social media influencers advocate for their use, particularly for women in perimenopause or menopause, exercise scientists emphasize that existing data does not substantiate claims for significant bone density or muscle strength improvements. Experts consistently recommend traditional resistance training with weights or other weight-bearing exercises as far more effective for building strength. However, the article acknowledges that weighted vests can offer cardiovascular benefits by increasing energy expenditure, and for some individuals, they serve as a motivational tool to enhance physical activity.</p>

          <p>Arsenal forward Bukayo Saka is expected to miss up to four weeks due to a hamstring injury sustained in Saturday's home victory against Leeds United. This setback means he will be unavailable for Arsenal's crucial game against Liverpool on Sunday, as well as England's World Cup qualifiers next month. Arsenal captain Martin Odegaard is also doubtful for the Anfield match due to a shoulder injury, though there is optimism within the club that neither player will face long-term absences. Despite these significant injuries to key players, Arsenal's much deeper pool of attacking talent this season, bolstered by summer signings, is anticipated to help mitigate their impact.</p>

          <p>China and Mongolia are exploring joint efforts to expand China's ambitious "Great Green Wall" project into the Mongolian Plateau, aiming to combat the widespread issue of desertification. With nearly 80% of Mongolian land currently affected by degradation, this environmental challenge carries significant consequences that extend beyond its borders, posing substantial difficulties for the wider East Asian region. The Gobi Desert, which spans parts of both countries, is a primary source of sand and dust, contributing to increasingly severe sandstorms that have impacted China in recent years, including the worst in a decade in 2021, which led to soaring pollution levels and several deaths.

          <p>Singapore's inflation rate eased to a cooler-than-expected 0.6% in July, reaching its lowest level since January 2021 and falling below economists' forecasts. Core inflation, which excludes private transport and accommodation costs, also dipped to 0.5%. The Monetary Authority of Singapore (MAS) attributed this moderation primarily to falling retail and other goods prices, in addition to lower electricity and gas costs. With global crude oil prices easing and domestic nominal wage growth moderating, the central bank projects core inflation to average between 0.5% and 1.5% for 2025. This latest economic data strengthens the argument for the MAS to potentially loosen monetary policy in its October meeting, providing a buffer against anticipated weaker economic growth and significant external uncertainties.
