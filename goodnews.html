        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Harry Kane, England's all-time leading scorer and a prolific striker for Bayern Munich, is often considered an undervalued superstar despite his consistent record-breaking achievements. Experts and former players argue that his quiet demeanor and focus on team performance contribute to this perception, contrasting him with more flamboyant peers like Erling Haaland. While his major tournament performances have faced scrutiny, his overall contribution, versatility, and unique playing style are highly praised by those who have played with or against him. His impact on England's national team and club success is undeniable, making him an irreplaceable asset.</p>

          <p>Kenya has converted its $5 billion US dollar-denominated Chinese railway loans to Chinese yuan, a strategic move expected to reduce annual debt-servicing costs by $215 million. This decision, announced by Treasury Minister John Mbadi, is seen by analysts as a potential blueprint for other debt-stressed African nations, potentially drawing them closer to China. The original loans from the Export-Import Bank of China funded the Standard Gauge Railway, with a significant portion remaining unpaid. While new yuan loan terms were not fully disclosed, the deal is anticipated to halve the previous interest rates. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>USC secured a decisive 31-13 victory over No. 15 Michigan, largely thanks to the breakout performance of walk-on running back King Miller. Stepping in due to injuries to the top two running backs, Miller rushed for 148 yards and a touchdown, including two game-changing breakaway runs. The Trojans' defense also showed significant improvement, stifling Michigan's offense and holding their star freshman quarterback to limited yards. This resounding win marks a crucial turnaround for USC after a previous loss, demonstrating resilience and unexpected depth, especially from Miller, who is now expected to earn a scholarship.</p>

          <p>As the Los Angeles Dodgers prepare for the NLCS against the Milwaukee Brewers, they face several challenges from their less-resourced opponent.

Their pitching staff is also formidable, ranking second in team ERA, with key pitchers like Freddy Peralta, Quinn Priester, and rookie phenom Jacob Misiorowski.

          <p>Belgium's Flanders region plans to ban the trade and sale of kangaroo meat, citing severe animal welfare concerns regarding Australia's commercial kangaroo hunting. This move, which could influence broader European Union trade, highlights practices deemed inhumane, including the slaughter of up to 1.3 million kangaroos annually and the euthanasia of orphaned joeys. Concerns also extend to public health, as exotic game meats can transmit zoonotic pathogens. Major Belgian supermarkets previously stopped selling kangaroo meat, but it remains available in pet food and butcher shops. The ban also targets kangaroo skins used in fashion.</p>
