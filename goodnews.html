          <p>China has achieved a significant milestone in its nuclear energy ambitions by completing the conceptual design for a next-generation commercial fast neutron reactor. Known as the CFR-1000, this facility will be the country's first gigawatt-level, fourth-generation reactor, designed for greater fuel efficiency and sustainability. The project, which builds on a smaller demonstration reactor in Fujian province, is now awaiting final approval from national energy authorities. It is expected to become operational after 2030, positioning China alongside other major powers like Russia and the U.S. in developing advanced nuclear technology.</p>

          <p>The Los Angeles Dodgers secured a 5-2 win against the Boston Red Sox, showcasing a resurgent offense after a difficult start to July. Key performances came from Teoscar Hernández, who hit a crucial two-run homer, and Andy Pages, who contributed with multiple hits and an RBI. This victory marks the team's third in four games and the seventh time in their last ten games scoring five or more runs. The improved hitting provides a positive sign for the team as they approach the trade deadline, demonstrating that the current lineup may be finding its form again.</p>

          <p>Chinese quantitative hedge funds are capitalizing on difficulties faced by international PhD students in the United States to attract top talent. Firms like Shanghai-based Mingshi are offering competitive salaries to recruit scientists and engineers who are struggling with funding cuts and stricter visa policies under the Trump administration. This influx of brainpower is expected to help these firms harness advancements in artificial intelligence and expand their operations. The trend reflects the rapid growth of China's quant sector, which is now the world's second-largest yuan-denominated market. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>Former New York Rep. George Santos has surrendered to a federal correctional facility in New Jersey to begin serving his 87-month prison sentence. Santos pleaded guilty to federal wire fraud and identity theft charges stemming from a pattern of lies and deception used to defraud voters and donors. Prosecutors detailed how he fabricated his biography, created a fake nonprofit, and ran a credit card scheme to enrich himself, spending the funds on luxury goods and personal expenses. Prior to his sentencing, Santos appealed to President Trump for a future chance to prove himself.</p>

          <p>A Leicester-based salon owner is facing a crucial hearing in her trademark battle against the global cosmetics giant L'Oréal. Rebecca Dowdeswell, owner of 'nkd' salon, is being opposed by L'Oréal in her attempt to re-register her business's trademark, which she had held since 2009 but forgot to renew. L'Oréal, which owns the 'Naked' makeup line, argues that the 'nkd' name could cause consumer confusion. Despite having spent over £30,000 in legal fees, Dowdeswell remains determined to fight for her brand's name at the upcoming Intellectual Property Office hearing.</p>

          <div class="timestamp">2025-07-25 20:53:22 EDT</div>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>The United Kingdom's warmest and sunniest spring on record has resulted in a noticeable increase in certain insect populations, including ladybirds, butterflies, and wasps. The warm, dry conditions led to a boom in aphids, a primary food source for ladybirds, and prompted unusually early sightings of numerous butterfly species. However, experts express concern that the relative lack of rain could negatively impact insect and amphibian numbers next year by drying up wetland habitats essential for egg-laying. This short-term boom contrasts with the long-term trend of declining flying insect populations in the UK.</p>

          <p>A federal judge has dismissed a lawsuit filed by the Trump administration against Chicago and the state of Illinois over their so-called sanctuary policies. The suit, filed in February, argued that local laws limiting cooperation with federal immigration agents illegally thwarted enforcement efforts. However, Judge Lindsay Jenkins ruled that the city and state's decision not to participate in federal immigration enforcement is protected by the Tenth Amendment. Chicago's mayor and Illinois' governor praised the ruling, affirming their commitment to welcoming city ordinances they believe enhance public safety.</p>

          <p>A new exhibit at the New York Historical Society explores the infamous Hollywood blacklist era of the 1940s and 50s. The display focuses on the House Un-American Activities Committee's investigation into alleged Communist influence in the film industry, which led to the blacklisting of the "Hollywood Ten" and many others. The exhibit features personal artifacts, such as letters from screenwriter Dalton Trumbo's daughter, and testimony from figures like Walt Disney and Ronald Reagan. It examines the profound impact on careers and free speech, and how the blacklist's power eventually faded.</p>

          <p>A BBC feature delves into Donald Trump's multifaceted relationship with golf, portraying it as a business venture, a competitive outlet, and a key networking tool. The article recounts anecdotes from former aides and journalists who describe his intense focus and competitiveness on the course. For Trump, golf has been a vehicle for building his real estate empire and forging connections with politicians and world leaders, from Shinzo Abe to the president of Finland. The sport provides him a private environment for transactional discussions, away from the media spotlight, at his portfolio of exclusive, high-prestige courses.</p>

          <p>Wildlife biologists in Texas are undertaking a significant conservation effort to save the state's dwindling bighorn sheep population, which has been decimated by disease. After a disease outbreak wiped out about 50% of the population, a team captured dozens of healthy sheep from the last disease-free herd. The animals were airlifted, checked by veterinarians, and relocated over 200 miles to an isolated mountain range to establish a new, healthy colony. A recent check confirmed the relocated sheep have survived and have begun to reproduce, offering new hope for the species' survival in Texas.</p>

          <p>A BBC report explores the science behind popular health benchmarks, such as drinking eight glasses of water, getting 10,000 steps, and sleeping eight hours a night. Experts suggest there is often more flexibility than the rigid numbers imply, with individual needs varying based on factors like size and activity level. While some targets, like getting at least seven hours of quality sleep, are strongly supported by evidence for long-term health, others can be viewed as useful guides rather than strict rules. The consensus is that incorporating a generally healthy outlook is more beneficial than fixating on hitting every single target daily.</p>

          <p>A scientific revolution is underway in women's sports, focusing on how the female body is uniquely affected by elite athletic activity. Researchers are studying topics that were once ignored, such as how breast biomechanics and proper sports bras can impact running efficiency and prevent long-term tissue damage. Other areas of focus include how the menstrual cycle can influence performance, mood, and fatigue, and why female athletes face a higher risk of certain injuries like ACL tears. This growing body of research marks a significant shift from a time when female athletes were often treated as "mini-men."</p>
