          <p>India is taking steps to develop its domestic rare earth element (REE) supplies to counter China's restrictions on REE exports. Indian officials are exploring how Indian Rare Earths (IREL) can increase REE production, following a pause in China's exports that has affected manufacturers globally. India possesses substantial REE reserves, ranking third globally, and has nearly 35% of the world's beach and sand mineral deposits. However, India lacks advanced separation and refining technology compared to China, the U.S., and Japan, contributing less than 1% of global REE production.</p>

          <p>An independent Chinese think tank, the Grandview Institution, suggests establishing a "security dialogue mechanism" between the US and China to prevent conflict in the South China Sea. The report, prepared in collaboration with the Pacific Forum, highlights confrontational interactions in the region but notes that competition remains manageable. Researchers Liu Xiaobo and Sophie Wushuang Yi call for institutionalized dialogue focusing on regional security, maritime legal order, law enforcement norms, and crisis response protocols. Both sides recognize the risk of escalation and have developed crisis management tools, but implementation remains inconsistent.</p>

          <p>The Japanese government is set to implement a 100 billion yen policy package aimed at attracting foreign researchers, potentially targeting those leaving the United States due to funding cuts. The measures focus on creating an elite research environment in Japan, with competition intensifying in fields like AI and semiconductors. The government plans to use profits from a 10 trillion yen investment fund to support internationally competitive research at universities. The new policy package will fund existing programs, raise salaries for researchers, and reduce their administrative burden.</p>

          <p>Following the imposition of tariffs by the United States, China has encouraged the use of domestic letters of credit (L/Cs) to help Chinese exporters sell their products domestically. Domestic L/Cs, issued by major Chinese banks, function similarly to international L/Cs, ensuring payment security and enhancing credit for firms. Unlike international L/Cs, domestic ones can also be used in the trade of services. This measure aims to support businesses in pivoting to the domestic market amid trade tensions.</p>

          <p>Japan is hoping for special treatment from the United States regarding tariffs once a bilateral deal is finalized, according to Tokyo's top negotiator, Ryosei Akazawa. This follows U.S. President Donald Trump's suggestion of a potential increase in import levies on cars. Akazawa is visiting Washington for further negotiations ahead of a possible meeting between Prime Minister Shigeru Ishiba and Trump at the G7 summit. Japan aims to secure concessions on auto tariffs and remove other sector-based tariffs, while the U.S. seeks to reduce its trade deficit with Japan.</p>
