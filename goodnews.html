          <p>Jim Lovell, the renowned astronaut who commanded the Apollo 13 mission, has died at the age of 97. Remembered for his calm leadership during the 1970 lunar mission that famously turned a near-disaster into a safe return, Lovell was hailed as a national hero. He also played a crucial role in the Apollo 8 mission, the first to orbit the Moon, where he described Earth as a "grand oasis." His family and NASA celebrated his unshakeable optimism and significant contributions to the history of space exploration.</p>

          <p>The Trump administration is expanding its mass deportation efforts by securing agreements with several nations to accept deportees who cannot be returned to their home countries. Rwanda recently signed a formal deal to take in 250 individuals, providing them with support like workforce training and healthcare. This follows similar, though less formal, arrangements with countries including Eswatini, South Sudan, Costa Rica, and Panama. These partnerships are a key part of the administration's strategy to address illegal immigration by finding destinations for deportees, including those convicted of serious crimes.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>As bankruptcy filings rise, it is important for individuals considering this form of debt relief to understand the strict eligibility criteria that can lead to disqualification. For Chapter 7 bankruptcy, failing the means test by having an income above the state median is a primary barrier. Other disqualifying factors for both Chapter 7 and Chapter 13 include having a recent bankruptcy discharge, failing to complete mandatory credit counseling, or engaging in fraudulent behavior such as hiding assets. If disqualified, alternative options like debt consolidation, settlement, or management programs may offer a path to financial stability.</p>

          <p>Major technology companies like Meta and Alphabet are seeing significant returns in their digital advertising businesses, largely driven by heavy investments in artificial intelligence. Meta reported a 22% year-over-year sales increase, crediting AI for enhancing the efficiency of its ad systems, with a notable spending rebound from Asian-based retailers. While smaller platforms like Snap and Pinterest delivered lukewarm results, the market has rewarded the massive AI capital expenditures of the tech giants, viewing the strategy as a successful driver of core business growth. This trend underscores a growing divide between large and small players in the AI-powered ad race.</p>

          <p>Tesla has been granted a permit to operate a ride-hailing business across Texas, a significant step that allows it to compete with services like Uber and Lyft. The permit, issued to Tesla Robotaxi LLC, authorizes the company to run a "transportation network company" until 2026, including with fully autonomous vehicles. Since June, Tesla has been running a limited, invitation-only service in Austin using Model Y vehicles with a human safety supervisor present. This official permit marks a key milestone in Elon Musk's long-stated ambition to launch a widespread autonomous ride-hailing network.</p>

          <h2>EV Sales Surge as Consumers Rush to Beat Expiration of Federal Tax Credit</h2>
          <div class="timestamp">2025-08-08 14:37:38 EDT</div>
        </div>
        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Automotive analysts report a significant surge in electric vehicle sales as consumers rush to purchase before a September 30 deadline, after which a federal tax credit of up to $7,500 will be eliminated. Legislation signed by President Trump ended the Biden-era incentive, prompting what is expected to be a record-breaking third quarter for EV sales. In July, new EV purchases saw a 26.4% increase from the previous month, reaching their second-highest monthly total on record. Dealers are further fueling the rush with additional incentives, though analysts predict sales may "collapse" once the federal credit expires. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>Chelsea striker Nicolas Jackson has mutually agreed with the club that he can leave this summer and was subsequently left out of the squad for a match against Bayer Leverkusen. The 24-year-old Senegalese forward is reportedly attracting transfer interest from Newcastle. Chelsea, having already signed two new strikers, hopes to receive more than double the £32 million they paid for Jackson in 2023. If the club's asking price is not met, the plan is to reintegrate him into the squad, but for now, a move appears to suit both the player and the club.</p>

          <p>New York City's medical examiner has identified the remains of three more victims of the September 11, 2001, attacks, more than 24 years after the tragedy. The individuals were identified as Ryan D. Fitzgerald, a 26-year-old trader; Barbara A. Keating, a 72-year-old executive; and another woman whose name was withheld at her family's request. These identifications were made possible by advanced DNA testing technologies applied to remains recovered from the World Trade Center wreckage in 2001 and 2002. Approximately 1,100 of the 2,753 victims from the New York attack remain unidentified.</p>

          <p>England cricketer Chris Woakes is considering forgoing surgery on a suspected dislocated shoulder in favor of a rehabilitation program to ensure he is fit for the upcoming Ashes series. Woakes sustained the injury during the fifth Test against India but bravely came out to bat with his arm in a sling in a dramatic final-day chase. A surgical option would likely involve a three to four-month recovery, jeopardizing his Ashes participation, while a rehab-focused approach could have him ready in about eight weeks. He acknowledged this path carries a risk of re-injury but stated it might be one he is willing to take.</p>
