        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Walmart reported a dip in first-quarter profits, signaling that it will need to raise prices due to the increased costs associated with tariffs implemented by President Donald Trump. Despite this, the retailer posted solid sales growth, with U.S. comparable sales up 4.5% and e-commerce sales rising 22%. The company is attempting to mitigate the impact of tariffs by sourcing two-thirds of its merchandise in the U.S., but CEO Doug McMillon stated that the magnitude of the tariffs would necessitate price increases, despite efforts to absorb costs. Walmart's performance is closely watched as an indicator of consumer sentiment and the broader impact of tariffs on the retail sector. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>Germany is endorsing U.S. President Donald Trump's proposition to elevate NATO members' defense spending target to 5% of their GDP, according to German Foreign Minister Johann Wadephul. While NATO chief Mark Rutte suggested a 3.5% GDP commitment to defense and an additional 1.5% to broader security, Wadephul indicated alignment with Trump's higher target. This move reflects Germany's increasing focus on defense, demonstrated by recent changes to debt rules to facilitate greater military expenditure. Chancellor Friedrich Merz emphasized Germany's ambition to become the strongest military power in Europe, signaling a significant shift in the country's defense posture.</p>

          <p>Dick's Sporting Goods is set to acquire Foot Locker for approximately $2.4 billion, marking the second major footwear company buyout in recent weeks. The acquisition comes amid growing uncertainty regarding the impact of President Donald Trump's tariffs on companies manufacturing products overseas.

The footwear industry has been increasingly concerned about the trade war with China, given extensive investments in Asian production.</p>

          <p>The UK economy is 'beginning to turn a corner' according to the chancellor, Rachel Reeves, after experiencing stronger-than-anticipated growth in the first three months of the year. The economy grew by 0.7% from January to March, surpassing the forecast of 0.6%, fueled by increased consumer spending and business investment. This data reflects the period prior to the implementation of US import tariffs and increased UK employer taxes in April, with analysts cautioning that this growth rate may not persist. While Reeves acknowledges the ongoing cost of living crisis, she highlights the UK's projected status as the fastest-growing economy in the G7 during this period.</p>
