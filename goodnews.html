          <p>Nissan Motor Co. is reportedly considering closing two plants in Kanagawa Prefecture, near Tokyo, as part of its restructuring plans. The potential closures involve Nissan's main Oppama plant, a pioneer in electric vehicle production, and the Shonan plant of its Nissan Shatai Co. unit, which builds commercial vehicles. These two plants account for approximately 30 percent of Nissan's domestic production capacity. The company announced earlier this week that it would shut down seven vehicle plants and cut 20,000 jobs globally after experiencing a net loss for fiscal year 2024. </p>

          <p>The Secret Service questioned former F.B.I.

Comey removed the post after the criticism, stating he didn't realize the numbers could be associated with violence. Trump accused Comey of intentionally calling for his death, while critics argued the administration was overreacting to harass a perceived enemy. </p>

          <p>A rare dust storm warning was issued for the Chicago area as a fast-moving wall of dust created a thick haze. The National Weather Service confirmed it was only the second time in its history that a dust storm warning was issued, with the first in 2023, but this was the first time the warning included the Chicago metropolitan area itself. High winds blowing over dry farmlands caused the dust storm, significantly reducing visibility on major interstates.
