        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>This article addresses and debunks several false claims made by Donald Trump and amplified on social media regarding wind energy. These claims include assertions that wind turbines are killing whales and birds, are not truly green due to recycling issues, and provide inconsistent energy efficiency. The article cites scientific evidence and reports from organizations like NOAA Fisheries and the US Fish & Wildlife Service to refute these claims. It clarifies that while wind turbines do contribute to bird deaths, they are a relatively small factor compared to other causes like cats and building collisions, and that recycling efforts for wind turbine components are improving.</p>

        </div>
        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>The Trump administration is reportedly taking a more aggressive approach to addressing antisemitism, initiating investigations and imposing sanctions on universities. Harmeet Dhillon, DOJ's assistant attorney general for the Civil Rights Division, emphasized that there is no conflict between combating antisemitism and protecting First Amendment rights. The DOJ is focusing on violent rhetoric and acts, such as blocking Jewish students and destroying property, rather than criticizing the Israeli government. This initiative follows a spike in anti-Jewish incidents after the Hamas attack on Israel in October 2023, with the administration also targeting non-citizen students accused of supporting Palestinian causes.</p>

        </div>
        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>This article explores the concept of time limits on federal rental aid, using the Delaware State Housing Authority's program as an example. The Delaware program includes a seven-year time limit, a work requirement, and a savings incentive, where tenants can save extra money and access it when they move out. While some experts support time limits to encourage turnover and upward mobility, others worry about the consequences for those who cannot find affordable housing. The Tacoma Housing Authority in Washington state ended its time limit program after finding that people without time limits fared better at increasing their incomes.</p>

          <p>This article discusses how China's Gen Z is changing the country's liquor industry, with a shift away from traditional baijiu towards low-alcohol, fruit-flavored beverages. In Baisha, farmers are increasingly growing green plums instead of sorghum grain, reflecting this trend. Chinese liquor brands are innovating to appeal to younger consumers, who prioritize self-indulgent experiences over social rituals. This shift could upend the alcohol market, where baijiu has long been the dominant choice.</p>

While acknowledging concerns about Trump's potential misuse of the military, the author suggests that a parade could help counter misperceptions about the armed forces and boost recruitment. With the military facing a shrinking pool of qualified recruits, a celebratory parade could familiarize civilians with military service and inspire talented young Americans to join.</p>
