While first-quarter sales slightly missed expectations, earnings surpassed estimates.

          <p>Former Chicago Bears linebacker Brian Urlacher has shared his stance on the inclusion of transgender athletes in women's and girls' sports, questioning why it is even a debate. Urlacher stated that a woman is a woman and a man is a man, emphasizing his belief that there are inherent differences that make it unfair for biological males to compete against biological females.

          <p>Lowe's stock is up nearly 3% in premarket trading after the company delivered earnings that matched revenue estimates and beat earnings expectations, overcoming years of post-pandemic struggles.

Same-store sales fell 1.7%, but this was better than the anticipated 2.04% decline. The company reaffirmed its guidance for the 2025 fiscal year, projecting total sales between $83.5 billion and $84.5 billion. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>West Nile virus has been detected in UK mosquitoes for the first time, according to the UK Health Security Agency (UKHSA). Fragments of the virus were found in Aedes vexans mosquitoes collected in Britain in 2023. While there have been no cases of West Nile virus acquired in the UK to date, the risk to the general public is considered "very low." Experts suggest that climate change may bring non-native mosquito species to the UK, increasing the potential for infectious diseases.</p>

          <p>The Supreme Court has backed the legal right to wild camping on Dartmoor, rejecting an appeal by landowners who argued permission should be required. Judges unanimously agreed that the 1985 Dartmoor Commons Act, which grants public access for open-air recreation, includes camping. The decision is expected to reignite debate over public access to land in England, where Dartmoor National Park is a rare exception to the lack of general wild camping rights.

          <h2>Southern California Home Prices Remain Largely Flat in April</h2>

          <p>Southern California home prices experienced minimal growth in April, rising only 0.4% from March to an average of $884,981. Compared to April 2024, values are up just 0.7%, indicating a significant slowdown in annual price growth. High mortgage rates, rising inventory levels, and economic uncertainty are contributing factors. Zillow forecasts a slight decline in home prices by April 2026, attributing it to a rising number of homes for sale. Rents in many parts of Southern California also ticked down, but the January fires in L.A. County could be upending the downward trend in some locations.</p>
