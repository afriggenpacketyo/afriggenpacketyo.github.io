          <p>CBS News examines how much a $100,000 annuity would pay a 65-year-old retiree, noting that while it won't cover all expenses, it can supplement retirement income. Factors influencing the payout include gender, the interest rate environment, the type of annuity, and optional features like cost-of-living adjustments. Men typically receive higher monthly payments due to actuarial tables indicating shorter life expectancies, and higher interest rates at the time of purchase result in larger payments. Immediate fixed annuities offer the same amount each month, providing predictability and peace of mind for those concerned about market swings. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>Tesla is expected to launch its robotaxi service in Austin, Texas, on June 22, with limited access and geofenced areas. The initial rides will be in the Model Y, not the CyberCab, and remote drivers will monitor the vehicles. Elon Musk has long promised a driverless robotaxi, and analysts believe this service could significantly increase Tesla's market capitalization. The service is expected to launch with 10 vehicles circulating Austin, with plans for expansion to Los Angeles and San Francisco.</p>
