          <p>Denise Moss, a 54-year-old mother, sought help for her sons' concentration issues in school, leading to their ADHD diagnoses. During a presentation on ADHD in women, Moss recognized similar challenges in herself, prompting her to seek her own diagnosis. Many adults discover their ADHD when their children are diagnosed, as it is highly genetic and manifests differently in adults, often mistaken for anxiety or depression. Moss, now diagnosed and medicated, has transformed her parenting and created a structured home environment for her children, feeling more manageable and excited about the future, including a family vacation to Italy.</p>
