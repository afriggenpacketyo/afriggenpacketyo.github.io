          <h2>Tariff Exemption's End Impacts Tech Giants' Ad Revenue</h2>
          <div class="timestamp">2025-05-03 00:01:14 EDT</div>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>The elimination of the tariff exemption on inexpensive goods from China, a policy enacted by President Trump, is already impacting advertising revenue for major tech platforms like Meta and Alphabet. This exemption had fueled the rise of low-cost online retailers such as Temu and Shein, who heavily advertised on these platforms. As these companies now face tariffs as high as 145%, they are reducing their ad spending, leading to a revenue decline for the tech giants. The article notes that Meta CFO Susan Li confirmed some Asian retailers had already reduced U.S. advertising spending in anticipation of the end of the exemption.</p>

          <p>The Department of Justice has filed a lawsuit against the state of Colorado, the city of Denver, and several local leaders, challenging their "sanctuary" policies that limit cooperation with federal immigration authorities. The suit claims these policies interfere with the enforcement of federal immigration law and violate the Supremacy Clause of the U.S. Constitution. The lawsuit mentions a controversial apartment complex in Aurora which President Trump claimed last year had been taken over by a Venezuelan gang, arguing Colorado's policies allowed Tren de Aragua to seize control of the building. Local officials have defended their policies, asserting that they comply with all applicable laws.</p>

          <p>The International Thermonuclear Experimental Reactor Organization (ITER) is showcasing its fusion energy technology at the World Exposition in Osaka, marking its first independent participation in the event. The exhibits explain the fusion energy process and the experimental reactor being built in France, highlighting Japan's leading role in the project. Fusion energy, often dubbed "the Sun on Earth," is seen as a clean and byproduct-free energy source, although scientists believe it is still decades away.

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>A recent Kyodo News survey reveals that approximately 58% of Japanese citizens believe that the spread of unverified information on social media during elections should be regulated by law. This sentiment arises amidst growing concerns over partisan online posts influencing election outcomes, despite constitutional guarantees of freedom of expression. The survey also indicates split opinions on revising Article 9 of the Constitution, which renounces war, and a general feeling that momentum for constitutional amendment is not building. The survey was conducted ahead of the Constitution Memorial Day national holiday.</p>

The article highlights the different perspectives on nepo babies, with some arguing that they are given unearned opportunities while others believe they must still work hard to succeed.
