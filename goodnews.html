          <p>The U.S. State Department has approved a potential sale of $1.4 billion in helicopters and F-16 fighter jet parts to the United Arab Emirates ahead of President Trump's visit. The proposed sale includes $1.32 billion for CH-47 F Chinook helicopters and $130 million for F-16 parts. Some Democrats have signaled opposition, citing concerns over the UAE's involvement in conflicts and investments in Trump's business ventures. Sen. Chris Murphy has vowed to block arms sales to countries doing direct business with Trump, calling such deals a corruption of foreign policy.</p>

          <p>Sony Group shares rose about 2% following the announcement of a 250 billion yen share buyback and a better-than-expected operating income report. The company's operating income for the last three months of the financial year surpassed analyst estimates, despite being down 11% from the previous year. Sony also detailed plans for a partial spinoff of its financial unit, distributing over 80% of shares to shareholders. However, the company's outlook for the current financial year was tempered by an anticipated hit from U.S. tariffs, though the impact may vary due to a recent trade deal.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Family offices are experiencing rapid growth as the ultra-rich seek personalized wealth management services, but they face a significant challenge in finding qualified money managers. The talent crunch is driven by factors such as a lack of clear corporate structure, competition from banks and hedge funds, and a strong emphasis on trust over other criteria. Family offices often seek candidates who can combine multiple roles, such as chief investment officer and CFO, making it difficult to find suitable professionals. While family offices are willing to pay a premium for trusted individuals, young employees are often reluctant to work in these environments due to perceived risks and a lack of career progression.</p>

          <p>U.S. retail egg prices fell in April for the first time in months, dropping to an average of $5.12 per dozen after reaching a record $6.23 in March, according to the U.S. Bureau of Labor Statistics. Despite the decrease, egg prices remain significantly higher than a year ago due to the persistent outbreak of bird flu, which has decimated flocks of egg-laying hens. Experts anticipate further price declines in the coming months due to decreased consumer demand after Easter and fewer bird flu outbreaks. The U.S. Department of Agriculture is investing in biosecurity measures to combat bird flu, and the U.S. has increased egg imports from other countries.</p>

          <p>Chimpanzees in Uganda have been observed using medicinal plants to treat wounds and injuries, showcasing a sophisticated understanding of natural remedies. University of Oxford scientists documented the chimps applying plants to their own wounds and occasionally to those of others, building on previous research about self-medication through plant consumption. The researchers compiled decades of observations to create a catalogue of chimpanzee "forest first aid" practices. The findings add to growing evidence that primates use natural medicines in various ways to maintain their health in the wild, suggesting a capacity for empathy among chimpanzees.</p>
