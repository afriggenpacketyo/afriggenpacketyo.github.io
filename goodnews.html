          <p>Nearly five decades after the strangulation of Jeannette Ralston in San Jose, California, authorities have charged Willie Eugene Sims with her murder. Ralston, a 24-year-old mother, was found dead in her car in 1977. The case went cold until a fingerprint from a cigarette carton at the crime scene matched Sims through an upgraded FBI database. Sims, who was an Army private stationed nearby in 1977, had a prior conviction for assault to commit murder. Investigators used DNA evidence to solidify their case, bringing closure to Ralston's family after decades of uncertainty.</p>

The House Ways and Means Committee released a preliminary partial text of its bill, though significant changes are possible.
