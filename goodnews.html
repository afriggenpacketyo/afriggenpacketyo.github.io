          <p>Chinese researchers have significantly improved the stability and lifespan of perovskite light-emitting diodes (PeLEDs).  This breakthrough addresses a major obstacle to commercial adoption, paving the way for highly energy-efficient, brighter, and potentially cheaper electronic devices. The enhanced PeLEDs achieve a brightness exceeding current commercial displays and boast a theoretical lifespan of over 21 years at standard operating brightness. This innovation could revolutionize lighting and display screen technology.</p>
