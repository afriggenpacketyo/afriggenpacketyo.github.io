          <p>A new study suggests that subsidizing men's participation in household chores and childcare could help reverse declining birth rates in countries like China. The research, co-authored by researchers from Fudan University and the University of Hong Kong, argues that subsidies for fathers produce higher long-term fertility gains than solely subsidizing mothers. China faces a rapidly aging population, shrinking workforce, and strained social welfare system, with its fertility rate estimated at 1.1 children per woman, well below the replacement level. The study highlights the persistence of traditional expectations that place the burden on women for childcare duties. </p>

          <p>AI scientist De Kai argues that artificial intelligence should be viewed as a social climate challenge, advocating for a paradigm shift in how we interact with and guide these systems. In his new book, "Raising AI: An Essential Guide to Parenting Our Future," De Kai proposes that humans should "parent" AI, acting as conscientious role models to influence its learning and development. Since AI learns by absorbing online data, it is crucial to be mindful of the information and values it is exposed to. De Kai emphasizes the importance of ethical considerations in AI development to ensure positive outcomes for society. </p>

          <p>The Japanese government plans to launch a new registration system to encourage people to maintain strong connections with rural areas affected by depopulation. The initiative aims to sign up more than 10 million users over the next decade and is a key part of Prime Minister Shigeru Ishiba's efforts to revitalize regional economies. Registered nonresidents would receive information on local events or services, with the government hoping to facilitate the flow of city dwellers into other parts of the country. The program will be launched as part of a broader strategy to boost regional growth. </p>
