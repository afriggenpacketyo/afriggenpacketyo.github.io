          <p>A new exhibit at the New York Historical Society examines the Hollywood blacklist, which began in 1947 amid investigations by the House Un-American Activities Committee into alleged Communist influence in the film industry. The display focuses on the "Hollywood Ten," a group of writers and directors who were imprisoned and blacklisted for refusing to answer the committee's questions. The article details how the blacklist expanded to affect numerous careers, including those of screenwriter Dalton Trumbo and entertainer Hazel Scott, and explores the broader impact of the Red Scare on American society. The exhibit raises questions about democracy, freedom of speech, and the consequences of punishing individuals for holding unpopular political views.</p>

          <p>Wildlife biologists in Texas are undertaking a significant conservation mission to save the state's bighorn sheep, whose population has been halved in the last five years due to disease. The disease was introduced by non-native animals brought to the region. In a carefully planned operation, biologists captured and airlifted dozens of healthy sheep from the last disease-free herd to an isolated, safe mountain range over 200 miles away. A recent check on the relocated herd revealed their successful survival and the birth of new lambs, signaling a hopeful resurgence for the native species and a monumental success for the conservation team.</p>

          <p>This article explores the validity and flexibility of common health targets, such as drinking eight glasses of water, getting seven to nine hours of sleep, and exercising 150 minutes per week. Experts offer varied perspectives; one kidney specialist suggests simply drinking when thirsty is sufficient for most, while a nutritionist highlights the benefits of hydration for preventing fatigue and brain fog. Regarding sleep, a specialist emphasizes that seven hours is a crucial minimum for long-term health, discouraging naps as a substitute. Ultimately, most experts agree that while these benchmarks are useful guides, individuals should focus on incorporating a healthy outlook into their lives without fixating on achieving every numerical goal perfectly.</p>

          <p>Tejano singer Bobby Pulido has launched an exploratory committee to consider a 2026 Democratic run for Congress in Texas's 15th district, challenging Republican incumbent Monica De La Cruz. Pulido, a political science major before his music career, stated he is tired of politicians who prioritize party over people and aims to address issues like comprehensive immigration reform and the region's struggling economy. He acknowledged that the Democratic party has been negligent in the district but criticized the recent redistricting as "cheating." Pulido plans to host "ranch halls" to connect with potential constituents and run an issues-based campaign rather than one focused on his fame.</p>

          <p>A scientific revolution is underway in women's sports, moving away from treating female athletes as "mini-men" to researching their unique physiological needs. This article delves into key areas, including how proper sports bras can improve performance by reducing breast bounce, which can alter a runner's stride length by up to four centimeters. It also examines the nuanced impact of the menstrual cycle on performance, noting that while hormonal fluctuations can affect the body, athletes have succeeded at all phases of their cycle. Additionally, the piece discusses why female athletes face a higher risk of ACL injuries, linking it to anatomical differences and historical disparities in quality training.</p>

          <p>Pitcher Walker Buehler, now with the Boston Red Sox, is preparing to face his former team, the Los Angeles Dodgers, for the first time since his departure. Buehler's time with the Dodgers was marked by postseason heroics, culminating in a legendary performance during last year's World Series victory. Reflecting on his free agency, Buehler expressed no regrets, stating the Dodgers signed the players they wanted while he signed with a team where he wanted to play. Before Friday's game, Buehler received his World Series ring from his former manager and teammates, a moment he described as a reminder of his successful and fortunate time in Los Angeles.</p>

          <p>Online claims that Derek Huffman, a Texas man who moved his family to Russia to escape what he called "LGBTQ+ propaganda," was killed in combat have been found to be without evidence. The rumor, which originated from a Maltese news site, spread rapidly across social media. However, Snopes investigated the claim and found no confirmation of his death; in fact, the family's YouTube channel, run by his wife DeAnna, has refuted the reports, stating he is alive and with his military unit. The U.S. State Department is aware of the unconfirmed reports but has no further information, reiterating its warning against travel to Russia.</p>

          <p>Twenty-five years after "Big Brother" first aired, some psychologists and sociologists are suggesting that reality TV, often dismissed as superficial, may have positive effects. The article argues that the genre can serve as a tool for social understanding by showcasing diverse demographics and lifestyles not typically seen in other media. By presenting raw, unfiltered emotions and difficult situations, shows like "Love Island" and "Embarrassing Bodies" can spark national conversations on topics like coercive control and health stigmas. Some experts believe watching these interactions can help viewers better understand social cues, develop empathy, and feel less isolated in their own experiences.</p>

          <p>A worldwide craze for matcha, the powdered Japanese green tea, is causing a significant supply shortage and driving up prices. Fueled by social media trends and a post-pandemic tourism boom in Japan, demand for matcha has skyrocketed, with some cafes reporting that a month's supply now lasts only a few days. The situation is worsened by poor harvests in Japan due to heatwaves, a shortage of tea farmers, and new U.S. tariffs on Japanese goods. In response, retailers are limiting purchases, and advocates are promoting more mindful consumption to preserve the high-grade tea for its traditional use rather than in food recipes.</p>

          <p>For the first time, multiple Christian contemporary musicians are simultaneously charting on the Billboard Hot 100, signaling a potential shift in the mainstream music landscape. This article explores the rise of Christian Contemporary Music (CCM), an industry ecosystem that mirrors mainstream styles without what it deems objectionable content. Experts discuss how megachurches like Hillsong and Bethel drive the genre's sound and how a new wave of male, country-flavored artists are finding success. The trend is seen by some as reflecting a broader cultural and political moment, connecting with a conservative search for faith and an administration that speaks of fighting anti-Christian bias.</p>

          <p>The White House has announced it will release $5.5 billion in federal education funds that it had frozen just before their scheduled distribution for the 2025-26 school year. The administration had withheld the congressionally approved money, claiming it discovered funds being used to subsidize a "radical left-wing agenda." This decision prompted widespread outrage from educators and bipartisan pushback, including from ten Republican senators who argued the freeze denied communities support for long-standing programs like after-school and summer enrichment. Following the reversal, lawmakers and education groups hailed the release of the critical funding for schools across the country.</p>

Littler held a significant lead but had to withstand a late comeback from Gilding before closing out the match at Blackpool's Winter Gardens. He will now face Northern Ireland's Josh Rock, who advanced by defeating 2023 runner-up Gerwyn Price 16-11 in a high-quality quarter-final. Rock, who had already eliminated three-time champion Michael van Gerwen, delivered another strong performance, setting up what Littler predicts will be a "cracking game" against one of his closest friends on the tour.</p>

          <p>Former U.S. Congressman George Santos has begun serving his seven-year federal prison sentence for wire fraud, identity theft, and other crimes. Santos reported to a federal correctional facility in New Jersey after pleading guilty to charges that he misused campaign funds for personal luxury expenses and lied about his background. His downfall began after a New York Times investigation revealed he had fabricated his resume, leading to his expulsion from Congress in 2023. In a final post on social media before entering prison, Santos wrote that his "rhinestones are packed" and that "legends never truly exit."</p>
