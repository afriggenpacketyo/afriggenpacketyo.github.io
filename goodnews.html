          <p>New York Governor Kathy Hochul has officially endorsed Zohran Mamdani, the Democratic mayoral nominee for New York City, nearly three months after his surprising primary victory. This key endorsement is expected to help unify the party and could influence other top Democrats, including Chuck Schumer and Hakeem Jeffries, to back Mamdani, who is currently the clear frontrunner in public opinion polls. Mamdani, a democratic socialist state lawmaker, secured the nomination on a platform focused on affordability, proposing initiatives like eliminating bus fares and expanding access to childcare. Governor Hochul, while acknowledging past disagreements, expressed confidence in his commitment to a safer and more affordable city, a stance that may also bolster her support among progressive voters.</p>

          <h2>Australia Approves World-First Chlamydia Vaccine for Koalas</h2>
          <div class="timestamp">2025-09-14 20:11:23 EDT</div>
        </div>
        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Australia has approved a pioneering single-dose vaccine designed to protect koalas from chlamydia, a major threat to the marsupial's survival and a leading cause of death. Developed over more than a decade by researchers at the University of the Sunshine Coast, this world-first vaccine aims to significantly reduce the rapid spread of the disease, which can cause blindness, infertility, and starvation in affected koalas. Unlike traditional antibiotics that often prove ineffective or have detrimental side effects, this new vaccine offers a multi-faceted approach, reducing infection, preventing the progression to clinical disease, and even reversing some existing symptoms, offering hope for critically endangered koala populations.</p>

          <p>The Los Angeles Dodgers are entering the final two weeks of their regular season with significant playoff implications, particularly regarding securing a first-round bye. Currently holding the third-best record among division champions, they face the prospect of playing in the wild-card round, which team president Andrew Friedman views as detrimental to World Series odds. A crucial series against the Philadelphia Phillies will largely determine their seeding, as they trail the Phillies by 4.5 games. The article also discusses the potential impact of the San Diego Padres challenging for the NL West title, which could lead to a different wild-card matchup.</p>

        </div>
        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Brain fog, characterized by symptoms like difficulty concentrating, forgetfulness, and mental slowness, is a common experience, not a medical condition itself. It frequently occurs when life becomes busy, stress levels rise, or during periods like menopause or perimenopause, indicating an overstretched or tired brain. Medical expert Dr. Tharaka provides practical advice to mitigate this mental cloudiness, stressing the importance of acknowledging its temporary nature and not viewing it as a personal failing. The article recommends scheduling short, deliberate breaks between tasks—even just 5-10 minutes—to allow the mind to reset, process information, and reduce lingering stress, thereby improving overall mental clarity.</p>

          <p>Corinna Brown, who portrays Gemma in Amazon's popular series "The Summer I Turned Pretty," has shed light on the rigorous secrecy protocols implemented during the show's production, especially concerning its highly anticipated third-season finale. Amazon employs extensive codenames for both the show's title and individual characters, with Brown initially believing her character was named Maeve until just before filming began. This stringent approach is designed to safeguard the plot from spoilers, a crucial measure given the series' passionate young fanbase, deeply invested in its central love triangle. Brown shared her excitement about being part of such a significant cultural phenomenon, admitting she only truly understood the scale of its fandom after the show's release.</p>

          <p>Jim Edgar, a highly regarded two-term Republican governor of Illinois, has passed away at the age of 79 due to complications from pancreatic cancer. During his tenure in the 1990s, Edgar was widely recognized for guiding the state towards greater financial stability, successfully implementing budget cuts and making a temporary income tax surcharge permanent to secure funding for public schools. A moderate Republican, he demonstrated broad appeal, even winning heavily Democratic Cook County. In later years, Edgar expressed discomfort with the Republican party's conservative shift and notably supported Kamala Harris's presidential campaign. He continued to serve as a respected statesman, contributing to academia and the Abraham Lincoln Presidential Library Foundation.</p>

          <p>Football analyst Danny Murphy contends that Manchester United's recurring problems, highlighted by their 3-0 derby loss to City, are due to player selection and positioning rather than their 3-4-2-1 system. Murphy notes improvements in team compactness and defensive shape under Ruben Amorim. However, individual mistakes, such as Bruno Fernandes's defensive lapses in a deeper midfield role and Luke Shaw being shoehorned into center-back, are costing the team. Murphy argues that while Fernandes has excellent passing, his defensive instincts are lacking for the role, and the manager must pick players better suited to specific positions to prevent errors from accumulating.</p>

For China to effectively contribute to the international order, Zheng believes it is imperative to fully embrace its secular civilization and move beyond frameworks predominantly shaped by Western thought.
