          <p>Tesla reported a 12% increase in third-quarter revenue, ending two quarters of decline, but earnings missed analyst estimates, causing a stock dip. Net income decreased by 37% due to lower EV prices and increased operating expenses related to AI and R&D projects. The quarter was also impacted by the expiration of federal tax credits for electric vehicles, which had boosted sales earlier. Tesla aims to begin volume production of the Cybercab, Semi trucks, and Megapack 3 in 2026, with Cybercab production expected to start in the second quarter. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>The University of Virginia has agreed to adhere to Trump administration guidance on racial discrimination in admissions and hiring, ending months of Justice Department scrutiny. The agreement requires UVA to provide relevant data quarterly through 2028, with the university president personally certifying compliance. The move follows the resignation of UVA's president due to pressure from the Justice Department, which accused him of failing to end DEI practices. Columbia and Brown universities have also signed similar agreements to restore federal funding, reflecting a broader effort by the Trump administration to reform higher education according to its vision.</p>

          <p>Oil prices increased by about 5% after the Trump administration imposed sanctions on Russia's largest crude companies, citing Moscow's lack of commitment to ending the war in Ukraine. Treasury Secretary Scott Bessent announced the sanctions on Rosneft and Lukoil, stating the action was to stop the killing and enforce an immediate ceasefire. The Treasury Department said the sanctions will reduce the Kremlin's ability to fund its war efforts. The global benchmark Brent crude rallied significantly following the announcement, as did U.S. crude oil. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>The University of Virginia has agreed to the Trump administration's demands regarding discrimination in admissions and hiring, ending a Justice Department investigation. The deal follows the resignation of UVA's president, who was told that the university would face severe consequences if he remained. UVA will not engage in unlawful racial discrimination and will provide relevant data to the Justice Department through 2028. Other universities, such as Pennsylvania, Columbia, and Brown, have reached similar agreements with the Trump administration regarding federal funding and alleged antisemitism.</p>

          <p>While President Trump dismisses climate change, President Xi Jinping is unveiling China's strategies for addressing the issue, including cutting emissions and increasing non-fossil fuels. Driven by rising risks of floods and extreme weather, China is re-engineering urban landscapes for climate resilience. Beijing's focus on green and low-carbon energy reflects a broader trend, with China aiming to cut emissions by 7 to 10 percent from peak levels by 2035. This transition is driven by data showing increasing climate risks and is seen as an economic opportunity for the nation.</p>

Southwest CFO Tom Doxey mentioned that increased sales from selling seat assignments would show up in the first quarter. Southwest's third-quarter profit fell more than 19% year over year to $54 million, but revenue rose 1% to $6.95 billion from the year-earlier period. (not investment advice)</p>

The cuts did not impact employees within TBD Labs, which includes many of the top-tier AI hires brought into the social media company this summer. Meta CEO Mark Zuckerberg has been frustrated with Meta's progress in AI, leading to the creation of Meta Superintelligence Labs, led by Alexandr Wang. Meta notified employees that Nov. 21 is their termination date and they're in a "non-working notice period."</p>

The controls aim to deny the use of the materials in foreign military systems, linking China’s mines directly to the heart of Western military technological superiority. China is attempting to project its regulatory power beyond its borders, but faces a steep learning curve with limited experience and tools. The listed items include metals, alloys, target materials and permanent magnets critical for advanced technologies.</p>

Adults with gum disease may be more likely to have signs of damage to the brain's white matter than people without gum disease. Having both gum disease and cavities is linked to an 86% increased risk of stroke compared to people with healthy mouths. Taking care of your mouth, including brushing, flossing, and regular dentist visits, decreases the risk.</p>

The institute noted that the mosquitoes were one of a number of new insect species discovered in Iceland in recent years due to a warming climate and the growth of international transportation.</p>
