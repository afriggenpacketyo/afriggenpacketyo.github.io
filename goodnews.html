          <p>Cameron Norrie defeated Jacob Fearnley in the French Open third round, in a match notably disrupted by fireworks from a nearby Champions League final celebration at PSG's stadium. Norrie, currently ranked 81st, leveraged his experience to overcome Fearnley, who is ranked 55th, in straight sets. Norrie acknowledged the difficulty in maintaining focus due to the constant noise, while Fearnley downplayed the impact of the distractions on his performance. Norrie is set to face Novak Djokovic in the next round, marking the first time since 1968 that two British men have reached the French Open last 16.</p>

He claimed to have only used prescription ketamine a few years ago and denied current drug use. Musk's role in the Trump administration, aimed at cutting federal spending, has yielded about $170 billion in savings, though some analyses suggest potential costs due to lost productivity.</p>

          <p>Lewis Hamilton has criticized a new rule implemented at the Spanish Grand Prix that aims to limit front wing flexibility, calling it "a waste of money." The FIA introduced a stiffer load test to reduce the aerodynamic advantage gained from flexible front wings. Hamilton stated that the rule has not changed anything significantly and has only resulted in teams spending more money on new wings. He added that the changes felt almost identical in the simulator and the money could have been better used for charitable purposes.</p>

The decision was driven by soaring egg prices and increased costs for bacon, cheese, and bread.
