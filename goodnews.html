        </div>
        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Amid rising home insurance premiums driven by an increase in extreme weather events, this article offers practical advice for homeowners to weather-proof their properties. Key recommendations include regular roof maintenance, installing storm shutters, and sealing gaps around windows and doors to prevent wind and water damage. Experts also advise clearing outside debris to reduce fire risk and cleaning gutters to prevent water backup and potential structural damage. Taking these proactive steps can reduce the likelihood of filing a claim, which may in turn help control rising insurance costs and, in some cases, qualify for discounts.</p>

          <p>An NPR correspondent shares a personal reflection on the serene beauty of the red cypress forests in Alishan, Taiwan, a place renowned for its misty mountains and high-altitude tea. The author describes the ancient, mossy forests as a source of inner calm and a personal favorite destination during their posting in Taiwan. The article captures a specific moment where late-afternoon sun rays filtering through the trees created a magical effect, which a fellow hiker described as "god's smile." This piece is part of a series sharing snapshots of life and work from NPR's international team, offering a peaceful and reflective travel vignette.</p>

          <div class="timestamp">2025-07-02 09:44:17 EDT</div>
        </div>
        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>The Wisconsin Supreme Court has ruled that a contentious 1849 law does not constitute a ban on abortion, allowing the procedure to remain legal in the state. This decision resolves a legal ambiguity that arose after the 2022 overturning of Roe v. Wade. The court, with its 4-3 liberal majority, affirmed a lower court's finding that the 19th-century statute was intended as a feticide law, criminalizing attacks on a pregnant woman's unborn child without her consent, rather than a prohibition on consensual medical abortions. Consequently, abortions up to 20 weeks will continue to be legally available in Wisconsin.</p>

          <p>During a hospital visit in Essex, Catherine, the Princess of Wales, spoke candidly about the difficult and often unrecognized challenges of life after chemotherapy. She described how patients often put on a "brave face" during treatment, only to find the recovery phase afterward to be a significant struggle where they cannot function as they used to. The princess emphasized that cancer is a life-changing experience for both the patient and their family, and that adjusting to a "new normal" is a rollercoaster process that takes time. This was her first public engagement since withdrawing from an event to balance her return to work.</p>

          <p>After nearly two decades of searching for a new home, the Federal Bureau of Investigation has announced it will relocate its headquarters to the Ronald Reagan Building in Washington, D.C. The move from the deteriorating J. Edgar Hoover Building, its home since 1975, was described by FBI Director Kash Patel as ushering the agency into a new era. This decision finalizes a long and politically charged process that had previously considered moving the headquarters to Maryland or Virginia. The new location, just blocks from the current one, is seen by the Bureau as the most cost-effective and efficient option for its mission.</p>

          <p>A Persian-language X account, which satirically presents itself as Israel's Mossad intelligence agency, has publicly named Iran's new, officially undisclosed commander of the Khatam al-Anbiya Central Headquarters. After Iran's semi-official media stated the commander's identity would be kept secret for his protection, the account launched a guessing game, later crowning an investigative journalist for correctly identifying the chief as Ali Abdollahi Aliabadi. Aliabadi is a veteran IRGC general known for his role in major construction projects. While Israeli officials have not acknowledged the account, it appears to function as a psychological operations tool, using leaks and trolling to unsettle Tehran.</p>

          <p>Australia's immigration minister, Tony Burke, has revealed that the country revoked the entry visa for the American rapper Ye, formerly Kanye West, due to his pro-Nazi song "Heil Hitler." The song, which praises Adolf Hitler, has been banned on multiple platforms for its antisemitic lyrics. Burke stated that while Ye had been visiting the country for a long time, his visa was canceled after the song's release because Australia does not need to "deliberately import bigotry." The minister clarified that the ban is not permanent, and any future visa applications would be reassessed, emphasizing that the decision was made to protect the community from hatred.</p>

          <p>A recent drop in mortgage rates has spurred a surge in refinancing activity among homeowners. According to the Mortgage Bankers Association, applications to refinance a home loan increased by 7% last week, and were 40% higher than the same week a year ago. The average contract interest rate for a 30-year fixed-rate mortgage fell to 6.79%. This decline particularly motivated borrowers with larger loans to seek savings. In contrast, demand for purchase mortgages remained flat, suggesting that overall uncertainty continues to keep many potential homebuyers on the sidelines despite the more favorable rates.

          <p>Chinese tech firm Honor has launched its new Magic V5 foldable smartphone, directly challenging market leader Samsung with a focus on a thin design and large battery capacity. The device, which measures as thin as 8.8 mm when folded, will initially be sold in China before a likely international release. The launch is strategically timed ahead of Samsung's own foldable phone event next week. While Honor has made significant strides in design and features, analysts note it still faces challenges in brand recognition and global distribution compared to the well-established Samsung, which benefits from its vertically integrated supply chain for displays and batteries.</p>
