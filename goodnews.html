The London Fire Brigade has warned of a "severe" risk of wildfires due to the high temperatures and low rainfall. However, other areas like Northern Ireland and western Scotland are seeing cooler, rainy weather.</p>

          <p>President Donald Trump has stated in an interview that he has a group of "very wealthy people" ready to buy the U.S. operations of TikTok, with a formal announcement possible within two weeks. This development comes as the September 17 deadline approaches for Chinese parent company ByteDance to divest from the platform under a 2024 law. The law was passed due to concerns that the Chinese government could access American user data and manipulate content on the popular social media app.</p>
