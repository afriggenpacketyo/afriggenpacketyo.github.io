          <p>Real Madrid right-back Trent Alexander-Arnold has been dropped from the latest England squad selected by manager Thomas Tuchel for the upcoming World Cup qualifiers. Despite being included in the previous squad, the 26-year-old was not named for the matches against Andorra and Serbia. His omission follows a period where he was not in the starting lineup for his club. In his place, the squad features first-time call-ups for Nottingham Forest midfielder Elliot Anderson and Tottenham full-back Djed Spence, signaling a shift in the team's selection strategy.</p>

          <p>Starting in January, all young children in the United Kingdom will be offered a free chickenpox vaccine on the NHS, administered in two doses at 12 and 18 months of age. The move aims to protect children from the varicella virus and its rare but severe complications, as well as reduce the economic impact of parents taking time off work to care for sick children. Previously, the vaccine was only available privately at a significant cost. This decision brings the UK in line with other countries like the US, where the vaccine has been available for decades.</p>

          <p>Elon Musk has filed a motion to dismiss a lawsuit from the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) that alleges he illegally delayed disclosing his growing stake in Twitter (now X) in 2022. The SEC claims this delay allowed Musk to purchase shares at artificially low prices, saving him approximately $150 million. Musk's legal team argues the lawsuit is a waste of resources, stating there was no investor harm, no ongoing violation, and that any filing error was immediately corrected. They also accuse the SEC of selectively targeting Musk due to his criticism of government overreach.</p>

          <p>Chinese tech giant Alibaba reported a 78% year-over-year increase in net income for the June quarter, driven primarily by gains from equity investments and the sale of its Turkish e-commerce unit. However, the company's overall revenue of $34.6 billion fell short of analysts' expectations. A key bright spot was its cloud computing division, which saw revenue grow 26% due to strong demand for AI-related products. The core e-commerce business faced mixed results, with increased investment in the highly competitive "instant commerce" space impacting profitability despite a rise in customer management revenue.</p>

          <p>India's economy demonstrated robust growth in the first quarter of the 2026 fiscal year, expanding at an annual rate of 7.8%, which surpassed economists' forecasts of 6.7%. This strong performance was primarily driven by the manufacturing, construction, and service sectors. The reported GDP growth marks an acceleration from the 7.4% growth recorded in the preceding quarter. The result aligns with projections from the World Bank and IMF, which anticipate India's economy will grow between 6.3% and 6.4% for the full fiscal year, reinforcing its position as a major fast-growing economy.

          <p>At the Bitcoin Asia 2025 conference in Hong Kong, Eric Trump expressed strong confidence in cryptocurrency, predicting that Bitcoin's value could reach one million dollars within several years. This appearance is part of a broader push by him and his brother, Donald Trump Jr., to expand their crypto-related business ventures into Asia, with further events planned in South Korea and Singapore. The tour coincides with President Donald Trump's administration embracing the digital asset industry, though it also raises concerns about potential conflicts of interest. Some Hong Kong officials reportedly withdrew from the event to avoid engaging with the president's son. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>Nearly two decades after her death during Hurricane Katrina, 81-year-old Dorothy Virginia Driggers Taquino has been formally identified, allowing her family to provide a proper burial. Taquino died in her home in a suburb of New Orleans during the 2005 storm but remained among the unidentified victims, interred in an unmarked grave at a memorial. Her identification was made possible through the investigative efforts of a local news outlet, which used autopsy records and a high school necklace to connect the dots. The discovery has brought a sense of peace to her relatives on the 20th anniversary of the disaster.</p>

          <p>Illinois has introduced IL Pride Connect, a first-of-its-kind statewide legal hotline and digital resource hub designed to provide free and affirming support to the LGBTQ+ community. The initiative, launched by Governor JB Pritzker, aims to help individuals with legal matters such as changing identity documents, accessing healthcare, and understanding their rights amid increasing hostility nationwide. This state-level action contrasts with federal policies under the Trump administration, which have included shutting down an LGBTQ+ youth suicide lifeline and cutting health funding. The hotline is seen by advocates as a vital resource and a powerful message of state support.</p>

          <div class="timestamp">2025-08-29 07:00:01 EDT</div>
        </div>
        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>A new analysis by the Bank of America Institute reveals that wealthier households return a higher percentage of their retail purchases compared to lower-income groups. In 2025, high-income shoppers refunded 5.3% of their purchases, while lower-income shoppers returned only 3.7%. The report suggests affluent consumers are more prone to "speculative" buying and a practice known as "bracketing," where they order multiple variations of an item with the intent to return most of them. This trend contributes to the high cost of returns for retailers, who are increasingly tightening their policies by charging fees or shortening return windows.</p>

          <p>A growing number of multigenerational, legacy ranches in the American West are hitting the market for the first time in decades as heirs find it difficult to manage the properties or prefer to cash out. High-end brokers report a surge in inventory of these trophy properties, which are in high demand from wealthy buyers seeking privacy and a rural lifestyle, partly fueled by the "Yellowstone" effect. These historic ranches often command premium prices due to their vast acreage and proximity to protected public lands. The trend reflects a broader generational transfer of wealth and a shift in how younger family members view these large, long-held assets.</p>

          <p>The Office of the U.S. Trade Representative (USTR) has granted a 90-day extension for tariff exclusions on 178 specific products imported from China. These items, which include chemical materials, electronic components, and medical supplies, will continue to be exempt from the Section 301 tariffs of up to 25% that were imposed during President Trump's first term. The USTR stated the decision was made after considering public comments and advice from interagency committees. This extension provides temporary relief for U.S. companies that rely on these specific imports, though the broader trade tensions with China remain unresolved. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>Parasocial relationships describe the one-sided sense of intimacy that fans develop with public figures like celebrities, podcasters, or influencers, whom they feel they know personally despite the lack of reciprocity. This phenomenon, which has existed for centuries, is now amplified by social media and the direct access it provides, blurring the lines between public personas and private individuals. While these connections can be meaningful for fans, they can also lead to entitlement and toxic behavior, such as stalking or harassment. The article explains that fans are not relating to the actual person but to a constructed "star text" created by the celebrity, media, and the fans themselves.</p>

        </div>
        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>This opinion column challenges the narrative that federal student aid is the primary driver of soaring college tuition, arguing instead that decades of declining state funding for higher education are to blame. The article traces a long history of U.S. government investment in education as a public good, from Thomas Jefferson to the G.I. Bill, noting this trend reversed in the 1980s. Since then, the financial burden has shifted from the state to individual students and their families. The author concludes that restoring affordability requires reinvesting public funds in higher education, viewing it as essential to democracy and economic stability, not a luxury item.</p>
