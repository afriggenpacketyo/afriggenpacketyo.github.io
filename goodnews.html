          <p>A North Korean envoy is scheduled to meet with China's Foreign Minister in Beijing, a development that follows Seoul's recent efforts to engage China for assistance with Pyongyang. The visit underscores the enduring ties between China and North Korea, with leaders Xi Jinping and Kim Jong Un recently reaffirming their strong bilateral relationship regardless of international shifts. During their meeting, Xi expressed a desire to enhance cooperation, while Kim praised China's "impartial position" on the Korean peninsula. The diplomatic engagement signals continued close alignment between the two neighboring countries.</p>

          <p>Apple's latest operating system, iOS 26, includes new features designed to combat the overwhelming volume of spam calls and texts that have made many users hesitant to answer their phones. A new AI-powered call screening feature, which is off by default, has Siri ask unknown callers for their name and reason for calling, transcribing the response for the user to review. Additionally, enhanced text filtering automatically sorts messages from unknown senders and suspected spam into separate folders. These tools offer more control but also reflect a broader industry trend of using technology to reclaim basic phone functionality.</p>

          <p>In a notable moment during a Carabao Cup match, brothers Jaden and Reigan Heskey, sons of former England international Emile Heskey, both made their senior debuts for Manchester City. Manager Pep Guardiola brought the two academy graduates onto the pitch in a 2-0 victory against Huddersfield. Jaden, 19, is a midfielder, while Reigan, 17, is a winger; both have been with the club's youth setup since the age of eight. Their appearance marks a proud family milestone and adds them to a growing list of players who have followed their fathers into top-flight English football.</p>

          <h2>Research Suggests AI Has Changed the Method, Not the Rate, of Student Cheating</h2>

        </div>
        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>An education researcher argues that while generative AI has introduced new ways for students to cheat, it may not have significantly increased the overall prevalence of academic dishonesty, which was already high. Citing survey data from before and after the release of ChatGPT, the article suggests that the percentage of students engaging in cheating behaviors has remained relatively stable. However, AI is capturing a share of these activities, with a notable percentage of students using it to write entire assignments. The author calls for a nuanced conversation about why students cheat and how educational systems should adapt to a future where AI is ubiquitous.</p>

          <p>Following an investigation by the UK's Competition and Markets Authority (CMA), Ticketmaster has agreed to provide fans with clearer information about ticket prices. The inquiry was prompted by complaints over the sale of Oasis reunion tour tickets, where fans faced unexpectedly high costs due to a tiered pricing system that was not clearly explained. While the CMA found no evidence of algorithmic "dynamic pricing," it concluded Ticketmaster may have misled consumers. The company will now have to provide more upfront information about pricing structures and ensure ticket labels are not misleading, with regular compliance reporting.</p>

          <h2>Analysis Suggests NYC Mayoral Candidate's FIFA Campaign Could Reconnect Progressive Politics with Sports</h2>

          <p>New York City mayoral nominee Zohran Mamdani's recent campaign against FIFA's dynamic pricing for the 2026 World Cup is being analyzed as a strategic move to engage a new political audience. The article argues that while conservative politicians have long used sports to connect with voters, Democrats have often kept sports at arm's length. By framing the high cost of World Cup tickets as an affordability issue, Mamdani taps into soccer's progressive-leaning fanbase and uses the sport as a potent symbol of unchecked capitalism. This approach is seen as a potential blueprint for the left to re-engage with sports culture.</p>

          <p>Millions of California residents will see a credit on their October electricity bills as part of the state's biannual California Climate Credit program. The refund is funded by the state's cap-and-invest program, which requires large polluters to pay for their greenhouse gas emissions. The credit amount varies by utility provider, with customers of PG&E, Southern California Edison, and SDG&E receiving between $56 and $82. The credit is applied automatically to residential and small-business customer bills. Due to a recent extension of the program, these refunds are expected to increase in the coming years.</p>
