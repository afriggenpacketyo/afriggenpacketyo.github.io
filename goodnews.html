          <p>Shohei Ohtani propelled the Los Angeles Dodgers to a 7-4 win against the Miami Marlins with a powerful two-run home run, marking his ninth of the season. Ohtani's homer, clocked at 117.9 miles per hour, was the hardest-hit in Major League Baseball this season. Ohtani reflected on his confidence boost after homering off a great pitcher in a clutch situation. Freddie Freeman also contributed with a two-run homer, and South Korean rookie Kim Hye Seong notched his first two major league hits, driving in a run for the Dodgers.</p>

          <p>Credit Suisse Services AG will pay nearly $511 million after pleading guilty to conspiring with wealthy American taxpayers to conceal over $4 billion in offshore accounts, according to the Department of Justice. The UBS subsidiary also entered a non-prosecution agreement related to U.S. accounts booked at Credit Suisse AG Singapore, which held over $2 billion in undeclared assets for U.S. persons. This plea comes after Credit Suisse's 2014 guilty plea for similar offenses, marking a breach of their previous agreement.

          <p>K-pop star Lisa from Blackpink sparked discussion at the Met Gala with her black lace ensemble, specifically the pattern of tiny, intricate faces composing the lace. Louis Vuitton revealed that the lace replicated elements of artwork by American artist Henry Taylor, known for portraits of figures in his life. Taylor recently painted a portrait of Pharrell Williams, Louis Vuitton's men's wear creative director, and collaborated with Williams for his debut show in Paris, embroidering miniature portraits by the artist on suits and accessories.

Over 64.9% of foreign visitors were from countries involved in China's Belt and Road Initiative, contributing to more than 60% of the total transaction volume.

          <p>Asian shares were mostly higher early Tuesday, rebounding after benchmarks fell on Wall Street. A monthly survey measuring future activity in China's services sector fell to its lowest level, signaling that the escalation of the U.S. President Donald Trump's trade war is hitting the world's second-largest economy. U.S. benchmark crude oil picked up 74 cents to $57.87 per barrel, while Brent crude, the international standard, also added 74 cents, $60.97 per barrel. Markets have been absorbing the shock of tariffs and the growing trade war. Concerns about inflation reigniting also have deepened.</p>

          <p>In response to President Trump's call for tariffs on movies filmed overseas, California Gov. Gavin Newsom proposed a $7.5 billion federal film tax credit to support the entertainment industry. The proposal aims to counter the loss of film and television production to states and nations offering incentives and cheaper labor. While the White House has not yet responded, the move reflects a broader effort to address the challenges facing Hollywood and retain jobs in the industry. Industry workers and state officials have sought to increase the amount of funding for filming made available by the state of California, and some have also begun pushing for a federal tax credit that can be layered on top of state incentives.</p>
