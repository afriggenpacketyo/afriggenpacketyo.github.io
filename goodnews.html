          <p>This opinion article suggests that Indonesian President Prabowo Subianto is positioned to introduce a new, pragmatic approach to international relations amid global instability. As a leader of an economic powerhouse not aligned with a single ideological bloc, Prabowo could champion a form of "constructive pragmatism." This philosophy prioritizes cooperation over confrontation, potentially offering a corrective model for a dysfunctional international system. The article posits that his leadership could provide a practical road map for middle powers to navigate complex geopolitical tensions and foster a more stable world order.</p>

          <p>Director Guillermo del Toro's long-awaited adaptation of "Frankenstein" has premiered at the Venice Film Festival, starring Oscar Isaac as Victor Frankenstein and Jacob Elordi as his creation. The ambitious, nearly two-and-a-half-hour film is a project del Toro has dreamed of making for decades, focusing on a more beautiful and newborn-like creature to explore themes of humanity and imperfection. Early reviews are divided, with some critics praising it as one of del Toro's finest works for its epic scale and artistry, while others found it visually impressive but lacking in substance and emotional voltage.</p>

          <p>Ahead of the 80th anniversary of Victory Day, this article examines how remembering the shared history of Sino-American cooperation during World War II could serve as a foundation for improving current bilateral relations. It highlights forgotten stories of collaboration, such as the efforts of Chinese villagers who risked their lives to protect American airmen from the Japanese army. By focusing on this historical alliance against a common foe, the article suggests that both nations could find common ground and foster better understanding from a grassroots level, moving beyond present-day geopolitical tensions.</p>

          <p>Sabrina Carpenter's new album, "Man's Best Friend," serves as a follow-up to her breakout success, focusing on the theme that pop superstardom has not improved her romantic life. The album humorously chronicles encounters with various unimpressive men, set to a soundscape blending '70s AM-radio pop with country and disco influences, crafted with producer Jack Antonoff. While the article notes it may not be as consistently sharp as its predecessor, "Short n' Sweet," it praises standout tracks for their wit and Carpenter's versatile vocal performance, which deftly lampoons modern dating dynamics and social power structures.</p>

          <p>President Donald Trump announced he had solved a minor mystery at the White House involving a long, deep gash found in the newly installed limestone in the Rose Garden. In a social media post, Trump described his anger upon discovering the damage and his immediate demand for an investigation. According to the president, security footage revealed that a subcontractor using a broken, tilting steel cart was responsible for scraping the stone. Trump stated that the contractor would be charged for the replacement and barred from future work at the White House, emphasizing the importance of surfaces to him as a builder.</p>

        </div>
        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>This article synthesizes expert consensus on appropriate screen time for children, emphasizing that limits should align with developmental stages. For toddlers under three, experts recommend a screen-free environment to encourage exploration of the physical world and self-regulation of attention. For kindergarten-aged children, a maximum of 30 minutes is suggested to foster imagination and social skills through play. As children enter elementary school and adolescence, the focus shifts from strict time limits to the quality of content and maintaining open communication, ensuring digital consumption does not replace crucial real-world interactions and social development.</p>

          <p>Everton manager David Moyes has lauded Jack Grealish's performance, calling him "better than I thought" after the player provided two assists in a 3-2 win at Wolverhampton Wanderers. Since joining Everton on loan from Manchester City, Grealish has been instrumental, registering multiple assists in consecutive games and demonstrating a creative edge. Despite his strong club form, Grealish was recently left out of the England squad, but Moyes believes the player is thriving with more game time and is successfully proving his quality, describing him as a "maverick" who makes a significant difference for the team.</p>

          <p>Donald Trump was seen publicly on Saturday for the first time since unfounded rumors of his death trended on social media. The 79-year-old was photographed at the White House with his grandchildren before a family golf outing in Virginia. The online speculation was fueled by recent comments from Vice President J.D. Vance about being prepared to step in should a tragedy occur, which raised concerns about Trump's health. The White House has previously addressed health concerns, attributing bruising on his hands to frequent handshaking and a recent diagnosis of a benign venous condition.</p>

          <p>A Hamburg brewery has launched a unique and limited-edition beer named "Currydurst," which translates to "Currythirst." The unconventional beverage is a collaboration between the local Astra St. Pauli Brewery and Hela, the producer of a famous spiced curry ketchup that is a staple condiment for Germany's classic Currywurst sausage snack. The beer infuses Astra's classic brew with the spicy and smoky flavor profile of the ketchup, creating a homage to Hamburg's street food culture. Only 2,000 liters of the special edition beer will be produced, leaving its potential for cult status uncertain.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>A federal judge has dealt a significant blow to the Trump administration's immigration agenda by blocking the expanded use of expedited removal. U.S. District Judge Jia Cobb ruled that the administration's policy of applying this streamlined deportation process to immigrants in the interior of the country, often without a court hearing, is unlawful. The ruling curtails the ability of authorities to quickly remove migrants who cannot prove they have been in the U.S. for over two years. The judge's opinion emphasized that the government's arguments threatened the due process rights of both noncitizens and citizens alike.</p>

          <p>New York City health officials have officially declared an end to the Legionnaires' disease outbreak in central Harlem, as no new cases have been reported since August 9. The outbreak resulted in 114 cases, 90 hospitalizations, and seven deaths. The source of the bacteria was traced to cooling towers at Harlem Hospital and a nearby construction site, both of which have since been disinfected. In response, Mayor Eric Adams announced new proposals to prevent future clusters, including more frequent testing of cooling towers and expanding the health department's inspection and sampling capacity.</p>
