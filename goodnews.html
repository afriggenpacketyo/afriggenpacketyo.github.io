        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>CrowdStrike's stock experienced a drop after the cybersecurity firm released a lower-than-expected revenue forecast for the current quarter, with projections ranging from $1.14 billion to $1.15 billion, below analysts' estimates of $1.16 billion. The company cited the ongoing impact of a widespread outage from the previous July, which temporarily disrupted flights and hospital procedures, as a contributing factor. Burt Podbere, the finance chief, mentioned that ending the customer commitment packages program reduced revenue by approximately $11 million in the quarter and anticipates a further $10 million to $15 million impact through the fiscal year's end. Despite the disappointing guidance, CrowdStrike exceeded earnings estimates for the first fiscal quarter, reporting adjusted earnings per share of 73 cents, surpassing the expected 65 cents, and announced a $1 billion share repurchase plan. The optimism score for this article is 60.</p>

          <p>Reddit has filed a lawsuit against AI startup Anthropic, alleging breach of contract and unfair business practices related to the unauthorized use of Reddit's platform data for training AI models. The lawsuit claims Anthropic trained its models on the personal data of Reddit users without consent, causing harm to Reddit through the commercial exploitation of its content. Reddit asserts that other AI companies, like OpenAI and Google, have licensing agreements that respect user privacy, unlike Anthropic. The lawsuit seeks damages and demands Anthropic comply with contractual and legal obligations, marking a significant development in the ongoing debate over data usage in AI training.
