          <div class="timestamp">2025-09-22 02:14:00 EDT</div>

          <p>This article explores the intricate relationship between the birth control pill and women's sex drive, revealing a spectrum of experiences among users. Many women report a noticeable decrease in libido, while others experience no change or even an increase due to the psychological relief of contraception. Researchers suggest the pill's impact on sex hormone-binding globulin, which reduces free testosterone, may contribute to diminished desire. However, the varying hormonal compositions of different pills and the multifaceted nature of libido, influenced by psychological, relational, and social factors, make a universal conclusion challenging. The article also touches on the societal context, including conservative narratives and a general lack of open discussion around women's health and contraception.</p>

          <p>Former Deputy Prime Minister Sir Nick Clegg expressed his disapproval of the UK government's "cringey" and "endless knee-bending" to US President Donald Trump. Speaking at a Liberal Democrat conference, Clegg urged Prime Minister Sir Keir Starmer to uphold British values rather than solely pursuing a constructive relationship with the unpredictable US president. He argued that the government's approach is based on a "rubbish" miscalculation that the UK doesn't need to choose between the US and the EU. Clegg also supported the Liberal Democrats' strong condemnation of Elon Musk's comments to UK protesters, labeling them an "outrageous intrusion into our sovereignty," and ruled out a return to active politics himself.</p>

          <h2>Gatwick Airport's Second Runway Expansion Receives Government Approval</h2>
          <div class="timestamp">2025-09-22 02:06:32 EDT</div>
        </div>
        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Transport Secretary Heidi Alexander has approved a £2.2 billion plan for a second runway at London Gatwick Airport, a privately-financed project aimed at boosting economic growth. The expansion involves repurposing the existing Northern Runway for regular use, projected to increase annual flights to 389,000 and passenger capacity to 80 million by the late 2030s. This approval follows earlier concerns from planning inspectors regarding traffic and noise, leading to agreements for stricter noise controls and increased public transport usage targets. Despite government and some political support for job creation and investment, the project faces significant opposition from climate campaigners who criticize its environmental impact and question its long-term economic benefits.</p>

Adam Smith, held discussions with Chinese Premier Li Qiang during a rare congressional visit to Beijing, advocating for enhanced military-to-military dialogue. This marks the first House delegation visit since 2019, signaling an effort to mend strained US-China relations, which have been impacted by trade disputes, the status of Taiwan, and China's stance on Russia. Premier Li characterized the trip as "icebreaking," emphasizing the global importance of cooperation between the two influential nations. The visit precedes a scheduled meeting between President Trump and Chinese leader Xi Jinping at an upcoming regional summit, indicating ongoing diplomatic engagement.</p>

          <p>Europe is witnessing a significant uptick in Initial Public Offerings (IPOs), sparking optimism for a much-needed market rebound despite persistent investor interest in private markets. Recent notable listings include Aumovio in Frankfurt and Swiss Marketplace Group in Zurich, while Verisure and NOBA are also preparing substantial debuts in Sweden. This surge in activity, which Bank of America describes as the busiest in 18 months, suggests that both issuers and private equity firms are increasingly viewing public offerings as an attractive exit route. Contributing factors to this resurgence include low market volatility and improved dollar-based returns on European equity investments, which are drawing new US capital to the continent.

          <p>Rachael De Foe, a Singaporean professional, dramatically increased her income to $220,000 annually by transitioning from a demanding 9-to-5 public relations role to a fractional work model. Burnt out in late 2019, she quit her job, and the COVID-19 pandemic unexpectedly opened doors as businesses sought cost-effective communications solutions. De Foe established her company, Redefy, becoming a fractional head of communications—a role distinct from freelancing, where she leads strategy for multiple clients part-time. This approach has not only tripled her previous salary but also granted her significant autonomy, enabling her to avoid burnout and pursue personal and professional fulfillment by choosing her projects and clients.</p>

          <p>President Trump has indicated that media magnates Rupert and Lachlan Murdoch, alongside Michael Dell, could be involved in the acquisition deal to place TikTok's US operations under American control. This proposed arrangement seeks to mitigate national security risks associated with potential Chinese manipulation of the app's algorithm and user data. Oracle founder Larry Ellison was already confirmed as a participant in the consortium, which plans for Americans to hold six of seven seats on a new TikTok board. Trump, who once considered banning the app, now credits it with aiding his election victory. The deal, discussed with Chinese President Xi Jinping, still requires final approval and signing to proceed. (not investment advice)</p>
