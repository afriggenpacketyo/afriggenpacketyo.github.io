          <p>After reaching Category 5 status, Hurricane Erin has been downgraded to a powerful Category 4 storm over the Atlantic, with maximum sustained winds of 150 mph. The National Hurricane Center reports that the storm's center is projected to pass north of Puerto Rico and the Virgin Islands, avoiding a direct impact on the continental United States. Tropical storm watches have been issued for several Caribbean islands, which are expected to experience heavy rain and dangerous surf conditions. Forecast models indicate a high-pressure system will steer Erin northward, away from the U.S. East Coast, though it may pass closer to Bermuda next week.</p>

          <p>A derelict Napoleonic fort on Thorne Island, off the coast of Pembrokeshire, Wales, has been transformed into a luxury party venue and is now on the market for £3 million. Former software CEO Mike Conner purchased the abandoned, listed building in 2017 for £555,000 and undertook a challenging five-year renovation. The once-ruined fortress now features 40 beds, en-suite bathrooms, and a nightclub, overcoming immense logistical hurdles like having no running water or electricity. Conner hopes the island's next owner will utilize its potential as a unique tourist attraction or event space, bringing jobs and revenue to the local Welsh economy.</p>

          <div class="timestamp">2025-08-16 20:18:34 EDT</div>
        </div>
        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>As school holidays increase financial pressure on families, parents are sharing creative strategies to manage rising food costs. Techniques include buying reduced "yellow sticker" items to freeze for later, pre-portioning daily snacks into separate bags to prevent overconsumption, and organizing refrigerators to use up items nearing their expiration date first. Many families also rely on community pantries that provide surplus food from supermarkets at a low cost. These methods help stretch budgets, especially for parents of children who normally receive free or subsidized meals during the school term, ensuring that nothing goes to waste during the summer break.</p>

          <p>In response to limited space, the historic Hollywood Forever Cemetery has opened a new, five-story vertical mausoleum, adding a modern architectural landmark to Los Angeles. The Gower Mausoleum provides permanent housing for approximately 13,000 people, allowing the cemetery to meet community needs by building upward rather than outward. Designed with natural light and marble, the structure aims to offer a peaceful environment for visitors and has already sold out two of its five floors. This development is part of the cemetery's broader strategy to serve as a cultural hub for the living, hosting events like movie nights and festivals.</p>

          <p>A group of students in the UK have opened time capsule letters they wrote to their future selves as 11-year-olds in 2021, just after returning to school from a COVID-19 lockdown. The letters reveal their anxieties about the pandemic and their hopes for the future as they prepared to sit their GCSE exams. Written during a period of significant educational disruption, including remote learning and classroom 'bubbles,' the letters served as a poignant reminder of their resilience and ambitions. As they await their exam results, the students reflect on how their secondary school experience was uniquely shaped by the global health crisis and their personal growth since then.</p>

          <p>A new wave of Chinese restaurant chains is expanding globally, introducing diners to authentic, diverse regional cuisines far beyond Westernized staples like chow mein and sweet-and-sour chicken. Brands specializing in fiery Hunan dishes, savory Zhejiang seafood, and other regional specialties are using Singapore as a launchpad for international growth. These establishments aim to correct outdated perceptions of Chinese food by offering sophisticated, immersive dining experiences that reflect the country's vast gastronomic culture. This culinary expansion is seen by some as a potent form of soft power, potentially helping to soften China's image on the world stage through shared cultural appreciation.</p>

          <p>A new box set, "Sunset Boulevard," chronicles the final burst of musical creativity from Elvis Presley, collecting recordings made in Los Angeles between 1972 and 1975. This period includes his last Top 10 hit, "Burning Love," and poignant ballads like "Separate Ways," recorded as his marriage to Priscilla Presley was ending. The collection also sheds light on a pivotal moment of disappointment when Presley lost the co-starring role in "A Star Is Born" opposite Barbra Streisand, an event friends believe accelerated his career decline. The set offers a fresh look at a mature artist grappling with personal turmoil and a changing cultural landscape before his death in 1977.</p>

          <p>Australian snooker player Neil Robertson won the Saudi Arabia Masters title after defeating Ronnie O'Sullivan 10-9 in a thrilling final match in Jeddah.

          <p>Samsung is gaining ground on Apple in the U.S. smartphone market, with its market share surging from 23% to 31% in the second quarter, while Apple's declined from 56% to 49%. This shift is partly driven by the growing popularity of Samsung's innovative foldable phones, such as the Z Fold 7, which offer new form factors that appeal to consumers. While Apple still leads the U.S. market, Samsung's wider range of products at various price points and its experimentation with new designs are creating renewed competition. Analysts suggest Apple may respond by releasing its own slimmer and foldable iPhone models in the coming years. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>Manchester City began their season with a commanding 4-0 victory over Wolves, highlighted by an exceptional debut from new signing Tijjani Reijnders. The 27-year-old Dutch midfielder contributed both a goal and an assist, becoming only the second City player to do so on a Premier League debut. Manager Pep Guardiola praised Reijnders as a "top signing," highlighting his pace and ability to create space. The all-action performance suggests Reijnders will be a key figure in City's midfield, especially as the team looks to rebound from a disappointing previous season and reassert their dominance in the league.</p>
