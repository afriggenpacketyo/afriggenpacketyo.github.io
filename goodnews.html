          <h2>Number of Missing Persons in Texas Floods Drastically Reduced</h2>
          <div class="timestamp">2025-07-19 22:22:22 EDT</div>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Officials in Kerr County, Texas, have significantly lowered the number of individuals listed as missing following recent devastating floods, from nearly 100 down to just three. This reduction is attributed to intensive follow-up work by local, state, and federal agencies that successfully verified the safety of many people previously unaccounted for. While this marks a positive development in the recovery efforts, the article notes the broader tragedy remains immense, with the total death toll from the statewide flooding standing at 134 people, including 107 in Kerr County alone. The community expresses gratitude for the tireless work of over a thousand emergency responders.</p>

          <p>Actress Jennifer Love Hewitt has responded to long-standing rumors of a feud with her co-star Sarah Michelle Gellar, stating she finds the speculation amusing as they have not spoken since the original film's release when she was 18. Hewitt downplayed any animosity, suggesting the narrative of conflict is often created by others. The rumors gained new life with the release of a new sequel in the "I Know What You Did Last Summer" franchise, which Hewitt and Gellar's husband, Freddie Prinze Jr., both star in. Despite attending the same premiere, the two actresses did not cross paths, which Gellar later explained on Instagram was due to the event's chaotic nature.</p>

          <p>England's rugby team achieved a decisive six-try victory over the US Eagles in a match marked by challenging humidity and two separate lightning delays in Washington D.C. Despite the disruptions, the mostly young English squad demonstrated superior precision, with hooker Curtis Langdon scoring the first try and captain George Ford guiding the offense effectively. The US team struggled to counter England's organized attacks, particularly their driving mauls. The event, part of a doubleheader, drew a record crowd for the preceding women's game, reflecting World Rugby's long-term investment in growing the sport's audience in the United States ahead of future World Cups.</p>

          <p>Players at the WNBA All-Star Game made a powerful statement by wearing warmup shirts with the slogan “Pay us what you owe us.” This unified protest was a direct response to the failure to reach a new collective bargaining agreement (CBA) with the league. The WNBA Players Association, which opted out of the previous CBA, is seeking significant improvements, including a better revenue-sharing model, higher salaries, and enhanced benefits. With negotiations at a standstill and a large discrepancy reported between the players' demands and the league's offers, prominent players have raised the possibility of a walkout if a deal is not reached by October.</p>

          <p>UK Home Secretary Yvette Cooper announced plans for a powerful new law designed to prevent mass killings by targeting individuals who are preparing for attacks but lack a specific ideological motive. This move aims to close a legal gap, as current terrorism laws require an ideological link to prosecute for preparatory acts. The proposed legislation, prompted by incidents like the Southport attack, would give police similar powers to intervene and charge suspects for planning mass violence, regardless of their motivation. The goal is to treat the plotting of such devastating attacks with the same seriousness as terrorism, enhancing public safety.</p>

          <p>Los Angeles Dodgers manager Dave Roberts made the decision to give superstar shortstop Mookie Betts a day off to help him mentally reset from a season-long performance slump. Betts, who has been visibly frustrated, is experiencing a career-worst start to the season, with his batting average and OPS falling to uncharacteristically low levels. Roberts stated he wanted to take the decision out of Betts' hands, allowing him to watch a game from a different perspective and work on his mechanics without the pressure of performing. The move underscores the urgency of Betts' struggles and the team's hope for his quick return to form.</p>

          <p>Pop star Katy Perry handled a technical issue with professionalism during a concert in San Francisco when a midair prop malfunctioned. While performing her song "Roar" suspended above the audience on a large mechanical butterfly, the prop suddenly dropped a few feet. Videos show the singer was momentarily startled but quickly regained her composure and continued with the performance without missing a beat. The butterfly prop continued its flight path, and Perry was safely returned to the stage, later remarking, "Not today, Satan." The incident concluded without any injuries, highlighting the unpredictable nature of complex stage productions.</p>

          <p>Motorists across the UK are devising strategies to avoid steep drop-off fees at major airports, which have seen significant price hikes. At Edinburgh Airport, for example, a 10-minute stay in the drop-off zone costs £6, with drivers parking in nearby lay-bys and coordinating pickups by phone to evade the charge. This behavior highlights public frustration with the so-called "kiss-and-fly" tariffs, which critics call extortionate and greedy. While airports maintain that free drop-off zones are available further from the terminals, many drivers, especially those with passengers who have mobility issues, find the fees unavoidable or the alternatives impractical.</p>

          <p>A debate is growing in the UK over the traditional six-week school summer holiday, with some advocating for a shorter break to benefit students and families. Proponents argue that a long holiday widens the learning gap between children from different socioeconomic backgrounds and creates significant childcare challenges for working parents. However, others, particularly teachers, contend that the long break is essential for them to recharge and plan for the upcoming school year. The discussion also touches on how spreading holidays throughout the year could affect vacation costs and whether hotter summers due to climate change should be a factor.</p>

          <p>The UK's chancellor, Rachel Reeves, has signaled a push to encourage savers to move money from low-interest cash accounts into stocks and shares investments to stimulate the economy. The government plans to launch new advertising campaigns and have banks send targeted messages to savers, arguing that the benefits of investing are often overshadowed by risk warnings. The debate includes the possibility of altering the tax-free allowance for cash ISAs to incentivize a shift toward investment ISAs. Critics, however, warn this approach could backfire if new investors face short-term losses and stress the need for better financial education. (not investment advice)</p>

With high demand and long waiting lists at older establishments, these new spaces provide a haven for networking, business, and leisure.

Recent data from universities and secondary schools in these countries shows a significant decline in language course enrollments, with US university numbers down 25% from their 2013 peak. This "huge shift" marks a notable reversal of a trend that was once fueled by the perception of Mandarin as the language of the future due to China's economic ascent.
