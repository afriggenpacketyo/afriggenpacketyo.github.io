          <p>History teachers across the U.S. are implementing new strategies to educate students who have no living memory of the September 11, 2001 terrorist attacks. Through programs like one hosted by the 9/11 Memorial and Museum, educators connect with survivors and first responders to bring authentic, first-hand accounts into their classrooms. The curriculum focuses on conveying the national trauma, the subsequent global war on terror, and the period of national unity that followed the attacks. These efforts aim to ensure that the historical significance and complex legacy of 9/11 are not forgotten.</p>

          <p>Markets in the Asia-Pacific region displayed a mixed performance after U.S. stocks reached record highs, driven by optimism over cooling inflation and potential Federal Reserve rate cuts. Japan's Nikkei 225 and South Korea's Kospi both saw gains, while Australia's S&P/ASX 200 and Hong Kong's Hang Seng Index futures pointed to declines. In the United States, the S&P 500 and Nasdaq Composite closed at new records, although the Dow Jones Industrial Average fell, partly due to a decline in Apple's stock price following its latest product announcement.

          <p>China is implementing a pragmatic, state-directed strategy in the global artificial intelligence race, focusing on practical applications rather than the massive private investments seen in the U.S. Through its "AI+" initiative and a national fund of over $8 billion, Beijing is integrating AI into critical sectors like energy and industry. This approach aims to leverage China's existing infrastructure and talent to build a robust ecosystem, even while facing U.S. restrictions on advanced chips. The strategy prioritizes developing immediately usable technology to drive economic and societal progress, differing from the U.S. pursuit of human-level artificial general intelligence.

A deal with a major international carrier like AirAsia would be a major breakthrough for the state-owned manufacturer Comac, which designed the single-aisle jet to challenge the dominance of the Boeing 737 and Airbus A320. The growing interest in the C919 reflects the expanding economic and travel links between China and nations in the ASEAN bloc.</p>

          <p>Supreme Court Justice Amy Coney Barrett promoted her new memoir at the Ronald Reagan Presidential Library, one day after siding with the conservative majority in a contentious immigration ruling. The decision, which permits federal agents in Southern California to detain people based on appearance or language, has fueled accusations of 4th Amendment violations. While Barrett's talk focused on personal anecdotes rather than jurisprudence, she alluded to the legal debate by discussing the interpretive "play in the joints" of the 4th Amendment. The event drew a supportive crowd that praised her for her role in key conservative legal victories.</p>

          <p>CNBC's Jim Cramer has issued a buy recommendation for the newly public financial technology company Klarna, following its strong debut on the stock market. The Swedish "buy now, pay later" firm saw its shares climb significantly after pricing its IPO above the expected range. Cramer argued that despite the initial surge, Klarna's valuation remains reasonable and its fundamentals, such as improving profitability and solid credit quality, are promising. He suggested that the success of publicly traded competitors indicates strong growth potential for Klarna in the expanding sector. (not investment advice)</p>

          <h2>The Decline of Traditional TV Cooking Shows and the Rise of Online Food Influencers</h2>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Traditional television cooking shows are facing a steep decline, with commissions for the genre in the UK dropping by 44% in the last year. This downturn is attributed to the rise of food content on platforms like YouTube and TikTok, where creators can produce content with greater speed, authenticity, and direct audience engagement. Unlike the slow, heavily regulated world of broadcast television, online influencers can quickly capitalize on trends and build loyal communities. While some highly authentic formats like "The Great British Bake Off" continue to succeed, the broader "stand and stir" genre is losing its cultural relevance to a new generation of digital creators.</p>

          <p>A senior White House technology adviser is calling for the U.S. to proactively defend its lead in artificial intelligence by exporting complete "AI tech stacks" to allied nations. This strategy would involve providing not just advanced chips but also integrated algorithms and applications to create a cohesive, U.S.-led global AI ecosystem. The goal is to prevent China from gaining dominant market share and to undercut the growth of American rivals. The adviser warned that the technological gap between the U.S. and China has narrowed significantly, necessitating urgent and coordinated action on export controls and supply chain security.</p>

          <p>Shares of online real estate platform Opendoor soared by 30% in after-hours trading following a major leadership overhaul. The company appointed former Shopify executive Kaz Nejatian as its new CEO and named influential co-founder Keith Rabois as chairman of the board. This move comes after a period of intense investor pressure, led in part by Rabois, which resulted in the resignation of the previous CEO. The company's stock has seen a dramatic turnaround this year after nearly being delisted, fueled by a surge of interest from retail investors. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>Researchers are examining the "dark DNA" of Australia's vibrant peacock spiders to unlock the secrets of their incredible diversity, which includes more than 100 known species. This so-called dark DNA consists of non-coding genetic material that is far more prevalent in these spiders than in humans and is believed to drive their rapid evolution. Each tiny species boasts unique colors and performs an elaborate, rhythmic mating dance. By mapping the DNA of every species and correlating it with their distinct behaviors, scientists hope to understand the fundamental processes that create such rich biodiversity in the natural world.</p>

          <p>In a bipartisan vote, the U.S. House of Representatives has passed a measure to repeal the two Authorizations for the Use of Military Force (AUMFs) that justified the wars in Iraq in 1991 and 2003. This move is part of a sustained effort by members of Congress to reassert their constitutional power over matters of war and peace. Proponents of the repeal argue that the decades-old authorizations are obsolete and create a risk of misuse by presidents seeking to launch military actions without new congressional approval. The measure, attached to the annual defense bill, now faces consideration in the Senate.</p>

          <p>For the first time since the pandemic began, COVID-19 is no longer among the top 10 leading causes of death in the United States, according to preliminary 2024 data from the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention. The disease, which was the third leading cause of death in 2020 and 2021, has steadily declined in mortality, though it still remains in the top 15. The data also indicates that overall U.S. death rates fell for the third consecutive year. Heart disease and cancer continue to be the top two causes of death, collectively accounting for over 40% of all fatalities.</p>
