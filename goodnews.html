          <p>Trentham Monkey Forest in Staffordshire has announced the birth of three Barbary macaque monkeys, a species with fewer than 8,000 individuals remaining in the wild. Staff members at the sanctuary expressed their excitement over the new arrivals, discovered during morning feeding rounds. The 60-acre site, home to 140 Barbary macaques, anticipates more births during its "baby season," with expectations of six to ten births annually. The sanctuary collaborates with organizations dedicated to safeguarding wild Barbary macaques in Morocco and Algeria, striving to raise awareness about the species' endangered status.</p>

          <p>Chinese biotechnology firms are increasingly engaging in mega drug-licensing deals with multinational corporations, driven by cost savings and depressed valuations. These deals often utilize a "newco structure," combining traditional intellectual property licensing with fundraising through a newly established corporate vehicle. CSPC Pharmaceutical Group recently announced potential deals worth up to US$5 billion for its drug candidates, leading to a surge in its shares. This trend reflects an alternative approach for Chinese biotech firms to raise capital amid challenging market conditions, with the number and value of deals exceeding those of the previous year.</p>

          <p>China has agreed to initiate steps to resume imports of Japanese seafood, reversing a ban imposed following the release of treated radioactive wastewater from the Fukushima nuclear power plant. Japanese authorities anticipate a public notice easing the ban, in place since August 2023, and the reopening of registration for Japanese facilities processing marine products. Japan will continue advocating for the removal of remaining restrictions on food imports from 10 Japanese prefectures, imposed after the 2011 earthquake and tsunami. This agreement marks a potential easing of tensions between the two nations, though the registration process and radiation checks may delay shipments for a few months.</p>

          <p>The Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) has formally dropped its lawsuit against Binance and its founder, Changpeng Zhao, concluding a major crypto enforcement action. The lawsuit, initiated in June 2023, accused Binance of illegally serving U.S. users, inflating trading volumes, and commingling customer funds. This dismissal signals a potential shift in regulatory approach towards the crypto industry, especially with the Trump administration's efforts to be seen as an ally to the industry. Binance, the world's largest digital assets exchange, has also recently established ties with World Liberty Financial, a project with connections to the Trump family.</p>

          <p>A prominent Chinese economist, Lian Ping, has cautioned that financial sanctions and countermeasures could become a new battleground in the escalating China-US rivalry. While the likelihood of full-scale financial sanctions remains slim, Washington could adopt a strategy of targeting specific Chinese entities before gradually expanding the scope. Lian noted that implementing full-blown financial sanctions, such as cutting China off from the Swift system, would be difficult due to China's significant role in global trade and investment. He added that excluding China from Swift could lead countries to shift to China's alternative, the Cross-border Interbank Payment System (CIPS), undermining Swift's importance.
