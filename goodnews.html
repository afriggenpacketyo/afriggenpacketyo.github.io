The spacecraft rotated 90 degrees while in orbit to capture the image, which focuses on Arsia Mons, roughly twice as tall as Earth's largest volcano, Hawaii's Mauna Loa. Scientists are using the image to study dust and water ice cloud layers, enabling them to observe changes over the course of seasons and gain new clues to how Mars' atmosphere evolves over time.</p>

He suggests preparing a cup of oatmeal with water instead of milk or butter to keep it low in calories, and adding berries, flax seeds, and walnuts for extra fiber and health benefits. Oatmeal contains minerals, vitamins, and beta-glucan, a dietary fiber that can help maintain healthy cholesterol levels and lower blood glucose levels.
