          <h2>MPs Urge Year-Long Delay for Farm Inheritance Tax Reforms</h2>
          <div class="timestamp">2025-05-15 20:17:59 EDT</div>
        </div>
        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>A committee of MPs is advocating for a year-long postponement of the proposed inheritance tax changes affecting agricultural assets exceeding ¬£1 million, citing inadequate consultation and potential harm to small family businesses. The Environment, Food and Rural Affairs (Efra) Committee's report highlights concerns that the reforms threaten vulnerable farmers, suggesting the delay would allow farmers more time to seek professional advice. The National Farmers' Union (NFU) remains critical, deeming the policy fundamentally flawed and destructive, despite government assurances that only the wealthiest 500 farms annually will be affected. Additionally, the committee criticized the sudden closure of the Sustainable Farming Incentive (SFI) scheme, impacting trust in the government and potentially rendering many farms unviable.</p>

          <p>California's state Assembly unanimously passed a bill to enhance criminal penalties for soliciting minors, specifically targeting 16- and 17-year-olds, after a period of political contention. The legislation, initially proposed by Assemblymember Maggy Krell, aims to crack down on perpetrators and increase protections for victims of sexual assault. While the bill underwent revisions, including adjustments to penalties based on the age difference between the offender and victim, it ultimately garnered bipartisan support. The bill now proceeds to the state Senate for consideration, with lawmakers acknowledging the importance of safeguarding children from exploitation and trafficking.</p>
