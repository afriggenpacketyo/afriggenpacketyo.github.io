          <p>A bear sighting on a golf course in Ishikawa Prefecture, Japan, caused the cancellation of the final round of the Twinfields Ladies tournament on the women's second-tier Step Up Tour due to safety concerns.

The incident highlights the increasing interaction between wildlife and human activities in Japan, prompting authorities to step up efforts to protect both service workers and residents from bear attacks.

          <p>In a guest essay, Rachel Feintzeig reflects on her obsession with the HBO series "The Last of Us," a show about a zombie apocalypse, and how it serves as a distraction from the anxieties of the real world. She finds that immersing herself in a fictional, terrifying scenario provides a temporary escape from the real-world problems she faces. Feintzeig recalls a therapist recommending horror movies to cope with grief after a miscarriage, finding that focusing on someone else's fictional suffering can be strangely liberating. The author humorously anticipates the end of the season and the need to find a new terrifying alternate reality to escape to.</p>

          <p>Studies indicate a growing trend among young adults in Europe to reduce smartphone usage, with a British survey revealing that nearly half would prefer a world without the internet. A Dutch startup, The Offline Club, organizes offline meetups to encourage real-world interactions, offering activities like reading, games, and arts and crafts in phone-free environments. This movement aligns with concerns about the harmful effects of excessive smartphone use on mental health, leading some countries to consider measures like mandatory curfews and raising the age limit for social media use.

The research found that dogs of owners with higher job stress exhibited more stress-related behaviors, such as whining and pacing. This connection is driven by "work-related rumination," suggesting that thinking about work off the clock can spread stress from humans to pets. Dogs are sensitive to their owners' moods and changes in routines, highlighting the importance of managing work stress to protect the well-being of pets.</p>

          <p>The Japanese government is increasing the annual salaries of chefs at its overseas diplomatic missions to over 6 million yen ($41,000) to improve working conditions and attract talent, reflecting the growing global popularity of Japanese cuisine. Chefs will also be allowed to opt for rented accommodation covered by the government. This initiative aims to enhance the role of chefs as "food diplomats" in promoting Japanese food and culture. The improvements also include funds for chefs to bring their spouses to their work locations.</p>

          <p>South Western Railway (SWR) has been renationalized, becoming the first train company to transfer to public ownership under the Labour government. The government hopes to improve services and use profits to reinvest in infrastructure, though lower fares were not promised. Unions have expressed concerns over outsourcing to private companies, while the Conservatives have called on Labour to deliver on its promises. SWR trains will now be the responsibility of DfT Operator and will be integrated into Great British Railways (GBR).</p>

          <h2>Insects Plague World Exposition in Osaka</h2>

          <p>Swarms of midges are causing distress at the World Exposition in Osaka, with visitors cringing at the insects landing on food and raising health concerns. While the midges do not bite, dead ones can cause allergic reactions if inhaled. The insects are believed to be emerging from the Water Plaza, and the expo organizer is taking action by spraying insecticide, treating areas with a growth inhibitor, and installing insect repellent lights. The governor has also sought help from an insecticide maker to address the problem.</p>
