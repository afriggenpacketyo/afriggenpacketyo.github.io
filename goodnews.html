          <p>President Trump commenced his four-day tour of the Gulf states, starting in Saudi Arabia, where he was warmly received by Crown Prince Mohammed bin Salman, signaling the kingdom's high regard for his administration. The trip aims to secure deals worth over $1 trillion, focusing on investments in AI, energy, and arms purchases from U.S. manufacturers. Trump's visit coincides with his family's financial interests in the region, including pending deals with Saudi-owned real estate firms and projects backed by Qatar. The Trump administration is also expected to accept a luxury Boeing 747-8 from the Qatari royal family as a donation, potentially for use as Air Force One. </p>
