          <h2>Japanese Doctors Advocate for Easing COVID-19 Restrictions in Hospitals</h2>
          <div class="timestamp">2025-05-24 22:28:00 EDT</div>

          <p>Despite much of the world moving past the coronavirus pandemic, many Japanese hospitals continue to enforce strict visitation policies, causing distress for families wanting to see their loved ones. A group of physicians and social workers is now advocating for these restrictions to be lifted or significantly reduced, arguing they infringe on human rights. They cite the lack of scientific evidence supporting the effectiveness of visitation restrictions in preventing infection spread, and the importance of family visits for hospitalized patients' well-being. The health ministry has recommended considering visitation opportunities while maintaining infection control, but the final decision is left to individual hospitals, leading to inconsistent policies across the country.</p>

          <div class="timestamp">2025-05-24 22:10:33 EDT</div>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>A recent study published in Scientific Reports indicates that a dog owner's work-related stress and rumination can negatively impact their dog's well-being. Researchers found that dog owners who frequently dwell on work problems at home are more likely to have dogs exhibiting stress-related behaviors such as whining, pacing, and restlessness. This "crossover" effect suggests that dogs are sensitive to their owners' moods and can pick up on stress through subtle cues, or that owners focused on work may be less attentive to their dog's needs. The study emphasizes the importance of employed dog owners separating work from home life to protect their pet's well-being.</p>

          <p>Juan Soto's two-run double in the fourth inning proved decisive as the New York Mets defeated the Los Angeles Dodgers 5-2. After Dodgers pitcher Tony Gonsolin loaded the bases with two walks, Soto capitalized with a hit that sent Citi Field into a frenzy. Gonsolin, making an important start for the Dodgers after their bullpen was taxed in a previous extra-inning game, struggled with command in the fourth, ultimately leading to Soto's game-changing hit. Mets starter David Peterson pitched effectively, lasting nearly eight innings, striking out seven, and inducing three double plays.</p>

          <p>Billy Joel has canceled his summer concerts after being diagnosed with normal pressure hydrocephalus (NPH), a brain condition affecting hearing, vision, and balance. The condition, caused by a buildup of cerebrospinal fluid in the brain, is treatable but often underdiagnosed, and doctors hope Joel's announcement will raise awareness. Symptoms include problems with walking, cognitive issues, and urinary incontinence, which can be mistaken for normal signs of aging. Treatment typically involves surgery to insert a shunt to drain excess fluid, and early diagnosis and treatment can significantly improve a patient's quality of life.</p>
