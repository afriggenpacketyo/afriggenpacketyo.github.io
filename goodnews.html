          <p>Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu held meetings with U.S. congressional leaders, including House Speaker Mike Johnson, to discuss Israel's security and the ongoing conflict in Gaza. The discussions took place amid criticism from some lawmakers over recent U.S. strikes against Iran's nuclear program. Netanyahu emphasized the importance of the U.S.-Israel partnership in confronting regional threats and expressed hope for a new chapter of peace. The visit underscores the delicate diplomatic efforts to manage the interconnected conflicts involving Israel, Hamas, and Iran.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>The latest "Superman" movie, directed by James Gunn, is being reviewed as a refreshing and worthwhile entry in the franchise, a notable departure from the grim tone of recent DC films. The article praises the film for its bright, sincere, and consciously silly energy, evoking the fun of Saturday-morning cartoons. It highlights David Corenswet's portrayal of a more relatable, regular-guy Superman who exists in a world already populated by other heroes. This approach allows the film to explore what makes Superman exceptional without retreading a standard origin story.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>The UK's House of Commons has passed the Football Governance Bill, which will establish an independent regulator for the top five tiers of men's football in England. The legislation aims to protect clubs by ensuring their financial sustainability and placing fans at the heart of the game. The bill, reintroduced by the new Labour government, was celebrated by fan campaign groups as a historic step toward a fairer future for football. However, MPs rejected amendments to make more Premier League games free-to-air and to review the ban on alcohol in stands.</p>

          <p>For savers considering where to place $20,000, this article analyzes the earning potential of Certificates of Deposit (CDs) versus high-yield savings accounts in the current economic climate. It calculates the interest earned over various terms, showing that short-term CDs currently offer slightly higher returns, while high-yield savings accounts may earn more over longer periods. The analysis emphasizes that CD rates are fixed, providing certainty, whereas savings account rates are variable and subject to change.

          <p>Homeowners looking to tap into their home equity are increasingly drawn to no-closing-cost Home Equity Lines of Credit (HELOCs), but there are important trade-offs to consider. This article explains that while these loans eliminate upfront fees, the costs are often absorbed through higher interest rates or clawback penalties if the line of credit is closed early. It advises potential borrowers to calculate their break-even point and carefully read the fine print regarding rate structures and repayment terms. Lenders also tend to have stricter credit requirements for these products. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>French fencing champion Ysaora Thibus has been cleared of doping allegations after successfully arguing that a banned substance entered her system through kissing her partner. The Court of Arbitration for Sport accepted that ostarine, an anabolic agent, was transferred via bodily fluids over nine days from her then-partner, who was using a product containing it. The court concluded that Thibus bore no fault or negligence, dismissing an appeal from the World Anti-Doping Agency that sought a four-year ban. This unusual case echoes a 2009 ruling where a tennis player was cleared of cocaine use via a similar defense.</p>

          <p>A senior White House economic adviser, Stephen Miran, downplayed the risk of President Trump's tariffs causing significant inflation, comparing the likelihood to that of "a meteorite striking Earth." Speaking on CNBC, Miran argued that despite widespread fears, there has been no evidence of broad price increases resulting from the tariffs so far. He promoted a White House report showing that import prices had actually fallen between December and May. Critics argue that the full impact of the tariffs has not yet been felt due to implementation delays and corporate stockpiling. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>The Transportation Security Administration (TSA) is ending its long-standing requirement for travelers to remove their shoes at some U.S. airport security checkpoints. The rule, in place since 2006, was a response to the 2001 "shoe bomber" attempt. Travelers at several airports have reported passing through security with their shoes on, and officials have confirmed the change at some locations. While the TSA has not made a formal nationwide announcement, the move is seen as an effort to enhance the passenger experience and speed up screening lines with modern technology.</p>

          <p>An unusually large swarm of over 400 small earthquakes was detected beneath Washington's Mount Rainier on Tuesday, according to the U.S. Geological Survey. The tremors, with the strongest reaching magnitude 1.7, are occurring at a shallow depth below the volcano's summit. Scientists have stated there are no other signs of volcanic unrest, such as ground deformation or gas emissions. They attribute the earthquake swarm to the circulation of hydrothermal fluids interacting with existing fault lines, a phenomenon that has occurred in the past, most recently in 2009.</p>
