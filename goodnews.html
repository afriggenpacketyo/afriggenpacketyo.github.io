          <p>Jafar Panahi's film, ‚ÄúUn Simple Accident,‚Äù won the Palme d‚ÄôOr at the 78th Cannes Film Festival, marking a high point for the Iranian writer-director who had previously been barred from making movies in Iran. The film, shot clandestinely, follows a group of men and women who band together after one of them kidnaps a man they believe tortured them in prison, drawing inspiration from Panahi's own experiences as a political prisoner. The jury, led by Juliette Binoche, also awarded prizes to films from Chinese, Norwegian, and German directors, highlighting the festival's commitment to cinema as an enduring art form despite industry challenges. The event was marked by a sense of celebration, especially given recent threats of tariffs on foreign-made films.</p>

          <p>Ben Stokes, captain of the England cricket team, clarified that his comments regarding Jacob Bethell's return to the team were misinterpreted and twisted to suit an agenda. Stokes had previously hinted at Bethell's return, but later stated that it was not at the expense of Ollie Pope. Stokes emphasized that he had made it clear to Pope that his position was secure. Bethell is currently playing in the Indian Premier League and missed the recent match against Zimbabwe.</p>

          <h2>California Creates New Wetlands on the Shore of the Shrinking Salton Sea</h2>
          <div class="timestamp">2025-05-24 13:03:22 EDT</div>

          <p>California officials have begun filling a complex of shallow ponds near the Salton Sea to create wetlands, aiming to provide habitat for fish and birds and control dust. The project, the state's largest effort to address the environmental problems at the Salton Sea, involves flooding hundreds of acres of dry lake bed. The Species Conservation Habitat Project, covering 2,000 acres, is part of a long-term plan to build dust-control projects and wetland habitat. The state is using a mix of saltwater from the lake and freshwater from the New River to create lower-salinity habitats.</p>
