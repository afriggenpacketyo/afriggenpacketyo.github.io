          <p>During a summit at Carnegie Mellon University, former President Trump and various corporate leaders announced over $90 billion in new private investments for Pennsylvania. The initiative aims to leverage the state's energy resources to power a new artificial intelligence economy, with plans for new data centers and an energy innovation training hub. The event, hosted by Senator Dave McCormick, was presented as a historic investment package intended to create tens of thousands of jobs. The announcement was met with some protests from activists concerned about the focus on fossil fuels and AI surveillance.</p>

          <p>Adelita Grijalva has won the Democratic primary for Arizona's 7th congressional district, the seat formerly held by her late father, Rep. Raúl Grijalva. A Pima County supervisor, Grijalva defeated social media activist Deja Foxx in a race that highlighted a generational divide within the party. Foxx had challenged Grijalva's 'legacy last name,' but Grijalva emphasized her own long record of public service in the community. Given the district's strong Democratic leaning, she is now the favorite to win the general election in September.</p>

          <p>Contractor Daniel Butierez has won the Republican primary for the special election in Arizona's 7th congressional district. The seat was left vacant by the death of longtime Democratic Rep. Raúl Grijalva. With the district spanning a large portion of the U.S.-Mexico border, Butierez and his primary opponents focused their campaigns heavily on border security and supporting President Trump's immigration policies. He will now face the late congressman's daughter and Democratic nominee, Adelita Grijalva, in what is considered a reliably blue district.</p>

          <p>Speaking at an expo in Beijing, Nvidia CEO Jensen Huang forecasted that automation and machine learning will replace human labor in factories, especially for repetitive or hazardous tasks, within the next ten years. He positioned artificial intelligence as a fundamental infrastructure, comparable to electricity or the internet, that is actively revolutionizing global supply chains. The article notes that Huang's visit coincides with Nvidia's plans to resume shipments of its specialized H20 chips to China after receiving assurances of export licenses from the U.S. government.</p>

          <p>President Trump is set to sign an executive order establishing national standards for the NCAA's Name, Image, and Likeness (NIL) program, which allows college athletes to earn money. This action aims to create a unified federal framework, superseding the current inconsistent patchwork of state laws that govern athlete compensation. The move comes as Congress debates similar legislation and follows years of pressure that led the NCAA to relax its rules in 2021, dramatically reshaping the landscape of college sports by allowing athletes to profit from endorsements and other deals.</p>

The announcement followed direct discussions with Indonesian President Prabowo Subianto and is part of a broader pattern of renegotiating trade terms with various countries.

          <p>After a key procedural vote on several cryptocurrency bills failed in the House, President Trump held a meeting with Republican holdouts to successfully secure their support. Following the discussion, Trump announced on social media that the members had agreed to vote in favor, allowing the legislation, including the stablecoin-regulating GENIUS Act, to advance. The initial failure was a rare, though brief, instance of House Republicans voting against a Trump-endorsed initiative during the chamber's designated "Crypto Week," underscoring the president's influence within the party.</p>

          <p>The U.S. House is considering the "Genius Act," a bipartisan Senate-passed bill that aims to create a regulatory framework for stablecoins. These digital currencies are typically pegged to stable assets like the U.S. dollar to minimize the price volatility seen in other cryptocurrencies. Proponents believe that clear regulations would provide consumer protections and help establish stablecoins as a faster, lower-cost mainstream payment method. The bill is a central piece of a broader "Crypto Week" initiative in the House to establish clear rules for the digital asset industry. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>A growing number of the world's central banks, especially in developing nations, are opting to purchase gold directly from domestic mines rather than on the international market. According to the World Gold Council, this strategy allows them to use local currency to build reserves, support their national mining industries, and potentially acquire the metal at a discount. This trend is being driven by record-high gold prices and a broader desire among countries to strengthen their financial buffers against increasing geopolitical and economic risks.

This follows a heated debate and high-profile cases where patients were treated by associates they mistook for fully qualified doctors, sometimes with tragic results, highlighting a lack of clarity in their roles and responsibilities.</p>

The extensive makeover will involve moving 1,300 plants and replacing 16,000 panes of glass. A key objective is to upgrade the heating system to make the historic glasshouse a net-zero emissions building, ensuring its sustainability for the future.</p>
