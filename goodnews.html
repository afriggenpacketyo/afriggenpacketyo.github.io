          <h2>Chinese Scientists Identify Compound Produced During Exercise That May Slow Aging</h2>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>A study by Chinese scientists has identified a naturally occurring compound, betaine, which may explain how long-term exercise slows the aging process. The research, published in the journal Cell, found that betaine is produced in the kidneys during exercise and acts as a messenger to prevent inflammation and organ aging. It functions by inhibiting a specific enzyme, TBK1. These findings provide insight into the molecular mechanisms behind the health benefits of physical activity and could potentially lead to new anti-aging strategies that simulate the effects of exercise, according to the research team.</p>

          <p>A new trend in China is seeing the country's booming coffee culture spread from urban centers to rural areas, with a surge in trendy, picturesque cafes. These countryside locations often cater to a younger, social media-savvy clientele seeking unique natural settings for their photos. While this has fueled growth in China's $42 billion coffee industry, some question the sustainability of this influencer-driven model, suggesting the novelty may fade quickly for customers. The trend reflects a significant cultural shift in a traditionally tea-drinking nation, with coffee consumption and imports continuing to grow at a rapid pace.</p>

          <p>The Los Angeles Lakers have made early moves in NBA free agency, adjusting their roster after a key role player's departure. Forward Dorian Finney-Smith, who was a significant contributor last season, has agreed to a four-year, $53-million contract with the Houston Rockets. In response, the Lakers quickly signed forward Jake LaRavia to a two-year, $12-million deal. LaRavia, a 6-foot-7 wing player, demonstrated strong three-point shooting ability last season with Memphis and Sacramento.

          <p>The UK government has launched a "landmark" review of the entire parental leave system, including maternity, paternity, and shared leave policies. Ministers acknowledged that the current system is outdated, with low take-up of shared leave and paternity pay that is unaffordable for many fathers. Campaign groups have welcomed the review as a generational opportunity to modernize a system they say is one of the worst in the developed world. The review will examine the statutory leave and pay entitlements for new parents, aiming to create a system that better supports working families in the modern era.</p>

          <p>The U.S. military commander overseeing National Guard troops in Los Angeles has requested that the Trump administration return 200 troops to California state command. This move comes as the state enters fire season with its specialized National Guard firefighting unit at just 40% strength, due to troops being diverted for protest-related duties. Governor Gavin Newsom, who has legally challenged the federalization of the Guard, supports the request, emphasizing the critical need for these troops to combat wildfires. The decision highlights tension between the federal deployment for immigration-related unrest and the state's urgent needs.</p>

          <p>According to CNBC's Jim Cramer, a new generation of younger investors is significantly influencing the stock market by favoring innovative, story-driven companies over established giants. He argues these investors are drawn to bold ideas, such as Robinhood's use of blockchain for private company trading, and are less concerned with traditional metrics or Federal Reserve policies. Cramer suggests this has created an "idea market" where companies like Reddit and DoorDash are rewarded for their growth potential rather than immediate earnings. This contrasts with institutional strategies focused on indices, indicating a shift in market enthusiasm. (not investment advice)</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>A new report from the Royal College of Paediatrics and Child Health suggests that practical obstacles are a primary reason for falling childhood vaccination rates in the UK. Rather than vaccine hesitancy, parents face difficulties booking appointments, getting time off work, and accessing clear information, which prevents them from getting their children immunized. This decline has led to recent outbreaks of preventable diseases like measles. The report recommends improving booking systems through NHS apps, expanding vaccination services, and finalizing a digital record book to help parents track their child's immunization status and improve public health outcomes.</p>

          <p>Film producer Randall Emmett has been removed from the Writers Guild of America's "strike list" after paying a $630,000 judgment to resolve a long-standing dispute.

Being on the list prohibited WGA members from working with him, complicating his current projects. Emmett stated he made the personal decision to settle the debt because it was "the right thing to do," allowing him to move forward with his production company.</p>

After starring in Fluminense's Club World Cup win, the veteran now holds the record for the most career clean sheets, surpassing Gianluigi Buffon. Having made his senior debut in 1997, Fabio has now played 1,378 senior matches, putting him within striking distance of the all-time appearance record, which is believed to be held by former England goalkeeper Peter Shilton.
