          <p>Elon Musk has announced that Tesla aims to launch its robotaxi service in Austin, Texas, by the end of June, with plans to expand to Los Angeles and San Francisco shortly after. The service will begin with approximately ten Model Y vehicles equipped with FSD Unsupervised software, and will rapidly scale to thousands if the initial launch is successful and incident-free. Musk has been promising self-driving capabilities since 2016, and this launch is a crucial step in realizing that long-awaited vision for Tesla. The company intends to proceed cautiously, starting with a small fleet to ensure safety and reliability before a wider rollout.</p>

          <p>President Donald Trump has announced plans to construct a missile defense shield system, dubbed the "Golden Dome," aimed at protecting the United States from missile threats. The project, reminiscent of President Ronald Reagan's "Star Wars" program, could potentially cost tens or even hundreds of billions of dollars. The plan involves integrating the new system with existing defense capabilities, with the goal of intercepting missiles launched from anywhere in the world, including space. Critics have questioned the necessity and cost of such a system, while military officials have cited existing missile defense systems already in use.</p>

          <p>The Food and Drug Administration is considering a new approach to COVID-19 vaccines, prioritizing immunizations for high-risk individuals while requiring additional studies for children and healthy adults. This shift could mean annual boosters are not automatically recommended for everyone, instead focusing on older individuals and those with health risks. Critics worry the move could limit vaccine availability and send a misleading message about vaccine safety and effectiveness, potentially causing insurers to stop covering the shots for everyone. Federal health officials assert that the new policy will align the U.S. with other high-income countries and help restore trust in the vaccines.</p>

          <p>This article explores the impact of debt forgiveness on credit scores, noting that while it can provide a path to becoming debt-free, it generally does hurt your credit. Settling a debt is typically marked as "settled" rather than "paid in full," which can negatively affect your credit score. The damage is not permanent, however, and the impact lessens over time, especially if you rebuild your credit with responsible financial behavior. The article also discusses when debt forgiveness may be worth the credit damage, particularly for those facing bankruptcy or wage garnishment. (not investment advice)</p>
