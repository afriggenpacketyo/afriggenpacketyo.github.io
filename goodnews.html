        </div>
        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Online fashion giant Shein has reportedly filed confidentially for an initial public offering in Hong Kong, a move seen as an attempt to pressure U.K. regulators and advance its stalled listing ambitions. The Singapore-based retailer has struggled to gain approval in London and previously faced significant pushback in New York due to allegations over its labor practices and supply chain transparency. This strategic shift to Hong Kong represents another attempt by the company to access public markets and secure international legitimacy despite ongoing scrutiny from Western lawmakers and regulators.</p>

          <p>Brazilian club Fluminense has made an unexpected run to the Club World Cup final, where they will face Chelsea in a highly anticipated match. The team's success has been anchored by a surprisingly solid defense led by 40-year-old veteran Thiago Silva, who has been a commanding leader on the field. The final is particularly significant for Silva, as he won the same trophy with Chelsea in 2021 and now seeks a historic victory with the club where he began his youth career.</p>

          <p>China's recent implementation of export controls on rare earth elements has intensified global efforts to reduce dependency on Beijing for these critical minerals. This has spurred a new wave of international investment in exploration and development projects in countries like Brazil and Kazakhstan to establish alternative supply chains. Despite this push for diversification, analysts caution that China continues to hold a dominant position and a "strong hand" in the global rare earths market.</p>

          <p>In a surprising move, the Reserve Bank of Australia has decided to hold its key policy rate at 3.85%, defying economists' expectations of a cut. The central bank stated it needs more time and information to confirm that inflation is sustainably returning to its target range. This cautious decision comes as the country faces a slowdown in economic growth and was met with disappointment from government officials who were hoping for relief for households facing cost-of-living pressures.

          <p>The Los Angeles Angels clinched a dramatic 6-5 victory over the Texas Rangers after Nolan Schanuel drew a bases-loaded, walk-off walk in the bottom of the ninth inning. Veteran catcher Travis d’Arnaud was instrumental in the win, hitting a two-run homer against his former battery mate Jacob deGrom and later driving in the crucial tying run. The comeback win provided a significant morale boost for the Angels, demonstrating the team's resilience after a recent string of close, one-run losses.</p>

Developed by Novartis and its partners, the new medicine is expected to be rolled out in high-risk African countries within weeks, offering a much safer and more effective option for the most vulnerable population.</p>

          <p>Major stock indices, including the S&P 500 and a global stock tracker, have formed a "golden cross," a technical chart pattern that some market analysts interpret as a long-term bullish signal. The pattern occurs when a short-term moving average (such as the 50-day) crosses above a long-term moving average (like the 200-day). While historical data shows that this formation has often preceded periods of market growth, past performance does not guarantee future results. (not investment advice)</p>

The initial plan, which could have cut more than 80,000 jobs to return to 2019 staffing levels, had drawn sharp criticism from lawmakers and veterans' advocates.</p>
