          <p>New clinical testing requirements for vaccines may delay the availability of updated COVID and flu shots this fall, according to the article. The Department of Health and Human Services indicated that substantial updates to existing vaccines may require additional clinical evaluation, potentially affecting the availability of shots for even high-risk individuals. Officials are also questioning the necessity of COVID vaccines for children under 12, with some experts suggesting annual booster shots may offer only marginal benefits to younger, healthy individuals. Some experts fear these changes are part of a larger effort to undermine vaccine use.</p>
