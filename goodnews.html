        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Homeowners looking to borrow $150,000 against their property face a choice between a fixed-rate home equity loan and a variable-rate home equity line of credit (HELOC). Currently, average interest rates for both products are nearly identical, resulting in very similar initial monthly payments. However, the key difference lies in future rate stability; the home equity loan rate is fixed, while the HELOC rate can fluctuate with market conditions. This article advises that borrowers should consider their risk tolerance for changing payments, as even small rate shifts can alter long-term costs. (not investment advice)</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>A new survey reveals that nearly two-thirds of Germans believe the country's rules on teenage drinking are too lenient and should be tightened. Currently, 14-year-olds are legally permitted to consume beer or wine if accompanied by a guardian, a practice that a majority now wants to ban. The poll also showed that over half of Germans support raising the legal age for purchasing beer and wine from 16 to 18. This sentiment comes amid concerns about alcohol addiction and rising rates of excessive drinking among youth, prompting calls from doctors' associations and politicians for stronger public health policies.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>India has taken complete control of the second Test against England, largely thanks to a monumental innings of 269 from captain Shubman Gill. His epic knock powered India to a massive first-innings total of 587. In response, England's top order collapsed under pressure from India's bowlers, leaving the hosts struggling at 77-3 by the close of day two. After their comeback victory in the first Test, England now faces a formidable challenge to avoid a series-leveling defeat. India's bowlers found significantly more movement than their English counterparts, compounding the pressure on the home side.</p>

The market's bullish performance follows a volatile second quarter where indices recovered from early losses to post significant gains. A stronger-than-expected June jobs report indicated economic resilience, though it may temper arguments for immediate Federal Reserve interest rate cuts.

          <p>As families prepare for the 2025-26 academic year, a key decision is whether to use federal or private student loans. Federal loans for the upcoming year offer fixed rates of 6.39% for undergraduates, with no credit check required, alongside valuable borrower protections like forgiveness programs. In contrast, private lenders are advertising rates as low as 3.2%, which could offer significant savings for borrowers with excellent credit or a qualified co-signer. While private loans can fill funding gaps and offer lower rates to some, they lack the robust safety nets of federal options, making a careful comparison essential. (not investment advice)</p>

The case emerged after an underwater archaeology expert spotted the gold for sale on a U.S. auction site in 2018. The couple denies any wrongdoing, claiming they were unaware of the gold's illicit origins and did not profit from the sales, which they say were arranged on behalf of their French friend.</p>

          <p>The UK's Labour government intends to further scale back the "Right to Buy" policy in England to protect and increase the supply of social housing. Under the new plans, newly-built social homes will be exempt from the scheme for 35 years, a significant increase from the previous period. Additionally, tenants will now have to live in their properties for at least ten years, up from three, before they qualify to purchase their home at a discount. The government stated these changes are necessary to allow local authorities to recover building costs and prevent the depletion of much-needed affordable housing stock.</p>

          <p>The Isle of Wight rock band Wet Leg is returning with their second album, "Moisturizer," showcasing a significant evolution from their Grammy-winning debut. In a recent interview, frontwoman Rhian Teasdale discussed the band's new, more sonically expressive and visually bold direction, reflecting their growth after a meteoric rise to fame. The album explores themes of love and heartache with a raw authenticity, a departure from the more kitschy style of their first record. Teasdale explains that the new sound is a natural result of the band touring together for years, while their signature tongue-in-cheek humor remains a core element of their music.</p>
