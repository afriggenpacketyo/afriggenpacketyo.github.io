        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Donald Trump has revived his proposal for publicly traded companies to report earnings on a semi-annual basis, rather than quarterly, arguing the change would save money and encourage long-term strategic focus. The suggestion, which would require SEC approval, has drawn mixed reactions from financial experts, with some supporting the idea to reduce short-term pressure on executives. However, critics argue that less frequent reporting would decrease transparency for investors and could lead to market instability, noting that the U.S. system is considered among the world's most reliable. The proposal would align U.S. practices more closely with those in the U.K. and European Union. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>A Colorado-based mother and influencer is offering advice on how families can save money on skiing and snowboarding trips, a notoriously expensive activity. She recommends taking advantage of programs like the Epic SchoolKids Colorado Pack and the Colorado Ski Country USA pass, which offer free or heavily discounted access for elementary school students. Additional cost-saving strategies include booking packages, skiing on weekdays, visiting smaller resorts, and renting gear for children who are still growing. Planning and booking well in advance of the season is also crucial to securing the best prices.</p>

          <p>U.S. and Chinese officials have reportedly reached a framework agreement to transfer ownership of TikTok to a U.S.-controlled entity, potentially resolving a long-standing national security dispute. The deal's commercial terms have been agreed upon by the private parties involved, though they have not been publicly disclosed. This breakthrough follows months of negotiations and threats of a U.S. ban on the popular social media app due to its Chinese parent company, ByteDance. The final details are expected to be settled when President Trump and Chinese President Xi Jinping speak later in the week, marking a significant step in de-escalating tech-related tensions.</p>

The station, which was established in just five weeks, has hired a staff of 50 and aims to bring a community-focused, entrepreneurial spirit to local journalism, backed by the resources of a national network. Key hires, including anchor Jobina Fortson-Evans and reporter Brian Unger, expressed excitement about the startup-like energy and the opportunity to innovate in the Atlanta market. The station will initially air evening newscasts with plans to expand its programming.</p>

          <p>CNBC's Jim Cramer advised investors on Monday that it is a good time to increase holdings in Boeing, despite recent stock declines related to certification delays for its 777X jet. He urged his audience to "pound the table" on the aircraft manufacturer, signaling strong confidence in its long-term prospects. Regarding the news that China is investigating Nvidia for anti-monopoly violations, Cramer expressed little concern, suggesting the probe is politically motivated and could be resolved as part of broader trade negotiations between the U.S. and China. He indicated that positive movement in trade talks would outweigh the regulatory risk for the chipmaker. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>British actor Stephen Graham won the Emmy for Outstanding Lead Actor in a Limited or Anthology Series for his role in the Netflix drama "Adolescence." In an emotional acceptance speech, Graham described himself as "just a mixed-race kid from Kirkby" and expressed disbelief that such an honor could happen to someone with his background. He paid tribute to his wife, Hannah Walters, calling her his "rock" and "soulmate," and thanked his father for introducing him to film as a child.

          <p>Alphabet, the parent company of Google, has become the fourth U.S. company to reach a market capitalization of $3 trillion, joining the ranks of Nvidia, Microsoft, and Apple. The company's stock surged following a recent antitrust ruling that imposed lighter-than-feared penalties, avoiding a forced divestiture of its Chrome browser. This legal victory, combined with optimism around its AI initiatives like the Gemini models, has propelled its share price to record highs. The milestone reflects strong investor confidence in the company's ability to navigate both regulatory challenges and increasing competition in the technology sector. (not investment advice)</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>With U.S. credit card debt exceeding $1.21 trillion and average interest rates near 22%, consumers are being warned against simple mistakes that can make their debt more expensive. Financial experts advise that paying a bill late can trigger immediate fees and a high penalty APR, significantly increasing borrowing costs. Carrying a balance from month to month allows interest to compound daily, causing debt to spiral, while a high credit utilization ratio can damage one's credit score. The article suggests exploring options like 0% balance transfers or debt consolidation loans to manage and reduce high-interest debt more effectively. (not investment advice)</p>

        </div>
        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>An analysis of the Levelized Cost of Energy (LCOE) indicates that renewable sources like onshore wind and utility-scale solar are the cheapest forms of energy to produce, even before accounting for government subsidies. While the initial capital investment for renewables is high, their operational and fuel costs are significantly lower than those for fossil fuels like coal and natural gas, whose prices are more volatile. The article notes that U.S. energy policy, including tax incentives and tariffs, significantly impacts the final cost of different energy projects. Experts suggest that a diverse mix of energy sources is necessary to ensure a stable and affordable power grid. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>The Federal Reserve is widely expected to announce an interest rate cut this week, which would be the first since 2024, as concerns grow about potential downside risks to the economy and the job market. While a single small cut won't drastically change the financial landscape for consumers, it signals a shift in monetary policy. Financial advisors suggest that now is a good time for individuals to pay down high-interest variable debt, such as credit card balances, and to lock in high returns on savings with products like CDs before rates fall further. The move could also provide some relief to the housing market by lowering mortgage rates. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>U.S. banks borrowed $1.5 billion from the Federal Reserve's Standing Repo Facility on Monday, a move that indicates some minor, temporary tightness in funding markets. The borrowing coincided with the deadline for quarterly corporate tax payments and a large settlement of U.S. Treasury securities, both of which increase the demand for cash. The repo facility acts as a backstop to ensure the financial system has adequate liquidity and prevents disruptive funding squeezes. Analysts view this level of borrowing as a sign of normal, manageable pressure rather than a cause for significant concern about the stability of the banking system. (not investment advice)</p>
