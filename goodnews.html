          <p>Veteran NFL running back Matt Breida has decided to retire from football just weeks before the start of the regular season. The 30-year-old, who most recently played for the New York Giants, reportedly declined a workout invitation from the Miami Dolphins. Breida began his seven-year career as an undrafted free agent with the San Francisco 49ers, where he had a career-high 814 rushing yards in 2018. He concludes his professional career with 2,652 rushing yards and 19 touchdowns across stints with four different teams.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>The fashion brand Topshop is planning a major comeback, with the return of standalone physical stores and its first catwalk show in seven years. After its parent company Arcadia collapsed in 2020, the brand was acquired by Asos and has since operated online only. The relaunch aims to capitalize on nostalgia while also attracting a new generation of shoppers with its signature "London girl" aesthetic. However, industry experts caution that Topshop faces challenges, including stiff competition from fast-fashion giants like Shein and the need to regain its "cool" factor in a changed retail landscape.</p>

          <p>Liverpool defeated Bournemouth 4-2 in a chaotic and emotional Premier League season opener at Anfield, marked by tributes to the late Diogo Jota. New £70m signing Hugo Ekitike made an immediate impact, scoring one goal and assisting another for Cody Gakpo. Despite the victory, Liverpool's defensive vulnerabilities were exposed, particularly when Bournemouth's Antoine Semenyo scored an impressive equalizer. Late goals from Federico Chiesa and Mohamed Salah ultimately secured the win for the reigning champions, but the match highlighted areas for improvement in the team's transitioning lineup.</p>

          <p>The market for technology initial public offerings (IPOs) is experiencing a significant resurgence after a nearly three-year slowdown caused by inflation and interest rate hikes. Recent successful debuts by firms like Figma and Bullish have seen stock prices soar on their first day of trading. This renewed investor enthusiasm is encouraging a backlog of high-value private companies to prepare for public offerings. While Wall Street is optimistic, some experts caution that the market may be overheating, drawing parallels to the dot-com bubble and warning that the large first-day valuation increases may not be sustainable.

          <p>The Department of Justice has agreed to reverse key aspects of the Trump administration's federal takeover of the Washington, D.C. police force following a lawsuit from the city. In a court hearing, the DOJ agreed to remove the newly appointed emergency police chief, allowing D.C. Police Chief Pamela Smith to remain in command. The administration also committed to rewriting a directive that had ended the city's "sanctuary" policies limiting cooperation with federal immigration authorities. This decision came after a federal judge signaled she would likely block the administration's move, which the city had challenged as an illegal overreach of presidential power.</p>

          <p>The Jeff Bezos-backed startup Slate Automotive is promoting an American-made electric pickup truck with a simple, customizable design intended to keep the base price low. The company's strategy is to sell a barebones vehicle and allow owners to add features and accessories, including a kit to convert it into an SUV. Slate initially advertised a starting price below $20,000 with federal tax credits, but with those incentives ending, the price is expected to be closer to $28,000. This higher price point puts it in competition with established models, raising questions about its competitiveness in the affordable vehicle market.</p>

          <p>Leading Democratic lawmakers have introduced a joint resolution in Congress to formally end the Trump administration's federal takeover of the Washington, D.C. Metropolitan Police Department. The resolution, sponsored by Representative Jamie Raskin and others, argues that the president has not demonstrated the emergency conditions required by the Home Rule Act to justify such an action. Lawmakers contend the move is a "lawless" and politically motivated attack on D.C.'s autonomy, citing that the city's crime rate has actually been declining. This legislative action complements the city's successful legal challenge that forced the administration to scale back its control.</p>

          <p>Scottish jazz pianist Fergus McCreadie initially dismissed calls from acclaimed film director Spike Lee as a potential scam. However, the offer was genuine, leading McCreadie and his trio to fly to New York to work on the score for Lee's new crime thriller, "Highest 2 Lowest." Lee had become a fan of McCreadie's track "Stony Gate" and even flew to Edinburgh to watch him perform live. The 2022 Scottish Album of the Year winner described the experience as surreal, culminating in his music being incorporated into the film's main score alongside composer Howard Dressin.</p>

This potential valuation represents exponential growth for the artificial intelligence company, which was valued at $300 billion in a funding round earlier this year.

She expressed a hope that Trump would stand up to the Russian leader on behalf of U.S. and European security interests.

          <p>At 21 years old, all-rounder Jacob Bethell is set to become the youngest man to ever captain England in international cricket. He will lead an understrength T20 squad for a three-match tour of Ireland in September, as regular captain Harry Brook and other senior players are being rested. The selection is a significant show of faith in Bethell, who has limited senior captaincy experience but has impressed selectors with his leadership potential. The squad for the Ireland tour, as well as a preceding series against South Africa, also includes a first call-up for Hampshire bowler Sonny Baker.</p>

Playboy plans to be fully operational in its new luxury office space by next year and intends to open a new Playboy Club in the area.

          <p>After a six-month halt and a lawsuit from over a dozen states, the Trump administration is resuming a federal program to fund the installation of electric vehicle chargers along highways. The administration, which has been critical of the program, has released new guidance that allows the funds to flow but removes many Biden-era requirements related to community engagement and labor standards. Transportation Secretary Sean Duffy stated that while he disagrees with subsidizing green energy, the administration will respect Congress's decision. EV advocates have welcomed the end of the freeze but are frustrated by the lengthy and disruptive delay.</p>
