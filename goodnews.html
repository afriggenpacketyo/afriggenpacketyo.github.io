          <p>As Poland prepares for its presidential election, the Tusk government is experiencing declining approval ratings due to President Duda's obstruction of their reform plans. The election's outcome will determine whether the government can proceed with its pro-European, center-left agenda, which includes restoring the rule of law, liberalizing abortion legislation, and reforming public media. The two front-runners are Rafal Trzaskowski, backed by Tusk, and Karol Nawrocki, supported by the opposition conservative Law and Justice party, and far-right candidate Slawomir Mentzen. With a runoff election likely, the Tusk government faces an uncertain future depending on the voters' choices.</p>

          <p>Despite Shohei Ohtani's MLB-leading 16th home run, the Los Angeles Dodgers lost to the Los Angeles Angels 6-2.

The Dodgers hit into a franchise-record-tying five double plays, hindering their offensive efforts. Ohtani's home run added a second run for the Dodgers in the eighth inning, but it wasn't enough to overcome the Angels' lead.</p>

          <p>Former President Joe Biden dismissed Special Counsel Robert Hur's report, which raised concerns about his mental acuity following interviews about his handling of classified documents. Audio recordings from those interviews revealed Biden's struggles with remembering key dates and details, including the death of his son Beau. In response to questions about the report, Biden asserted his competence and dismissed the special counsel's assessment. The report amplified Republican criticisms about Biden's mental fitness, while Democrats initially defended him before later urging him to drop his re-election bid.</p>

          <p>A rare dust storm swept through the Chicago area, causing visibility to drop to zero in some areas and halting flights at Midway International Airport. The National Weather Service issued only its second dust storm warning for the Chicago office, the first to include the city itself. The storm, caused by high winds blowing over dry farmlands, forced drivers to pull over and coated the city in dust. While skies cleared within 30 to 45 minutes, the event was described as something out of the history books.</p>

          <p>President Trump's tour of the Middle East was marked by lavish displays of honor and respect from Saudi Arabia, Qatar, and the United Arab Emirates. He announced over $2 trillion in economic investments between the U.S. and these nations, who are major purchasers of American military equipment. The trip contrasted sharply with the backlash he faces at home, where his policies have drawn criticism. Gulf leaders lauded Trump's approach, focusing on peace and profit, and praised his decision to remove sanctions from Syria.</p>

          <p>As the United States and China reduce their investment and presence in Africa, the United Arab Emirates is increasing its influence through strategic investments in ports, mines, and renewable energy projects. Since 2019, Emirati-backed firms have announced $110 billion worth of deals in Africa, dwarfing pledges from other countries. This expansion is part of an ambitious plan to diversify the Emirates' economy away from fossil fuels and increase its control over global supply chains. While the U.S. reduces aid and closes operations in the region, the UAE is building trade and economic partnerships.</p>
