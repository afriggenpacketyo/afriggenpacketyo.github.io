          <p>Mark Zuckerberg, frustrated with Meta's AI progress, is reportedly investing heavily in Scale AI and attempting to recruit its CEO, Alexandr Wang. Meta is allegedly finalizing a deal to invest $14 billion in Scale AI, potentially taking a 49% stake, with Wang possibly leading a new AI research lab at Meta. This move mirrors strategies by Google and Microsoft, who have brought in AI leaders through significant investments rather than outright acquisitions. Zuckerberg hopes Wang can improve Meta's AI execution, especially after the lukewarm reception of the Llama AI models, as Wang's expertise in AI's technical complexities and business acumen is highly valued. </p>

          <p>Following high-level trade discussions in London, representatives from the U.S. and China have announced a consensus on a framework to implement the Geneva trade agreement. U.S. Commerce Secretary Howard Lutnick stated that this framework aims to resolve issues such as Chinese restrictions on rare earths exports to the U.S. Lutnick and U.S. Trade Representative Jamieson Greer will seek President Trump's approval, while Chinese President Xi Jinping's approval is also required for implementation. While Chinese state media initially remained silent, the agreement signals a potential de-escalation in trade tensions between the two nations. The agreement addresses concerns about reciprocal tariffs and aims to stabilize the relationship after accusations of Geneva agreement violations. </p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>A new law in Georgia, the Survivor Justice Act, may allow domestic violence survivors to seek reduced sentences if they can prove abuse led them to commit crimes. Latoya Dickens, convicted of felony murder after a fight with her abusive husband, could have received a lesser sentence of 10 years under the new law. The law aims to consider the full picture of abuse endured by survivors, not just bits and pieces, according to Republican state Rep. Stan Gunter. Similar laws exist in other states, offering hope to incarcerated survivors and a chance for resentencing. </p>

          <p>Play experts are advocating for a national ban on "no ball games" signs and increased protection of playtime in schools to combat the decline in outdoor play and excessive screen time among children. The Raising the Nation Play Commission's report calls for a national Play Strategy for England, including updating planning policies to prioritize children's play in new developments. The report warns that outdoor play has decreased by 50% in a generation due to traffic, safety concerns, and unwelcoming public spaces. The commission emphasizes the importance of creating child-friendly neighborhoods and reversing the growing intolerance towards children playing outdoors. </p>

          <p>Singer Sting has voiced strong criticism of successive governments for neglecting the North East of England, where he grew up, and announced a donation to the Baltic Centre for Contemporary Art in Gateshead. Sting believes the region has been "wilfully neglected" and that child poverty statistics are discouraging. Despite his humble beginnings, Sting recalls a childhood rich in culture, fostered by access to libraries, theaters, and art galleries. He sees the now-disappeared shipyard as a symbol of government neglect and believes art can nourish creative sparks in even the poorest households. </p>
