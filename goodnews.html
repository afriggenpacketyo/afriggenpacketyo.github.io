          <p>The UK government has announced a new partnership with supermarkets and food manufacturers in England to address rising obesity rates. The plan encourages retailers to voluntarily make healthy food more appealing and accessible, potentially through promotions, loyalty point incentives, or changes to store layouts. This initiative is part of a broader strategy to improve national health and reduce strain on the NHS. Critics note that healthy food often costs more than unhealthy options and that the success of previous voluntary industry partnerships has been mixed.</p>

          <p>Following a disappointing single-medal performance at the Paris Olympics, Japan's national swimming team is implementing a new strategy to improve results for the 2028 Los Angeles Games. Athletes are now living together in a "virtual athletes' village" during competitions to build resilience, foster team unity, and better prepare for the unique challenges of an Olympic environment.

          <div class="timestamp">2025-06-28 21:23:14 EDT</div>
        </div>
        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>This article explains the phenomenon known as the "urban heat island effect," which causes cities to be significantly hotter than surrounding rural areas. This occurs because dark, hard surfaces like asphalt roads and buildings absorb and retain the sun's energy, releasing it slowly as heat. The effect is compounded by a lack of cooling elements like trees and water, as well as waste heat generated by vehicles and air conditioning. As climate change makes heatwaves more frequent and intense, urban populations are becoming increasingly vulnerable to extreme heat.</p>

          <p>Primary schools in Kent, England, are trialing a new sun safety program designed to teach young children about UV levels and proper sunscreen application. The initiative, which may be expanded nationwide, aims to reduce future cases of melanoma, the most serious form of skin cancer. Health experts emphasize that sunburn during childhood significantly increases the risk of developing melanoma later in life. By educating children early, the program hopes to instill lifelong protective habits and empower them to take responsibility for their own skin health.</p>

          <p>Japan successfully conducted the 50th and final launch of its H2A rocket, bringing a 24-year era of space exploration to a close. The rocket lifted off from Tanegashima Island, deploying a government satellite designed to monitor greenhouse gases and climate change. The H2A series, which had a 98% success rate, is being retired in favor of the newer, more cost-effective H3 rocket. This transition is part of Japan's strategy to remain competitive in the increasingly crowded global satellite-launch market dominated by companies like SpaceX.</p>

While Ohtani's outing was a significant positive step in his recovery from Tommy John surgery, the Dodgers' bullpen struggled after he left the game, ultimately leading to a 9-5 loss against the Kansas City Royals.
