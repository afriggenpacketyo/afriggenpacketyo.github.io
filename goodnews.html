          <p>A Berlin court has ruled it unlawful to turn away asylum seekers at Germany's borders without adhering to the EU's Dublin procedure, a decision that challenges the new federal migration policy. The court's emergency ruling came in response to the case of three Somali nationals who were turned back to Poland from Frankfurt an der Oder on May 9, under a new German regulation. The court stated that such rejections circumvent necessary legal procedures and violate asylum rights, emphasizing the importance of following due process in handling asylum claims. The decision highlights the tension between national migration policies and international legal obligations.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>A new international study has found that colon cancer patients who participated in a three-year exercise program experienced improved survival rates. The research, presented at the American Society of Clinical Oncology's annual meeting, showed that the exercise program kept the disease at bay, rivaling the benefits of some drugs. Patients in the exercise group met regularly with a coach and showed a 28% reduction in cancer recurrences and a 37% decrease in deaths from any cause after eight years. Experts suggest that cancer centers and insurance plans should consider making exercise coaching a standard part of care for colon cancer survivors.</p>

          <p>The UK government is planning a major redesign of the country's flight paths to potentially reduce journey times, decrease delays, and increase the number of flights. The UK Airspace Design Service (UKADS) will lead the remodelling, focusing initially on the complex airspace around London, with changes expected in the 2030s. The government hopes the modernized airspace will allow planes to climb and descend more smoothly, reducing aviation's climate impact and paving the way for new technologies like flying taxis. However, environmental groups like Friends of the Earth have expressed concerns that the redesign could expose more communities to noise and air pollution.</p>

They suggest that homeowners should look for low or no-fee deals, as competition among lenders is creating opportunities for borrowers to save money. HELOCs can provide flexibility, but it's important to understand the terms and potential risks. By carefully weighing the advantages and drawbacks of different home equity options, homeowners can make informed decisions that align with their financial goals. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>Tesla's new car sales in Norway have surged by 213% in May, contrasting with a downward trend in other European markets. The increase is primarily attributed to strong sales of the revamped Model Y compact SUV. While Tesla's European sales have been impacted by reputational damage and CEO Elon Musk's political activities, Norway's EV incentives and consumer preferences for the Model Y have driven the rebound. Despite the sales increase, a survey indicates that a significant percentage of Norwegian EV drivers would not buy a Tesla due to political reasons.</p>
