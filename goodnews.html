          <p>The Norwegian Nobel Committee granted unprecedented media access to its secret deliberations for the Nobel Peace Prize, set to be announced on Friday. Committee members discuss and argue to reach a consensus, guided by Alfred Nobel's 1895 will, which mandates the award for promoting international fraternity and peace congresses. This year, former US President Donald Trump's public desire for the prize is a notable point of discussion, with the committee chairman acknowledging the intense global scrutiny and pressure surrounding their independent decision-making process.</p>

          <p>A construction team at the Port of Long Beach made a startling discovery when they unearthed a World War II-era explosive device, prompting an immediate response from authorities. The eight-decade-old shell was found at one of the port's container terminals, leading to its evacuation and the establishment of a safety perimeter by local police, fire departments, and the U.S. Coast Guard. A U.S. Marine Corps ordnance disposal team successfully transported and deactivated the device off-site. The port quickly resumed normal operations Wednesday night, with no injuries reported.</p>

          <p>This article offers an analysis of former President Trump's recent Gaza peace plan, which he announced has entered its initial phase with agreements from both Israel and Hamas. While the first phase focuses on hostage release and troop withdrawal, the article highlights that deeper, unresolved issues like Hamas's disarmament and the establishment of an alternative Palestinian regime persist. It suggests Trump is leveraging his personal influence and regional alliances, alongside growing Israeli public sentiment, to push for a broader resolution. Success in this endeavor could significantly expand his engagement in the wider Israeli-Palestinian conflict.</p>

Despite starting their ace, Yoshinobu Yamamoto, and taking an early lead, the Dodgers' pitching faltered, allowing the Phillies' previously dormant offense to explode. This unexpected loss places immense pressure on the Dodgers to secure a victory in Game 4 at Dodger Stadium to avoid a decisive Game 5 back in Philadelphia.

Priscilla is expected to further weaken into a remnant low by Friday, but life-threatening surf and rip current conditions persist.</p>
