          <p>This article outlines three key strategies for Americans to maximize their Social Security retirement benefits. It emphasizes delaying claims past full retirement age for an 8% annual increase, working longer to boost earnings records over 35 years, and coordinating spousal benefits strategically for married couples. The piece also suggests supplementary income options like annuities, reverse mortgages, and maintaining a retirement portfolio to cover rising costs and ensure financial stability in later years. Implementing these steps early can significantly enhance future financial security. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>This article compares the potential interest earnings of a $40,000 Certificate of Deposit (CD) versus a $40,000 money market account amidst falling interest rates. While money market accounts currently offer slightly higher rates in some short-term scenarios, their variable rates are subject to change with Federal Reserve cuts. CDs, conversely, provide guaranteed fixed returns over their term, making them a more secure option for savers prioritizing predictable earnings. The analysis provides specific examples over 3, 6, 9, and 12 months, highlighting the trade-offs between flexibility and guaranteed income. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>Russian tennis player Daniil Medvedev received a hefty fine of $42,500 by the U.S. Open for unsportsmanlike conduct and racket abuse following his first-round defeat. The outburst stemmed from a heated disagreement with the chair umpire over allowing his opponent, Benjamin Bonzi, an additional first serve after a photographer's disturbance. Medvedev, a former world No. 1 and 2021 U.S. Open champion, is known for his on-court antics and has a history of engaging with crowds. Despite his protest, he ultimately lost the match in five sets.

          <p>Eli Lilly, the maker of the popular weight loss drug Mounjaro, has offered a discounted deal to UK suppliers, aiming to mitigate a significant price increase for consumers. Initially, the list price was set to rise by up to 170%, but the new arrangement is expected to limit the increase to under 50% for higher doses. This development comes after US President Donald Trump previously criticized high drug costs in the US compared to other countries. The deal does not affect the NHS, which has its own negotiated rate, but will impact the estimated 1.5 million private users in the UK. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>Nvidia's stock fluctuated after its latest earnings report, which showcased robust AI demand but offered limited clarity on its future in China. The company reported a 56% surge in sales and adjusted earnings per share that topped estimates, driven by the ongoing build-out of AI infrastructure. However, concerns persist regarding the Trump administration's block on selling its H20 chip in China and the finalization of a deal to resume sales. CEO Jensen Huang projects significant AI infrastructure spending by the end of the decade, but the geopolitical landscape remains a key variable. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>The UK government has unveiled the first electric vehicles (EVs) eligible for discounts under a new grant scheme, aiming to encourage a shift from petrol and diesel cars. Ford's Puma Gen-E and e-Tourneo Courier will receive a £3,750 discount, with another 26 models qualifying for £1,500 reductions. These grants, part of a £650 million scheme, are automatically applied at the point of sale for eligible cars costing up to £37,000. The initiative seeks to make EVs more affordable, addressing upfront cost as a major barrier, as the government targets a ban on new petrol and diesel car sales by 2030. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>The U.S. economy expanded at an annualized pace of 3.3% in the second quarter, exceeding initial estimates and consensus forecasts. This robust growth was driven by stronger-than-expected consumer spending and business resilience, even amidst tariff volatility. A key metric, final sales to private domestic purchasers, also jumped, indicating strong internal demand. While imports tumbled due to companies stockpiling ahead of tariffs, net exports significantly contributed to the GDP total.
