          <p>An Air Canada flight from Toronto to Las Vegas was forced to make an unscheduled landing at Chicago's O'Hare International Airport due to a passenger disturbance. The incident occurred late Friday night, causing a three-hour delay for the flight's final arrival. According to the Federal Aviation Administration, the crew reported the disturbance, leading to the safe diversion of the aircraft. Air Canada has not provided specific details about the passenger's behavior, but the situation was resolved on the ground without any arrests being made before the flight continued to its destination.</p>

          <p>The UK is set to experience a late summer heatwave, with temperatures predicted to reach 30°C (86°F) on the upcoming bank holiday Monday. This warm spell is attributed to tropical air being pushed towards the UK by the remnants of Hurricane Erin. The pleasant weather is anticipated for major events like the Notting Hill Carnival and the Reading and Leeds music festivals. However, the warmth will be brief, as more unsettled and cooler weather, including wind and rain, is expected to arrive by Tuesday. Travelers are also warned of potential delays due to planned strikes on the CrossCountry rail network.</p>

        </div>
        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>After a prolonged legal challenge from residents, a street in central Berlin with a name considered racist has been officially renamed in honor of Anton Wilhelm Amo. Amo was an 18th-century Black German philosopher and the first Africa-born scholar to earn a doctorate from a European university. The original street name, Mohrenstrasse or "Moor Street," has been criticized for decades by civil society groups for its racist connotations tied to slavery and colonialism. The renaming ceremony, held on the International Day for the Remembrance of the Slave Trade, marks a significant victory for decolonization activists and recognizes the contributions of Black figures in German history.</p>

          <p>Former Seattle SuperSonics star Shawn Kemp has been sentenced to 30 days of electronic home monitoring and one year of supervision for a shooting incident in a mall parking lot in March 2023. Prosecutors had recommended nine months in jail, but the judge opted for a lesser sentence, agreeing with the defense's claim that Kemp acted in self-defense. Kemp had tracked his stolen truck and phone to the location, where he claimed one of the occupants of the other vehicle fired at him first. Kemp, who pleaded guilty to an assault charge, expressed remorse and stated his intent to become an advocate against gun violence.</p>

          <h2>Massive Landslide in Alaska Triggers One of the Largest Tsunamis Ever Recorded</h2>
          <div class="timestamp">2025-08-23 11:00:05 EDT</div>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>A colossal landslide in Alaska's Tracy Arm fjord triggered a massive tsunami, sending a wave of water an estimated 1,400 feet up the opposite shore. Scientists believe the event, which occurred in a popular tourist area, was a narrow miss for a major disaster, as no tour boats or cruise ships were in the immediate vicinity at the early morning hour. The incident highlights the growing risk of such events as climate change causes glaciers to retreat, potentially destabilizing steep fjord walls. While a group of kayakers had to be rescued, the lack of casualties is considered fortunate, prompting a closer examination of hazards in these increasingly volatile environments.</p>

          <h2>Federal Judge Expands Injunction Preventing Trump Administration from Defunding 'Sanctuary' Jurisdictions</h2>

          <p>A U.S. district judge has significantly broadened a previous ruling, now blocking the Trump administration from withholding federal funds from 34 cities and counties with "sanctuary" policies. The order, issued by Judge William Orrick, adds major cities like Los Angeles and Chicago to the list of jurisdictions protected from the administration's attempts to penalize them for limiting cooperation with federal immigration enforcement. This legal setback for the White House comes amid an escalating confrontation with Democrat-led cities over immigration. The administration argues such policies undermine federal law, while the cities contend the funding threats are an unconstitutional abuse of power.</p>

          <p>Kilauea, one of the world's most active volcanoes, has resumed its eruption, sending fountains of lava up to 100 feet into the air within its summit crater. This marks the 31st eruptive event since December, with the activity currently contained within Halemaumau crater and posing no threat to nearby homes. The spectacle is drawing visitors to Hawaii Volcanoes National Park and attracting a large online audience via U.S. Geological Survey livestreams. Scientists are closely monitoring the volcano, noting that the current pattern of episodic lava fountaining could continue or evolve, as it has in past extended eruption cycles.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>An opinion article explores the diplomatic messaging behind Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy's clothing choices during his recent visits to the White House. After a previous, more combative meeting where his casual, military-style shirt drew criticism, Zelenskyy opted for a more formal black blazer for his latest visit with President Trump. This sartorial shift is interpreted as a deliberate act of "wardrobe diplomacy," signaling a desire for a more serious and constructive conversation. The piece draws parallels to historical examples, like Winston Churchill's wartime attire, to argue that what political leaders wear can convey powerful, non-verbal messages on the world stage.</p>

          <p>The latest season of the animated series "South Park" is being noted for its direct and scathing satire of the Trump administration, a move that has led to record ratings for the nearly 30-year-old show. The episodes feature pointed parodies of President Trump and key figures in his cabinet, tackling controversial policies and actions head-on. This aggressive comedic approach comes at a time when the show's parent company, Paramount, has faced scrutiny from the administration. Despite this, the creators appear to have been given free rein, with the show's immense financial value and long-standing reputation for being an "equal opportunity offender" providing it with a unique level of protection.</p>
