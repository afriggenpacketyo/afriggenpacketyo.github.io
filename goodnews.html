          <p>United Airlines is reducing its schedule at Newark Liberty International Airport by 35 roundtrip flights daily, approximately 10% of its Newark hub, due to air traffic controller staffing shortages and FAA technology problems.

The FAA acknowledged staffing issues were delaying operations. United is urging the FAA to implement flight restrictions similar to those at other congested airports. </p>

          <p>A man who injected himself with snake venom hundreds of times over nearly two decades has potentially revolutionized snakebite treatment. Immunologist Jacob Glanville discovered that Tim Friede, a self-taught snake expert, had developed immunity to several neurotoxins. Researchers isolated antibodies from Friede's blood and created an antivenom that protects against bites from 19 species of poisonous snakes in mice. The team is investigating whether additional antibodies might offer protection against the viperid family of snakes. </p>
