          <p>A major power outage impacted southeastern France, causing traffic disruptions and briefly halting events at the Cannes Film Festival. The outage affected approximately 160,000 households in the Alpes-Maritimes department due to a fallen high-voltage line, occurring shortly after a fire at an electrical substation had already weakened the grid. Despite the disruptions, Cannes Film Festival organizers confirmed that the Palais des Festivals switched to an independent power supply, ensuring all scheduled events, including the Closing Ceremony, proceeded as planned. Restoration efforts were underway, with authorities urging residents to exercise caution during travel.</p>

          <p>President Donald Trump is scheduled to deliver the commencement address at the U.S. Military Academy at West Point, amid changes to diversity, equity, and inclusion (DEI) programs. Recent actions, including the disbanding of student clubs like the National Society of Black Engineers and the removal of books on diversity from academy libraries, reflect the administration's rollback of DEI initiatives. Critics, including former West Point teachers, argue these changes undermine the values and education of the academies. Two protests are planned during the ceremony.</p>

          <p>The Netflix miniseries 'Sirens,' adapted from Molly Smith Metzler's play, is set on a wealthy northeastern island and explores themes of class, money, and power with a satirical bent. The story centers on trophy wife Michaela (Julianne Moore) and her assistant Simone (Milly Alcock), whose lives are disrupted by Simone's sister Devon (Meghann Fahy).

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>An increasing number of Labour MPs are questioning Chancellor Rachel Reeves' economic policies, particularly her plans to cut welfare payments. They are proposing alternative measures, such as new taxes on the wealthiest and a relaxation of fiscal rules to increase investment. Some MPs are also calling for the restoration of the 50p top tax rate and aligning capital gains tax rates with income tax. These challenges reflect growing unease within Labour as poll ratings decrease, and highlight disagreements over the government's approach to public finances.</p>

          <h2>Progress Seen in Austin and Seattle Despite Criticisms of 'Defund the Police' Movement</h2>
          <div class="timestamp">2025-05-24 07:00:58 EDT</div>
        </div>
        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Despite criticisms that the movement to defund the police has failed, some cities like Austin and Seattle are seeing progress in shifting resources to social services. Inspired by calls for alternatives to policing from Black and brown organizers, Seattle launched a third public safety department that responds to mental health crises. Austin has increasingly invested more money in its homeless services since diverting millions of dollars from the 2021 police budget. These cities are showcasing how community engagement can reimagine public safety and shift city priorities.</p>
