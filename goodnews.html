          <p>The U.S. Air Force has announced the first flight of a second B-21 Raider stealth bomber, a key milestone expected to accelerate the testing of America's newest long-range bomber. This development allows for the integration of weapons and mission systems into the next-generation aircraft, which is designed to penetrate advanced enemy air defenses. The Air Force plans to acquire at least 100 of these sixth-generation bombers, which will form the backbone of the U.S. bomber fleet alongside modernized B-52s. The program is crucial for maintaining a strategic military advantage, particularly in the Indo-Pacific region.</p>

          <p>European Commission President Ursula von der Leyen has announced that the EU will fast-track its review of the planned 2035 ban on new internal combustion engine cars. The decision comes in response to significant pressure from European automakers, who cite challenges such as dependency on Asia for batteries, high costs, and intense competition from Chinese electric vehicles. Industry leaders argue the 2035 target is no longer feasible and are calling for relaxed emissions requirements and the inclusion of other low-emission technologies. Environmental groups, however, are urging the EU to remain firm on the original deadline to drive innovation and investment.</p>

          <h2>Analysts Debate Fate of $7.6 Trillion in Money Market Funds as Fed Prepares for Rate Cuts</h2>
          <div class="timestamp">2025-09-12 15:21:19 EDT</div>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>With the Federal Reserve expected to begin cutting interest rates, investors and market analysts are closely watching the record $7.6 trillion currently held in high-yield money market funds. A prevailing theory suggests that as yields on these cash-equivalent accounts fall, a significant portion of this capital could flow into riskier assets like stocks and bonds, potentially fueling a market rally. However, some experts are skeptical, arguing that the majority of these funds are held by institutions and corporations that are unlikely to shift their strategy. They contend that money fund assets have historically only decreased when rates approach zero. (not investment advice)</p>

          <h2>Key Considerations for Prospective Homebuyers in a Falling Mortgage Rate Environment</h2>
          <div class="timestamp">2025-09-12 15:13:07 EDT</div>
        </div>
        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>As mortgage rates decline to their lowest levels in nearly a year, prospective homebuyers are facing a timely opportunity, but should proceed with strategic considerations. Experts advise that timing is critical, as lenders often adjust rates in anticipation of Federal Reserve actions, meaning the best rates may appear before an official cut. It is also crucial for buyers to have a high credit score to qualify for the most favorable terms and to secure a pre-approval to demonstrate seriousness to sellers. The article suggests prioritizing finding the right home over waiting for even lower rates, as refinancing is always a future option. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>Los Angeles Mayor Karen Bass has named Mitch Kamin, a lawyer with extensive experience in nonprofits and legal services, as her new chief of staff. Kamin becomes the mayor's third chief of staff in under three years, a notably faster turnover rate than in previous administrations. He previously served as general counsel for the Lucas Museum of Narrative Art and as a partner at the law firm Covington & Burling, where he represented the city in a lawsuit against the Trump administration's immigration policies. Bass praised Kamin as a "seasoned leader and status quo disrupter" who will take charge of her office later this month.</p>

          <p>Terence Crawford, who is moving up two weight classes, successfully made weight for his super-middleweight championship fight against Saul "Canelo" Alvarez in Las Vegas. Both fighters weighed in just under the 12-stone limit, with an unbeaten Crawford appearing remarkably conditioned for the heavier division. Crawford aims to become the first male boxer in the modern era to be an undisputed champion in three different weight classes. The highly anticipated bout will see Alvarez defend his four major world titles, with his natural power at the weight class posing a significant challenge for Crawford.</p>

          <p>A federal grand jury has indicted identical twin brothers, Se Youn Kim and Hee Youn Kim, on charges of tax evasion and running an illegal tee time brokering scheme. The brothers allegedly monopolized reservations at numerous public golf courses in Southern California, reselling the coveted slots to customers for a fee and earning nearly $700,000. Prosecutors accuse them of failing to report a combined $1.1 million in income from this business and their work as MRI technicians. The arrests bring a sense of justice to local golfers who have long been frustrated by the inability to secure tee times on public courses.</p>
