          <p>Federal Reserve Governor Christopher Waller has surpassed other candidates to become the leading contender for the next Fed chair on prediction markets like Kalshi. His odds surged following reports that advisors to President Trump are impressed with his policy approach, which favors adjusting monetary policy based on forecasts rather than only current data. Waller, who was nominated to the Fed by Trump in 2020, recently dissented from a decision to hold rates steady, arguing the central bank's approach was overly cautious. Other candidates like Kevin Warsh and Kevin Hassett have seen their odds decrease in response. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>The Northern Superchargers secured a dominant 47-run victory over the Welsh Fire in The Hundred cricket competition at Headingley. After setting a target of 141-4, the Superchargers' bowlers dismantled the Fire's batting lineup, dismissing them for just 94 runs, their lowest total in the women's competition. Australian all-rounder Georgia Wareham was the standout performer, contributing with both bat and ball and playing a role in two run-outs. The significant margin of victory provides the Superchargers with a valuable net run-rate boost, placing them at the top of the league table.</p>

          <p>President Donald Trump is set to sign an executive order that will allow alternative assets, including cryptocurrencies, private equity, and real estate, to be included in 401(k) retirement plans. The order directs the Department of Labor to review guidance under the Employee Retirement Income Security Act (ERISA), which governs most retirement plans. This move is seen as a significant win for the alternative asset industry, which has been advocating for inclusion in these defined contribution plans, although it introduces new potential risks for retail investors. The policy change aims to broaden investment options for the trillions of dollars held in American retirement accounts. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>Tampa Bay Buccaneers quarterback Teddy Bridgewater defended his actions while serving as a volunteer head coach for his high school alma mater, which led to a suspension. Bridgewater stated he was acting as a "protector" for the student-athletes, many of whom come from a tough neighborhood. He was suspended for providing financial benefits, including funding rides home and meals, which he said was to ensure the players' safety and well-being. Despite the controversy, Bridgewater expressed hope that his journey back to the NFL after a brief retirement serves as an inspiration to the young men he coached.</p>

          <p>A new executive order from President Trump greenlighting alternative assets in retirement plans has intensified focus on cryptocurrency ETFs as a vehicle for long-term investing. While some financial advisors now advocate for significant digital asset allocation, others remain cautious about the risks. The article explains that ETFs offer a convenient way to gain crypto exposure without directly holding the assets, similar to gold ETFs. It also highlights the distinction between standard ETFs like BlackRock's IBIT and high-risk leveraged funds, which are designed for short-term trading rather than long-term retirement strategies.

          <p>The National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration (NOAA) has published the list of names for the 2025 Atlantic hurricane season, which is predicted to see above-normal storm activity. The list, which includes names like Andrea, Barry, and Chantal, is one of six alphabetical lists that are rotated annually by the World Meteorological Organization. Names are retired from the list if they are associated with a particularly deadly or costly storm, making their reuse inappropriate. Naming storms helps improve communication and public preparedness, especially when multiple weather systems are active at the same time.</p>

          <p>The National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration (NOAA) has updated its forecast for the 2025 Atlantic hurricane season, slightly lowering its storm predictions but still anticipating above-normal activity. The agency now projects 13 to 18 named storms, with five to nine becoming hurricanes and two to five reaching major hurricane status. The outlook, which has a 50% chance of being above-normal, is influenced by factors like the neutral phase of the El Niño cycle and warmer-than-average ocean temperatures. Officials are using the forecast to urge communities in storm-prone areas to prepare in advance for potential impacts.</p>

          <p>Apple CEO Tim Cook announced a new $100 billion investment in U.S. manufacturing, a move seen as strengthening the company's position with the Trump administration and shifting focus away from its perceived lag in artificial intelligence. This commitment, announced at the White House, builds on a previous $500 billion pledge and includes a $2.5 billion expansion for Corning, which produces glass for iPhones and Apple Watches in the U.S. The investment could provide Apple with a competitive advantage over rivals like Samsung regarding potential tariffs. Analysts note that while this is a political win, Apple still faces pressure to deliver on its AI strategy. (not investment advice)</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>An article in The Atlantic argues that the societal decline in politeness, accelerated by online interactions and AI, is harming individual well-being. The author posits that being impolite, even to nonhuman entities like AI bots, can make people less happy, more depressed, and angrier. Citing research, the piece shows that courteous behavior is linked to higher happiness, and this effect holds true even when the courtesy is not reciprocated. The author suggests three personal rules: make courtesy a habit in all interactions, renounce sarcasm, and respond to rudeness with dignity, framing politeness as a countercultural act of personal freedom.</p>

          <p>A startup named Neurable is pioneering consumer-grade headphones equipped with a brain-computer interface (BCI) that uses EEG sensors to monitor brainwaves. The technology can interpret electrical signals to measure a user's focus levels, prompting them to take breaks when attention wanes, and is now being developed to track broader brain health metrics. Unlike trackers that measure downstream effects like heart rate, this BCI measures brain activity at its source, potentially enabling early detection of issues like cognitive decline or depression. The company aims to license its technology for use in other devices like earbuds and helmets, making neurotechnology more accessible.</p>

          <p>The Bank of England has lowered its main interest rate from 4.25% to 4.0%, the fifth cut since August of last year. The decision was narrowly passed by the Monetary Policy Committee, indicating that future cuts will be carefully considered amid concerns about rising inflation, which is now forecast to peak at 4%. The rate cut will provide immediate relief for homeowners with tracker mortgages but will likely mean lower returns for savers. Bank Governor Andrew Bailey stated that while the path for rates is still "downwards," the economy's slow growth and a softening labor market create uncertainty. (not investment advice)</p>
