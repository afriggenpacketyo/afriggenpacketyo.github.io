          <p>A 50-year-old woman who believed a lump in her groin was a pulled muscle from working out was later diagnosed with metastatic malignant melanoma that had spread to her lungs and brain. The diagnosis was unusual as she never had a visible mole, a typical sign of this deadly skin cancer. She underwent an aggressive treatment combining gamma knife radiation and immunotherapy, which, despite severe side effects, has led to what her doctor calls a "miraculous" improvement. Her story highlights the importance of investigating unusual lumps and the advancements in immunotherapy for treating late-stage cancer.</p>

          <p>Over the past 25 years, the Forum on China-Africa Cooperation (FOCAC) has dramatically deepened ties between China and African nations, leading to what officials call "leapfrog development." Since the forum's inception in 2000, trade has surged nearly thirtyfold and Chinese investment has grown almost a hundredfold. This economic partnership has been paralleled by increased security cooperation, with China becoming a leading arms supplier to the continent and annually training about 2,000 African military officers. This growing influence positions China ahead of traditional partners like the US, Russia, and France in the region.</p>

          <p>The U.S. Army has announced a significant reduction in its Military Working Equid program, with plans to put 141 of its 236 horses, donkeys, and mules up for adoption. These animals primarily serve in ceremonial roles, such as in parades, honor guards, and funeral processions at Arlington National Cemetery, providing a living connection to military heritage. The Army has not used equids in combat since 1942 but values their stately presence in official ceremonies. This move is expected to save approximately $2 million annually, while the Army will retain enough animals for key ceremonial duties.</p>

          <p>Representatives for the Democratic Republic of Congo (DRC) and the Rwanda-backed M23 militia have signed a provisional ceasefire agreement in Qatar. The deal commits both parties to establishing a permanent truce and a comprehensive peace agreement by August 18. This development is a significant step toward achieving stability in the mineral-rich eastern DRC, a region plagued by decades of conflict involving numerous armed groups. The terms of the final agreement are still being negotiated, with key issues including the release of captured fighters and the withdrawal of M23 troops from seized territories.</p>

          <p>The England women's football team is hopeful that captain Leah Williamson will be available for their Euro 2025 semi-final match against Italy. Williamson sustained an ankle injury during extra time in the quarter-final victory over Sweden and was later seen on crutches with a protective boot, which was reportedly a precautionary measure. Teammate Esme Morgan stated that Williamson was in "very high spirits" and that the team is optimistic about her recovery. Manager Sarina Wiegman confirmed that the defender will be assessed before Tuesday's crucial game.</p>

          <p>Two leading UK end-of-life charities, Marie Curie and Hospice UK, are calling for local councils to exempt people with a terminal diagnosis of less than 12 months to live from paying council tax. The campaign follows Manchester City Council's recent decision to become the first local authority to implement such a policy. Proponents argue that a terminal diagnosis often brings a severe income shock and increased costs, making council tax a significant burden. The exemption would provide crucial peace of mind and financial relief during an incredibly challenging time for patients and their families. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>The California red-legged frog, a threatened species absent from Southern California for decades, is making a comeback thanks to an innovative conservation effort. Scientists translocated frog eggs from a healthy population in Mexico's Baja Peninsula to prepared sites in California. After years of waiting for signs of breeding, researchers successfully used a custom AI model to analyze thousands of hours of audio recordings, detecting the frogs' mating calls. This technological breakthrough confirmed the re-introduced population is now breeding, marking a major success for the species' recovery and showcasing AI's potential in wildlife conservation.</p>

        </div>
        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>As the market for high-protein snacks grows, nutrition experts advise consumers to be discerning about marketing claims. Many products labeled "high-protein" may also contain significant amounts of sugar or be highly processed. Experts suggest a simple calculation: a food can be considered high in protein if 30% or more of its total calories come from protein. They also recommend checking the nutrition label for added sugars and prioritizing whole-food snacks like Greek yogurt, cottage cheese, or nuts. These alternatives often provide a better balance of nutrients without the unhealthy additives found in many packaged goods.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>To promote more mindful spending habits, financial therapists and consumer experts suggest asking a series of self-reflective questions before making a purchase. If the answer is 'yes' to any, it may be a sign to reconsider. Key questions include whether the purchase limits cash for necessities, if it's meant to fill an emotional need, or if it's an attempt to impress someone. Consumers are also advised to research products thoroughly rather than buying on impulse and to walk away if the desired item isn't exactly what they wanted, avoiding settling for a lesser alternative.</p>
