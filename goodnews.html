          <p>Experts are questioning the Trump Organization's claim that its proposed gold Trump phone can be made entirely from American components. An industry analyst stated that it would be "virtually impossible" to build the handset, retailing at $499, in the United States. The phone will come with a mobile service costing $47.45 per month, and the Trump family has not yet disclosed which company would manufacture the phone in the US. The announcement has raised ethical concerns, as critics suggest the venture could allow President Trump to personally profit while in office.</p>

          <p>As college graduates enter the job market, employment and salary prospects are increasing concerns weighed against the high costs of higher education. Surveys indicate that engineering, computer science, and healthcare majors offer the highest earning potential, while education and foreign language degrees often yield lower salaries. Rising tuition costs and economic instability contribute to student anxiety about finding employment after graduation, though a college education remains important for developing critical thinking skills and exposing students to diverse perspectives.</p>
