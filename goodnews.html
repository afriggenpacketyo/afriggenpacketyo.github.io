          <p>A new report indicates that insiders at AI chipmaker Nvidia have sold more than $1 billion of company stock over the past year, with approximately $500 million of those sales occurring in the last month. The selling activity has coincided with the stock reaching new highs, up over 17% this year. CEO Jensen Huang recently sold about $15 million in shares as part of a pre-announced plan to sell up to 6 million shares by the end of the year. Despite the significant insider sales, Nvidia's stock continued to rally, briefly regaining its position as the world's most valuable company. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>Jeff Bezos's company, Blue Origin, successfully completed its 13th passenger spaceflight, carrying six tourists to the edge of space and back. The New Shepard rocket launched from West Texas, propelling the capsule just above the 65-mile altitude mark, the internationally recognized boundary of space. Passengers, including the first Nigerian to fly to space, experienced about three minutes of weightlessness and viewed Earth through the capsule's large windows. Both the reusable booster and the passenger capsule landed safely, marking another successful mission in the growing sub-orbital tourism market, where Blue Origin currently operates without direct competition.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>With heatwaves becoming more common, an article from a BBC correspondent and guide dog handler emphasizes the severe risks of exercising dogs in hot weather. The RSPCA warns that dogs are far more likely to suffer heat-related illness from exercise than from being left in hot cars, as they can only regulate their temperature through panting and their paws. Key signs of overheating include heavy panting, lethargy, and excessive drooling. The article strongly advises owners to avoid walks during the hottest parts of the day, check pavement temperatures, and provide plenty of cool water, suggesting indoor play as a safe alternative for exercise.</p>

While Baidu's CEO claims the release will empower developers, some experts raise concerns about security and the potential for Chinese AI to become embedded in global applications.

While crypto trading itself may not be a major revenue driver, SoFi hopes these features will attract new users to its ecosystem.

The star, who was performing her ballad "16 Carriages," called for the music to stop and held onto a flagpole for support as the car was safely lowered to the ground. She later reassured the crowd, and her production company, Parkwood Entertainment, confirmed it was a "technical mishap" with no injuries. The incident is one of several minor prop malfunctions the superstar has experienced during her elaborate Cowboy Carter stadium tour.</p>
