        </div>
        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Prageeta Sharma's poem, "Irresistible Contentment," offers a deep dive into the speaker's introspective search for the core of poetic expression, moving beyond the corporeal. The article highlights the poem's exploration of language's transformative power, the internal conflict with articulation, and the yearning for a profound, authentic feeling that surpasses mere words. The speaker expresses a hope for speech to burn away superficiality, leading to a state of "golden silence" and a "plateau of nested changes." This work, featured in Sharma's new book *Onement Won*, contemplates the ongoing journey of self-discovery and artistic refinement, seeking a genuine connection to the creative spirit.</p>

          <p>North Korea's new Wonsan Kalma Coastal Tourist Zone, situated near a missile testing site, has begun welcoming Russian tourists, offering a highly controlled and unique vacation experience. One of the first visitors, Anastasia Samsonova, described pristine, uncrowded beaches but highlighted the constant presence of security guards and strict prohibitions on photography and dress code. The resort, reportedly inspired by Spain's Benidorm, is central to Kim Jong Un's efforts to boost tourism, despite ongoing human rights concerns regarding its construction and alleged forced labor. Despite the high cost and restrictive environment, the article notes some Russian visitors are keen to return, drawn by the exotic appeal of the secluded nation.</p>

          <p>SpaceX successfully launched its 33rd cargo resupply mission to the International Space Station early Sunday, delivering a Dragon capsule loaded with 2.5 tons of critical equipment and supplies. This CRS-33 mission is notable for carrying an innovative add-on thruster kit, equipped with two Draco engines and six propellant tanks, designed to assist in maintaining the ISS's orbital altitude. This new capability will provide approximately a quarter of the station's annual propulsion needs, supplementing current Russian re-boost operations. The cargo also includes more than 50 diverse research projects, such as studies on microgravity's effect on bone loss and experiments in 3D bioprinting, alongside essential provisions for the crew.</p>

          <p>R&B artist Ginuwine headlined a widely discussed concert at SeaWorld San Diego, becoming part of a viral series featuring 90s and 2000s hip-hop and R&B stars at the controversial marine park. The article delves into the public's mixed reactions, ranging from confusion to cynicism, with animal rights organizations like Peta denouncing the events as a cynical attempt to rehabilitate the park's image.

          <p>SpaceX, founded by Elon Musk in 2002, has emerged as a critical and dominant force in the U.S. space industry, now valued at approximately $400 billion. This article explains how crucial early government support, notably a $1.6 billion NASA Commercial Resupply Services contract in 2008, was instrumental in saving the company following its initial rocket failures. Currently, SpaceX's Falcon 9 rocket and Dragon capsule are the primary means for ferrying astronauts and supplies to the International Space Station, while its Starlink satellites provide vital internet services globally. The company's record 134 orbital launches in 2024 underscore its unparalleled market leadership, fundamentally transforming space access through reduced costs.</p>

          <p>Coyotes are flourishing in New York City's Central Park, exemplified by a pair named Romeo and Juliet, showcasing the remarkable adaptability of wildlife to urban settings across the United States. Naturalists and photographers are dedicated to documenting these animals to inform the public and encourage coexistence, stressing that coyotes rarely pose a threat to humans. Historically limited to western North America, coyotes have expanded their range eastward, benefiting from reduced predator populations and the growth of suburban areas. Initiatives such as New York City's WildlifeNYC program are actively promoting safe interactions by advocating for distant observation and responsible pet management, fostering a future where urban wildlife can thrive harmoniously.</p>
