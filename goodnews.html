          <p>Cracker Barrel Old Country Store has announced its decision to abandon a controversial new logo and reinstate its traditional design, which prominently features the "Old Timer" character. This significant reversal comes after widespread public outcry from customers and direct criticism from prominent political figures, including former President Donald Trump and his son, Donald Trump Jr., who publicly urged the company to listen to its base. The company's statement confirmed it had heeded its guests' feedback, with its stock experiencing a notable rise in after-hours trading following the announcement.

          <p>This article delves into the cultural significance of Taylor Swift and Travis Kelce's engagement, portraying their relationship as a "defiant conventionality" that resonates with modern audiences. It analyzes Swift's masterful storytelling of her own life and how "Brand Tayvis" embodies the beloved American archetype of the smart, successful woman and the lovable, supportive jock. The piece highlights Kelce's unresentful enthusiasm for Swift's success and the appeal of his "relaxed masculinity" to female fans.

          <p>Decades of dedicated conservation efforts in China's Shennongjia mountains have led to a significant recovery of the endangered golden snub-nosed monkey population. Once threatened by hunting and logging, their numbers have risen from below 500 to over 1,600, with hopes of reaching 2,000 within a decade. Professor Yang Jingyuan, who has spent his career studying and protecting the species, highlights the complex social structures of the monkeys and the success of turning local farmers into forest protectors.

          <p>China's upcoming Victory Day parade, marking the 80th anniversary of victory over Japan, aims to display the strength and solidarity of the People's Liberation Army (PLA) towards its 2027 modernization goal. However, the recent removal of former navy chief of staff Li Hanjun due to "serious violations of discipline and law" raises questions about corruption's impact on war readiness. While some see this as a hindrance, others view it as President Xi Jinping's commitment to building a "capable of winning wars" force. The article suggests the parade will offer insights into the PLA's latest weapons and new generation of commanders.</p>

          <p>A Utah judge has ordered the state legislature to redraw its congressional maps, a development that could benefit Democrats in the 2026 midterm elections. The ruling found that a 2020 state law unconstitutionally undermined a voter-passed proposition aimed at preventing partisan gerrymandering. Currently, all four of Utah's U.S. House seats are held by Republicans, but the Democratic Congressional Campaign Committee sees this as an opportunity to elect leaders that better represent voters' values. This article highlights the ongoing national battle over redistricting, with every winnable seat becoming crucial in the closely contested fight for House control.</p>

          <p>Conservative MP George Freeman will not face a parliamentary standards investigation regarding "cash for questions" allegations, after referring himself to the commissioner in June. Claims emerged that a company he advised helped him draft parliamentary questions related to space data and emissions tracking. Freeman, a former science minister, had been advised against lobbying the UK government on the company's behalf. The Commissioner found insufficient grounds for a formal investigation, with Freeman expressing delight and stating that lobbying rules do not prohibit MPs from advocating for sectors of public interest as long as declarations are followed.</p>
