        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Erik and Lyle Menendez, convicted of the 1989 murders of their parents, have been resentenced to 50 years to life, making them eligible for parole after serving over 30 years. The judge's decision follows years of the brothers claiming self-defense due to alleged abuse. Attorney Mark Geragos expressed optimism about bringing the brothers home, while prosecutors maintain they should not be released. The California Board of Parole Hearings will conduct separate hearings in June, and Governor Newsom will consider clemency after receiving the board's reports. The resentencing hearing included testimony from family members who believe the brothers have been rehabilitated and deserve release.</p>

          <p>Traditional British television is facing an existential threat from US streaming giants like Netflix and Amazon, prompting discussions about consolidation and new strategies for survival. With viewing habits shifting and the potential end of terrestrial TV in 2035, industry leaders are considering mergers and increased collaboration to compete with better-funded American rivals. Some suggest a unified streaming service under BBC iPlayer, while others argue for maintaining distinctiveness among British broadcasters. The challenge lies in competing financially with streamers and ensuring the survival of British-originated and British-focused content in the digital age.</p>

          <p>Lyle and Erik Menendez were resentenced to life in prison with the possibility of parole, a significant step in their effort to be released after more than 30 years for killing their parents.

          <p>Republican lawmakers are targeting online pornography with a proposed interstate ban on obscene content. Senator Mike Lee and Representative Mary Miller introduced the Interstate Obscenity Definition Act (IODA), aiming to clarify the definition of obscenity and make it easier to prosecute those who transmit such content across state lines. The bill seeks to update the legal definition of obscenity for the internet age, replacing subjective standards with practical ones. Supporters argue that the IODA will equip law enforcement with the tools needed to remove harmful material from the internet.</p>

          <p>Lower tariffs on Chinese goods are likely to keep auto-parts exports relatively attractive for American buyers, prompting mainland-based producers to reassess their plans to build production facilities in the US. The US agreed to lower its combined 145 per cent tariffs on most Chinese imports to 30 per cent for 90 days after talks in Geneva on Monday, cooling a stand-off between the world‚Äôs two biggest economies since US President Donald Trump rolled out his so-called reciprocal tariffs on the nation‚Äôs trading partners. Officials with five vendors said they embraced the truce since their goods were still demanded by their American clients.</p>

          <p>A team of researchers in China has questioned hospitals‚Äô rapid adoption of DeepSeek , warning that it creates clinical safety and privacy risks, raising red flags over the rush to use the artificial intelligence (AI) start-up‚Äôs cost-efficient open-source models. As of early March, at least 300 hospitals in China have started using DeepSeek‚Äôs large language models (LLMs) in clinical diagnostics and medical decision support. The researchers warned that DeepSeek‚Äôs tendency to generate ‚Äúplausible but factually incorrect outputs‚Äù could lead to ‚Äúsubstantial clinical risk‚Äù, despite strong reasoning capabilities.</p>
