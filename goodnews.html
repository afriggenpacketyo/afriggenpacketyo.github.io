          <p>The Japanese government began selling its stockpiled rice through direct contracts with retailers to combat soaring rice prices. Consumers flocked to purchase the cheaper rice, with some stores selling out within minutes. The government aims to distribute 300,000 tons of rice from 2021 and 2022 harvests through this initiative. This effort marks a shift from previous auction-based sales, with the hope that direct contracts will more effectively curb rice prices and ease the financial burden on households.</p>
