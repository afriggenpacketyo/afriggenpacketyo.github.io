          <p>Alphabet reported second-quarter financial results that exceeded analyst expectations for both revenue and earnings per share. The company announced a significant increase in its capital expenditure forecast for 2025, raising it by $10 billion to a total of $85 billion, primarily to support growing demand for its Cloud and AI services. Despite increased competition, Google's core search and advertising businesses demonstrated strong growth, and its YouTube and Cloud segments also outperformed revenue predictions. The company's AI products, AI Overviews and the Gemini app, showed substantial user growth. (not investment advice)</p>

        </div>
        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>This article explores the history of the word "OK," tracing its origins to a linguistic fad in 1830s Boston where phrases were humorously abbreviated and misspelled. "OK" began as a joke, standing for "oll korrect," a misspelling of "all correct." The term gained widespread popularity during President Martin Van Buren's 1840 reelection campaign, as it aligned with his nickname, "Old Kinderhook." Now considered one of the most universally understood words, its simplicity and versatility made it ideal for the telegraph age and its global spread was accelerated by American soldiers in the 20th century.</p>

          <h2>Trump Administration Considers Eliminating Capital Gains Tax on Home Sales</h2>
          <div class="timestamp">2025-07-23 17:26:12 EDT</div>
        </div>
        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>President Trump has indicated that his administration is considering a proposal to eliminate capital gains taxes on profits from the sale of primary residences. This move, aimed at stimulating the housing market, follows the introduction of the "No Tax on Home Sales Act" by Rep. Marjorie Taylor Greene. Under current law, profits exceeding $250,000 for single filers or $500,000 for married couples are subject to capital gains tax. While the proposal could benefit many homeowners, particularly in high-value markets, experts suggest that raising the existing exemption is a more likely outcome than a complete elimination of the tax.

          <p>International Business Machines (IBM) reported second-quarter financial results that surpassed analyst expectations for both earnings and revenue, driven by strong growth in its software and infrastructure segments. The company's revenue increased by nearly 8% year-over-year, and its generative AI book of business grew to $7.5 billion. Despite the positive report and reaffirming its full-year forecast for revenue growth and free cash flow, IBM's shares declined by as much as 5% in extended trading. The company noted that geopolitical tensions and constrained U.S. federal spending are causing some clients to proceed with caution. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>Republican Senators Susan Collins and Lisa Murkowski have joined several Democrats in sponsoring a bill to shield U.S. small businesses from President Trump's tariffs on Canadian goods. The legislation, named the CANADA Act, comes as the administration threatens a blanket 35% tariff on Canadian imports. The bill specifically targets tariffs announced earlier in the year, which proponents argue threaten jobs and increase costs for businesses reliant on cross-border trade. The bipartisan support signals significant political concern over the economic impact of the trade dispute with Canada, one of America's largest trading partners.</p>

          <p>A recent viral incident, where a married CEO and his subordinate were caught on a Jumbotron at a Coldplay concert, has reignited discussions about privacy and public shaming. The article explores the phenomenon of "panopticontent," where everyday people are unknowingly turned into online spectacles, often for entertainment or brand opportunism. While some actions are seen as justified, like exposing racism, the trend has descended into less urgent and more opportunistic surveillance. The piece argues that this normalization of exposing strangers, amplified by social media and brands, erodes social norms around privacy and creates a culture of fear.</p>

          <p>In a pair of significant rulings, federal judges in Tennessee and Maryland have acted to protect Kilmar Abrego Garcia, a Salvadoran national facing human smuggling charges. One judge ordered his release from criminal custody, while another barred ICE from immediately detaining him, requiring 72 hours' notice before any removal proceedings. Abrego Garcia was previously deported to El Salvador in what the government called an "administrative error," despite a court order protecting him. The new rulings are seen as a rebuke of the government's handling of the case and a crucial safeguard for his due process rights.</p>

          <div class="timestamp">2025-07-23 16:50:00 EDT</div>
        </div>
        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>The term "corn sweat" refers to the process of evapotranspiration, where vast fields of corn release significant moisture into the atmosphere during hot, sunny weather. This phenomenon dramatically increases humidity, making the air feel more oppressive and elevating the heat index to dangerous levels, as seen in recent Midwest heat waves. While the process itself has a slight cooling effect, the intense humidity it creates can offset this, trapping heat and preventing nighttime cooling. This agricultural reality, driven by monoculture farming, exacerbates the human impact of extreme heat events that are becoming more common with climate change.</p>

          <p>Meta is rolling out new safety features for teen users on its platforms, including enhanced protections in direct messaging to help spot potential scammers and exploitative content. This move follows the company's removal of nearly 135,000 Instagram accounts for sexualizing children, which led to the removal of an additional 500,000 linked accounts. The company is now automatically placing teen accounts into its strictest settings to filter offensive messages and limit contact from unknown adults. These updates come amid increasing pressure from policymakers and state attorneys general over the platform's impact on youth mental health and safety.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>This article analyzes whether a $10,000 deposit would earn more interest in a 6-month Certificate of Deposit (CD) or a high-yield savings account. A CD offers a high, fixed interest rate but requires locking the money away, while a high-yield savings account provides flexibility with a variable rate. Based on current rates, a 6-month CD at 4.45% would earn slightly more than a high-yield savings account at 4.30%. The CD's return is also guaranteed, whereas the savings account's rate is likely to decrease if the Federal Reserve cuts rates later in the year. (not investment advice)</p>

The mission aims to understand how energy from the sun couples with our planet's magnetosphere, creating "space weather" phenomena like auroras that can also disrupt GPS, power grids, and satellites. The identical satellites will fly in tandem, allowing for precise measurements of the rapid changes in this protective magnetic shield. The launch also deployed several other small satellites for various scientific and technological research purposes, including one testing 5G communications in space.</p>

          <p>This review praises "The Fantastic Four: First Steps" as a refreshing departure from typical modern superhero blockbusters, embracing a mature, retro sci-fi tone reminiscent of the 1950s. Directed by Matt Shakman, the film is described as staid and sure-footed, focusing on the established, adult heroes as they face the world-devouring threat of Galactus. The movie is commended for its lean narrative, crisp visuals, and emotionally credible performances from its cast, including Pedro Pascal and Vanessa Kirby. By valuing its characters' "lameness" and dignity, the film successfully reboots the franchise with a unique and charmingly vintage sensibility.</p>
