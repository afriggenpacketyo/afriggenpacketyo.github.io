          <p>Following a meeting with Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy, U.S. President Donald Trump has dramatically shifted his position on the war in Ukraine. In a social media post, Trump stated that Ukraine is in a position to "WIN all of Ukraine back in its original form," a stark contrast to his previous suggestions that Kyiv might need to cede territory for peace. Zelenskyy praised the meeting as productive and called Trump's pivot a "big shift," while Ukrainian politicians expressed cautious optimism about the change in rhetoric.</p>

          <p>A study by Oxford Economics reveals that YouTube's creative ecosystem contributed £2.2 billion to the UK's economy and supported an estimated 45,000 jobs in 2024. In response to this growing sector, an all-party parliamentary group has been launched to represent UK creators and address challenges they face, such as access to funding and permits. The move signifies growing recognition in Westminster for the significant economic and cultural impact of the online content creation industry.</p>

          <p>A new report indicates that China's implementation of visa-free travel policies has significantly boosted the international influence of Beijing and Shanghai. Driven by a surge in tourist arrivals and better transport links, Beijing climbed to sixth place on the 2025 International Exchange Centres Index, while Shanghai rose to eighth. The policy has successfully attracted more foreign visitors and enhanced the cities' roles as global hubs for culture, science, and finance, reflecting a strategic move to open up and increase global engagement.</p>

The home, named Higher Ground, provides a supportive environment for women re-entering the community after treatment or incarceration in a region devastated by the opioid crisis. Residents receive assistance with employment and education while building a sense of kinship and mutual support, filling a critical gap in local recovery services.</p>

          <h2>New York City Considers Moving Mayoral Elections to Even-Numbered Years to Boost Turnout</h2>

        </div>
        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>New York City voters are set to decide on a proposal to move municipal elections to even-numbered years, aligning them with federal and state races. This initiative is part of a national trend aimed at combating chronically low voter turnout in off-cycle local elections. Proponents argue that consolidating election dates increases participation from younger and more diverse demographics, while also reducing administrative costs, though some express concern that local issues could be overshadowed by larger political contests.</p>

          <p>The UK's home secretary has launched an urgent review into the use of taxis for transporting asylum seekers following a BBC investigation. The report found that some individuals were being taken on long-distance journeys, such as a 250-mile trip to a doctor's appointment, at a significant cost to the taxpayer. The investigation raised questions about the efficiency and necessity of the automated booking system used in hotels, which often defaults to taxis without considering more cost-effective options like public transport.</p>

          <p>UK energy regulator Ofgem has announced that all suppliers must offer customers a tariff with a lower standing charge by the end of January. This move addresses complaints from low-energy users who are disproportionately affected by the fixed daily fee, which covers network costs. However, these new tariffs will likely feature higher per-unit energy prices, meaning the change is unlikely to reduce overall bills for most households but will offer more choice in how they pay for their energy supply.</p>
