          <p>Concerns are growing over Novak Djokovic's fitness ahead of his Wimbledon semi-final match against world number one Jannik Sinner. Djokovic, who had an awkward fall in his quarter-final, canceled a scheduled practice session on Thursday. Sinner is also managing an elbow injury, adding another layer of uncertainty to the highly anticipated matchup. Given Djokovic's age and recent injury history, his physical condition remains a key variable for the upcoming high-stakes game.</p>

          <p>The OPEC international seminar took place at Vienna's Hofburg palace, bringing together energy ministers and top CEOs to discuss the oil market, investments, and the green energy transition. The event, marked by a lavish setting, was led by Saudi Energy Minister Prince Abdulaziz bin Salman. However, the conference also drew protests from demonstrators who gathered nearby, calling for an oil embargo in solidarity with Gaza. The seminar provided a rare opportunity for in-person briefings as OPEC+ has increasingly held meetings via videoconference.</p>

          <p>Tesla is experiencing a significant sales boom in Norway, with a 54% year-on-year increase in June, standing in stark contrast to its declining performance across much of Europe. The surge is largely driven by the popularity of the revamped Model Y, which meets Norwegian demand for space and all-wheel drive at a competitive price. This success persists despite a notable backlash against CEO Elon Musk's political activities, which a survey found would deter 43% of Norwegian EV drivers from buying a Tesla. Norway's strong pro-EV government policies continue to foster a uniquely favorable market.</p>

          <p>In a major environmental restoration effort, China has demolished approximately 300 dams and closed numerous hydropower stations along the Red River, a key tributary of the upper Yangtze. This action aims to save the habitat of rare and endemic fish species, which ecologists consider a last refuge in the region. For decades, the dense network of dams has severely restricted water flow, blocking fish migration routes and shrinking vital spawning grounds. The project represents a significant shift towards prioritizing ecological recovery in one of the country's most important river systems.</p>

          <p>China is experiencing a rapid increase in the adoption of electric-powered heavy trucks, with sales estimated to have risen 175% in the first half of the year. This boom, driven by government subsidies and a fast-growing charging network, is significantly curbing the nation's diesel consumption and overall oil demand. The shift is so pronounced that some analysts have revised their forecasts, now predicting that China's oil demand may have already peaked. The lower operating costs of electric trucks are making them an increasingly attractive option for commercial use. (not investment advice)</p>
