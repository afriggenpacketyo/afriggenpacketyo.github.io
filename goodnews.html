          <h2>Autonomous Vehicles Show Potential to Significantly Reduce Traffic Fatalities</h2>
          <div class="timestamp">2025-05-04 08:00:00 EDT</div>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>A new study by Waymo analyzing 56.7 million miles driven by its autonomous vehicles in several cities reveals that self-driving cars could drastically reduce traffic fatalities. The study found significantly fewer airbag-deploying crashes, injury crashes, and pedestrian injuries compared to human drivers. Extrapolating the data across all vehicle miles driven in the U.S. suggests that autonomous vehicles could potentially save tens of thousands of lives annually. Despite caveats regarding weather conditions and geofenced areas, the article argues that slowing down the development and deployment of autonomous vehicles is costing lives due to the far greater carnage caused by human drivers.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Anthony Albanese secured a landslide victory in the Australian election, potentially bolstered by anti-Trump sentiment. Despite Albanese's attempts to maintain a neutral stance towards President Trump, the global turmoil caused by Trump's policies influenced the election. Peter Dutton, the opposition leader, was nicknamed "Temu Trump" for espousing some of Trump's ideas, which voters rejected. The cost-of-living crisis and fluctuations in retirement accounts due to Trump's policy announcements also contributed to the election outcome.</p>

          <p>Native American women are reclaiming and revitalizing traditional facial tattoos, known as inchunwa, as a symbol of cultural identity and commitment to their communities. The Inchunwa Project is supporting this revival, hosting retreats for artists and community members to research and practice the ancient art form. The tattoos, which carry deep cultural meanings and reflect personal promises, are seen as a way to honor ancestors and create a legacy for future generations. The practice underscores the belief that Indigenous culture is a living tradition, not a relic of the past.</p>
