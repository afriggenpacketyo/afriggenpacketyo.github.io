          <p>Electric vehicles, once a mainstay over a century ago, face renewed challenges as the Trump administration works to undercut their growth and impose new taxes. Scholars note parallels between the early 1900s demise of EVs and current attacks, including political opposition and convenience concerns. Republicans are pushing to eliminate subsidies and impose fees on EVs, echoing historical biases towards oil and gasoline. The article also discusses gender stereotypes and marketing tactics that influenced the early adoption and subsequent decline of electric cars.</p>

          <p>The Los Angeles Dodgers are working with closer Tanner Scott to adjust his pitching strategy after recent blown saves. The Dodgers' pitching coach, Mark Prior, noted that Scott is leaving too many pitches in the middle of the strike zone, leading to hitters making good contact. Scott's increased aggressiveness in the strike zone, while resulting in fewer walks, has also reduced his swing-and-miss rate. The Dodgers hope that by locating his fastball better and more consistently executing his slider, Scott can regain his effectiveness.</p>
