          <p>Daniel Graham and Adam Carruthers, who were convicted of cutting down the Sycamore Gap tree, were also suspects in a sexual assault investigation. The investigation involved alleged homophobic assaults that occurred around the same time as the tree felling. One victim reported being doused in icing sugar and verbally abused, and later identified himself in videos of other men suffering homophobic abuse. Despite the police preparing a file, the Crown Prosecution Service (CPS) decided against bringing charges due to insufficient evidence and time elapsed, a decision the victim challenged unsuccessfully.</p>

          <p>This week's inflation report will provide initial insights into the effects of President Trump's "Liberation Day" tariff policies on U.S. prices. Economists anticipate a slight cooling in inflation, with prices expected to increase by 2.3% over the year ending in April. Trump has since eased some tariffs, including temporarily reducing levies on China from 145% to 30% for 90 days, while China also agreed to cut tariffs on U.S. goods. Federal Reserve Chair Jerome Powell has cautioned that sustained tariffs could lead to higher inflation and slower economic growth.</p>

          <p>Rangers have not yet established a leading candidate for their new manager, despite reports linking Davide Ancelotti, assistant at Real Madrid, to the position. While Spanish newspaper Marca suggested Ancelotti was identified by 49ers Enterprises, discussions with potential managers are ongoing, and sources indicate that no leading candidate has been determined. Carlo Ancelotti, Davide's father, will leave Real Madrid to coach Brazil. Barry Ferguson is currently serving as interim head coach for Rangers.</p>

          <h2>Fintechs Face Resilience Test as High Interest Rates Decline</h2>
          <div class="timestamp">2025-05-13 04:55:03 EDT</div>

          <p>Financial technology firms that profited from high interest rates are now facing a resilience test as rates decline, raising doubts about the sustainability of their business models. Fintechs like Robinhood, Revolut, and Monzo saw significant boosts to their net interest income during periods of high rates, but falling rates could expose vulnerabilities. Some fintechs are diversifying their revenue streams to reduce reliance on interest income, offering services like crypto trading and mobile plans. Diversified income strategies are seen as key to weathering changes in the economy. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>The US and China have agreed to a 90-day pause during which most of the recently imposed tariffs will be drastically reduced. The agreement creates a mechanism to avoid further escalation, with the US stating it does not want a general decoupling of the two countries' economies, but wants to decouple in strategic industries. Washington will slash levies on 'de minimis' shipments, and China has removed a ban on airlines taking delivery of Boeing jets. The deal has lifted global stocks, but economists point out that average tariffs remain significantly higher than before the turmoil.</p>
