          <p>The Welsh government has proposed changes to controversial tax rules for self-catering holiday accommodations, aiming to modify the criteria for paying non-domestic rates instead of higher council tax. Currently, properties must be available for 252 days and let for 182 days annually; the new proposal suggests an average of 182 days let over several years. While the government claims to have listened to feedback, industry groups and Welsh language societies criticize the changes as insufficient, arguing they fail to address the housing crisis or the challenges faced by the tourism sector. A consultation on these proposals is open until November 20, with changes intended for April 2026.</p>

          <p>Nvidia reported better-than-expected earnings and revenue for the second quarter of 2026, with sales growth projected to remain above 50%, indicating strong demand for AI infrastructure. Despite these positive results, the stock experienced a slight dip in extended trading as data center revenue, while robust, fell short of analyst estimates for the second consecutive period. The company expects between $3 and $4 trillion in AI infrastructure spending by the end of the decade, with geopolitical issues surrounding H20 chip shipments to China impacting potential sales. Nvidia's board also approved an additional $60 billion in share repurchases. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>UK Prime Minister Sir Keir Starmer is replacing Nin Pandit, his principal private secretary, marking the third senior staff change in his Downing Street office in under a year. Pandit, who has been in the role for ten months, will transition to a new policy delivery position. Reports suggest concerns about her effectiveness, though Number 10 contests this, and allies state the Prime Minister retains trust and confidence in her. This significant turnover, following the departures of chief of staff Sue Gray and communications director Matthew Doyle, signals ongoing adjustments within Starmer's top team amidst expectations of a junior ministerial reshuffle.</p>

          <p>Japan's chief trade negotiator, Ryosei Akazawa, postponed a trip to Washington, urging the Trump administration to expedite the implementation of a previously agreed tariffs deal. Tokyo is pushing for a presidential order to correct "reciprocal tariffs" and lower duties on autos and auto parts, following a misunderstanding where an initial 15% tariff was mistakenly added to existing duties. Japanese officials emphasize the importance of sincere and prompt implementation for the economic security of both nations, highlighting that the deal is crucial for bilateral trade. US Commerce Secretary Howard Lutnick indicated Washington's readiness to finalize the agreement, which includes Japan's pledge to invest up to $550 billion in the United States.

          <p>Sales of British-made cars to the US rose by 6.8% in July, reversing a three-month decline, following a new UK-US tariff deal. This agreement reduced import taxes on UK cars from an initial 27.5% to 10% for the first 100,000 vehicles, underscoring the importance of the trade deal for the British automotive industry. While the US remains the largest single national market for British-built cars, overall UK car manufacturing continues to struggle, with output down 11.7% year-to-date, attributed to factors like higher labor costs, increased competition, and Brexit. Experts note the deal's positive impact, especially for premium brands like Jaguar Land Rover. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>Nate Landman, a linebacker for the Los Angeles Rams, shares his unique experience as one of the few active NFL players born in Zimbabwe, often encountering disbelief due to his Californian accent. Despite moving to the US at age three, Landman maintains a strong connection to his African roots through family culture, food, and tattoos, including the continent of Africa on his chest. His journey to the NFL was unconventional, going undrafted but persevering to become a starter, a path he credits for shaping him. Landman emphasizes the importance of his identity and the support from relatives in Zimbabwe, proudly carrying his heritage onto the field as a source of pride and motivation.</p>

          <h2>AI Displacing Entry-Level Workers, Study Reveals Impact on Job Market</h2>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>A new Stanford study indicates that generative AI tools like ChatGPT are displacing entry-level workers, particularly in fields highly exposed to AI such as software engineering and customer service. Since 2022, early-career employment in these sectors has dropped by 13%, while older workers in the same jobs have seen growth, likely due to their accumulated tacit knowledge and soft skills. The research, using ADP payroll data, suggests AI is augmenting more experienced workers but automating tasks typically performed by younger employees. This trend signals a significant disruption and rearrangement within the labor market, emphasizing the need for workers to adapt by learning to leverage AI tools.</p>

          <p>In drought-stricken Las Vegas, about two dozen "water waste investigators" patrol neighborhoods daily, enforcing conservation efforts for the Southern Nevada Water Authority. They identify violations like misaligned sprinklers and over-irrigation, issuing notices and fines for repeat offenders, while also offering financial assistance for repairs to low-income homeowners. These patrols, part of broader conservation measures including banning decorative grass and recycling water, have helped Las Vegas reduce Colorado River water consumption by over 30% since 2002, despite significant population growth. Such initiatives are crucial as the region faces "exceptional" drought conditions and declining reservoir levels.</p>

This upgrade, the largest investment in Amtrak's rolling stock in 25 years, follows years of development and technical delays due to challenges with the aging infrastructure shared with other rail lines. Despite the new trains, high-speed rail in the US faces uncertainty, with the Trump administration seeking to revoke federal grants from California's troubled project. However, Transportation Secretary Sean Duffy insists the administration supports high-speed rail's success and is taking on major station renovation projects.</p>

          <p>Computer-chip designer Nvidia reported a 56% revenue surge to $46.7 billion for the second quarter, driven by strong demand from tech giants expanding their AI capabilities. Despite this AI boom, Nvidia continues to navigate "geopolitical issues," particularly US-China tensions that impact chip sales, causing its shares to fall in after-hours trading. CEO Jensen Huang noted the "AI race is now on," with spending from four big tech firms doubling to $600 billion annually, and predicted AI would accelerate GDP growth, with Nvidia at the heart of this infrastructure. The company is lobbying the US government for approval to sell its Blackwell chips to China, a crucial market. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>The news of Taylor Swift's engagement sparked widespread emotional reactions among fans, highlighting the phenomenon of "parasocial relationships" where individuals feel deeply invested in a celebrity's life as if they were a close friend. Psychologists explain that constant exposure to celebrities' private lives through social media creates an illusion of intimacy, fulfilling a human need for connection. While these one-sided friendships can offer distraction and a sense of community, experts caution that they lack reciprocal "nutritional content" and cannot replace real-life relationships. This pop culture event serves as a vivid example of modern fan engagement and the evolving nature of human connection.</p>

          <p>The value of small parcels shipped from China to the UK under an import tax exemption more than doubled last year to £3 billion, primarily driven by Chinese e-commerce giants like Shein and Temu. These low-value imports now constitute 51% of all small parcels entering the UK, up from 35% previously. The UK government is reviewing these rules, facing pressure from domestic retailers who argue the exemption undercuts them and exposes consumers to potentially unsafe products. While some warn of disproportionate impact on lower-income consumers, the British Retail Consortium urges swift action to level the playing field. (not investment advice)</p>

This statement followed South Korean President Lee Jae-myung's assessment that Seoul needs to rebalance its relationship with Beijing amidst intensifying US-China competition. Lee had previously stated that South Korea could no longer maintain its previous logic of relying on the US for security while cooperating with China on the economy, and could not act against America's basic policy stance.
