          <p>Following a period of heightened trade tensions, the United States and China have resumed communication, signaling potential progress in bilateral discussions. Chinese Vice Foreign Minister Ma Zhaoxu and U.S. Deputy Secretary of State Christopher Landau held a call to exchange views on crucial issues, building on earlier talks in Geneva where both sides agreed to temporarily lower tariffs. These statements reflect a mutual interest in stabilizing the relationship and maintaining engagement, further evidenced by Ma's conciliatory meeting with the new U.S. Ambassador to China, David Perdue. The resumption of dialogue offers a glimmer of hope for resolving ongoing trade disputes between the two nations.</p>

          <p>Jussie Smollett, the former "Empire" actor, has settled a lawsuit with the city of Chicago by agreeing to donate $50,000 to a local charity. This resolves the city's claim for reimbursement of over $130,000 spent on investigating his alleged hate crime hoax in 2019. Smollett's conviction for staging the incident was overturned on double jeopardy grounds by the Illinois Supreme Court. The donation will be made to the Building Brighter Futures Center for the Arts, which supports underprivileged youth in Chicago, allowing all parties to move forward from the six-year-old case.</p>
