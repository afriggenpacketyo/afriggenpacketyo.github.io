          <p>Months after the Los Angeles County fires sent toxic materials into the ocean, public agencies and scientists are analyzing seawater and sand to assess the safety of beaches. While tests have not found contaminant levels likely to pose health risks to beachgoers, the extent of ecological damage dwarfs the available measurement tools. The seawater safety testing is designed for sewage-related hazards, not fire debris, and there are no clear health guidelines for safe exposure levels to fire-related contaminants. This lack of guidelines makes it difficult to provide simple answers about beach safety, leading to public frustration.</p>

          <p>President Donald Trump unleashed a series of attacks on the Supreme Court, fellow Republicans, and celebrities in social media posts, highlighting domestic political challenges and personal grievances. He criticized Bruce Springsteen for speaking negatively about him in a foreign country, accused the Supreme Court of being "played," and took a swipe at Taylor Swift, claiming she's no longer "HOT." These posts, sent during his flight back from Abu Dhabi, reflect Trump's willingness to target perceived enemies in both politics and culture, while also shifting his focus back to domestic issues.</p>

          <p>Swedish journalist Joakim Medin, who was jailed in Turkey for "insulting" President Recep Tayyip Erdogan, has been released, according to Swedish Prime Minister Ulf Kristersson.

He received an 11-month suspended sentence for "insulting the president" and faced additional charges of "belonging to a terror organization."

          <p>A New York Times guest essay discusses a House amendment to the Republican budget package that would allow the sale or transfer of approximately 500,000 acres of public land in Nevada and Utah. Representative Ryan Zinke of Montana, former interior secretary, opposes the amendment, threatening the budget bill's future. The amendment reflects Interior Secretary Doug Burgum's view of public lands as assets to be exploited, a perspective the author argues is shortsighted and threatens a century of conservation progress. The essay emphasizes the importance of public lands for their beauty, biodiversity, historical significance, and recreational value, and notes that selling them off would not solve the nation's affordable housing crisis.</p>

The FDA's approval comes after a study comparing the blood test results with brain scans and spinal fluid tests showed high accuracy.

          <p>Washington Elementary STEM magnet school in Pasadena, California, is undergoing a green transformation with the help of Amigos de los Rios, an organization dedicated to addressing environmental disparities. The school, which serves primarily low-income Latino and Black students, is adding native plants, vegetable gardens, climate-resilient trees, and outdoor classrooms. These green spaces aim to improve children‚Äôs health, well-being, and academic performance, while also combating the heat island effect caused by excessive asphalt and lack of tree cover.</p>
