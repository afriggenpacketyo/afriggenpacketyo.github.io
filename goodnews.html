          <p>Singapore's economy demonstrated robust growth in the second quarter of 2025, expanding 4.3% year-over-year and significantly outpacing economists' forecasts. The manufacturing sector was a primary driver of this acceleration, which marked a rebound from the previous quarter's contraction. Despite the positive figures, the Ministry of Trade and Industry maintains a cautious outlook, highlighting significant uncertainties and downside risks from global trade tensions, particularly U.S. tariff policies. The country's central bank has also adopted a looser monetary policy in response to these external economic pressures. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>Australia is enhancing its strategic partnership with the Philippines through expanded maritime cooperation, reflecting a diplomatic effort to balance regional security interests with its significant trade relationship with China. As part of a civil maritime program, Australia is set to double its investment to A$11.5 million, funding initiatives like vessel support, training, and marine protection seminars. Analysts note that these moves are motivated by a desire to strengthen the 80-year diplomatic relationship between Australia and the Philippines, particularly in the context of regional geopolitical dynamics.</p>

          <p>A significant trend is emerging in Chinese higher education, with students increasingly choosing to major in technology and engineering fields. Disciplines such as information and communications technology and vehicle engineering have become top choices, supplanting formerly popular subjects like international trade. This shift is heavily influenced by China's state-driven focus on achieving technological advancement and self-sufficiency, especially amid intensified tech competition with the United States. The new academic priorities reflect a strategic funneling of talent into fields deemed critical for the nation's future industrial development.</p>

          <p>Banyan Group founder Kwon Ping Ho, a 30-year veteran of the hospitality industry, observes that modern tourists have vastly different expectations than previous generations. He notes that younger travelers, already well-traveled with their parents, are now seeking deeper, more authentic experiences that involve interaction with local communities rather than simple sightseeing. Ho also describes the rise of "rainbow tourism," a shift from predominantly Western tourists to a diverse, global mix of travelers from developing nations. This change demands that the industry move beyond one-size-fits-all offerings to provide more tailored and creative experiences.</p>

          <p>The Armagh Observatory in Northern Ireland is marking a major meteorological milestone: 230 years of continuous, daily, handwritten weather observations. This unbroken sequence represents the longest of its kind in the UK and Ireland, providing an invaluable dataset for climate science. The tradition, which began on July 14, 1795, continues today with a human observer manually recording data, a rarity in an age of automation. The records document historic weather events and scientific developments, and were notably maintained through a critical period by an unsung hero, Theresa Hardcastle, in 1917.</p>

          <p>President Trump is scheduled to meet with NATO Secretary General Mark Rutte, a meeting that follows the president's announcement of a plan to sell weapons to NATO allies, which can then be transferred to Ukraine. This strategy aims to expedite military aid by moving equipment from European allies to Ukraine more quickly than from U.S. factories. The discussions also involve a potential bipartisan legislative package that would impose heavy sanctions on Russia and any countries that support its war effort. The plan would grant the president flexibility to impose tariffs up to 500% on nations propping up the Russian economy.</p>
