          <p>Reform UK candidate Sarah Pochin secured a narrow victory in the Runcorn and Helsby by-election, defeating Labour by just six votes after a recount. This marks Reform's first parliamentary by-election win, overturning a significant Labour majority. The by-election was triggered by the resignation of the former Labour MP, Mike Amesbury, following his conviction for assaulting a constituent. Nigel Farage hailed the result as proof that Reform is now the opposition party to the Labour government, while Labour acknowledged the difficulty of by-elections for governing parties. The Conservatives experienced a collapse in their vote share during the election.</p>

          <p>Reform UK achieved its first parliamentary by-election victory in Runcorn and Helsby, while also securing its first mayoral position in Greater Lincolnshire with Andrea Jenkyns. Labour managed to retain mayoralties in North Tyneside, Doncaster, and the West of England, although their vote share decreased as Reform UK emerged as a strong contender in these races. The Conservative party faced significant losses in council seats, with Reform UK making notable gains, particularly in Lincolnshire. Results from other mayoral contests and council elections are expected to continue coming in, with the Conservatives bracing for further losses and the Liberal Democrats targeting councils in the south.</p>

          <p>A Pasadena resident contracted whooping cough after visiting Kidspace Children‚Äôs Museum, prompting a public health warning due to rising cases across the United States. Health officials urge visitors from April 25 to monitor for symptoms and seek medical attention, particularly for infants and pregnant women. Whooping cough cases have doubled nationally and more than quadrupled in California last year, attributed to decreasing vaccination rates. The disease, caused by Bordetella pertussis, can be severe, especially in infants, with symptoms including a runny nose, low-grade fever, and severe coughing fits.</p>

          <p>Roche has entered into a $5.3 billion agreement with Zealand Pharma to co-develop and co-commercialize petrelintide, a novel amylin analog for weight loss, marking Roche's strategic move to compete in the expanding obesity drug market. Petrelintide mimics a hormone that increases satiety, differentiating it from prevalent GLP-1 drugs, with early clinical data suggesting comparable weight reduction and potentially superior tolerability. The deal involves upfront payments to Zealand and milestone-based payments, with both companies emphasizing a collaborative partnership.

          <p>Marco Rubio now simultaneously holds four high-ranking positions within the Trump administration, including Secretary of State, Acting Administrator of U.S. Agency for International Development, Acting Archivist for the National Archives and Records Administration, and Interim National Security Adviser. This unprecedented accumulation of titles raises questions about his capacity to effectively manage such diverse responsibilities, particularly given Trump's unconventional approach to governance. The appointment to these multiple roles reflects Trump's trust in Rubio and his close relationship with Chief of Staff Susie Wiles. The situation draws comparisons to historical precedents, such as Henry Kissinger's dual role, and raises practical concerns about Rubio's ability to balance his duties and potential conflicts of interest.</p>

The decision demonstrates New Delhi's commitment to the values and interests of the society and country.
