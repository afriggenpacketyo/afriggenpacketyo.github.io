          <p>Google co-founder Sergey Brin addressed the shortcomings of the original Google Glass and expressed optimism about the company's new smart glasses initiative. Speaking at the Google I/O developer conference, Brin admitted to making mistakes with Google Glass, which launched in 2013. Google is partnering with Warby Parker to develop new smart glasses based on Android XR, an operating system for headset computers. These glasses will incorporate Google's Gemini AI assistant, allowing users to control the devices with voice commands, and are designed to look like normal glasses without a visible camera.</p>

          <p>This article reports that current certificate of deposit (CD) interest rates are providing opportunities for savers to earn returns that outpace inflation. Online banks often offer the most competitive rates due to lower overhead costs. The inverted yield curve has made short-term CDs (six months to one year) more attractive than longer-term options. Strategies such as CD laddering can help savers take advantage of high rates while planning for long-term financial goals. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>A new WalletHub study has identified the most and least affordable cities in the U.S. for buying a home, considering factors like home prices, maintenance costs, and tax rates.

The study highlights the challenges of homeownership amid rising interest rates and limited inventory, but also points to metro areas where it remains attainable. (not investment advice)</p>
