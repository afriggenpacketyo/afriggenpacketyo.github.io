          <p>Three massive wildfires in northeastern Minnesota are nearly contained after burning for weeks. Firefighters have made significant progress, and all evacuations were lifted on Memorial Day. The fires have covered about 30,000 acres, with the U.S. Forest Service believing the Jenkins Creek Fire was "human caused."
