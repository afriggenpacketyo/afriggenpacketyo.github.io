          <p>A Los Angeles museum is transforming decommissioned Confederate monuments, including a melted Robert E. Lee statue and a graffitied equestrian sculpture, into a provocative art exhibit titled "Monuments." Curator Hamza Walker argues the exhibit challenges the "Lost Cause" ideology, which he states perpetuates white supremacy by lionizing figures who fought for slavery. This article highlights the exhibit's timing amidst President Trump's call for reinstallation of such monuments, offering a powerful counter-narrative to America's divisive historical symbols. Artist Kara Walker's "Unmanned Drone" further reimagines Stonewall Jackson as a ghostly figure.</p>
