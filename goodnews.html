          <p>Following Karen Read's acquittal on murder and manslaughter charges in the death of her boyfriend, John O'Keefe, her parents shared their relief and focus on returning to normalcy. They praised Karen's strength and determination throughout the two-year ordeal, calling her the "fifth lawyer" due to her active involvement in the case. Read's parents acknowledged that her life would never be the same, expressing sorrow for the O'Keefe family while hoping the truth about John's death will eventually be uncovered. The case garnered significant attention and hurtful commentary, prompting them to advocate for others in need and speak out against misogyny. The juror cited inconsistencies and lack of evidence as reasons for the acquittal, and Read still faces a civil wrongful death suit filed by the O'Keefe family. </p>

          <p>A federal judge blocked the Trump administration from revoking Harvard University's ability to enroll international students, preventing the government from cutting off the school's access to a federal database tracking student visa applications. President Trump hinted at a potential "deal" with Harvard, suggesting the school has acted appropriately during negotiations. The Department of Homeland Security had previously told Harvard it was revoking its student visa system certification, citing alleged failures to address campus antisemitism. Harvard sued, arguing it was being punished for defying the administration's political agenda. The ruling allows Harvard to continue enrolling international students while the case moves forward, though tensions remain between the university and the administration.</p>

          <p>A study indicates that visits to locations related to anime and manga in Japan have significantly boosted local economies. In 2024, around 3 million foreign tourists, 8.1 percent of inbound visitors, visited these sites, up from 4.8 percent in 2016. Purchases of anime and manga-related goods totaled 54.3 billion yen last year, a 53 percent increase from 2016. The trend, known as "seichi junrei," involves fans visiting real-life settings that inspired popular works. The growing popularity of Japanese content could offset the country's digital trade deficit, though local governments need to address overtourism issues and provide multilingual support.</p>

          <p>Due to surging rice prices, Japanese restaurants and food companies are increasingly turning to noodles as a cost-effective alternative. Antworks Co., which operates pork rice bowl eateries, opened its first ramen noodle restaurant in Tokyo and plans to open more to diversify its operations. Yoshinoya Holdings is also strengthening its ramen noodle business, viewing the beef bowl market as saturated. Consumers are seeking alternatives to rice at supermarkets, with sales of frozen udon noodles and packaged udon noodle soup rising.

          <p>A mysterious human skull found in the 1930s, known as "dragon man," has been identified as a Denisovan, an extinct group of humans closely related to Neanderthals. Researchers used calcified dental plaque to extract DNA after previous attempts failed. The "dragon man" skull is the first intact Denisovan specimen to date. The skull was discovered in mysterious circumstances by a Chinese laborer who hid it from the Japanese army and was donated shortly before his death in 2018.</p>

          <p>A recent border skirmish between Thailand and Cambodia has tested China's regional diplomacy as Beijing seeks to maintain stability in a crucial strategic area. Analysts suggest China will closely monitor the situation while avoiding direct mediation, potentially working with ASEAN to prevent future confrontations. The clash, resulting in one Cambodian soldier's death, highlights deep-rooted border disputes in the Indochina peninsula, a key trade gateway for China. The incident underscores the challenges in China's neighborhood diplomacy as it aims to foster closer regional ties amid competition with the United States. Both Cambodia and Thailand are friendly to China, and regional stability is important for Beijing's foreign policy.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Dietitians recommend chia seed pudding as a late-night snack to help lower cholesterol due to its high fiber content and low saturated fat. The soluble fiber in chia seeds can absorb cholesterol in the gut, removing it from the body. The snack is made with almond milk, which is low in saturated fat, and contains plant protein, which is linked to better heart health. Dietitians suggest that a heart-healthy bedtime snack should combine fiber and protein, be easy to digest, and be simple to assemble.</p>

          <p>Scientists are trying to determine the source of strange radio waves detected from below the ice in Antarctica, which appear to defy the laws of physics. The signals were discovered during a search for high-energy cosmic particles called neutrinos. The radio waves, picked up by NASA's ANITA experiment, seemed to have passed through thousands of miles of rock, which should have absorbed them. Follow-up observations have not been able to find the same signals, leaving the origin of the anomalous signals unclear. Researchers are exploring larger, more sensitive detectors to solve the mystery and continue the search for neutrinos.</p>

          <p>Gardening games have experienced a surge in popularity, with "Grow a Garden" on Roblox attracting over 16 million players on a single weekend. This surpassed the concurrent player record of Fortnite, a more action-oriented game. The game involves players developing a virtual patch of land, buying seeds, and selling their harvest. The slow-paced nature of the game and the competitive element of competing with friends are appealing to many players. While some find the premise uninteresting, the game's popularity suggests a growing interest in more sedate and patient gaming experiences.</p>

          <p>Many companies are relaxing dress codes, but wearing shorts to the office remains a contentious issue. While some companies, particularly in creative industries, embrace casual attire, including shorts, most stylists advise caution, especially in client-facing roles. The appropriateness of shorts often depends on the context and company culture, with tailored shorts being more acceptable than beach or sports shorts. The pandemic has led to more casual office attire, but it is important to consider what colleagues are wearing to determine if shorts are appropriate. Style experts suggest that women are more likely to feel comfortable wearing shorts for everyday life.</p>
