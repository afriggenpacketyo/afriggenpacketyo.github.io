          <p>England's women's rugby team delivered a dominant performance, defeating Samoa 92-3 to secure a place in the World Cup knockout stages. Despite making 13 changes to the starting lineup, the world's top-ranked professional team showcased its depth against the amateur Samoan side, which had to crowdfund its tournament participation. Winger Jess Breach scored a hat-trick, while fly-half Helena Rowland set a new individual record with 27 points in a single Women's World Cup game. The comprehensive victory extends England's winning streak and solidifies their status as tournament favorites.</p>

          <p>In a highly anticipated rematch, the No. 3 Ohio State Buckeyes defeated the No. 1 Texas Longhorns 14-7, largely thanks to a dominant defensive performance. Texas quarterback Arch Manning struggled in his first career road start, being held to just 170 passing yards, with most of those gained late in the game. The Buckeyes' defense consistently thwarted Texas on crucial fourth-down attempts, including a goal-line stand. This victory marks a significant early-season statement for Ohio State, while Texas will look to rebound after its offense failed to find a rhythm against elite competition.</p>

          <p>Manchester United clinched a dramatic 3-2 victory over Burnley with a stoppage-time penalty from Bruno Fernandes, providing a moment of relief for manager Ruben Amorim. However, the narrow win highlighted the team's ongoing defensive vulnerabilities, particularly with goalkeeping errors that have plagued their early season. Goalkeeper Altay Bayindir made a critical mistake leading to Burnley's second goal, continuing a pattern of errors from United's keepers. The victory was also marred by injuries to key players Matheus Cunha and Mason Mount, adding to the challenges facing the club as they prepare for a difficult stretch of upcoming matches.</p>

Perrin, a graduate of the ACE programme aimed at increasing Black representation in cricket, has become the first Black British woman to score a professional T20 century.

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>While no universal rules exist for children's screen time, medical and psychological experts generally agree on age-based guidelines to protect developmental health. For children under three, minimal to no screen time is recommended to encourage exploration of the physical world and development of self-controlled attention. As children grow, limited and supervised screen time is advised, focusing on quality content and maintaining a balance with physical play, social interaction, and imagination. Experts stress that excessive screen time can negatively impact language skills, motor development, and social behavior, making parental guidance and open communication crucial.</p>

          <p>Jack Grealish delivered another man-of-the-match performance for Everton, providing two assists in a 3-2 victory over Wolverhampton Wanderers. Since joining the club on loan from Manchester City, Grealish has been instrumental, registering four assists in two games and revitalizing his career after a season with limited playing time. His exceptional form has led to praise from Everton manager David Moyes and reignited discussions about his potential return to the England national team ahead of the World Cup. Despite his recent success, Grealish was notably left out of the latest England squad.</p>

She demonstrated improved serving, hitting only four double faults, and effectively managed the match to avoid the emotional struggles of her previous rounds. Gauff now prepares for a highly anticipated fourth-round clash against two-time US Open champion Naomi Osaka, setting the stage for a compelling rematch of their 2019 encounter.</p>

          <p>A federal judge has blocked the Trump administration's policy of expanding expedited removal to detain and deport immigrants from the interior of the U.S. with limited due process. U.S. District Judge Jia Cobb ruled that the practice of applying this streamlined process to migrants who cannot prove they have been in the country for over two years is unlawful. The decision curtails the administration's ability to quickly remove noncitizens without a full hearing before a judge. In her opinion, the judge emphasized that the government cannot deprive individuals of a meaningful opportunity to challenge its allegations.</p>

          <p>New York City health officials have declared that the legionnaires' disease outbreak in central Harlem is over, as no new cases have been identified in three weeks. The outbreak resulted in 114 cases, 90 hospitalizations, and seven deaths. Investigators traced the legionella bacteria to cooling towers at Harlem Hospital and a nearby construction site, both of which have since been disinfected. In response, Mayor Eric Adams announced new proposals to enhance the city's detection and prevention measures, including more frequent testing of cooling towers to better protect public health in the future.</p>

          <p>A new stethoscope equipped with artificial intelligence could significantly speed up the diagnosis of major heart conditions, according to a British study. Researchers found the device can detect heart failure, valve disease, and abnormal rhythms almost instantly by analyzing subtle sounds the human ear cannot perceive. The tool records an ECG and sends the data to an AI system trained on thousands of patient records for analysis. The study, involving over 200 GP surgeries, showed a marked increase in detection rates, suggesting the technology could be a "game-changer" for early diagnosis and treatment.</p>

          <p>The new remake of the 1984 cult classic "The Toxic Avenger" offers a polished and well-made update to the Troma schlock-fest, starring Peter Dinklage as the mutant hero. Directed by Macon Blair, this version anchors its goofy, gory story in a more sincere emotional context, with Dinklage playing a janitor and struggling stepfather who is transformed by toxic waste. While the film pays homage to the original's anti-corporate and environmental themes, its higher production values and appealing cast, including Kevin Bacon and Elijah Wood, create a more mainstream experience. This article suggests the remake lacks the raw, offensive charm that made the original a cult favorite.</p>
