          <p>Paraguayan officials have proposed a new law to encourage the local assembly of electronic and digital goods using imported components, primarily from China. The plan aims to create jobs, diversify the economy, and leverage global trade disputes, such as U.S. tariffs on Chinese and Brazilian goods, to position Paraguay as an attractive manufacturing hub. This initiative would allow businesses to import parts and brand the finished products as “Made in Paraguay,” potentially reducing costs and boosting the national industry.</p>

        </div>
        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Reverse mortgages offer a way for seniors aged 62 and older to convert home equity into cash without monthly payments, which can help supplement retirement income. While most of these loans are federally insured, providing protections like ensuring the debt never exceeds the home's value, they are not without risks. Homeowners must still pay for property taxes, insurance, and maintenance, and failing to do so can lead to default and foreclosure, making it a complex financial decision. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>A federal appeals court has lifted a preliminary injunction, granting the Department of Government Efficiency (DOGE) access to potentially sensitive data from several federal agencies. The ruling is a significant legal victory for the Trump administration, as the new agency seeks to review data that could include Social Security numbers and immigration status.
