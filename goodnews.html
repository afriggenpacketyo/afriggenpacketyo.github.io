          <p>A JetBlue flight arriving from Chicago O'Hare International Airport went off the runway and into the grass after landing at Boston Logan International Airport. No injuries were reported among the passengers or crew, according to the Massachusetts Port Authority.

          <p>Debt collectors may illegally "re-age" old debts, resetting the clock to make them appear newer and pursue collection more aggressively. This tactic violates the Fair Credit Reporting Act and can negatively impact credit scores. Consumers can spot re-aging by checking credit reports for debts that reappear after seven years or have manipulated delinquency dates. To combat this, individuals should dispute inaccuracies with credit bureaus and report violations to the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>The Pentagon is reportedly reviewing the AUKUS agreement, a deal initiated by the Biden administration to assist Australia in acquiring nuclear-powered submarines, due to shipbuilding challenges in the U.S. The review aims to ensure the initiative aligns with President Trump‚Äôs "America First" agenda, focusing on military readiness, allied contributions to collective defense, and the capacity of the defense industrial base. Concerns have been raised about the U.S.'s ability to produce enough submarines for its own needs while also supplying Australia. Australia plans to increase its defense spending, but the U.S. is pushing for a faster increase to 3.5%.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Despite concerns that President Donald Trump's tariffs would drive inflation higher, traditional data points measuring inflation have not shown significant increases. Recent reports on consumer and producer prices have been benign, with indexes from the Bureau of Labor Statistics reporting modest price increases in May. Several factors have contributed to keeping inflation in check, including companies stockpiling imported goods ahead of tariff announcements, the time it takes for tariffs to impact the real economy, and a lack of pricing power among companies due to consumer belt-tightening.
