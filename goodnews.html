          <p>An alumnus of Pomona College reflects on the growing movement among students and professors to limit technology's impact on campus life. Concerns are rising about the pervasiveness of screens and the potential for technology to detract from the close-knit community and learning environment that small liberal arts colleges strive to create. The author suggests that Pomona could differentiate itself by formalizing experiments in tech-free spaces, such as dorms and dining halls. While acknowledging the importance of technological literacy, the author argues for a more balanced approach to technology on campus. The movement is growing.</p>
