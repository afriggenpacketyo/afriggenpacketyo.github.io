          <p>A U.S. Marine veteran, Scott Harrison, found solace during the Vietnam War by imagining a carousel in a peaceful mountain meadow, an image inspired by a music box from his sister. After struggling with PTSD upon returning home, he decided to make his vision a reality to find personal healing. Over 26 years, he restored a broken-down carousel and hand-carved new animals for it, opening the "Carousel of Happiness" in Nederland, Colorado, in 2010. The nonprofit has since brought joy to over a million visitors and provided its creator with profound purpose.</p>

          <p>President Trump has signed the GENIUS Act into law, establishing the first major federal regulatory framework for stablecoins in the United States. The bipartisan legislation sets consumer protection guardrails and allows banks and other financial institutions to issue their own stablecoins pegged to assets like the U.S. dollar. Proponents, including the president, hailed the act as a revolutionary step for financial technology that strengthens the dollar and provides clarity for the crypto industry. The signing follows a week of legislative activity in Congress dubbed "Crypto Week" by Republicans. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>Shares of the fintech company Block, formerly known as Square, surged more than 10% in extended trading following the announcement that it will join the S&P 500 index. Block is set to replace oil producer Hess, which was recently acquired by Chevron. This inclusion is significant as it often leads to a stock rally because index funds must purchase the shares to rebalance their portfolios. Despite being down 14% for the year, Block's addition reflects the growing influence of technology companies within the benchmark index. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>A U.S. envoy has announced that the leaders of Israel and Syria have agreed to a ceasefire, which is also supported by neighboring Turkey and Jordan. The agreement follows recent Israeli airstrikes on Damascus, which Israel stated were to defend the Druze minority community after clashes in southern Syria. The announcement was made by Tom Barrack, the U.S. ambassador to Turkey, who is serving as a point person on the Syrian conflict. He called on all factions in the war-torn country to lay down their arms and work towards building a new, united Syrian identity.</p>

          <h2>Medical Experts Explain President Trump's Diagnosis of Chronic Venous Insufficiency</h2>
          <div class="timestamp">2025-07-18 20:08:30 EDT</div>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Following a diagnosis of chronic venous insufficiency (CVI) after noting mild leg swelling, the White House physician has described President Trump's condition as "benign and common." CVI occurs when veins, particularly in the legs, struggle to return blood to the heart, causing it to pool. The condition affects about one in three U.S. adults and is often caused by weakened vein valves, with risk factors including age and prolonged sitting or standing. For mild cases like the president's, treatment typically involves lifestyle changes such as compression, elevation, and exercise to manage symptoms like swelling and aching.</p>

          <p>The "California Forever" project, a controversial plan by Silicon Valley billionaires to build a new city in Solano County, has unveiled its latest proposal: a 2,100-acre manufacturing site called the "Solano Foundry." The hub aims to attract companies in defense, aerospace, robotics, and other high-tech industries, with the goal of bringing manufacturing jobs back to the state. The project's CEO, Jan Sramek, framed the plan as restoring the "designed in California, made in California" model. However, local community groups remain skeptical, viewing it as hype to generate support for the larger, contested development project on farmland.</p>

          <p>Microsoft has changed its support protocols to ensure that its engineers based in China will no longer provide technical assistance for the company's U.S. defense clients. The move comes in response to a ProPublica report that raised national security and cybersecurity concerns about the arrangement. Previously, the work of Chinese engineers on Microsoft's Azure cloud services was overseen by U.S.-based "digital escorts." Defense Secretary Pete Hegseth called the old system "unacceptable" and announced a review of similar vulnerabilities, while Microsoft stated its commitment to providing the most secure services possible to the government.</p>

          <p>A new comedic stage play, "The Legend of Rooney's Ring," has opened in Liverpool, reimagining the lives of football star Wayne Rooney and his wife Coleen as a fantasy saga inspired by "The Lord of the Rings." The show, written by "Motherland" co-creator Helen Serafinowicz, is a humorous homage to the couple, loosely based on a tabloid myth about Coleen throwing away her engagement ring. The play portrays the Rooneys as a heroic warrior and princess on a quest, with the creators insisting it is an affectionate and silly tribute rather than a targeted satire.</p>

This new initiative covers infants born too early to benefit from the maternal RSV vaccine, which has been offered to pregnant women since last September. Health officials stated the new vaccine, which offers 80% protection, will help reduce pressure on the health service during the winter months.</p>

          <p>This article revisits a remarkable story from 2005, when a 12-year-old girl in Ethiopia was reportedly rescued by a pride of lions after being kidnapped. The girl had been abducted by men attempting to force her into marriage and was missing for a week. According to reports at the time, three lions chased the captors away and then "stood guard" over the girl until she was found by police. A wildlife expert speculated that the girl's whimpering may have been mistaken for the sound of a lion cub, preventing the animals from attacking her in what many considered a miracle.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>A new study has identified a potential trigger for ulcerative colitis, finding that an interaction between a specific gut bacteria molecule and a common gene variant can cause an overactive immune response. Researchers found that in people with a faulty version of the OTUD3 gene, a molecule produced by gut bacteria over-activates an inflammatory protein called STING. This leads to the chronic inflammation characteristic of the disease. The discovery helps explain the unpredictable nature of colitis and opens the door for more precise, personalized therapies that target this specific pathway rather than suppressing the entire immune system.</p>

A senior U.S. official confirmed the exchange and stated that there are no longer any U.S. nationals being held by the Maduro regime.
