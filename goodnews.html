High-net-worth individuals are concerned about tariffs and potential geopolitical instability, leading them to seek secure storage for their precious metals.

The total amount applied for is over 30% of the 300,000 tons planned for release through direct sales contracts with major retailers. The average price of rice at supermarkets has doubled from a year earlier, prompting the government to bypass auctions and directly intervene in price control.

          <p>A Chinese study published in Cell challenges Darwinian evolution by demonstrating that acquired traits can be inherited without DNA changes. Rice plants exposed to cold stress passed on cold tolerance across generations through DNA methylation changes, supporting Lamarck's theory that organisms can pass on learned survival traits. This research revives the debate between Lamarckism and Darwinism, suggesting epigenetics may play a more significant role in evolution than previously thought. The findings indicate that environmental factors can induce heritable adaptations in crops, highlighting the potential for Lamarckism in evolutionary processes.</p>
