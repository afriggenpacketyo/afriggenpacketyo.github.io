          <p>A federal judge has ruled that deporting migrants to Libya or Saudi Arabia without allowing them to raise safety concerns violates an existing court order. The ruling came after lawyers for a group of migrants filed an emergency motion, citing reports and accounts alleging they were being prepared for removal to Libya or Saudi Arabia on military aircraft. Judge Murphy clarified that any such removals would defy his preliminary injunction, which bars deporting noncitizens to countries other than their origin without due process. The judge's order emphasized the significant risks faced by those deported to Libya, including imprisonment, torture, and death, referencing the U.S. State Department's travel advisory against travel to Libya due to "crime, terrorism, unexploded landmines, civil unrest, kidnapping, and armed conflict.</p>

          <p>President Trump has announced a forthcoming "major trade deal" with the UK, marking the first such agreement since his administration imposed tariffs on numerous trading partners. The announcement, made via Truth Social, lacked specific details, but reports suggest the deal aims to lower British tariffs on US cars and farm products, as well as reduce taxes on US technology companies. UK officials have prioritized a separate agreement with the EU, which is likely to align British standards with European ones, potentially complicating negotiations with the US. The US had imposed tariffs on several trading partners on April 2, before partially reversing course following market downturns, but the UK was not hit with reciprocal tariffs due to a trade surplus with the US.</p>

          <p>Public transportation providers and police in Japan are implementing AI to enhance lost-and-found services, improving the rate at which lost items are returned to their owners. Find Inc.'s "lost-and-found platform" uses AI to categorize and catalog lost items based on photos taken by staff, enabling owners to inquire through messaging apps by providing information or similar-looking images. Keio Corp., a railway operator, has seen its return rate increase from less than 10% to 30% after adopting the system, which has also reduced inquiry times for staff. The platform, launched in June 2023, has handled approximately 1.5 million lost items, returning around 480,000 to their owners.</p>

          <p>Apple is requesting a court to pause a recent decision in its case against Epic Games, seeking to continue charging commissions on in-app transactions that link out for payment. Last month, a judge found Apple in contempt of court for violating a previous order regarding its linking out policy, ordering Apple to stop imposing commissions on purchases made through web links inside iPhone apps. Apple argues that the required changes will cost the company "substantial sums" and claims the ruling is punitive. The company is appealing the contempt ruling, with CEO Tim Cook stating that Apple has complied with the court's order.</p>
