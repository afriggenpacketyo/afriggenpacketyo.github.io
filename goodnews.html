          <p>England's women's cricket team has kept its T20 series against India alive with a thrilling five-run victory at The Oval. Chasing 172, India needed six runs off the final ball, but captain Harmanpreet Kaur was caught, ending their chase at 166-5. Earlier, England posted a strong total of 171-9, thanks to impressive half-centuries from Sophia Dunkley and Danni Wyatt-Hodge, before suffering a dramatic late-innings collapse. The tense win reduces England's series deficit to 2-1, setting up a crucial fourth match at Old Trafford.</p>

        </div>
        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>In a detailed interview, documentary filmmaker Ken Burns describes the American Revolution as the most important event in world history since the birth of Christ, as it created the novel concept of a "citizen" rather than a subject. He emphasizes that the nation was born from a bloody and divisive civil war, and that understanding the founders' deep flaws is essential to appreciating their achievements. Burns argues that embracing this complex, gritty history, rather than a sanitized version, makes its lessons more powerful and accessible for navigating the divisions of the present day. He views the founding documents as an ongoing inspiration for a more inclusive nation.</p>

          <p>In a dramatic turn, a federal judge has temporarily blocked the Trump administration from deporting eight immigrants to war-torn South Sudan, just one day after the Supreme Court cleared the way for their removal. The men, only one of whom is from South Sudan, were flown to a U.S. base in Djibouti while their case was litigated. In an emergency Fourth of July hearing, Judge Randolph Moss issued a brief stay and transferred the case back to a Boston judge who had originally halted the deportations, stating that new claims from the immigrants' lawyers deserved a hearing.</p>

          <p>The technology IPO market is showing signs of life after a nearly three-year drought, largely sparked by the successful public debut of crypto company Circle, whose stock has surged sixfold. This has provided much-needed returns for venture capital firms, which have been waiting for an exit environment to improve since rising interest rates stalled the market in 2022. While financiers are encouraged and more companies are preparing to go public, some remain cautious, noting that a sustained trend of successful IPOs has not yet been firmly established.

          <p>A board-certified cardiologist with over 20 years of experience has outlined five "toxic" foods he avoids feeding his own children to promote long-term heart health. The list includes microwave popcorn due to chemical-lined bags, flavored yogurts for their high sugar content, and processed meats like hot dogs and deli meats because of sodium and nitrates. He also advises against sugary cereals and deep-fried foods, which can fuel inflammation and establish unhealthy cravings. Instead, he recommends alternatives like air-popped popcorn, plain yogurt with fruit, lean proteins, and air-fried foods.</p>

          <p>Competitive eating legend Joey Chestnut made a triumphant return to win the 2025 Nathan's Famous Hot Dog Eating Contest, reclaiming his title after being banned from last year's event. Chestnut consumed 70.5 hot dogs and buns in 10 minutes, easily beating defending champion Patrick Bertoletti. He was banned in 2024 due to a partnership with a rival plant-based hot dog brand. On the women's side, Miki Sudo continued her reign, securing her 11th victory by eating 33 hot dogs and buns, though this was well short of her world record.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>A provision in the newly passed federal budget package creates a new tax deduction for workers who earn tips, a policy President Trump has championed as "no tax on tips." The measure allows workers like waiters and bartenders to deduct their tip income from their federal income tax liability. However, the tax break is temporary and scheduled to expire at the end of 2028. Critics and policy experts argue that the deduction is a poor way to help low-wage workers, as many earn too little to have a federal tax liability to begin with. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>The U.S. Air Force has suspended a proposed project with SpaceX to test hypersonic rocket cargo deliveries from Johnston Atoll, a remote Pacific wildlife refuge. The decision follows a Reuters report highlighting concerns from biologists that the project would severely harm the 14 species of tropical seabirds that nest on the island. The program aimed to test the delivery of up to 100 tons of cargo anywhere on Earth in about 90 minutes. The Air Force is now reportedly exploring alternative locations for the breakthrough military logistics program due to the environmental opposition.</p>

However, India's bowlers, led by Mohammed Siraj's six wickets, roared back with the second new ball, causing England's last five wickets to fall for just 20 runs. India secured a 180-run first-innings lead and extended their overall advantage to 244 by the close of day three, remaining in a dominant position.</p>

This rapid growth, driven by brands like BYD and MG, marks a significant increase from previous years and contrasts with other G7 nations that have recently imposed steep tariffs on Chinese electric vehicle imports. The trend has been fueled by the popularity of electric cars and the competitive pricing and innovation of Chinese models, sparking a debate about the future competitiveness of the UK's domestic auto industry.</p>
