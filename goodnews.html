          <p>Oracle's shares experienced an 8% increase in extended trading following the release of a report indicating earnings and revenue surpassing Wall Street's projections. Cloud infrastructure revenue is anticipated to rise by over 70% in fiscal year 2026, which is a significant increase from the 52% growth observed in the reported quarter. CEO Safra Catz forecasts over $67 billion in fiscal 2026 revenue, exceeding consensus estimates, and the company projects adjusted earnings per share of $1.46 to $1.50 for the fiscal first quarter. Recent partnerships with Cleveland Clinic, G42, and IBM, along with Temu's infrastructure migration to Oracle's cloud, contribute to this positive outlook (not investment advice).</p>

          <p>As the conflict in Ukraine continues, an opinion piece suggests that China holds the best chance for facilitating peace negotiations. With recent peace talks stalled and neither side able to achieve a decisive victory, the article argues that direct negotiations between Ukrainian and Russian leaders are necessary. While the U.S. and NATO have not been successful in brokering a ceasefire, China's potential involvement could provide a path forward. The establishment of the International Organisation for Mediation in Hong Kong further underscores the need for effective conflict resolution mechanisms.</p>

          <p>The UK and the European Union have reached an agreement regarding Gibraltar's status following Brexit, aiming to avoid border checks between Spain and the British Overseas Territory. Passport checks for travelers arriving at Gibraltar airport will be conducted by both Gibraltar and Spanish officials, similar to the Eurostar system in London. UK Foreign Secretary David Lammy asserts the deal protects British sovereignty and supports Gibraltar's economy. The agreement seeks to address concerns about potential border delays and ensures the UK's military facilities in Gibraltar maintain full operational autonomy.</p>

          <p>The Department of Government Efficiency (DOGE) has announced a 22.4% reduction in annual non-defense federal obligations, amounting to approximately $25 billion compared to 2024. This announcement coincides with the Department of Health and Human Services (HHS) rehiring over 450 employees previously let go during DOGE cuts. HHS Secretary Robert F. Kennedy Jr. stated that some personnel cuts were mistakes and are being rectified, while other agencies like the IRS and FDA are also rehiring employees. A recent court ruling restricting DOGE's access to federal databases presents a potential obstacle to the agency's operations.</p>

          <p>President Trump stated that Chinese students are welcome at U.S. colleges and universities, potentially reversing a previous policy to revoke visas for Chinese students in critical fields. The announcement was made as part of a trade deal with China, pending approval from both sides. This decision contrasts with earlier statements from Secretary of State Marco Rubio, who suggested the U.S. would target students with ties to the Chinese Communist Party. Universities rely on tuition fees from international students and consider them integral to campus diversity, leading to uncertainty surrounding the administration's stance.</p>

This collaboration highlights the interconnectedness of labor and immigration issues in the region and their shared opposition to certain government actions.

          <p>A coalition of states has filed a lawsuit against the bankrupt DNA-testing company 23andMe to prevent the sale of customers' genetic data without explicit consent. The lawsuit argues that customers have a right to their genetic information, which is uniquely sensitive. 23andMe is undergoing a court-supervised sale process, with potential buyers including Regeneron Pharmaceuticals and TTAM Research Institute. Concerns have been raised about the privacy of genetic data, with 1.9 million customers requesting their data be deleted since the company's bankruptcy filing.</p>

          <p>A former Florida Department of Environmental Protection worker, James Gaddis, filed a whistleblower lawsuit alleging retaliation for leaking plans to build golf courses and hotels in state parks. Gaddis claims he was directed to create "secret maps" for development in nine parks and was fired after sharing the information, which sparked bipartisan outrage. The lawsuit seeks damages of at least $100,000. The Republican-dominated state Legislature has since passed a bill banning development in state parks, which DeSantis signed into law.</p>
