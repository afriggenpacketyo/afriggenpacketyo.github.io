        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Taiwan has blacklisted China's Huawei and SMIC, adding them to its "Strategic High-Tech Commodities Entity List," a move that aligns with U.S. trade policy amid tensions with Beijing. This action requires Taiwanese firms to obtain licenses before shipping products to these companies, reinforcing existing U.S. export restrictions. The decision aims to tighten loopholes and increase penalties for potential breaches, as TSMC has previously faced scrutiny for supplying chips to Huawei. This development occurs against the backdrop of ongoing geopolitical tensions between Taiwan and Mainland China, with China reiterating its stance on reunification. The stability in trade relations, even with restrictions, provides a certain level of predictability.</p>

Ohtani has been progressing well in practice and expressed eagerness to pitch in games again, leading the team to utilize his "bullets" in a real game. The Dodgers' manager also mentioned that there is no timeline for the return of rookie right-hander Roki Sasaki, who is currently on the injured list with a shoulder issue.</p>

          <p>The CEOs of Baker Hughes and Woodside Energy are closely monitoring the escalating conflict between Iran and Israel but are hesitant to make firm predictions about oil prices. Both CEOs acknowledged the fluidity of the situation and the potential for significant market impacts, especially concerning supplies through the Strait of Hormuz. While historical geopolitical events have influenced oil prices, forecasting future prices remains uncertain. The CEOs stated that their companies will adopt a wait-and-see approach to project developments, focusing on monitoring and adapting to the evolving situation.

          <p>Shares of Santos, an Australian oil and gas producer, experienced a significant surge following a non-binding takeover offer from a consortium led by Abu Dhabi's National Oil Company (ADNOC).

Santos' board intends to recommend shareholders vote in favor of the transaction, provided no superior proposal emerges. The acquisition would grant the consortium control over key Australian liquefied natural gas operations and stakes in other significant projects, marking a strategic move in the energy sector.

          <p>Japan is shifting from a reactive to a preemptive cyber defense strategy, enacting legislation to protect critical infrastructure and sensitive data. The government is urging private firms, which manage most of Japan's infrastructure, to take proactive measures against growing cyber threats. The new legislation allows the government to track online communications and take early action against harmful servers, while obliging companies to report cyberattacks. The goal is to establish a full-fledged preemptive defense system by 2027, with increased collaboration between the government and private sector to strengthen cybersecurity measures.</p>

          <p>China's retail sales grew at the fastest pace since December 2023, driven by government subsidies and increased online shopping. Retail sales jumped 6.4% year-on-year in May, exceeding analysts' expectations, as the consumer goods trade-in program and the "618" e-commerce event boosted consumption. However, industrial output slowed, and fixed-asset investment growth remained below forecasts, with property investment continuing to contract. While the rise in retail sales is a positive sign, falling property prices could dampen consumer sentiment, requiring stronger policy support to sustain the economic recovery.
