          <p>The Kooks and Hard-Fi, prominent bands from the 2000s indie rock scene, are experiencing a revival, connecting with new audiences through platforms like TikTok. Both bands, who sold millions of records during their initial run, are back with new music and tour dates. They attribute their resurgence to a cyclical trend where younger listeners rediscover their parents' music and to the anthemic quality of their songs, which had been missing from guitar music for some time. The article also touches on the challenges faced by emerging artists today, including the shrinking live music scene and the impact of streaming on music consumption.</p>

          <p>The UK has received its first samples of Moon rock in nearly 50 years, loaned from China's Chang'e 5 mission, and these samples are considered "more precious than gold dust". Professor Mahesh Anand and his team will analyze the dust to understand the Moon's formation and early Earth history. The research will involve grinding and using lasers on the dust to potentially confirm the theory that the Moon was formed from debris after Earth collided with a Mars-sized planet billions of years ago. The samples are being kept in a high-security facility to prevent contamination, and the team will use specialized equipment to extract valuable data.</p>

          <p>Federal judges ruled that Alabama intentionally diluted the voting strength of Black residents when it drew congressional lines and must continue using a court-ordered map. The panel permanently blocked Alabama from using a state-drawn map that they said flouted their directive to draw a plan that was fair to Black voters. The judges chided what it called Alabama's "deliberate decision to ignore" their order to draw a second district where Black voters had an opportunity to elect a candidate of their choosing, calling the map a violation of the Voting Rights Act of 1965.</p>

          <p>Chris Mason analyzes the recent trade deals secured by the UK, including one with the US, and an expected agreement with the EU. The US deal involves reducing import taxes on British cars and allowing tariff-free entry for some steel and aluminum. While the deal mitigates some of the recent tariff increases, it is not a deep and broad free trade agreement. The analysis suggests that the deal is a limited but positive step for the UK, providing relief for key industries and potentially improving trading conditions.</p>
