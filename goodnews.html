          <p>Dallas Wings rookie Paige Bueckers revisited her 2021 comments about using her platform to celebrate Black women, stating that while the media is great for the game's attention, it often "tries to isolate" individuals. In a recent podcast interview, she emphasized that success is not achieved alone and spoke of the importance of sharing the spotlight and glorifying her faith. Bueckers reiterated her belief that White privilege exists in sports marketing and that coverage is not equal, stating her desire to counteract this imbalance through her actions. She stressed the need for equal opportunities for all athletes regardless of race.</p>

          <p>A federal judge has once again denied President Donald Trump's attempt to have a defamation lawsuit filed by the exonerated men formerly known as the Central Park Five thrown out of court. The judge ruled that Pennsylvania's Anti-SLAPP law, which protects against lawsuits targeting free speech, does not apply in federal court. The lawsuit accuses Trump of defaming the five men by making false statements about them during a presidential debate, including claims they had killed someone and pled guilty. This ruling marks another significant legal setback for Trump in his efforts to dismiss the case.</p>

          <p>On the tenth anniversary of the nationwide legalization of same-sex marriage, a Maryland couple who were lead plaintiffs in a 2004 lawsuit challenging the state's ban reflected on their journey. Gita Deane and Lisa Polyak, while unsuccessful in the courts at the time, believe their fight helped pave the way for marriage equality in Maryland and beyond. They expressed joy over the progress made but also deep concern over recent efforts by some groups to challenge and overturn these rights. The couple emphasized that the fight for equality is ongoing and that such rollbacks would be both cruel and unsafe for the LGBTQ community.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>A team of mechanical engineering students at Johns Hopkins University has successfully designed and built a custom printer that creates braille labels for a Maryland brewery. The project was initiated after Blind Industries & Services of Maryland (BISM), a nonprofit, requested a machine capable of embossing braille onto plastic beer labels, which commercial printers cannot handle. The student-designed device is user-friendly for employees with low or no vision and has already produced 400 labels for a special beer benefiting individuals with vision loss. This invention will save BISM employees from the laborious process of manually punching thousands of labels.</p>

          <p>The S&P 500 and Nasdaq closed at new record highs, demonstrating remarkable resilience despite the recent U.S. military strikes in Iran. The market initially shrugged off fears of a wider conflict, with a key factor being the rapid decline in oil prices after a brief surge, which eased inflation concerns. Investor sentiment was also bolstered by growing expectations for multiple Federal Reserve rate cuts by the end of the year. However, a slightly hotter-than-expected core inflation reading from the PCE price index suggests that the path for future rate decisions remains complex and uncertain. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>A new genetic study of skeletons from √áatalh√∂y√ºk, a 9,000-year-old settlement in Turkey, suggests the ancient city may have been a matriarchal society. Researchers analyzed DNA from over 130 individuals buried under the city's houses and found that genetic connections within households were primarily traced through the female line. This indicates that husbands likely relocated to their wife's household after marriage and that female offspring remained in their birth homes. The findings challenge traditional assumptions about patrilineal social structures in ancient societies and point to the central role of women in this well-preserved Neolithic community.</p>
