        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>The U.S. and its NATO allies are escalating military support for Ukraine by preparing to ship additional Patriot missile systems and other crucial munitions. This policy shift aims to bolster Ukraine's defense against persistent Russian drone and missile attacks. The move follows President Trump's meeting with NATO's Secretary General, where he emphasized that allies would provide their own systems and purchase more from the U.S. This renewed commitment to arming Kyiv signals a tougher stance against Russia, which has continued its bombardment of Ukrainian cities.</p>

          <p>The parliamentary standards commissioner has concluded that UK Chancellor Rachel Reeves inadvertently breached rules by failing to declare gifted theater tickets on the register of MPs' interests within the 28-day deadline. Reeves, who had declared the items on the ministerial register, referred herself for investigation and apologized for the oversight. The commissioner accepted her apology and noted the breach was inadvertent but stated greater attention to the rules was needed. Reeves has since implemented new procedures in her office to prevent future occurrences and said she will not accept similar tickets going forward.</p>

          <p>At an energy and innovation summit at Carnegie Mellon University, former President Trump announced that 20 leading companies will invest over $90 billion in Pennsylvania to develop a new artificial intelligence economy. The investments will focus on building energy-intensive data centers and an innovation hub to train workers for new jobs in the AI and energy sectors. Hosted by Senator Dave McCormick, the event brought together top tech and energy executives, as well as Democratic Governor Josh Shapiro. The visit also drew protests from activists concerned about the focus on fossil fuels and AI for surveillance. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>A federal appeals court has issued a temporary block preventing the Trump administration from terminating Temporary Protected Status (TPS) for thousands of people from Afghanistan. The administration had planned to end the protections, arguing the security situation in Afghanistan has improved, but the court granted a one-week stay to review the case. Advocacy groups praised the decision, stating that TPS has been a vital lifeline for Afghans who fled the Taliban, and that ending it would uproot families. The White House criticized the ruling as judicial overreach, asserting its authority to manage immigration policy.</p>

          <p>UK Chancellor Rachel Reeves has called on the financial industry to adopt a more positive narrative about investing in stocks and shares to encourage economic growth. In a speech, she argued that the focus has been too much on the risks without properly highlighting the potential benefits for savers. The government is working with the Financial Conduct Authority to introduce a new type of targeted support for would-be investors. This push comes as Reeves seeks to shift some of the £300 billion held in cash savings accounts into investments that can help fuel the UK economy. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>Sotheby's is auctioning NWA 16788, the largest known piece of Mars on Earth, with an expected price of $2 million to $4 million. The meteorite, weighing over 54 pounds, represents about 6.5% of all known Martian material on our planet. It is believed to have been ejected from Mars by an asteroid strike before traveling 140 million miles and landing in the Sahara Desert, where it was discovered in 2023. Such finds are exceptionally rare, with only about 0.6% of all meteorites found on Earth originating from the red planet, making this a significant item for collectors and scientists.</p>
