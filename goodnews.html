          <p>Japan, traditionally known for its pacifist constitution, is increasingly focused on global arms exports. This shift is driven by security concerns and a desire to deepen ties with allies. Exporting arms allows Japan to improve interoperability with purchasing parties and develop its defense industrial base. The country aims to achieve economies of scale in domestic production and reduce reliance on U.S. weapons purchases. </p>

          <p>A Japanese design firm has developed a "smart" puffer jacket that uses light and sound to lull users to sleep. The jacket, developed by Konel in collaboration with NTT DX Partners, utilizes biometric data gathered by a wearable ring to customize the sleep experience. The jacket uses red light to induce sleep and blue light to wake the body up, accompanied by "neuromusic" with frequencies that aid sleep. The ZZZN sleep apparel is designed to normalize naptime and promote a culture that values sleep. </p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>The Senate Finance Committee's version of a major bill is setting up a potential clash with the House of Representatives, as some Senate Republicans raise concerns. Key sticking points include the state and local tax (SALT) deduction cap and Medicaid provisions. The Senate legislation would keep the SALT cap at $10,000, while the House bill offers deductions up to $40,000 for those making less than $500,000 annually. The Senate bill also lowers health care provider taxes in states that expanded Medicaid. (not investment advice)</p>
