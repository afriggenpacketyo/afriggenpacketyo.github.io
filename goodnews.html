          <p>Oscar Piastri emerged victorious at the Miami Grand Prix, leading Lando Norris in a McLaren 1-2 finish. The race featured early drama with Verstappen running wide and Norris being forced off track. Piastri overtook Antonelli and then Verstappen to take the lead, while Norris climbed through the field. A virtual safety car period benefited Russell, further hindering Verstappen's race, and Piastri's win extended his championship lead over Norris and Verstappen.</p>

          <p>Elon Musk's SpaceX rocket facility in South Texas is on track to become an official city named Starbase. A vote to formally organize Starbase as a city was approved by a small group of voters, mostly Musk's employees at SpaceX.
