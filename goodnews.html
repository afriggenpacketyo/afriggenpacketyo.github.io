          <p>Shohei Ohtani hit his MLB-leading 20th home run of the season as the Los Angeles Dodgers defeated the Cleveland Guardians 9-5.

          <p>During a decisive Game 5 of the American Hockey League's Calder Cup playoff series, Abbotsford Canucks' announcer Brandon Astle was confronted by a raucous fan and hit with a chair during the live broadcast. Astle revealed that the noise was the result of a fan throwing a chair, which ultimately struck him in the leg. After the game, Astle apologized for his handling of the situation, stating that he could have handled it better, but was in shock and fired up as it had never happened to him before. The Canucks will meet the Texas Stars in the conference finals.</p>

          <p>Chinese scientists claim to have found a solution to a major flaw in hyperloop technology, which could make journeys "extremely unpleasant" due to turbulence and vibrations. The study, published in the Journal of Railway Science and Engineering, found that even minor imperfections in the track could cause violent low-frequency vibrations in maglev cars traveling at 1,000km/h. Researchers working at China's full-scale test line found a way to reduce turbulence intensity by nearly half, making the ride more tolerable. This could potentially salvage vacuum-tube maglev technology and address challenges faced by Elon Musk's Hyperloop concept.</p>

          <p>Onosato has been promoted to sumo's highest rank of yokozuna after competing in just 13 professional tournaments, setting a record pace. The 24-year-old from Ishikawa Prefecture is the 75th yokozuna and the first Japanese-born grand champion since his stablemaster Nishonoseki. Onosato secured his promotion by winning the Summer Grand Sumo Tournament, meeting the benchmark of back-to-back championships as an ozeki. He joins Wajima as the only wrestler to become a grand champion after entering the professional ranks from university, and is set to rival Mongolian yokozuna Hoshoryu.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) will no longer advise routine COVID shots for healthy children or healthy pregnant women, according to Health Secretary Robert F. Kennedy Jr. This decision marks a significant departure from the previous recommendation of annual shots for everyone age 6 months and older. While the original course of vaccination offered significant protection against serious illness in children, the need for annual vaccines is more contentious, with some experts arguing that children's immune systems remember vaccinations for longer. Data shows that two or more doses of COVID vaccines were 40 percent effective at preventing emergency room visits and hospitalizations among children under the age of 5.</p>

          <p>A new bill known as the Fairness, Inclusion, Rehabilitation, and Expungement for Incarcerated Firefighters Act (FIRE Act) aims to provide job training, workplace opportunities, and mentoring for former inmate firefighters. Introduced by California Democratic Reps. Sydney Kamlager-Dove and Judy Chu, the act would also create a pathway for expunging the criminal records of those who have successfully completed probation and reentry. The bill would offer incentives for other states to start their own versions of fire camps, expand occupational safety coverage, recognize incarcerated firefighters as employees entitled to wage protections, and provide $20 million annually for states to adopt safety and wage compliance.</p>

They both emphasized the challenges of living far from family and working together as a couple, but found that it works well for them.</p>
