          <p>Australians are voting in a general election where the high cost of living and housing shortages are major issues. Prime Minister Anthony Albanese's Labor Party seeks a second term, while Peter Dutton's conservative opposition aims to unseat the first-term government, a feat not achieved since 1931. With early voting already high, the election also highlights changing demographics, as Millennials and Gen Z outnumber Baby Boomers for the first time. Both parties have promised policies to help first-home buyers, but they differ on energy policy, with the opposition favoring nuclear power and Labor focusing on renewables.</p>

          <p>Mohsen Mahdawi, a Palestinian human rights advocate and Columbia University student, recounts his detention by the Department of Homeland Security during his citizenship naturalization interview in an op-ed. Mahdawi believes he was targeted for his opposition to Israeli actions in Gaza and asserts that the Trump administration is suppressing free speech. After being unjustly imprisoned, a federal judge ruled in his favor, leading to his release. Mahdawi sees his freedom as intertwined with the freedom of other student activists and Palestinians fighting for their rights.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>A federal judge has ruled that President Trump's executive order targeting the law firm Perkins Coie is unconstitutional and has permanently blocked the administration from enforcing it. The judge found that the order, which sought to punish the firm for representing Hillary Clinton during the 2016 election, violates the First, Fifth, and Sixth Amendments. The ruling is a significant victory for Perkins Coie and a rebuke of the president's attempt to use government power to target lawyers for their representation of disfavored clients. The judge noted the importance of lawyers standing up in court to vindicate constitutional rights.</p>

          <p>United Airlines will reduce its schedule at Newark Liberty International Airport by 35 roundtrip flights daily, approximately 10% of its schedule, after experiencing significant flight disruptions. CEO Scott Kirby cited air traffic controller staffing shortages and the FAA's technology problems as the cause. Kirby said that 20% of air traffic controllers for Newark were absent after technology failures, making it impossible to handle the scheduled number of planes. He is urging the FAA to establish flight restrictions similar to those in place at other congested airports.</p>

          <p>Chinese e-commerce platform Temu has ceased direct shipping of products from China to customers in the United States, now shipping all U.S. orders from local warehouses. This change follows the Trump administration's closure of a loophole that allowed low-cost Chinese goods to enter the U.S. without import fees. Temu had previously announced it would adjust prices after the policy change. The company states that pricing for U.S. consumers remains unchanged as it transitions to a local fulfillment model and actively recruits U.S. sellers to join the platform.</p>

          <p>Wall Street stocks bounced back from losses incurred after President Trump imposed global tariffs, with major US indexes closing higher on Friday. The S&P 500 and Nasdaq both rose 1.5%, while the Dow Jones Industrial Average increased 1.4%. Gains were fueled by a better-than-expected jobs report and rising hopes for US-China trade talks. The Department of Labor reported that US employers added 177,000 new jobs in April, outpacing analysts' predictions. While the jobs report is strong, the outlook remains very uncertain.</p>
