          <p>Zhimin Qian, a Chinese national, has been convicted in the UK for her central role in a large-scale bitcoin scam that led to the world's largest cryptocurrency seizure, valued at over £5 billion. Between 2014 and 2017, Qian defrauded more than 128,000 victims in China, converting their stolen funds into bitcoin. She fled to the UK using false documents and attempted to launder the money through property. This conviction, following a seven-year international investigation, aims to return funds to victims, some of whom have already received compensation.</p>

The San Diego Humane Society's Ramona Wildlife Center provided specialized care, minimizing human interaction to foster natural hunting behaviors and habitat familiarity. This release is particularly significant as California's wild mountain lion population is estimated to be much lower than previously thought, facing constant threats from human activity and environmental factors. The goal is for them to thrive without human-wildlife conflict.</p>

          <p>British Prime Minister Sir Keir Starmer will address the Labour Party conference, asserting that Britain stands "at a fork in the road" and advocating for a "hard path" of renewal and decency over decline and division. His speech aims to distinguish Labour's vision from Nigel Farage's Reform UK Party, which is gaining traction among former Labour voters. Starmer faces internal party criticism, recent ministerial departures, and challenging economic forecasts, with Chancellor Rachel Reeves signaling potential tax increases.

          <p>Zijin Gold, the overseas gold-mining arm of China's Zijin Mining, saw its shares surge over 60% in its Hong Kong trading debut, raising nearly $3.2 billion. This marks the world's second-largest initial public offering this year and builds on a resurgence in Hong Kong's IPO market. The timing is particularly favorable, as gold prices have been reaching record highs due to strong safe-haven demand, anticipated rate cuts, and global economic uncertainty. Zijin Gold's listing, delayed by a typhoon, benefits from this market excitement, attracting significant investor interest in gold miners. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>Paralympic champion Stef Reid is advocating for major brands like Nike and Adidas to sell single shoes, addressing a significant need for amputees and individuals with different-sized feet. Reid, who lost her right foot in a boat accident, highlights the financial burden and practical disconnect when having to buy pairs despite only needing one shoe for her prosthetic blade. She emphasizes that retailers should align their inclusive marketing imagery with actual product offerings, ensuring that athletes and consumers with disabilities have appropriate and cost-effective options. This campaign seeks to promote greater inclusivity.</p>

          <p>Fences have been erected around underpasses on Virginia Beach Boulevard and Military Highway in Norfolk, Virginia, in preparation for upcoming repairs to the Military Highway overpass. The city confirmed these fenced-off areas will serve as "laydown areas" for the construction project, clarifying that the installation is unrelated to the homeless population often found in the area. The timeline for the overpass repairs has not yet been announced, leading to some social media speculation regarding the purpose of the new fencing.

          <p>This opinion article proposes that Hong Kong should serve as China's gateway to the United Nations, leveraging its unique attributes such as a common law tradition, English as an official language, and low corporate taxes. The author suggests that establishing a UN Asia headquarters in Hong Kong could facilitate organizational reforms and align with Beijing's vision for global governance. As the second-largest UN donor, China could utilize Hong Kong to enhance its international engagement, effectively bringing the world to China rather than solely communicating China's story globally.</p>

          <p>A federal judge has temporarily suspended the Trump administration's plan to eliminate 532 jobs at the US Agency for Global Media (USAGM), the parent agency of Voice of America (VOA). The judge cited "concerning disrespect" from the administration in response to earlier orders to restore VOA programming to its statutory mandate. President Trump had signed an executive order effectively shutting down the taxpayer-funded broadcaster, calling it "radical propaganda," leading to the suspension of broadcasts and employees being placed on administrative leave. The ruling aims to preserve VOA's ability to fulfill its mission.</p>

          <p>The Navi Mumbai International Airport (NMIA) is set to open, aiming to significantly ease congestion at Mumbai's current overworked airport and become India's first fully digital hub. With two parallel runways and a capacity for 90 million passengers, NMIA is connected to the city by India's longest sea-bridge. However, it faces major challenges, including traffic woes and last-mile connectivity issues, which could hinder its ambition to compete with global hubs like Singapore and Dubai. Policy revisions and airline optimization are also needed to facilitate smoother transfers and international expansion.</p>
