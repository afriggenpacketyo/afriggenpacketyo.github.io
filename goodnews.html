          <p>Euro zone inflation remained unchanged at 2.2% in April, defying expectations of a decrease, according to Eurostat data. Core inflation, excluding volatile components, rose to 2.7%, while services inflation increased to 3.9%. ECB President Christine Lagarde stated that the disinflationary process is nearing completion, although medium-term inflation remains uncertain due to potential tariff retaliation and fiscal shifts. The ECB is closely monitoring data for future interest rate decisions, having recently cut its key rate to 2.25%.</p>

          <p>Canadian Prime Minister Mark Carney is expected to meet with President Trump at the White House soon, potentially finding common ground despite their contrasting styles. Trump has expressed a more favorable view of Carney compared to his predecessor, Justin Trudeau, potentially due to Carney's Ivy League background and recent election victory. Carney aims to establish a partnership with the U.S. on Canada's terms, addressing issues such as undocumented migration and trade imbalances, while also emphasizing Canada's vital role as a supplier of energy and critical minerals to the U.S.</p>

          <p>Jonathan Eig, author of "King: A Life," reflects on the Rev. Dr. Martin Luther King Jr.'s "Letter From Birmingham Jail" and its enduring relevance in today's society. Dr. King's message emphasized the power of love to overcome cruelty and reform unjust systems, urging Americans to choose mercy over meanness. Eig suggests that Dr. King would call on elected leaders to change unjust policies and might advocate for economic boycotts or rely on clergy to seize the moral high ground. He emphasizes that Dr. King intentionally violated a local court order to demonstrate that American law itself was broken and in need of repair.</p>

The Bernstein children plan to donate proceeds from upcoming Kennedy Center performances to the American Civil Liberties Union, viewing it as an audible rebuke to Trump's policies.

          <p>A bipartisan push to ban members of Congress from trading individual stocks is gaining traction, boosted by President Trump's endorsement and increasing public scrutiny of lawmakers' investment activities. Recent trades made by lawmakers around Trump's tariff announcements have raised concerns about potential insider trading, fueling the demand for reform. Lawmakers from both parties are advocating for legislation that would require members of Congress and their spouses to divest from individual stocks, transitioning to blind trusts or mutual funds. While some argue that current disclosure rules are sufficient, proponents believe a ban is necessary to prevent conflicts of interest and maintain public trust.</p>

          <p>Roche has partnered with Zealand Pharma in a $5.3 billion deal to co-develop and co-commercialize Zealand's petrelintide, a next-generation weight loss candidate. Petrelintide is an amylin analog, a nascent form of weight loss treatment that mimics a hormone co-secreted with insulin in the pancreas to increase satiety, which differs from GLP-1 obesity drugs. The companies will co-develop petrelintide as a standalone treatment and in combination with Roche's incretin asset CT-388. Early clinical data suggests amylin analogs offer comparable weight reduction to GLP-1s with potentially better tolerability and lean muscle preservation. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>Amid a trade war with the United States and weak domestic consumption, China is easing restrictions on K-pop, signaling a potential boost for the sector. K-pop group Epex will perform in Fuzhou, marking the first all-Korean idol group concert in mainland China since 2016. China's annual Dream Concert is scheduled to take place in Hainan province in September. The shift is part of China's strategy to revitalize domestic demand amid a prolonged consumption downturn, and K-pop is seen as a tariff-proof sector due to its digital revenue streams.</p>

          <p>Cecil Newton, one of the last survivors of the assault on the D-Day beaches in 1944, has died at the age of 101. Newton served in the 4th/7th Royal Dragoon Guards and landed on Gold Beach on June 6, 1944, at the age of 20. His amphibious Sherman Tank was among the first to land on the beach. His son, Paul Newton, thanked friends for supporting his father's efforts to remember those of the 4/7 RDG who did not return.</p>
