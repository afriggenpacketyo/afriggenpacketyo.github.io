          <p>An opinion piece describes the author's experience traveling to China after the country reopened its borders following the COVID-19 pandemic. The author, who previously taught in China, noted a significant change in the atmosphere, with a more welcoming and friendly environment for foreigners. This "new opening up" contrasts with reports of increasing authoritarianism and warnings of arbitrary detention, as the author experienced a streamlined visa application process and minimal questioning upon arrival. The piece suggests that China is actively working to attract international visitors through measures like visa-free entry schemes and simplified application processes.</p>

          <p>Conservative leader Kemi Badenoch has called for the elimination of the windfall tax on oil and gas companies, advocating for new drilling licenses in the North Sea. Speaking at a Scottish Conservative party conference, Badenoch argued the Energy Profits Levy should be scrapped before its 2030 expiration, claiming it is detrimental to the oil and gas sector. She emphasized the importance of energy security, particularly in light of recent Middle East conflicts, and criticized Labour's support for the tax. Badenoch stated that a Tory government would remove the ban on new licenses.</p>

          <p>A parenting expert and therapist suggests avoiding phrases like "You should step it up" on Father's Day, especially when addressing fathers who may be absent or struggling. Instead, the expert recommends acknowledging these fathers and offering support with phrases such as "You are important, and we celebrate you today. Support is here if you ask for it." The expert emphasizes that no father dreams of being away from their child and that parenting is a team sport requiring support systems. Recent studies highlight the negative impact of parental separation on children, but the expert underscores that even separated or struggling parents want the best for their children.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>USA Fencing's board of directors has voted to amend its policy that prioritized states with LGBTQ-friendly laws for competition host sites, as well as a policy that restricted the playing of the national anthem at some events. This decision follows criticism over the organization's treatment of a fencer who refused to compete against a trans opponent. The new policy will prioritize cost, safety, and convenience when selecting host sites, and a uniform national anthem policy will be implemented at national events. The organization is also preparing to change its policy regarding trans athletes competing in the women's category.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Despite heightened tensions following Israeli strikes on Iran, analysts believe it is unlikely that Tehran will retaliate by blocking the Strait of Hormuz, a vital oil artery. Blocking the strait, which sees roughly 20 million barrels of oil and oil products pass through daily, would likely trigger further retaliation and could draw backlash from China, Iran's largest oil customer. Experts suggest that disrupting the channel would be more detrimental than beneficial for Tehran, as most of Iran's daily consumption goods come via that route. It is argued that closing the waterway might even be physically impossible.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Summer Fridays, once a popular workplace perk, are becoming increasingly rare as more companies embrace hybrid work schedules. While employees highly value summer Fridays for the extra time off, most workers are not offered any summer-specific benefits. As more commuters settle into flexible working arrangements, fewer workers are making Friday trips, making the perk less necessary. However, studies show that summer benefits improve productivity and can help prevent burnout, highlighting the potential benefits of offering summer Fridays to employees.</p>

          <p>Rare earth elements (REEs), a group of 17 chemical elements, play a crucial role in various modern technologies, including electric vehicles, wind turbines, and defense systems. These elements are essential for creating permanent magnets, which are used in electric vehicles and wind turbines. China dominates the mining and processing of REEs, raising concerns about access for Western nations. The US and EU are taking steps to build internal supplies of rare earth elements and reduce reliance on China.</p>
