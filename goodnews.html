          <p>In Tachikawa, western Tokyo, two men were arrested after breaking into Daisan Elementary School, resulting in minor injuries to five teachers and damage to a window. According to investigative sources, the suspects were called to the school by a parent who was there for a consultation, and no children were harmed during the incident. The Metropolitan Police Department arrested the two men, one in his 20s and the other in his 40s, on suspicion of assault, as the school has an enrollment of around 520 children as of April of last year. Police are investigating the motives behind the disturbance.</p>

          <p>President Trump is expected to announce a trade agreement with Britain, marking the first deal since imposing tariffs on trading partners. A senior British official confirmed the agreement, noting its potential benefits for both nations, as details remain unclear, discussions have involved lowering British tariffs on U.S. cars and farm goods, and removing taxes on U.S. technology companies. Timothy C. Brightbill suggests the announcement may outline negotiation frameworks for issues like tariff rates, nontariff barriers, and digital trade, with Britain also seeking to lift tariffs on steel, aluminum, and automobiles.</p>

          <p>Despite reporting stronger-than-expected first-quarter operating profits, Danish shipping giant Maersk has revised its global container market volume growth forecast for 2025 due to increased macroeconomic and geopolitical uncertainty, particularly U.S.-China trade tariffs. The company's underlying EBITDA for the first three months of the year was $2.71 billion, up 70% from the previous year, and while Maersk kept its 2025 profit guidance unchanged, it now anticipates container market volume growth between -1% and 4%, compared to the previous forecast of 4%. Maersk CEO Vincent Clerc noted that the trade tensions are primarily a China-U.S. issue and have not yet affected other trade lanes.</p>

          <p>Nintendo projects sales of 15 million units for its new Switch 2 console in the fiscal year ending March 2026, as it reported a 24.7% revenue decrease and nearly 50% profit plunge in its fiscal fourth quarter, which was largely expected due to fans awaiting the new console. The Switch 2 will launch in June at $449.99 with improved features, and investors are hopeful that Nintendo can continue its popularity wave, though pre-orders were delayed in the U.S. due to President Trump's tariffs on countries where Nintendo consoles are manufactured, such as Vietnam.</p>

          <p>According to The New York Times, Britain is set to become the first country to sign a trade deal with the U.S. after the U.S. announced stiff tariffs against various nations. While details remain uncertain, it is speculated that the agreement could either be a finalized deal or a framework for future negotiations, and while the U.K. was spared from higher tariffs, it still faces a baseline 10% levy. U.S. Vice President JD Vance expressed confidence in securing a beneficial trade deal with the U.S., though President Trump has recently contradicted White House officials by stating that the U.S. does not need to sign deals.</p>

          <p>Sotheby's has postponed its auction of sacred jewels linked to the Buddha's remains in Hong Kong after the Indian government threatened legal action, as the sale of the collection, known as the Piprahwa Gems, drew criticism from Buddhist academics and monastic leaders. India argued that the relics constitute inalienable religious and cultural heritage, violating Indian and international laws, and following discussions with Indian government representatives, Sotheby's agreed to postpone the auction. The jewels were unearthed in northern India nearly 130 years ago, along with bone fragments identified as belonging to the Buddha himself.</p>
