          <p>A recent report from Renmin University indicates that the Chinese yuan's international usage is growing, with its influence index rising by 11 percent in 2024. While the US dollar still dominates, its score slightly declined, whereas the yuan has surpassed the British pound and Japanese yen. The report suggests that promoting the yuan's internationalization is a key strategy for China to mitigate geoeconomic risks and reform the global monetary system. However, the rise of US-dollar-backed stablecoins is viewed as a potential threat to this expansion. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>An English zoo on the Isle of Wight has announced the successful birth of endangered red panda twins, a significant achievement for its breeding program. The cubs were born to a ten-year-old mother, Xiao, and a ten-month-old father, Flint, who was brought from Belfast Zoo for this purpose. The species is listed as endangered due to threats like poaching and habitat loss from forest clearance. Zoo staff are closely monitoring the new family via CCTV, expressing cautious optimism for their survival.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Starting in July 2026, Minnesota will become the first U.S. state to require social media platforms to display a warning label to users before they log on. The pop-up will inform users that prolonged use can be hazardous to mental health, a measure supported by former U.S. Surgeon General Vivek Murthy. The law aims to encourage more thoughtful online engagement, particularly among young people, and will be enforced by the state's attorney general. Tech industry group NetChoice has opposed the law, citing free speech concerns and may pursue legal action.</p>

          <p>Researchers suggest that children respond differently to ultra-processed foods, with some possessing a stronger 'food reward drive' that makes them more susceptible to overeating. For these children, common advice about moderation is often ineffective, and they may struggle to recognize satiety signals when consuming such foods. Experts recommend that parents of these children create a safer home environment by limiting the variety and availability of ultra-processed items. Instead, they should focus on a foundation of whole or minimally processed foods while allowing processed options in social settings.</p>

          <h2>Pete Buttigieg Argues Democrats Must Embrace Change Beyond Restoring Pre-Trump Status Quo</h2>

          <p>In a recent interview, Pete Buttigieg asserted that the Democratic party's future strategy should not be solely focused on restoring institutions to their pre-Trump state. He argued that the party has been 'too attached to a status quo that has been failing us,' which contributed to its 2024 election defeat. Buttigieg emphasized the need for fundamental change in government bodies like the Department of Education and USAID, rather than simply repairing the damage done by the Trump administration. He also linked the public's interest in the Epstein scandal to a broader breakdown in societal trust.</p>

          <p>At China's largest annual AI event in Shanghai, U.S. chipmaker Nvidia was notably absent, while its Chinese competitor, Huawei, featured a prominent display for its Ascend AI chips. This occurred just weeks after Nvidia's CEO visited Beijing amid hopes of resuming sales of less-advanced chips to China. Huawei showcased its 'Atlas 900 A3 SuperPoD,' a powerful computing system linking hundreds of its chips, highlighting China's growing self-sufficiency in the AI hardware supply chain. Many exhibitors at the conference demonstrated AI applications powered by domestic technology, signaling a reduced reliance on Nvidia.</p>

          <p>England has added fast-bowling all-rounder Jamie Overton to its squad for the final and decisive Test match against India at The Oval. The move provides reinforcement for England's pace attack, which was heavily utilized during the drawn fourth Test in Manchester. Captain Ben Stokes indicated a need for 'fresh legs' due to the tight turnaround between matches and his own injury concerns. England must avoid defeat in the final Test to secure a series victory, and Overton joins other pace options Gus Atkinson and Josh Tongue in the squad.</p>

          <p>Researchers at the University of Cambridge have discovered a complete 4,000-year-old handprint on an ancient Egyptian artifact known as a 'soul house.' The print was found on the underside of the clay model, which was designed as an offering tray for the deceased and dates back to the Middle Kingdom period (2055-1650 BC). Curators believe the handprint was left by the maker who moved the object to dry before it was fired in a kiln. This rare and exciting find offers a direct human connection to the ancient craftspeople who are often overlooked in history.</p>
