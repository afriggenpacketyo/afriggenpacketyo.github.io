          <p>Lowe's exceeded Wall Street's second-quarter earnings expectations, driven by increased demand for home projects, though larger renovations remain soft. The home improvement retailer also announced a significant strategic move, acquiring Foundation Building Materials for approximately $8.8 billion to strengthen its business with professional contractors. CEO Marvin Ellison expressed caution about the broader housing market due to high mortgage rates but stated the company is positioning itself for future growth when conditions improve. The company has revised its full-year sales outlook upward to reflect its recent acquisitions.</p>

          <p>OpenAI's CFO, Sarah Friar, revealed that the company is experiencing tremendous revenue growth, logging its first $1 billion month in July and projecting $12.7 billion in revenue for the year. Despite this financial success, the company faces a significant challenge in being 'constantly under compute' due to the voracious demand for GPUs to power its AI models. This has prompted massive investments in data infrastructure, including the 'Stargate' project, and partnerships with Microsoft, Oracle, and Coreweave. The demand highlights the immense operational costs and infrastructure needs required to scale advanced artificial intelligence systems.</p>

        </div>
        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Researchers at the University of Oxford have created a 'superfood' supplement designed to protect honeybees from threats like climate change and habitat loss. The new food contains all the essential nutrients bees need, including specific lipids called sterols that were previously difficult to manufacture but are vital for their development. In trials, bee colonies fed the supplement produced up to 15 times more offspring that reached adulthood. This breakthrough could provide a complete nutritional source for bees when natural pollen is scarce, helping to support global honeybee populations, which are crucial for pollinating crops.</p>

          <p>GE Vernova is investing at least $41 million in its Schenectady, New York, facility to expand its generator manufacturing capacity. This move is a direct response to the unprecedented demand for its heavy-duty gas turbines, which are essential for powering the growing number of AI data centers. The company's gas turbines are reportedly sold out for the next several years, reflecting a surge in electricity consumption driven by the AI boom. The investment aims to increase production of key generator components, preventing supply bottlenecks and helping to meet the historic rise in global energy needs.</p>

          <h2>Analysis Explores the Diplomatic and Political Significance of Recognizing a Palestinian State</h2>

          <p>Several Western nations, including France and Britain, are preparing to formally recognize a state of Palestine, a move that carries significant symbolic and political weight. This article argues that international recognition would bolster the diplomatic efforts of the Palestine Liberation Organization (PLO) over the armed struggle of its rival, Hamas. By affirming Palestinian national rights, the move could also complicate Israeli expansionist ambitions in the West Bank, the only territory seen as viable for a future state. The recognition is presented as a crucial step to counter annexation efforts and revive the possibility of a two-state solution.</p>

          <p>A new Gallup poll reveals that the percentage of U.S. adults who drink alcohol has fallen to 54%, a record low in the survey's nearly 90-year history. The decline coincides with a significant shift in public perception, as a record high of 53% of adults now believe that even moderate drinking is bad for one's health, up from 28% in 2015. This change is most pronounced among young adults but is also growing among older demographics. The findings suggest that increased awareness of alcohol's health risks, including its link to cancer, is influencing American drinking habits.</p>

          <h2>Financial Experts Explain How Potential Interest Rate Cuts Could Affect HELOC Payments</h2>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Homeowners with home equity lines of credit (HELOCs) may see their monthly payments decrease if the Federal Reserve cuts interest rates in the coming months. Because HELOCs typically have variable rates tied to the prime rate, a Fed rate cut usually translates to lower interest charges. However, the timing of this relief can vary depending on the lender's adjustment schedule and the borrower's billing cycle. Experts advise homeowners to review their loan terms to understand their specific rate index, margin, and any potential rate floors that could limit savings. (not investment advice)</p>

        </div>
        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Mortgage rates in the coming fall season will be shaped by several key economic factors, according to financial experts. The Federal Reserve's future policy decisions and commentary, rather than direct rate changes, will be a primary driver, with markets often pricing in expected moves in advance. Crucial data on inflation and the labor market will heavily influence the Fed's stance, with cooling inflation potentially leading to lower rates. Additionally, investor activity in mortgage-backed securities and 10-year Treasury bonds, as well as broader geopolitical events, will play a significant role in determining the direction of rates.
