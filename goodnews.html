          <p>The U.S. and China are intensifying their competition in space, particularly in the race to land humans on the Moon by the end of the decade, reflecting escalating geopolitical tensions. China has demonstrated significant progress this month with successful tests of its Lanyue lunar lander and Long March-10 carrier rocket, aiming for a Moon landing before 2030. Conversely, NASA's Artemis program, targeting a 2027 return for U.S. astronauts, faces considerable delays, budget issues, and challenges with its private sector lunar lander partners, SpaceX and Blue Origin. Experts from the University of Hong Kong suggest China could potentially achieve a human lunar landing first, given NASA's current hurdles and China's rapid space technology development.

          <p>Texas Instruments is embarking on a monumental $60 billion manufacturing megaproject across the U.S., with Apple committing to produce "critical foundation semiconductors" for its devices at TI's new plants in Utah and Texas. This substantial investment aligns with President Trump's tariff policies aimed at boosting domestic manufacturing, and Apple's broader U.S. spending commitment. While initial market reactions saw TI's shares dip due to weak guidance and tariff concerns, analysts largely view TI as a "tariff winner," poised to potentially undercut rivals with its U.S.-made chips. The project is designed to vastly expand TI's capacity for essential analog and embedded chips, which are ubiquitous in modern electronics. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>John Deere is navigating a challenging period marked by decreasing demand in the agricultural sector, resulting in lower net income and recent layoffs across its Illinois and Iowa factories. Farmers are curtailing equipment purchases due to reduced crop prices and increased operating costs, further complicated by significant tariff expenses for Deere. Despite these immediate headwinds, the company remains strategically committed to a $20 billion investment in U.S. manufacturing over the next decade, projecting confidence in future growth. Executives point to increasing demand in Europe and South America, and analysts suggest that while the short-term remains uncertain, the long-term outlook for the cyclical agricultural sector, especially in precision agriculture, is poised for a rebound.

          <p>Federal Reserve Chair Jerome Powell is poised to deliver a highly anticipated keynote address at Jackson Hole, where he is expected to provide an economic outlook and review the Fed's long-term policy framework. Financial markets are keenly awaiting any signals regarding a potential September interest rate cut, although some Fed officials express caution given ongoing inflation concerns and recent job growth data. Powell faces "near constant" political pressure from President Trump to lower rates, alongside administration attacks on Fed independence. This pivotal speech is anticipated to see Powell subtly defend the central bank's autonomy while outlining the future trajectory of monetary policy amidst these complex economic and political dynamics.

          <p>Waymo, Alphabet's autonomous vehicle subsidiary, has secured its inaugural permit from the New York Department of Transportation to commence testing self-driving cars in New York City. This initial phase will deploy eight vehicles across Manhattan and Downtown Brooklyn through late September, with a trained safety driver required behind the wheel in compliance with state law. Mayor Eric Adams lauded the initiative as a forward-thinking step to safely advance the city's technological landscape. Waymo is actively expanding its operations nationwide, having recently launched in Austin and San Francisco, and plans further expansion into major Northeast markets, building on over 10 million robotaxi trips completed by May.</p>

          <p>Major U.S. retailers, including Walmart and Home Depot, are largely succeeding in mitigating the impact of President Trump's tariffs, avoiding widespread consumer price hikes through strategic sourcing diversification and vendor negotiations. While businesses face rising tariff-related costs, consumer spending has demonstrated surprising resilience, although lower-income households are more sensitive to price adjustments. Retailers have proactively implemented tactics like early imports and selective price increases to minimize the financial burden. Despite persistent trade uncertainties and the potential for higher duties, strong brand loyalty and the growth of new revenue streams, such as advertising and third-party marketplaces, are helping these companies navigate the current economic climate effectively.

          <p>Poland's burgeoning games industry, home to approximately 500 studios, is demonstrating remarkable resilience and creativity amidst a global downturn affecting the sector. Despite widespread layoffs and market oversaturation experienced worldwide, Polish developers are gaining recognition for their unique perspectives in genres such as simulation and horror games. This growth is bolstered by government support programs and numerous educational institutions. However, the industry still grapples with challenges like investor withdrawals, prompting some indie studios to rely on crowdfunding. Developers at Gamescom remain optimistic for increased government financial backing, especially for new projects, as they continue to showcase their distinctive work on the international stage.</p>

          <p>Chocolate enthusiasts should brace for continued price increases as the lingering effects of soaring cocoa prices impact retailers, though a sweeter outlook may emerge by next Easter. Cocoa futures, which reached unprecedented highs due to adverse weather and supply chain issues in West Africa, have recently eased but the elevated costs are still being passed on to consumers. Industry experts predict that cocoa prices are unlikely to return to their previous low levels, suggesting they will remain structurally higher. Nevertheless, a combination of softening industrial demand and improving supply from new plantings in other regions could lead to more favorable chocolate prices in the longer term.

          <p>As the U.S. under President Trump increasingly withdraws from global clean energy investment, dismissing wind and solar as a "scam," Chinese cleantech firms are aggressively expanding their presence in emerging markets across Southeast Asia, Central Asia, and Latin America.
