          <p>Ahead of the Ryder Cup at Bethpage, European golf legends are outlining what it will take to secure a victory in the United States for the first time since 2012. Key strategies include mentally preparing for a hostile "bear pit" crowd, achieving a strong start on the first day to quiet the home fans, and leveraging the experience of a largely unchanged team. Captain Luke Donald, who is returning for a second term, is emphasizing discipline and focus among the players. The team's continuity and the seasoned leadership of players like Rory McIlroy and Justin Rose are considered crucial advantages for the difficult away match.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>During a debate on the 2026 federal budget in the Bundestag, German Chancellor Friedrich Merz emphasized the urgent need for deep reforms to address the country's economic slowdown and global instability. He described the current period as one of the most challenging in Germany's modern history, warning that the export-driven economy is under threat. Merz advocated for a growth-oriented economic policy to fund infrastructure and social security. The debate also featured criticism from the far-right AfD party, which accused the government of excessive borrowing and wasteful spending on climate and social programs.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>European defense company stocks experienced a significant rally after former U.S. President Donald Trump made surprisingly supportive comments about Ukraine's war effort. In a major policy shift, Trump stated that Ukraine could win back all its territory with European and NATO support, and that the U.S. would continue supplying weapons to the alliance. This led to notable gains for firms like Sweden's Saab and Germany's Hensoldt. The market reaction highlights the defense industry's sensitivity to geopolitical statements from influential global leaders, even as broader European markets traded lower.

          <p>The UK government has successfully recovered almost £500 million in public funds lost to fraud over the past year by employing a new artificial intelligence tool. A significant portion of the reclaimed money, £186 million, was linked to fraudulent claims made during the Covid-19 pandemic, with the rest coming from areas like illegal council tax claims. The AI tool, which cross-references data across government departments to identify suspicious activity, will now be licensed to international partners including the US and Australia. This initiative represents a major technological step in combating fraud and protecting taxpayer money.</p>

          <p>In a meeting with a bipartisan U.S. House of Representatives delegation, China's top diplomat Wang Yi described the visit as an "ice-breaking journey" and stressed that the two nations should be partners, not rivals. This was the first such visit by a U.S. congressional delegation to mainland China in six years, signaling a potential thaw in strained relations. Wang urged Washington to view China objectively and respect its commitments regarding Taiwan. The meeting represents a rare moment of direct, high-level engagement aimed at stabilizing the increasingly tense relationship between the two global powers.</p>

          <p>The northern Chinese city of Datong successfully avoided disaster from this summer's heavy rains, thanks to a major flood-prevention project completed over 15 years ago. The initiative, spearheaded by a former mayor, involved widening the city's main river and reinforcing its banks. While controversial and costly at the time due to the area's typically dry climate, residents and experts now credit the long-term investment in infrastructure with saving the city. The success story is being highlighted as an example of how proactive urban planning can build resilience against the growing threat of extreme weather events.</p>

          <p>Australia's national broadcaster, the ABC, has been ordered by a federal court to pay A$150,000 in penalties for the unlawful dismissal of presenter Antoinette Lattouf. The court found that the ABC fired Lattouf from a temporary hosting role due to her political opinions after she shared a Human Rights Watch post about the war in Gaza. The judge ruled that the ABC had surrendered to pressure from a pro-Israel lobby group and that the substantial penalty was necessary to ensure the broadcaster learned its lesson. The case has sparked a national debate about journalistic independence and support for diverse staff.</p>
