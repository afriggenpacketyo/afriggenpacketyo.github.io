          <h2>Energy Bills Projected to Decrease in July</h2>
          <div class="timestamp">2025-05-19 08:21:37 EDT</div>
        </div>
        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Analysts at Cornwall Insight predict that annual energy bills for typical households in England, Wales, and Scotland will decrease by ¬£129 in July, marking the first drop in regulator Ofgem's price cap in a year. This nearly 7% decrease would bring the typical annual bill down to ¬£1,720 from the current ¬£1,849 for dual-fuel customers paying by direct debit, based on usage of 11,500 kWh of gas and 2,700 kWh of electricity a year. While this reduction is a positive step, experts caution that prices remain significantly higher than historical levels, potentially leaving many households struggling with affordability as international wholesale energy markets continue to fluctuate, necessitating policy action to upgrade homes at scale.</p>

          <p>Former President Joseph R. Biden Jr. has been diagnosed with an aggressive form of prostate cancer that has metastasized to his bones, according to a statement from his office. The diagnosis came after Mr. Biden reported urinary symptoms, which led doctors to find a nodule on his prostate, characterized by a Gleason score of 9, indicating an aggressive form of the disease. While the cancer is Stage 4, it appears to be hormone-sensitive, allowing for effective management, with treatment options currently under review by the former president and his physicians. Despite the seriousness of the diagnosis, prostate cancer experts note that survival rates have significantly improved, and patients with similar conditions can live for many years with proper treatment.</p>

          <p>China's central government has directed state institutions and ministries to purchase more domestic electric vehicles (EVs) to promote environmentally friendly automobiles for official use. While no specific target was mentioned, the move signals the government's backing for home-made EVs and aims to influence broader adoption. Official procurement accounts for a relatively small share of the national market, with the public sector making up only around 10% of auto sales. Beijing has promoted the purchase of electric vehicles by state institutions since 2017, with EVs required to account for at least 30% of total annual vehicle purchases by ministry-level authorities and affiliated units nationwide.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>This article explores the historical evolution of male friendship, contrasting the passionate bonds celebrated in Renaissance Europe with contemporary depictions of men as emotionally reserved. During the Renaissance, male friendships were romanticized and considered superior to female friendships, with figures like Montaigne expressing profound affection for their male companions. Over time, societal views shifted, leading to the idealization of female friendships and the portrayal of male bonds as superficial or awkward. The article suggests reexamining emotional rules to foster more meaningful connections in an age of social fragmentation.</p>

In Poland, Rafal Trzaskowski, the liberal mayor of Warsaw, secured a slot in a runoff against a nationalist historian, Karol Nawrocki, but the margin of victory was small, indicating strong support for hard-right candidates.

The view at the top of government is that there is no public clamour to reopen the biggest questions of Brexit ‚Äì membership of the single market and customs union ‚Äì but that making the relationship smoother within those parameters is mere pragmatic common sense. If opposition to today's deal becomes a significant part of these parties' platforms, it will tell us that they believe there is in fact plenty of controversy yet in the decades-long debate over the UK's relationship with the EU. But if Sir Keir is right that the bulk of the public simply wants as little friction with the EU as possible, then he could prove to be our first truly post-Brexit prime minister.</p>

          <p>China's central government has intensified its austerity drive, introducing new rules to curb wasteful spending among party and government bodies. The regulations target white elephant projects, the use of official vehicles, lavish meals, and meeting venue decor. All officials should bear in mind that ‚Äúit‚Äôs glorious to save and it‚Äôs shameful to waste‚Äù, the latest rules say, while urging the party and the government to demonstrate ‚Äústrict diligence and thrift, and oppose extravagance and waste‚Äù. Analysts said the move reflected Beijing‚Äôs growing anxiety over the mounting debts incurred to finance its budget, and its aim to curb potential wasteful spending at various levels of government that had resulted in snowballing debt.</p>
