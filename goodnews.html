          <p>Several major banks, including Goldman Sachs, have notably increased their economic growth forecasts for China this year, with Goldman Sachs raising its 2025 GDP projection to 4.9 percent. This positive revision is primarily attributed to better-than-expected third-quarter data, suggesting the government's target of “around 5 percent” remains largely on track despite existing domestic and external headwinds. State media also highlighted China's institutional strengths, particularly its five-year plans, as crucial drivers of both rapid economic growth and long-term stability. The overall outlook reflects a cautious yet optimistic perspective on China's near-term economic trajectory. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>Nottingham Forest has appointed Sean Dyche, former Burnley and Everton boss, as their new manager on a contract extending until summer 2027. Dyche becomes the club's third manager this season, succeeding Ange Postecoglou, who was controversially sacked after just 39 days and failing to secure any wins in eight games. Forest currently sits 18th in the Premier League table, having secured only one victory in their last eight matches, indicating a dire need for change. Dyche's immediate challenge includes a Europa League fixture against Porto, followed by a crucial Premier League match against Bournemouth.</p>

          <p>China is rapidly advancing its artificial intelligence capabilities, aiming to become the global leader by 2030, with projected spending nearing $100 billion in 2025. The article highlights the rise of Chinese firms like DeepSeek, Alibaba, and Tencent, which are developing powerful, cost-efficient AI models, many of which are open-source. Despite US chip export controls, China is leveraging its vast user base and domestic innovation to bridge the AI gap, even optimizing older hardware to advance research. This intense competition is seen by some as a new form of Cold War, with both nations vying to shape AI's future and global standards.</p>

          <p>Sanae Takaichi has been elected Japan's first female prime minister, ending a three-month political vacuum following her Liberal Democratic Party's election loss. Her premiership was secured through a coalition deal with the right-wing Japan Innovation Party, pushing her governing bloc further to the right. Takaichi, a protégé of former Prime Minister Shinzo Abe, is expected to prioritize tackling rising prices and economic measures, while also pursuing a stronger military and revising Japan's pacifist constitution. Her alliance, however, lacks a majority in both houses, potentially leading to an unstable government and challenges in passing legislation.</p>

          <p>Declan Rice's role at Arsenal has significantly evolved since his £105 million transfer, transitioning from a traditional holding midfielder to a more dynamic box-to-box player. The arrival of Martin Zubimendi has allowed Rice to operate deeper in build-up phases while still joining attacks, maximizing his athleticism and attacking contributions. This tactical shift has led to a career-best season for goal contributions and praise from former captains, who describe him as a "complete midfielder." Both Arsenal and the England national team are benefiting immensely from his versatility and increased freedom in a more advanced position.</p>
