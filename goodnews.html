          <p>Actress Reese Witherspoon recently shared an experience she described as a significant "ego check" in her career. Despite optioning the rights to the novel "Gone Girl" with the intent to star in it, director David Fincher told her she was "totally wrong for this part" and cast Rosamund Pike instead. Witherspoon, who produced the film, now agrees Fincher was correct, speculating her established on-screen persona was not suited for the sinister role. She views the experience as a valuable lesson in producing, which sometimes means stepping aside for the good of the project.</p>

          <p>President Donald Trump and Chinese President Xi Jinping held a crucial phone call on Friday to finalize a deal concerning the future of TikTok in the United States. The call follows the establishment of a "framework" agreement earlier in the week aimed at resolving the U.S. government's national security concerns. Under a federal law, TikTok's Chinese parent company, ByteDance, must divest its American operations or face a ban. President Trump, who has previously extended the deadline multiple times, expressed his desire to keep the popular social media platform operational in the U.S.</p>

          <p>Apple CEO Tim Cook has clarified that the recent $100 price increase for the iPhone 17 Pro model is not a result of U.S. tariffs on Chinese goods. Speaking at the new iPhone's launch, Cook stated definitively that tariffs were not factored into the new pricing structure. To mitigate the impact of the trade war, Apple has been diversifying its supply chain, increasing production in countries like India and Vietnam to serve the U.S. market. Cook also addressed criticisms of Apple's AI strategy, asserting that artificial intelligence is integrated throughout the new phone's features.</p>

        </div>
        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>The fate of TikTok in the U.S. may depend on a licensing deal for its highly coveted recommendation algorithm, a major point of contention in negotiations. Previously, both the Chinese government and TikTok's parent company, ByteDance, seemed unwilling to sell the core technology, which is key to the app's success. However, recent statements from a Chinese official suggest a potential softening, with a framework deal including an agreement on "the use of intellectual property rights." Such a deal could allow a U.S. entity to "rent" the algorithm, though it raises questions about ongoing Chinese influence and access.</p>

          <p>The Treasury Department and the IRS have released proposed regulations clarifying President Trump's "no tax on tips" initiative, which was enacted in July. The provision allows certain workers to deduct up to $25,000 in tips annually from 2025 to 2028, with the benefit phasing out for higher earners. The new guidance specifies that workers in "specified service trades or businesses," such as healthcare and legal services, do not qualify for the deduction. Additionally, automatic gratuities, which are not voluntary, will not be considered qualified tips under the new rules. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>McLaren driver Lando Norris described his crash during Friday practice for the Azerbaijan Grand Prix as "costly" after he hit a wall and broke his car's rear suspension. The incident prevented him from completing a high-fuel race simulation run, putting him at a disadvantage for the weekend. Meanwhile, Ferrari showed strong pace, with Lewis Hamilton leading teammate Charles Leclerc for a one-two finish in the session. Championship leader Oscar Piastri also had a difficult session for McLaren, finishing 12th after his own minor brush with the wall.</p>

          <p>As the newly merged Paramount Skydance entity prepares an offer for Warner Bros. Discovery, sources indicate a potential bid could be in the range of $22 to $24 per share. This information remains speculative, and an official offer may come later than previously anticipated. The potential acquisition follows reports that Paramount Skydance is preparing a large cash offer to create a media conglomerate with extensive assets, including TV networks, sports rights, and major film studios. Warner Bros. Discovery shares saw a modest increase following the news. (not investment advice)</p>

          <h2>Retailers Employ 'Tariff Hacking' Strategy to Mitigate Trade War Costs for Consumers</h2>
          <div class="timestamp">2025-09-19 10:38:17 EDT</div>
        </div>
        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Retail companies are increasingly using a B2B2C (business-to-business-to-consumer) model to reduce the impact of U.S. tariffs on consumer prices. In this strategy, a middleman company acts as the official importer, purchasing goods from the retailer at a wholesale price and paying the tariff on that lower value before the final sale to the consumer. This "tariff arbitrage" can significantly cut duty costs, allowing brands to avoid passing the full expense of the trade war onto their customers. While some see it as a creative adaptation, logistics experts warn it may not be a scalable long-term solution.</p>

          <p>U.S. Treasury yields rose on Friday, with the 10-year note yield hitting a two-week high above 4.13%, a counterintuitive move following the Federal Reserve's interest rate cut earlier in the week. The increase in long-term yields suggests investors are weighing factors beyond the Fed's short-term policy, including expectations for economic growth, inflation, and the government's need to finance its debt. A weekly report showing fewer jobless claims helped calm concerns about a slowing economy, contributing to the sentiment that growth and inflation may remain persistent. (not investment advice)</p>

He emphasized that the military's primary focus should remain on national defense and key global security issues.

This Northern Sea Route offers significantly shorter transit times compared to the traditional Suez Canal path.

The misinformation appears to stem from a misinterpretation of comments made by Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy, who said Poland's Prime Minister agreed to send military representatives to Ukraine for drone defense consultations. The Polish Ministry of Defense later clarified that any such training or cooperation would take place exclusively on Polish territory. The false narrative was amplified by content farms and paired with unrelated news of Polish military drills near the Belarusian border.</p>
