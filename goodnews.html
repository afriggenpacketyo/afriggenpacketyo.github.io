          <p>AMD reported better-than-expected first-quarter earnings, with CEO Lisa Su noting the company navigated regulations on AI chip exports effectively. Revenue reached $7.44 billion, surpassing estimates, though the company anticipates a $700 million revenue hit in the current quarter due to export controls, totaling $1.5 billion through the third quarter. AMD's data center segment, driven by Epyc processors and Instinct GPUs, saw a 57% annual increase, while client and gaming revenue rose 28%, boosted by strong demand for Zen 5 chips, however gaming sales declined 30%. Despite macroeconomic and regulatory headwinds, AMD remains optimistic about its leadership product portfolio, particularly in AI training and inference applications.</p>

          <p>Senator Thom Tillis announced his opposition to President Trump's nomination of Ed Martin as the U.S. Attorney for the District of Columbia, citing concerns over Martin's defense of January 6 rioters. Tillis's opposition creates a potential tie in the Senate Judiciary Committee, hindering Martin's confirmation. Martin, who has served as interim U.S. attorney, faces controversy over his past support for the 'Stop the Steal' movement and inflammatory comments regarding the Capitol attack. The White House continues to support Martin, but the delay in a committee vote raises doubts about his confirmation before his interim term expires on May 20.</p>

          <p>Defense Secretary Pete Hegseth announced plans to reduce the number of senior admirals and generals by 20% and transform the Army to focus on homeland defense and deter China. However, details on these efforts remain scarce, with the memo lacking a specific timeline for the officer reductions. The Army restructuring plan aims to field long-range missiles and drones, while also scrapping outdated equipment.

Some florists are attempting to absorb the costs or source more local flowers to avoid passing the increase on to consumers.

          <p>Inter Miami has relinquished their option to hold talks with Manchester City midfielder Kevin de Bruyne, leaving Chicago Fire in pole position to sign him should he decide to move to Major League Soccer. Miami had the 33-year-old on their 'discovery list', meaning they were the only MLS team able to negotiate with him in the United States. Chicago now has the first option to speak to De Bruyne, who announced he would be leaving City when his current deal expires at the end of the season.</p>

          <p>The federal government's Real ID enforcement is set to begin at airports, requiring travelers to present compliant identification, leading to questions about potential travel disruptions. Travelers without a Real ID will generally be able to board flights but should expect additional questioning. The TSA will accept other forms of identification, such as passports, but those without acceptable ID may undergo an identity verification process. Travelers are advised to arrive earlier at the airport and be prepared for potential delays due to the new requirements.</p>

          <p>The BBC has announced plans to make a 'Call the Midwife' film and prequel TV series set during the Second World War. The film will be set in an as-yet undisclosed overseas location in 1972, and will feature characters from the existing TV show. Meanwhile, the separate prequel series will "delve into the deeper past", showrunner Heidi Thomas said, offering a view of life in Poplar, east London, during the Blitz. The projects are being made partly for a "new, younger generation who have also fallen in love with our characters and the challenges they face."</p>

          <h2>Apple TV's 'Your Friends & Neighbors' Reassures Viewers by Depicting Wealthy as Miserable</h2>
          <div class="timestamp">2025-05-06 16:20:20 EDT</div>

          <p>A New York Times opinion piece analyzes the Apple TV show 'Your Friends & Neighbors,' which portrays wealthy characters in a New York City suburb as unhappy and financially insecure. The show manages to eliminate almost any sense of aspirational identification from its portrait of leafy Connecticut hyperaffluence. The piece suggests that post-1960s cultural trends have stripped away elements of fun and aesthetic distinction that used to attach to upper-class lifestyles. The show provides a reassurance to meritocratic strivers by portraying its rich world as a place where unhappiness is only magnified and financial security is still an illusion.</p>
