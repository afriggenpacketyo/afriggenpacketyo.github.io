          <div class="timestamp">2025-07-18 02:00:12 EDT</div>
        </div>
        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Researchers in China have created a new infrared sensing technology inspired by the fire beetle, an insect with a unique organ that can detect faint heat from forest fires hundreds of kilometers away. This biomimicry has led to a device capable of detection speeds 20,000 times faster than conventional technology. Infrared sensing is crucial for military and industrial applications as it can penetrate obstacles like smoke and dust to provide clear imaging. The development showcases how studying biological systems can lead to significant advancements in optoelectronic and defense-related technologies.</p>

          <p>Israel's stock market has reached a record high, outperforming its Middle Eastern counterparts despite the country being engaged in multi-front wars for nearly two years. After an initial drop following the October 2023 attacks, the Tel Aviv Stock Exchange has rebounded significantly, buoyed by strong foreign investment and a resilient high-tech sector. The tech industry constitutes 20% of Israel's GDP and over half of its exports, attracting global investors who perceive long-term economic stability. This economic buoyancy persists amid domestic political turmoil and the significant costs of sustained military mobilization. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>Tom Lynagh, son of Australian rugby legend Michael Lynagh, is set to make his first-ever start for the Wallabies at the critical fly-half position in a match against the British and Irish Lions. The 22-year-old's selection comes after an injury to the first-choice fly-half, thrusting him into one of the sport's most demanding environments with minimal international experience. Lynagh chose to pursue his career in Australia over England, where he grew up, a decision that has now culminated in this significant opportunity. His performance will be closely watched as he faces a far more experienced opponent in a pivotal game.</p>

          <p>A farmer in China's Anhui province has captured local attention by inventing and building his own 7-metre-long submarine. Zhang, who had managed a riverside dock for years, was inspired by a television program featuring a submarine in 2014. Driven by a lifelong fascination with invention, he secretly used 5,000 yuan (US$700) to buy steel plates, an engine, and a battery to construct the vessel. His creation, which he successfully tested in a local river, represents the fulfillment of a personal dream to build a machine that could travel underwater, a concept that had always captivated him.</p>

          <p>In a powerful personal narrative, a man recounts his harrowing journey with Extramammary Paget’s disease (EMPD), a rare and aggressive cancer. His symptoms began as a persistent itch in his groin, which was dismissed by doctors for over a year as a simple fungal infection. It was only after he insisted on a biopsy that the invasive cancer was discovered, leading to multiple extensive surgeries and a painful, isolating recovery. His experience highlights the critical importance of self-advocacy in healthcare and has driven him to create the largest online support community for EMPD patients, raising awareness for this rare disease.</p>

        </div>
        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Japan's core inflation rate, which excludes fresh food costs, cooled to 3.3% in June, down from a 29-month high and in line with economists' expectations. The easing was partly due to a slight moderation in the rapid rise of rice prices, which had been a major driver of inflation. Despite this slowdown, inflation has now remained above the Bank of Japan's 2% target for 39 consecutive months. Economists remain cautious, pointing to risks from a depreciating yen and potential U.S. tariffs that could complicate the economic outlook and influence future central bank policy decisions.

          <p>In an interview with the BBC, German Chancellor Friedrich Merz acknowledged past criticisms from the United States that European nations were not contributing enough to their own defense. He stated that Europe had been "free-riders in the past" but is now committed to increasing its military spending in response to the threat posed by Russia. Merz emphasized a new era of cooperation with allies like the UK and France, forming a triangular alliance to bolster security and economic growth. He also expressed confidence in his working relationship with U.S. President Trump, despite previous disagreements over trade and transatlantic commitment.</p>

          <p>On the fifth anniversary of Congressman John Lewis's death, tens of thousands of people participated in over 1,500 "Good Trouble Lives On" events across all 50 U.S. states.

The rallies and marches demanded an end to crackdowns on civil rights, the targeting of minority groups, and cuts to social programs. Organizers framed the day of action as a continuation of Lewis's call to speak up and "get in the way" when faced with injustice.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Netflix has used generative artificial intelligence to create on-screen visual effects for the first time in its Argentine science fiction series, "The Eternauts." Co-CEO Ted Sarandos revealed that AI was used to generate a scene of a building collapsing, a process completed ten times faster than with traditional methods. He framed the technology as a creative tool that makes high-end effects more accessible for productions with smaller budgets. The use of generative AI remains a contentious issue in Hollywood, having been a key point of concern during the 2023 actors' strike.</p>
