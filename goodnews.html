          <p>China is reportedly on the verge of attempting a landmark satellite refueling and servicing test in geostationary orbit, a feat the United States has yet to achieve. Optical tracking images suggest two satellites, Shijian-25 and its target, are nearly indistinguishable, indicating a potential docking attempt. This mission, designed to test on-orbit life-extension technologies, aims to reduce costs, improve sustainability, and address space debris concerns. A prior close encounter on June 13 might have been a rehearsal, underscoring China's ambitious advancements in autonomous space operations.</p>

          <p>The European Commission has proposed a target to reduce greenhouse gas emissions by 90% by 2040 compared to 1990 levels, building on its existing 2030 goal. This "pragmatic and flexible" approach includes allowing member states to count carbon credits from non-EU countries for up to 3% of the reduction from 2036, aiming to soften the impact on European industries. European Commission President Ursula von der Leyen emphasized balancing economic competitiveness with a green transition. The proposal, based on scientific assessments and stakeholder engagement, now awaits discussion and adoption by the European Parliament and Council, facing concerns from some member states about economic implications.</p>

          <p>Gen Z, the first digital-native generation, is confronting unprecedented global instability, including geopolitical conflicts, inflation, and climate change, leading to a profound sense of uncertainty. Many feel they are "inheriting broken systems" and are delaying traditional adulthood milestones like homeownership and family planning due to financial insecurity. To cope, some are injecting humor into serious situations, while others are taking agency by pursuing entrepreneurship and impact-driven careers. This generation, despite facing significant mental health challenges, is often choosing to tackle big problems and remains optimistic about shaping their own futures.</p>

This visual overhaul complements a larger restructuring effort, deemed the biggest since the Cold War, aimed at streamlining operations and empowering regional bureaus and embassies. Secretary of State Marco Rubio announced that USAID programming would be absorbed, and the department plans to cut or consolidate over 300 offices and reduce personnel by 15-20%.

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>A Beijing-based think tank, China Finance 40 Forum, asserts that China's actual consumption power is significantly underestimated by mainstream metrics, potentially surpassing Mexico's and reaching 40-50% of developed nations like Japan and Germany. This conclusion challenges the prevailing market consensus that China's consumption is underdeveloped. The report highlights that while per capita spending appears low before adjustments, applying purchasing power parity reveals a much stronger consumer potential. This new perspective suggests a more robust domestic market within the world's second-largest economy than commonly perceived. (not investment advice)</p>

This declaration, made ahead of his 90th birthday celebrations in India, directly challenges Beijing's insistence that his successor must be approved by the Chinese government and born inside China. His message is seen as a strategic signal to China, asserting his legitimacy is based on consent rather than force. Despite China's likely attempt to name its own Dalai Lama, Tibetan followers and international experts anticipate widespread rejection of any Beijing-appointed figure.</p>

The core Israeli demand remains the release of hostages, with public opinion in Israel favoring an end to the conflict despite Prime Minister Netanyahu's insistence on "complete victory."

          <p>Progressive parents in Oklahoma are leveraging broad "opt-out" provisions, initially intended for right-wing censorship, to challenge the state's new social studies curriculum that promotes "MAGA" propaganda and factual inaccuracies. Inspired by a Supreme Court decision that expanded parental rights to object to classroom material on religious grounds, groups like "We're Oklahoma Education (WOKE)" are encouraging parents to withdraw children from lessons containing false historical views. A lawsuit backed by Americans United for Separation of Church and State also challenges the curriculum, arguing it violates religious freedom. This strategy highlights how seemingly conservative legal precedents can be used in unexpected ways to counter ideological impositions in education.</p>

Additionally, preparing a mental and social plan is crucial to combat loneliness and boredom, which often lead retirees back to work.
