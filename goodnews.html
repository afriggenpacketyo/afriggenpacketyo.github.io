        </div>
        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Retirement planning should account for several significant expenses, including rising healthcare and long-term care costs, which have increased by about 8.5% annually. Housing expenses, such as homeowners' insurance, property taxes, and unforeseen maintenance, also pose a considerable financial burden, even for those without mortgages. Retirees often face unexpected tax liabilities from Social Security benefits, retirement account withdrawals, and capital gains from home sales. Additionally, everyday expenses may increase due to new hobbies or increased travel. Careful and strategic planning, including visualizing retirement needs and consulting financial professionals, is crucial for a secure future.</p>

        </div>
        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>NFL Commissioner Roger Goodell indicated the league might renegotiate its media rights deals as early as 2026, four years ahead of the current agreement's opt-out clause. This move could inject billions into the league's finances, contingent on agreement from current partners like Disney and Amazon. Goodell believes the rapidly changing media landscape necessitates flexibility, especially given the success of other leagues in securing new deals. Potential complexities include ESPN's pending deal with the NFL and a possible 18th regular season game, which requires player union approval. Such a deal could also influence MLB's future negotiations and boost NFL team valuations and salary caps.</p>

        </div>
        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>As of September 23, 2025, the price of gold stands at $3,790.11 per ounce, though this figure is subject to constant fluctuations. Gold's value is influenced by supply and demand, with prices rising when demand increases or supply decreases. Economic conditions, such as uncertainty or inflation, often drive investors to gold as a safe-haven asset, while strong economies can reduce interest. Interest rates have an inverse relationship with gold prices, and geopolitical instability can also increase its value. Additionally, the strength of the U.S. dollar and central bank policies significantly impact market sentiment and gold's price.</p>

          <p>A new study by the Lowy Institute indicates China has emerged as Southeast Asia's leading external partner, with its economic clout driving increased prominence across the region. The Southeast Asia Influence Index gave China an overall score of 65 out of 100, placing it ahead of the United States and making it the most influential power in six of the region's eleven countries. The report highlights China's role as the region's primary export market and a significant source of imports, alongside its substantial investment and tourism impact. While Southeast Asian nations are diversifying to mitigate risks from US-China rivalry, many remain highly exposed to China in specific sectors.</p>

          <h2>Understanding the Fiduciary Standard for Trustworthy Financial Advice</h2>
          <div class="timestamp">2025-09-24 08:58:09 EDT</div>
        </div>
        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>To find trustworthy financial advice, individuals should ask if their advisor is a fiduciary, meaning they are legally obligated to act in the client's best interest. Unlike professionals adhering only to a "suitability" standard, fiduciaries must prioritize client needs and disclose any conflicts of interest, including how they are compensated. Failing to work with a fiduciary can lead to higher fees and misaligned advice, potentially costing tens of thousands over time. Resources like the SEC's Investment Adviser Public Disclosure site and organizations like the CFP Board can help identify fiduciary advisors. It is crucial to confirm an advisor is a fiduciary 100% of the time and get it in writing.</p>

          <h2>South Korean President Proposes Constitutional Reforms for Two-Term Presidency</h2>

          <p>South Korean President Lee Jae-Myung is advocating for constitutional reforms that would allow future presidents to serve two consecutive four-year terms, replacing the current single five-year term. This initiative aims to synchronize presidential and National Assembly elections, promoting policy continuity and greater accountability. The proposed amendment would also introduce a run-off round for presidential elections and update language on sexual minorities' rights and North Korea. However, passing these changes requires a two-thirds parliamentary majority and public referendum approval, which the opposition is likely to challenge, particularly on sensitive social issues. Despite political hurdles, polls suggest over 60% of the public supports these reforms.</p>

This surge has enabled Hong Kong to reclaim its status as the world’s largest IPO market in terms of funds raised for the first time since 2019. Companies like China Micro Semicon and Mech-Mind Robotics Technologies are among those pursuing listings.</p>

          <p>Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy praised U.S. President Donald Trump's "productive meeting" and subsequent shift in rhetoric regarding Ukraine's ability to reclaim its territory from Russia. After the meeting, Trump posted on social media that Ukraine could "fight and WIN all of Ukraine back," citing Russia's economic troubles and battlefield failures. This marks a dramatic pivot from Trump's previous suggestions that Ukraine might need to cede territory for peace. While the Kremlin dismissed Trump's "paper tiger" comment and reiterated its commitment to the war, Zelenskyy expressed cautious optimism, viewing Trump's statement as a potential "game changer" that aligns U.S. intelligence with Ukraine's situation.</p>

The study, conducted by NYU Stern School of Business and GoodFin, evaluated 23 large language models, finding frontier reasoning models like o4-mini and Gemini 2.5 Pro successfully navigated complex essay questions using "chain-of-thought prompting." This marks a rapid evolution, as previous AI struggled with Level III's essay component.

          <p>Mortgage demand stalled last week, rising only 0.6% in total application volume, despite a drop in interest rates for 30-year fixed-rate mortgages to 6.34%. This follows a substantial 58% surge in refinance demand the prior week. Refinance applications saw a modest 1% increase last week, driven primarily by government applications, particularly VA refinance volume. Purchase applications remained largely flat, increasing by only 0.3%. The market experienced volatility, with rates initially falling to a three-year low before rising after a Federal Reserve rate cut.

By evening, major cities in the Pearl River Delta began lifting restrictions and downgrading storm alerts. Satellite images suggested the typhoon was weakening, with the Shenzhen city government confirming no injuries and smooth operations.

German manufacturers prioritize maturity over speed, lagging behind countries like the U.S. and China in widespread deployment. NeMo's concept focuses on energy-efficient, coupled vehicles for rural and last-mile connections, with a commercial rollout targeted for 2026.

In his book, "Psychobabble," Nucci debunks over three dozen misconceptions, emphasizing that diagnoses should inform treatment, not define one's personality. He challenges the broad use of "people pleaser" and clarifies "love bombing" beyond rapid relationship progression, noting that intense feelings don't automatically imply manipulation. Nucci also stresses the balance between systemic issues and personal agency in mental health, and cautions against becoming an "amateur expert," as endless analysis can hinder healing.</p>
