          <p>As inflation strains retiree budgets, reverse mortgages are gaining traction as a way for senior homeowners to access home equity. This article explains how Home Equity Conversion Mortgages (HECMs) function for married couples, ideally with both spouses as co-borrowers. Both must meet eligibility criteria, including being at least 62 and undergoing HUD-approved counseling. The loan amount is influenced by the youngest borrower's age, and couples can choose various payout options. The article also discusses benefits like eliminating mortgage payments and creating a financial safety net, while cautioning about long-term implications and the importance of comparing lenders.

          <p>NFL Commissioner Roger Goodell confirmed the league will not reconsider Bad Bunny as the Super Bowl halftime show headliner, despite criticism from President Donald Trump and his supporters. Goodell defended the decision, citing the Grammy-winning Puerto Rican artist's immense global popularity and the expectation of a "great show" that will be "a united moment." Bad Bunny, known for performing in Spanish and his vocal opposition to Trump's policies, is set to perform on the league's biggest stage. This article highlights the NFL's commitment to its artistic choice amidst political backlash, emphasizing the artist's broad appeal and the league's confidence in the performance's unifying potential over partisan concerns.</p>

          <p>A new study published in The Lancet, analyzing over 58,000 participants, found "clinically significant" differences in physiological side effects across 30 antidepressants compared to a placebo. The article highlights varied impacts on weight, heart rate, blood pressure, and total cholesterol, with some drugs linked to weight gain and others to weight loss or changes in heart rate. While emphasizing that antidepressants remain effective treatments for mental health conditions, the findings underscore the need for personalized treatment plans that carefully consider individual health and preferences. This article encourages careful monitoring of side effects and comprehensive discussions between doctors and patients, rather than deterring medication use.</p>

          <p>China's Chang’e-6 mission, the first sample return from the Moon's far side, discovered fragments of carbonaceous chondrite (CI chondrite), a rare, water-bearing meteorite. This marks the first observation of CI chondrite on the Moon, suggesting that porous, volatile-rich asteroids can survive impacts and reach the lunar surface, accounting for up to 30% of samples. The samples, from the South Pole-Aitken Basin, show isotope ratios consistent with a CI chondrite asteroid that melted and cooled, preserving its composition. This article highlights a significant scientific discovery, potentially altering our understanding of water distribution on the Moon and how Earth was seeded with water billions of years ago.</p>
