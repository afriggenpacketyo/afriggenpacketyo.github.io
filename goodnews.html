        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>HSBC has announced a "world-first" trial successfully using quantum computing to optimize its bond trading operations, in collaboration with IBM. The trial utilized a combination of classical computing and IBM's Heron quantum processor to achieve a 34% improvement in algorithmic bond price predictions. This advancement allows for more accurate estimations of trade success in over-the-counter markets, which can lead to increased margins and greater liquidity for the bank. The successful trial provides the first empirical evidence of quantum computing's practical application in the complex field of algorithmic bond trading, signaling a new frontier for technology in financial services.</p>

          <p>On the eve of the Ryder Cup at Bethpage Black, U.S. golfer Bryson DeChambeau has publicly called on Donald Trump to inspire the American team to victory against Europe. Trump is expected to attend the first day of the tournament, prompting an intense security operation. DeChambeau believes the former president's presence will be an "electric" and positive force for the U.S. side. In contrast, European golfer Robert MacIntyre downplayed the visit, stating Trump is "just another spectator" and that his team remains focused on competing. Rory McIlroy avoided direct commentary on the rivalry but expressed his affinity for the United States.</p>

          <p>New vehicle sales in the U.S. have seen an unexpected increase, prompting Cox Automotive to raise its 2025 sales forecast to 16.1 million units. Analysts attribute this resilience to consumers purchasing vehicles now out of fear of future price hikes driven by potential tariffs and the expiration of federal EV tax credits. This "pull-ahead" effect has boosted sales by 4.6% compared to last year, benefiting major automakers like General Motors and Toyota. However, this trend is expected to slow in the fourth quarter as the incentives disappear and tariff costs are integrated into vehicle pricing. (not investment advice)</p>

This major defense deal is part of Prime Minister Narendra Modi's 'Make in India' initiative, aimed at modernizing the nation's armed forces and boosting its domestic defense industry. The acquisition is timed as the Indian Air Force prepares to retire its aging, Soviet-era MiG-21 fleet, which has raised concerns about the country's fleet size. This new order follows a previous 2021 contract for 83 of the same aircraft, which have yet to be delivered due to supply chain delays.</p>

          <h2>President Trump Expected to Approve Deal Allowing TikTok to Continue U.S. Operations</h2>

          <p>President Trump is expected to sign off on a deal that will permit TikTok to continue operating in the United States, avoiding a full ban mandated by a bipartisan law. The agreement, described as a "qualified divestiture," involves Oracle hosting U.S. user data and reviewing the app's code for security. A consortium of American investors, including Oracle, will take a stake in a new U.S.-based joint venture, though TikTok's Chinese parent company, ByteDance, will retain a minority stake. The deal also involves copying and retraining TikTok's powerful algorithm to run solely on U.S. user data, though some lawmakers have expressed concern that this may not go far enough to sever operational ties with ByteDance.</p>

          <p>As retailers prepare for an anticipated 9% growth in online holiday sales, companies like Amazon and Walmart are increasingly relying on robotics to fulfill orders. At Amazon's most advanced fulfillment center in Louisiana, nearly 1,000 robots work alongside 2,500 employees to move, sort, and pack items, enabling the facility to operate 24 hours a day. While automation handles heavy lifting and repetitive tasks, improving efficiency by 25%, human employees are still crucial for sorting, packing, and loading. Amazon states that while some jobs are replaced, robotics also creates new, higher-paying roles in maintenance and engineering, offering training for affected employees.</p>

          <p>Beginning next month, Americans traveling to most European countries will be required to have their fingerprints scanned and a picture taken upon arrival under the new Entry/Exit System (EES). This change applies to visitors from all non-EU countries entering the 29-nation Schengen Area, which includes popular destinations like France, Italy, and Spain. The new automated system will replace manual passport stamping and is designed to enhance security and better track who enters and leaves the zone. Travelers who refuse to provide the required biometric data will be denied entry, according to EU officials.</p>

          <p>Polish daredevil Andrzej Bargiel has made history by becoming the first person to ski down Mount Everest without using supplemental oxygen. After reaching the 8,849-meter summit, Bargiel successfully descended the mountain's treacherous slopes, a feat that required him to spend 16 hours in the high-altitude "death zone" due to heavy snowfall. This achievement is a groundbreaking milestone in ski mountaineering, as previous ski descents from the summit have relied on bottled oxygen. The successful expedition marks another major accomplishment for Bargiel, who previously became the first person to ski down K2, the world's second-highest peak, in 2018.</p>

England's Red Roses, currently on a 32-Test winning streak, will stick with the same squad that defeated France in the semi-finals as they seek their first World Cup title since 2014. They face a formidable, second-ranked Canadian team that delivered a dominant performance against New Zealand to reach their first final since 2014. The match is a significant milestone for the sport, with an expected record crowd of 82,000, surpassing the previous record for a women's rugby match.</p>

          <p>A new analysis of 3I/ATLAS, the third interstellar object ever detected in our solar system, suggests it could be significantly more massive than previously thought. Harvard astrophysicist Avi Loeb and his colleagues calculated that the object's nucleus must have a diameter larger than 3.1 miles and a mass exceeding 33 billion tons, making it orders of magnitude larger than the previous two interstellar visitors, 'Oumuamua and 2I/Borisov. The object's unusual size, chemical composition, and rare trajectory, which will bring it remarkably close to Mars, continue to fascinate astronomers. Researchers hope to get a more detailed look using a camera on NASA's Mars Reconnaissance Orbiter.</p>
