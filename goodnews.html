          <div class="timestamp">2025-08-27 19:45:35 EDT</div>
        </div>
        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Working parents in England are encouraged to apply for 30 hours of government-funded childcare per week for children aged nine months to three years, as the final phase of an expansion plan launches in September. This initiative aims to reduce childcare costs, which have reportedly decreased by 22% since 2024, but significant concerns persist regarding staff shortages and the availability of places. Eligibility requires parents to earn above £9,518 but under £100,000 annually, with some exceptions for those on certain benefits. Despite increased government funding rates, many providers charge "top-up fees" for extras, making access difficult for some families and leading to warnings about nurseries withdrawing from the scheme.</p>

Pundits hailed it as one of the greatest giant killings in football history, marking a famous night for the club and its community.

          <p>The charity Greater Change is providing direct cash grants to individuals at risk of or experiencing homelessness, claiming the approach is effective in preventing people from losing their homes. Laura Burns, a recipient, credits a £600 grant with enabling her to secure a new flat and escape eviction, transforming her life. The charity, which has distributed nearly £700,000 to over 400 people this year, emphasizes giving recipients "dignity of choice" and reports that 86% moved into stable housing, with nearly half finding jobs. International and smaller UK studies support the model, showing recipients typically make good choices and do not increase spending on addictions.</p>

          <p>Celebrated author Jacqueline Wilson describes her new adult novel, "Picture Imperfect," a sequel to "The Illustrated Mum," as both her "easiest and hardest book" to write. The article focuses on Dolphin, now 33, still caring for her mother Marigold, who struggles with bipolar disorder, while her sister Star has distanced herself. Wilson, known for tackling messy family dynamics and mental illness in her children's books, aims for truthfulness in depicting the complex realities of being the child of a parent with mental illness. The author also reflects on her own life, finding love later in life, and her enjoyment of the creative freedom offered by adult fiction.</p>

          <p>China's electric vehicle (EV) industry is rapidly reshaping the global car market, with BYD surpassing Tesla as the world's largest EV manufacturer by revenue in 2024. Fueled by government subsidies, tax incentives, and significant development costs, Chinese automakers have seen domestic sales soar and are now aggressively expanding exports, surpassing Japan as the world's largest vehicle exporter in 2023. This ascent has triggered regulatory scrutiny and tariffs in Western markets, yet analysts predict China will dominate auto manufacturing by 2030. The article highlights the competitive pressure on traditional carmakers and the need for European industry to adapt to this new landscape. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>As the world marks 80 years since WWII, an article examines China's evolving role as a potential guarantor of the post-war order, despite being a "forgotten ally" now often cast as an adversary. With an estimated 35 million Chinese casualties in the Sino-Japanese war, Beijing's determination to uphold global norms is deeply rooted in its wartime sacrifices. However, statements from Western leaders, such as Sullivan's implication that non-G7 nations are destabilizing, frame China's growing influence as a challenge to the Western-dominated security architecture. This analysis explores the profound shifts in global power dynamics since WWII.</p>

          <p>Nvidia reported better-than-expected earnings and revenue, with projected sales growth indicating sustained demand for AI infrastructure, yet its stock dipped slightly in extended trading. The minor decline was attributed to data center revenue falling marginally short of estimates for the second consecutive quarter, despite overall revenue rising 56% year-over-year. Nvidia's finance chief forecasts $3-4 trillion in AI infrastructure spending by decade's end, with large cloud providers driving significant Blackwell chip sales. The article also notes potential H20 chip sales to China, contingent on geopolitical factors, which could further boost revenue. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>The 70th anniversary of Emmett Till's death is being commemorated with a train ride from Chicago to Mississippi, retracing his fateful journey in 1955. The event includes Till's cousin, Rev. Wheeler Parker, Jr., the last surviving eyewitness to his kidnapping, and Juliet Louis, who reported Till's death. Till, a 14-year-old, was brutally lynched after allegedly whistling at a white woman; his mother's decision for an open-casket funeral and the widely published photos are credited with sparking the modern Civil Rights Movement. The commemoration honors his legacy and the enduring fight for justice, with programming planned in Mississippi.</p>
