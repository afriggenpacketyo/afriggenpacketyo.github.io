          <p>President Donald Trump has announced that he has a buyer lined up for TikTok, the popular video-sharing app facing a potential ban in the United States over national security concerns. In a Fox News interview, Trump stated that a group of "very wealthy people" is prepared to acquire the platform and that he would provide more details in about two weeks. A potential sale would require approval from the Chinese government, but Trump expressed confidence that President Xi Jinping would likely agree to the deal. This development comes as the deadline for parent company ByteDance to sell the app has been extended to September 17.</p>
