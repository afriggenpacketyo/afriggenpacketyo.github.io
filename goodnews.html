          <p>Black South Africans are responding with anger, disbelief, and humor to President Trump's claims of white victimhood and his offer of expedited resettlement for white South Africans. Many find it infuriating that Afrikaners, the descendants of colonizers, are being cast as victims after decades of brutal apartheid. The jokes and satire are a way to cope with the grinding poverty and violent crime still endured by many Black South Africans. President Ramaphosa had hoped to focus on trade and economic issues during his meeting with Trump, but the conversation was dominated by Trump's false claims.</p>

          <p>Japan's core consumer prices increased by 3.5% in April, the fastest pace in over two years, driven by reduced government utility subsidies and rising rice prices. The increase, excluding fresh food, exceeded expectations and remained above the Bank of Japan's 2% target since April 2022. Energy prices rose significantly, while food prices continued to contribute to overall price growth. Service prices saw a slight decrease due to state subsidies for high school fees. The United States began imposing steep tariffs on Japanese automobiles and other products in April, but its impact on the economy and prices has so far been limited.</p>
