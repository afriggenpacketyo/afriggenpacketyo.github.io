        </div>
        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>A New York state appeals court has overturned the massive monetary fine, which had exceeded $500 million, imposed on Donald Trump and his company in a civil business fraud case. The court ruled the penalty was unconstitutional, citing the Eighth Amendment's prohibition against "excessive fines." However, the ruling upheld the original finding that Trump and other defendants committed fraud by overstating asset values to secure better financial terms. The non-monetary sanctions imposed by the original judge will also remain in place.</p>

        </div>
        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>A recent survey reveals a growing trend where nearly 44% of American adults are ordering meals from children's menus at restaurants. The primary motivations cited are saving money amid economic uncertainty and a preference for smaller portion sizes. This consumer behavior coincides with major fast-food chains like McDonald's and Wendy's reporting slower sales, particularly among lower-income customers. The research suggests that the lower prices and simpler options on kids' menus are becoming an increasingly attractive choice for budget-conscious adult diners.</p>

        </div>
        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Sales of existing homes in the U.S. rose by 2% in July compared to the previous month, defying analyst expectations of a decline. This uptick is attributed to a temporary dip in mortgage rates during May and June when these sales contracts were likely signed. Housing inventory also increased by 15.7% year-over-year, reaching its highest level since May 2020, which is helping to moderate price increases. The median home price saw only a slight 0.2% annual gain, suggesting the market may be approaching an inflection point with improving affordability. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>Jeffrey Schmid, President of the Kansas City Federal Reserve, has indicated hesitation about a potential interest rate cut in September, suggesting that policymakers still have more work to do to control inflation. Speaking from the Jackson Hole symposium, Schmid stated that he believes inflation is closer to 3% than the Fed's 2% target and that very definitive data would be needed to justify lowering the policy rate. His comments contrast with market expectations, which have been strongly pricing in a rate reduction at the next Federal Open Market Committee meeting. (not investment advice)</p>

          <h2>Wealthy Investors Increasingly Use ETF Conversions to Defer Capital Gains Taxes</h2>
          <div class="timestamp">2025-08-21 14:22:00 EDT</div>
        </div>
        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>A financial strategy known as a 351 conversion is gaining traction among wealthy investors as a way to defer capital gains taxes on highly appreciated assets. The method involves exchanging stocks from a taxable account for shares in a new exchange-traded fund (ETF) before it launches, effectively postponing the tax bill until the ETF shares are sold. While this tax-deferral technique can be highly beneficial, it comes with strict diversification requirements and high investment minimums, typically starting at $1 million. Financial advisors caution that investors must also be comfortable holding the resulting ETF for the long term. (not investment advice)</p>

          <h2>New U.S. Pharmaceutical Plant Highlights Challenges of Onshoring Production Amid Tariff Threats</h2>

          <p>A new $3 billion Fujifilm biologics manufacturing plant in North Carolina, set to open this fall, illustrates the complexities drugmakers face in shifting production to the U.S. The project, which took five years to develop, underscores that even with tariff incentives, onshoring pharmaceutical manufacturing is a slow and expensive process. While President Trump has threatened tariffs to encourage domestic production, the administration recently clarified that drugs from the EU would face a manageable 15% tariff. Companies like Regeneron and Johnson & Johnson are investing in U.S. facilities, driven by both policy pressures and pre-existing tax incentives.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>With mortgage rates having declined in recent months, financial experts suggest that homeowners with high-interest loans should begin preparing for a potential refinancing opportunity. Key preparatory steps include reviewing credit reports for errors, protecting one's credit score by avoiding new debt, and estimating the amount of equity in the home. Homeowners should also gather necessary documents like proof of income and insurance, and begin researching potential lenders in advance. Being prepared allows homeowners to act quickly and capitalize on favorable rate movements when they occur. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>England's women's rugby team, the Red Roses, enters the 2025 Rugby World Cup on home soil with immense pressure and expectations of victory. The team has an extraordinary record, having won 57 of its last 58 games and seven consecutive Six Nations titles. Despite their dominance, the team and coach John Mitchell are wary of the pressure, recalling their loss in the last World Cup final. The tournament is poised to be a landmark event for women's rugby, with record-breaking ticket sales expected, including a potential sell-out of the 82,000-seat Twickenham stadium for the final.</p>

          <p>In a significant diplomatic shift, senior officials from Syria and Israel have held direct, US-brokered talks in Paris, the first such meeting in 25 years. The discussions reportedly focused on de-escalating tensions, reactivating a 1974 disengagement agreement, and providing humanitarian aid to Syria's Druze minority. Tensions have been high since the fall of the Assad regime, with Israel conducting numerous strikes in Syria. While full normalization of ties is seen as a long-term goal, the talks represent a potential pathway to greater stability in the region.</p>

          <p>This article presents an analysis arguing that Stephen Miller's intense focus on mass deportations, while cruel, may be counterproductive to the Trump administration's broader authoritarian aims. The author suggests that the highly visible and aggressive immigration enforcement tactics, such as the militarization of Washington, D.C., generate significant public resistance while failing to consolidate political power effectively. Unlike more subtle, systemic changes, these actions serve as a galvanizing force for the opposition. The article posits that Miller's personal obsession with immigration may be undermining the administration's strategic objectives.</p>

          <p>Recent securities filings show that the family offices of several billionaire investors made significant portfolio changes during the second quarter in response to tariff concerns and recession fears. The family offices of David Tepper, Leon Cooperman, and George Soros all sold their shares in casino operator Las Vegas Sands over concerns about its Macao operations. At the same time, many of these firms made opportunistic buys, increasing their stakes in semiconductor companies like Nvidia and beleaguered stocks like UnitedHealth Group, demonstrating a long-term investment horizon despite short-term market volatility.

          <p>Federal Reserve Chairman Jerome Powell is preparing to deliver a highly anticipated speech at the annual economic symposium in Jackson Hole, Wyoming. The address comes as the central bank faces intense pressure from the Trump administration to lower interest rates.

The speech is also expected to touch upon the Fed's long-term policy framework for balancing its dual mandate of fighting inflation and promoting maximum employment. (not investment advice)</p>

The pact also includes significant commitments on energy purchases, AI chips, and defense equipment. This framework aims to put the massive U.S.-EU trade relationship on a more stable footing and avert higher, more punitive tariffs threatened by President Trump.</p>
