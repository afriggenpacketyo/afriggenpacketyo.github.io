          <div class="timestamp">2025-10-14 03:16:50 EDT</div>
        </div>
        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>According to the Office for National Statistics (ONS), average wage growth in the UK slightly decreased to 4.7% in the three months to August, while the unemployment rate edged up to 4.8%. This data suggests a stabilization in the UK's volatile job market, with job vacancies falling for the 39th consecutive period. Analysts believe the softening labor demand could lead to an easing of cost pressures, though persistently high wage growth might delay interest rate cuts by the Bank of England. The ONS noted the increase in unemployment was primarily driven by younger people. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>After signing a historic peace agreement to end two years of conflict in Gaza, President Donald Trump declined to endorse a two-state solution for Israel and the Palestinians, stating, "We’ll have to see." Speaking aboard Air Force One, Trump emphasized his immediate focus is on rebuilding Gaza and coordinating with international partners on future steps. The U.S.-brokered deal led to the release of 20 hostages, and the U.S. will deploy around 200 troops to help monitor the fragile ceasefire. Critical issues like Gaza's postwar governance and Hamas's disarmament remain unresolved. </p>

The mission involved the Starship upper stage reaching the edge of space before splashing down in the Indian Ocean, while the Super Heavy booster executed a controlled return to the Gulf of Mexico. This flight marks the final test before SpaceX introduces an upgraded version of the rocket designed for long-duration missions to the Moon and Mars. The successful test is seen as a significant step for NASA's Artemis program, which aims to return humans to the lunar surface.</p>

Shares of the Indian subsidiary surged over 45% on Tuesday, pushing its valuation to $12.83 billion, compared to the parent company's $9.68 billion. The initial public offering was the most heavily subscribed in India since 2008, attracting bids worth nearly $50 billion, primarily from institutional investors.

          <p>The front pages of British newspapers are dominated by the recent ceasefire in Gaza and the accompanying release of hostages after more than two years in captivity. Headlines like "Freed from hell" from The Sun and feel-good images of reunited family members capture the joyous and emotional atmosphere. The Financial Times notes that while President Trump is celebrating the diplomatic victory, lasting peace is not yet guaranteed. Meanwhile, the Daily Telegraph reports that Trump may now turn his attention toward resolving the war in Ukraine, leveraging the diplomatic momentum gained from the Middle East agreement.</p>

          <p>The England football team is grappling with a noticeable lack of depth in the center-forward position, raising concerns about who can serve as a reliable backup for captain Harry Kane. With Kane's usual deputy, Ollie Watkins, injured, the issue has become more prominent ahead of the World Cup. Only seven English out-and-out strikers have played in the Premier League this season, highlighting a potential developmental gap for traditional number nines. England's Under-21s manager, Lee Carsley, also noted the need for more orthodox goalscorers, as the team prepares for World Cup qualification.</p>

          <p>Former UK Prime Minister Rishi Sunak is intensifying his call for a national screening program for prostate cancer, arguing it would be affordable and save lives. As an ambassador for Prostate Cancer Research, Sunak supports a targeted approach focusing on high-risk groups, such as men with a family history and Black men. The charity estimates the program would cost £25 million annually and require only a modest increase in NHS resources, thanks to more reliable testing methods like MRI scans. However, some medical experts remain cautious, citing the risk of over-treatment and its associated side effects.</p>

          <p>Scientists at Peking University have successfully used artificial intelligence to restore a 1,600-year-old masterpiece of Chinese calligraphy, "Rhapsody on the Luo River Goddess." The work, originally penned by 4th-century calligrapher Wang Xianzhi, had only about a quarter of its verses surviving. By analyzing the style of the remaining 250 characters, the research team's AI was able to replicate and complete the entire 919-character scroll. This project showcases the potential for AI to preserve and revitalize traditional cultural arts, providing new forms of expression in the digital era.</p>

The campaign, a collaboration with NHS Blood and Transplant, aims to address the fact that over half of regular donors are over 45. Officials hope to replicate the success of the organ donor registration prompt, which has been part of the licence application since 1994 and accounts for 70% of sign-ups. English hospitals require 5,000 blood donations daily to treat patients.</p>

          <p>The Los Angeles Dodgers secured a 2-1 victory over the Milwaukee Brewers in Game 1 of the National League Championship Series, showcasing the advantage of their record-breaking $415-million payroll.

Key contributions came from high-value players, including a go-ahead home run from Freddie Freeman and eight scoreless innings from pitcher Blake Snell.

          <p>Singapore's economy grew by 2.9% year-on-year in the third quarter, exceeding economists' forecasts of 1.9%, though this marks a slowdown from the previous quarter's 4.5% expansion. The growth was tempered by a flattening manufacturing sector and softer construction activity. Concurrently, the Monetary Authority of Singapore maintained its current policy settings but warned that GDP growth is expected to moderate in 2026 to a near-trend pace as global trade normalizes. Core inflation is projected to ease in the short term before gradually rising in the coming years. (not investment advice)</p>
