          <p>Midfielder Mohammed Kudus, a £55m summer signing from West Ham, has become a pivotal player for Tottenham Hotspur, culminating in his first goal for the club. In a 2-1 victory against Leeds, Kudus provided an assist for Mathys Tel before scoring the winning goal himself, earning praise from manager Thomas Frank. The Ghana international has been one of Tottenham's most creative players this season, and his performance is seen as a significant boost, especially with injuries to other key midfielders.</p>

          <p>Contrary to the trend of declining church attendance in America, a new study from the Barna Group suggests a surprising increase among Gen Z and Millennial men. This reversal shows young men attending church more frequently than some older generations, with experts suggesting they are seeking authentic community over a virtual world. The report also notes a gender split, as young women are leaving the church at higher rates, a trend some analysts link to the influence of feminist ideologies and suspicion of traditional institutions.</p>

          <p>With U.S. stocks near record highs, some financial experts are advising investors to diversify by increasing their exposure to overseas markets. ETF.com's Dave Nadig noted that American investors exhibit a strong "home bias," potentially missing out on better value and long-term growth opportunities abroad, particularly in emerging markets like China and India. Kevin Carter of EMQQ Global highlighted India's favorable demographics and rapid growth as drivers for consumption, drawing parallels to China's economic expansion over the past two decades.

          <p>A civil rights alliance in Pakistan-administered Kashmir has called off days of violent protests after reaching an agreement with Pakistani authorities. The demonstrations, which resulted in at least 10 deaths, were held to demand lower wheat and electricity prices and an end to lavish benefits for the political elite. The government has agreed to the protesters' demands, including service sector improvements and a reduction in the size of the regional cabinet, leading to the dispersal of demonstrators in the capital, Muzaffarabad.</p>

He was convinced by founder Jeff Bezos's obsession with customer experience and his bold prediction that Amazon would become a billion-dollar business by the year 2000. Despite Bill Gates calling it the "stupidest decision," Risher was drawn to the opportunity to be part of building a transformative company, a vision that Amazon ultimately surpassed by hitting $1.6 billion in revenue in 1999.</p>

          <p>Fans are speculating that Taylor Swift's new song, "Actually Romantic," from her album "The Life of A Showgirl," is a diss track directed at fellow pop star Charli XCX. The lyrics refer to another singer who calls Swift a "boring Barbie" and writes songs about hating her, which fans have connected to Charli XCX's song "Sympathy is a Knife." In a promotional film, Swift described her new track as "a love letter to someone who hates you," adding that she finds the amount of attention, even if negative, to be flattering.</p>
