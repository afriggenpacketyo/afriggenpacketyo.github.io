          <p>A long-standing succession dispute within the Murdoch family has been resolved, with an agreement ensuring Rupert Murdoch's son, Lachlan, will control the family's media empire after his father's death. The deal solidifies the conservative direction of outlets like Fox News and The Wall Street Journal. Under the terms, siblings James, Elisabeth, and Prudence will sell their holdings and cease to be beneficiaries of the trust containing Fox and News Corp shares, receiving cash instead. This resolution ends years of litigation and internal family tension over the future of the influential media conglomerate.</p>

Japan's Nikkei 225 index initially hit a record high before retreating following Prime Minister Shigeru Ishiba's resignation announcement, as investors anticipate potential new fiscal stimulus from his successor. Elsewhere, Hong Kong's Hang Seng index reached its highest point since late 2021, while Indonesian markets fell after the unexpected dismissal of the country's finance minister. The market movements occurred as global investors await key U.S. inflation data later in the week. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>Scotland secured a crucial victory against Belarus in a World Cup qualifying match, maintaining a strong position in their group. The professional, albeit unexciting, performance was highlighted by a goal from Che Adams and a solid contribution from winger Ben Gannon-Doak. The result was bolstered by Denmark's decisive 3-0 win over Greece, a key rival for Scotland in the group standings. With a critical home match against Greece approaching, Scotland has built positive momentum, though questions remain about finding consistent goal sources beyond midfielders Scott McTominay and John McGinn.</p>

          <p>According to HSBC co-CEO David Liao Yi-chien, multinational corporations are increasingly directing their investments in China toward high-end manufacturing, healthcare, and pharmaceutical sectors. Speaking at an investment fair, Liao noted that global companies view China not just as a production hub but as a key market for driving innovation and consumption. An HSBC survey of over 5,700 companies found China to be the top target for expanding global trade, with 40% planning to increase their manufacturing presence there. This trend reflects confidence in China's vast market, industrial infrastructure, and talent pool. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>Apple is set to unveil its next generation of iPhones, potentially named the iPhone 17, under the shadow of the ongoing trade war initiated by the Trump administration. The new models are expected to be manufactured in China and India, and tariffs of around 25% could force Apple to implement its first significant price increase in five years to protect profit margins. Analysts predict the updates will be incremental, focusing on camera and battery improvements, with a possible new ultra-thin "Air" model. The launch comes as Apple faces pressure to innovate in AI and navigate complex geopolitical and economic challenges. (not investment advice)</p>

The match in Serbia is seen as the first true test of temperament and progress for Tuchel's squad, which will face a talented Serbian team and a hostile crowd.

The dam's construction was self-funded through government bonds and public donations after international lenders withheld support due to geopolitical sensitivities. Downstream nations Egypt and Sudan continue to express fears that the dam will severely reduce their water supplies from the Nile River, and years of negotiations have failed to produce a water-sharing agreement.

          <p>An analysis of trade deals under the Trump administration reveals that large orders for Boeing aircraft are a frequent component of agreements with various countries, including South Korea, Japan, and the UK. Experts suggest these high-value, high-profile purchases serve as a visible symbol of a country's commitment to reducing its trade surplus with the U.S., a key demand from President Trump. Because aircraft orders have long delivery timelines and are less politically sensitive than agricultural or steel imports, they provide a pragmatic way for nations to appease the administration. The deals also benefit an iconic American company amid a recovering global tourism industry. (not investment advice)</p>
