          <p>Major US companies across tech, e-commerce, and fast food are deploying AI to enhance productivity and cut labor costs, particularly affecting entry-level and manual roles. Executives from firms like Microsoft and PayPal report significant savings and reduced need for human interaction in areas like customer service and support functions. While some economists predict long-term job creation through AI-driven innovation, the immediate trend shows a slowdown in hiring and workforce reductions in the most AI-exposed sectors. Companies are cautiously framing this shift, often emphasizing AI as a supplement to human workers rather than a direct replacement. (not investment advice)</p>

The company, which is geared toward institutional investors, will raise $1.1 billion and trade on the New York Stock Exchange under the ticker "BLSH." The successful IPO, which attracted interest from major investors like BlackRock and Cathie Wood's Ark Invest, reflects renewed investor appetite for crypto-related ventures amid a more favorable regulatory environment under the Trump administration.

In a departure from tradition, Trump confirmed he will host the December awards gala himself. The announcement comes after the Trump administration initiated a significant overhaul of the cultural institution, replacing board members and installing the president as its new chairman. Trump stated his goal is to reverse the center's perceived decline and restore it to a "TOP LEVEL of luxury, glamour, and entertainment."</p>

The match had been a back-and-forth affair, with star bowler Jofra Archer putting the Brave in a strong position before the final set of five balls.

          <p>Goldman Sachs is standing by its economic analysis predicting that consumers will ultimately bear the majority of the costs from new tariffs, despite direct criticism from President Donald Trump. After Trump suggested the bank should "get a new Economist," Goldman economist David Mericle reaffirmed the firm's research, which projects that consumers could absorb two-thirds of the tariff costs by the fall. The bank's model indicates this could push a key inflation gauge, the core personal consumption expenditures price index, to 3.2% by year-end. The firm maintains its forecast is consistent with findings from other economists. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>Tennis legend Venus Williams has been granted a wildcard to compete in the US Open, setting her up to be the oldest player in a Grand Slam singles draw in 44 years. The 45-year-old, seven-time major champion made a return to the WTA Tour in July after a 16-month absence, winning her first-round match in Washington. This will be her record-extending 25th appearance at Flushing Meadows, where she is a two-time champion. Her return has sparked discussion about her legacy and whether this could be a farewell tournament, similar to her sister Serena's in 2022.</p>

          <p>A U.S. district judge has ordered the Trump administration to restore a portion of the $584 million in federal grant funding it had suspended from the University of California, Los Angeles. The judge ruled that the suspension violated a previous injunction that blocked the National Science Foundation from canceling grants within the University of California system. The funding freeze is part of the administration's response to pro-Palestinian campus protests, which it alleges fostered antisemitism. The university is also reviewing a separate $1 billion settlement offer from the administration, a sum that campus officials claim would be devastating.</p>

Trump suggested a potential follow-up meeting involving himself, Putin, and Zelenskyy if the initial talks are productive, while also warning of "severe consequences" for Russia if no progress is made.

          <p>Walmart announced it is expanding its 10% employee discount to cover nearly all grocery items, including milk, meat, and frozen foods, effective immediately. The move comes as rising tariffs fuel concerns about higher consumer prices and is described as one of the most requested benefits by its 1.6 million U.S. employees. Previously, the discount on most food items was limited to the holiday season. This expansion could help motivate its workforce, improve retention, and encourage employees to spend more of their own money at Walmart stores, bolstering the company's business as it braces for potential price increases.</p>

          <p>According to a new estimate from the Senior Citizens League, Social Security beneficiaries could receive a 2.7% cost-of-living adjustment (COLA) for 2026. This projection, based on the latest inflation data, would be a slight increase from this year's 2.5% boost. The annual adjustment is designed to help benefits keep pace with inflation and is officially announced by the Social Security Administration in October using data from the third quarter. While inflation has remained relatively steady, some economists worry that a moderate COLA may not be sufficient if consumer prices rise later in the year due to tariffs. (not investment advice)</p>

The aid, most of which is being purchased in the United States, follows similar commitments from the Netherlands and a joint Nordic effort.

          <p>Visitor traffic to major pornography websites in the U.K. has fallen significantly since new, stricter age verification rules were implemented under the Online Safety Act. Data from analytics firm Similarweb shows that top sites like Pornhub and XVideos saw traffic decrease by 47% in the two weeks after the rules took effect on July 25. The new regulations require sites to make it harder for minors to access explicit material, prompting the use of methods like credit card or photo ID checks. While traffic to compliant sites has dropped, data suggests some smaller, less-regulated sites have seen an increase in visitors.</p>

The head of the university admissions service, Ucas, predicts a record number of 18-year-olds will secure their first-choice university placement, partly because universities are keen to enroll domestic students.

To maintain the record, he had to ride at least three waves to the shore every single day, enduring frigid waters, storms, and personal hardship.
