        </div>
        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>The Walt Disney Company reported fiscal third-quarter earnings that surpassed analyst expectations, although revenue fell slightly short of projections. The positive results were largely driven by continued growth in its direct-to-consumer streaming services and increased consumer spending at its theme parks and resorts. While the streaming business saw a 6% revenue increase and added 1.8 million Disney+ subscribers, the company's traditional television segment faced headwinds with a 15% revenue dip. Disney raised its full-year guidance, signaling confidence despite the challenges in legacy media.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>In an effort to combat its declining birth rate, China has announced it will eliminate tuition fees for the final year of public kindergarten, starting this autumn. The policy, which also provides subsidies to reduce fees at private kindergartens, is part of a broader plan to make preschool education free and lower the financial burden on families. This move comes as China grapples with a slowing economy and a real estate slump that has diminished household wealth. The central government will share the cost with local authorities, aiming to encourage more births by making education more affordable.</p>

        </div>
        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Researchers in Switzerland have created an innovative, ultra-thin material capable of significantly absorbing traffic noise, offering a potential solution for urban noise pollution. The material, a mineral foam just over two inches thick, performs as well as much bulkier traditional insulators like rock wool. Its multi-layered design with different pore sizes effectively dissipates sound waves. A real-world test in Zurich demonstrated a noticeable reduction in traffic noise by up to four decibels. While currently handmade, efforts are underway to automate production for wider commercial use in construction and design.</p>

          <p>ESPN has finalized a five-year deal to become the new home for WWE's premium live events, including WrestleMania, Royal Rumble, and SummerSlam, starting in 2026. The agreement, valued at an average of $325 million per year, will bring all ten of WWE's annual flagship events to ESPN's new direct-to-consumer streaming platform. This move is seen as a strategic partnership to expand WWE's audience and help ESPN attract a younger, more diverse, and more female viewership. The deal marks a significant shift for WWE's content, which was previously on NBCUniversal's Peacock streaming service.</p>

          <p>A California Court of Appeal has ruled that the University of California system failed to provide adequate legal justification for its policy that bars undocumented students from on-campus employment. The court found the policy to be discriminatory and stated that the university's fear of potential federal retaliation was not a sufficient reason to maintain it. While the ruling does not force the UC to immediately hire these students, it requires the system to reconsider the policy based on proper legal grounds. This decision is a significant victory for immigrant rights advocates who argue the ban harms students financially and professionally.</p>

          <p>This opinion piece reflects on the 80th anniversary of the atomic bombings of Hiroshima and Nagasaki, arguing that the survivors, known as hibakusha, have played a crucial role in preventing nuclear warfare for eight decades. By sharing their harrowing experiences, they created a powerful "nuclear taboo" that has influenced global leaders and helped the world step back from the brink on several occasions. The author expresses gratitude for their activism but also voices terror that as the number of living survivors dwindles, the vital lessons of their suffering are being lost. The article serves as a call to remember their legacy.</p>

          <p>The cast and creator of HBO's "The Penguin" explain that the show's success, marked by 24 Emmy nominations, stems from its deep focus on character rather than franchise spectacle. Creator Lauren LeFranc developed rich backstories for Oswald "Oz" Cobb, his mother Francis, and rival Sofia Falcone, which gave actors Colin Farrell, Deirdre O'Connell, and Cristin Milioti the freedom to explore complex motivations. The actors detail their transformative processes, from Farrell's full-body prosthetics to O'Connell's research into dementia. They emphasize that the project felt more like intimate theater than a giant comic-book production, allowing for a detailed and compelling origin story.</p>

          <p>An exhibition in San Francisco highlights the lasting influence of architect Bruce Goff, known for designing LACMA's unique Japanese Pavilion. As chair of the University of Oklahoma's architecture school from 1943 to 1955, Goff fostered a radical spirit of self-expression and freedom, breaking from mainstream Modernism. This "American School" of thought inspired a generation of architects who migrated to California, creating unconventional structures that emphasized natural context and structural poetry. The article explores how Goff's students, once dismissed as renegades, created a visionary and relevant body of work that challenged the architectural norms of their time.</p>
