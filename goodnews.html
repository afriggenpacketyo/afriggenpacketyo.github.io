          <p>Billy Joel, the renowned singer-songwriter, has canceled all upcoming concert dates, including a large-scale tour, due to a recent diagnosis of normal pressure hydrocephalus (NPH).

Joel's doctor advised him to undergo physical therapy and refrain from performing during recovery, leading to the cancellation. The 76-year-old singer expressed his apologies to his audience and gratitude for their understanding, with automatic refunds being issued for purchased tickets.</p>

          <p>Yuri Grigorovich, a highly influential choreographer of the 20th century and artistic director of the Bolshoi Ballet for over three decades, has passed away at the age of 98. Grigorovich was renowned for his epic ballets, including "Spartacus," which became a signature piece for the Bolshoi Ballet. His choreography emphasized athletic spectacle and departed from the previously dominant style of Soviet ballet, known as "drambalet." Despite some Western critics finding his work lacking subtlety, Grigorovich was widely regarded as a genius by Russian critics and left a lasting impact on the world of ballet.</p>

          <p>U.S. Treasury yields retreated from recent highs following President Trump's renewed trade war rhetoric. Trump suggested imposing a 50% tariff on the European Union and a 25% tariff on iPhones made outside the U.S., leading to market uncertainty and a flight to safety in bonds. These actions followed a week of bond sell-offs driven by concerns over Trump's budget bill and a credit rating downgrade by Moody's, which cited the growing U.S. budget deficit. The market's reaction reflects investor anxiety about the potential impact of trade policies on economic growth.</p>

          <p>A recent study has revealed that contrast-enhanced mammography can detect three times as many invasive cancers in dense breast tissue compared to ultrasound scans. The study, published in The Lancet, also found that this method can identify tumors smaller than those found by regular mammography. While MRI scans are also effective, contrast-enhanced mammography is more cost-effective and could be more widely available. The study suggests that contrast-enhanced mammography could become a standard of care for women with dense breasts at high risk of developing breast cancer.</p>

          <p>U.S. Rep. Gabe Vasquez is touting the removal of a provision authorizing the sale of public lands in Utah and Nevada from a House Republican bill. Vasquez, co-founder of the Bipartisan Public Lands Caucus, said the removal is a ‚Äúhuge victory‚Äù for Americans concerned about protecting public lands. The provision would have impacted 500,000 acres of land near Zion National Park, along with critical habitat for threatened desert tortoises and other areas designated by Congress for conservation. Environmental groups have applauded the removal, but warn that efforts to privatize public lands are far from over.</p>

          <p>Tarik Shah, a jazz bassist who once played with jazz greats, is attempting to rebuild his career after spending years in prison for plotting to teach martial arts to Al Qaeda fighters. Despite the stigma of his conviction, Shah has regained his freedom and relearned his instrument, but faces challenges in networking and securing gigs. While some in the music community are wary of associating with him, others, like club owner Spike Wilner, are willing to give him a chance based on his musical talent. Shah said playing the bass again is his therapy.</p>
