As part of the agreement, South Korea will direct $350 billion toward investments in the U.S., though interpretations differ on how the funds will be managed. The deal also includes a commitment from Seoul to purchase $100 billion in American energy products.

          <p>Robinhood announced strong second-quarter financial results, surpassing Wall Street estimates with a 45% year-over-year revenue increase to $989 million. The company's net income more than doubled, and it added 2.3 million funded customers, bringing the total to 26.5 million. This growth is driven by a strategic expansion into wealth management, including deposit incentives and the acquisition of TradePMR, positioning it as a stronger competitor to established firms. Despite the positive report, the company's stock dipped slightly due to projections of increased operating costs for 2025. (not investment advice)</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Following a major earthquake in Russia's Far East that triggered tsunami alerts across the Pacific, this article explains the science behind these powerful natural events. Tsunamis are typically generated by strong, shallow, underwater earthquakes of at least magnitude 6.5 that cause vertical shifts in the seafloor. The resulting waves can travel at jet-speed in the deep ocean and grow dangerously high as they approach shallower coastal waters. Experts advise that if you are in a coastal area and receive a warning, you should immediately move to higher ground, ideally at least 100 feet above sea level, and wait for an official all-clear.</p>

          <p>A Chinese-led research expedition has discovered and filmed abundant communities of life at depths of over 9,000 meters in the northwest Pacific Ocean, challenging previous assumptions about the limits of life. Using a human-occupied submersible, scientists observed vast fields of tube worms and clam beds, which are fueled by chemical seeps from the Earth's crust rather than sunlight. Researchers were amazed by the density of these "chemosynthetic" ecosystems, which have adapted to exist under immense pressure and in total darkness. The findings suggest such deep-sea communities may be more widespread than previously believed.</p>

          <p>Meta CEO Mark Zuckerberg has confirmed that the company's intensive spending on artificial intelligence will extend into 2026 as it competes with other tech giants. Following a strong second-quarter earnings report, Meta raised its expense outlook for 2025 and indicated that its 2026 expense growth rate will be even higher, driven by AI initiatives. Zuckerberg emphasized the strategy is to build an elite AI research team and a leading compute fleet to integrate advanced AI throughout its family of apps. For now, investors appear supportive of the strategy, as the investments are already driving efficiency gains in its core ad business. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>This article delves into the ongoing scientific debate about the impact of screen time on children, suggesting that the evidence for harm is not as conclusive as often portrayed. While many parents and some experts express concern about links to depression and behavioral issues, other researchers argue that much of the data is flawed, relying on self-reporting and failing to distinguish between different types of screen use. Some studies indicate that factors like loneliness, rather than screen time itself, are more significant drivers of mental health issues. The piece highlights the lack of clear scientific consensus, leaving parents without definitive guidance on a complex issue.</p>

          <p>A powerful 8.8 magnitude earthquake off Russia's Kamchatka Peninsula triggered widespread tsunami alerts, but the threat to the U.S. West Coast and Hawaii has largely passed with minimal impact. While the quake generated significant waves that caused flooding near the epicenter in Russia, the waves that reached U.S. shores were smaller than initially feared, causing only minor flooding in some harbor areas. Tsunami advisories were gradually lifted for Hawaii, California, Oregon, and Washington. However, several South American countries maintained or issued new warnings as the tsunami's energy continued to travel across the Pacific Ocean.</p>

          <p>The Federal Reserve has decided to keep its benchmark interest rate unchanged, maintaining its current range of 4.25% to 4.5% as it assesses the economic outlook. The decision was marked by a rare dissent, with two members of the rate-setting committee voting for a rate cut, the first such split by two board governors since 1993. Fed Chair Jerome Powell cited that inflation remains above the 2% target and the economy is in "good shape" as reasons for holding steady. The move reflects a cautious approach amid uncertainty over the impact of the Trump administration's tariffs on consumer prices and overall growth. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>Despite being one of the most powerful earthquakes ever recorded, the recent magnitude 8.8 temblor off Russia's Kamchatka Peninsula resulted in surprisingly little widespread damage. Scientists explain that the tsunami's primary energy was directed into a relatively empty stretch of the open Pacific Ocean, between Alaska and Hawaii. This path allowed the waves to dissipate significantly before reaching more populated coastlines in the U.S. and elsewhere. While the area near the epicenter experienced significant waves, the "best-case scenario" trajectory, combined with improved deep-ocean sensor technology for early warnings, prevented a major catastrophe across the Pacific basin.</p>

The piece argues that the era of pure escapist "comfort TV" may be waning, replaced by a desire for shows that reflect the mundane, high-stakes pressures of modern life. Psychologists suggest that watching such shows can provide a form of "vicarious stress" that is cathartic and engaging without any real-world risk. This trend may resonate particularly with younger audiences who have grown up with a constant backdrop of economic and social anxiety.</p>
