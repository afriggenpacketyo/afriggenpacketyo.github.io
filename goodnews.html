          <p>The Social Security Administration is ending its 85-year practice of issuing paper checks, transitioning nearly 70 million recipients to electronic payments by September 30th. Beneficiaries will now receive funds via direct deposit or a prepaid debit card, a move the agency states will enhance security and efficiency. This change follows a 2025 executive order mandating the digitization of all federal payments, although exceptions will be made for individuals who cannot receive electronic deposits, such as the unbanked population.</p>

          <p>Following Starbucks' announcement of a $1 billion restructuring plan that includes store closures and corporate layoffs, CNBC's Jim Cramer has endorsed the strategy as a positive step. He argues that closing underperforming locations is a necessary part of CEO Brian Niccol's turnaround plan, allowing the company to reallocate resources to more successful stores. Cramer expressed confidence in the coffee giant's direction, suggesting that the move to streamline operations and manage expenses is a bullish signal for investors. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>With the median annual cost of nursing home care exceeding $120,000 and projected to rise, financial planning for long-term care is becoming increasingly critical for retirees. This article examines the value of long-term care insurance as a tool to protect retirement savings from being depleted by these escalating expenses. It highlights that Medicare offers very limited coverage for such services and emphasizes that securing a policy is easier and more affordable before significant health issues arise.

          <p>Chelsea women's football manager Sonia Bompastor revealed that she is often asked in job interviews if being a mother of four is compatible with managing a top club, a question she believes would never be posed to a man.

Bompastor, who led her team to a domestic treble, noted that while Chelsea did not ask this question, the industry still has significant room for improvement regarding gender bias.</p>

In contrast, European player Robert MacIntyre downplayed the significance of Trump's visit, stating he is "just another spectator" and that his team remains focused on competing.</p>

          <p>According to a Cox Automotive analysis, U.S. new vehicle sales have received an unexpected boost, with the 2025 forecast raised to 16.1 million units. This resilience is attributed to consumers buying cars sooner to avoid anticipated higher prices resulting from potential tariffs and the expiration of federal EV tax credits. While this has benefited automakers like General Motors and Toyota in the short term, analysts expect the sales pace to slow in the fourth quarter and into the next year. (not investment advice)</p>
