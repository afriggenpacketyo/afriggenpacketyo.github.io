          <p>Tropical Depression Chantal brought significant rainfall to North Carolina, resulting in widespread flash flooding and prompting dozens of water rescues. The storm system, which made landfall as a tropical storm before weakening, caused rivers to crest near record levels and led to road collapses and voluntary evacuation notices. Although no injuries were immediately reported, the system is expected to continue moving northeast, with flood watches posted for several mid-Atlantic states. The National Hurricane Center has warned of continued heavy rainfall and the risk of dangerous surf and rip currents along the coast for the next few days.</p>

          <p>This article, presented as a collection of top headlines, prominently features the heroic actions of a U.S. Coast Guard swimmer during the deadly Texas floods. Petty Officer Scott Ruskin is credited with saving an astonishing 165 victims in what was the first rescue mission of his career, earning him the title of 'American hero.' The report also touches upon other major news, including the political pressure on Israel's prime minister regarding the Gaza war and a new national security initiative involving ICE. However, the primary focus is on the positive story of bravery and rescue that emerged from the catastrophic flooding event in central Texas.</p>

          <div class="timestamp">2025-07-07 06:30:26 EDT</div>
        </div>
        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>The UK government plans to change the law to grant parents who experience a miscarriage before 24 weeks of pregnancy the legal right to bereavement leave. Currently, this entitlement is only available for pregnancy loss after the 24-week mark. Deputy Prime Minister Angela Rayner stated the amendment will give people necessary time away from work to grieve without having to use sick leave. Campaigners and advocates, including musician Myleene Klass, have praised the move as a significant step forward in recognizing early pregnancy loss as a bereavement and breaking the taboo surrounding the topic.</p>

          <p>This column profiles Democratic Representative Robert Garcia of Long Beach, a formerly undocumented immigrant from Peru who has rapidly risen to a leadership position on the House Oversight Committee. Garcia is portrayed as a key figure in pushing back against the Trump administration's agenda, particularly its hardline immigration policies that have created fear in communities like his. The article highlights his journey from teaching himself English with Superman comics to becoming a mayor and now a congressman, framing him as the embodiment of the American dream. His aggressive but strategic style is seen as part of a generational shift within the Democratic Party, which is increasingly looking for fighters.</p>

          <h2>UCLA and UC Berkeley Engage in Social Media Rivalry Over Top Public University Ranking</h2>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>A long-standing rivalry between UCLA and UC Berkeley has flared up on social media over which campus is the nation's number one public university. The dispute began after U.S. News & World Report's global rankings listed Berkeley as the top public institution, prompting celebratory posts. UCLA quickly countered by citing a separate U.S. News national ranking from nine months earlier that placed it at number one, a title it has held for several years. The back-and-forth has amused alumni and students of both schools, with chancellors joining the 'playful banter' and highlighting the different methodologies of the various popular college ranking systems.</p>

          <p>Charlotte Runcie's debut novel, 'Bring the House Down,' offers a satirical look at the world of arts criticism through the lens of the Edinburgh Fringe Festival. The story follows two newspaper critics: Alex, a harsh and influential anti-hero whose career-making or breaking reviews give him immense power, and Sophie, his junior colleague who narrates his public downfall. After Alex sleeps with a performer whose show he has just panned, she transforms her act into a public takedown of him, creating a national sensation. The review praises the novel as a delightfully snackable read that explores the power dynamics and personal obsessions within the profession, even if its central characters sometimes lack depth.</p>

          <h2>Advice Column Explores Balancing a Contemplative Life with Altruistic Action</h2>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>This advice column addresses the dilemma of choosing between a contemplative life of reflection and an active life dedicated to doing good in the world. The author uses the examples of Buddhist figures like Matthieu Ricard and Thich Nhat Hanh to argue that these two paths are not mutually exclusive but can actually reinforce each other. Contemplative practice can build the mental fortitude needed for effective altruism, while engagement with the world's suffering provides crucial insights for spiritual growth. The column suggests integrating both paths by pursuing a meaningful career while intentionally scheduling periods of intensive reflection, such as retreats, to foster a balanced and fulfilling life.</p>

          <h2>Analysis Suggests America's Suburban Sprawl Model Is Becoming Unsustainable</h2>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>The long-standing American model of suburban sprawl, which once fueled affordable housing growth in the Sunbelt, is now showing signs of breaking down. A new paper by urban economists finds that housing construction in booming metros like Phoenix and Atlanta has plummeted, leading to surging costs that mirror those in expensive coastal cities. The authors argue that the 'suburban frontier appears to be closing' as even these regions adopt restrictive zoning that prevents densification. The article suggests that to solve the national housing crisis, America must rethink the suburban model and allow for more flexible, dense, and incremental development.</p>

          <p>A 15-year-old from Northern Ireland has set a new record as the youngest person to swim the North Channel solo from Northern Ireland to Scotland. Oscar Black from Lurgan completed the grueling swim from the Gobbins to Portpatrick in 16 hours and 38 minutes. Due to strong currents, he swam a total of 46km, significantly more than the direct 35km distance. He battled numerous jellyfish stings and difficult conditions, describing the feat as more of a mental than a physical challenge. The achievement is a testament to his endurance and determination in one of the world's most difficult open-water swims.</p>
