        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>The United Kingdom's job market is showing signs of a gradual slowdown, according to the latest figures from the Office for National Statistics. Job vacancies fell by 5.8% to 718,000 between May and July, reaching their lowest level since early 2021, with the hospitality and retail sectors being most affected. Despite this, the unemployment rate remained steady at 4.7%, and average wage growth held at 5%, suggesting a more moderate cooling than some economists had feared. The data indicates that some companies may be hesitating to hire new staff or replace departing employees, a trend potentially influenced by recent increases in the National Living Wage.</p>

          <p>Ukrainian international and Bournemouth defender Illia Zabarnyi is finalizing a significant transfer to European champions Paris St-Germain for a fee of approximately £57.1 million. The 22-year-old is currently in Paris for a medical after agreeing to a five-year contract with the French club. This move marks the third major defensive sale for Bournemouth during this transfer window, following the departures of Dean Huijsen and Milos Kerkez. The club is set to make a substantial profit from these transfers and has already arranged for Lille's Bafode Diakite to join as a replacement for Zabarnyi.</p>

          <p>Tottenham Hotspur is reportedly considering a move for Crystal Palace and England forward Eberechi Eze to strengthen its attacking options. The interest comes as Spurs look to bolster their squad, particularly after key midfielder James Maddison was sidelined with a long-term knee injury. The 27-year-old Eze had a strong season, scoring 14 goals for Palace and earning 11 caps for the England national team. While Tottenham is also in discussions with Manchester City for winger Savinho, sources indicate that Eze has become a significant target, though it remains unclear if the club will pursue both players.</p>

          <p>An American teen pilot and influencer, Ethan Guo, has had charges against him dropped after being detained on a remote Antarctic island since June. The 19-year-old was accused by Chilean authorities of illegally landing his plane and providing false flight information while attempting to fly solo to all seven continents for a cancer research charity. A judge ordered him to pay a $30,000 donation to a children's cancer foundation and banned him from re-entering Chilean territory for three years. Guo, who has been staying at a military base, expressed hope that he can now continue his mission to raise $1 million for St. Jude Children's Research Hospital.</p>

          <p>A Chinese man, Wei Qiang Lin, has pleaded guilty in a U.S. court to illegally exporting approximately 850 protected turtles to Hong Kong by hiding them in socks inside boxes mislabeled as toys. The smuggled animals, primarily eastern and three-toed box turtles, are protected species and have a collective market value estimated at $1.4 million. These turtles are highly sought after as pets in China, where they are considered a status symbol. Lin, who also shipped other reptiles including venomous snakes, faces a potential prison sentence of up to five years, highlighting ongoing efforts by U.S. authorities to combat the lucrative international wildlife trafficking trade.</p>

          <p>The CEO of Resorts World Sentosa (RWS) in Singapore has stated the company will "be ready" for its next license review, despite receiving a truncated two-year renewal instead of the usual three. Singapore's gambling authority cited "unsatisfactory" tourism performance from 2021 to 2023 for the shorter term. Despite the rebuke, RWS is moving forward with its S$6.8 billion expansion, focusing on experiences over shopping to transform into a premium lifestyle destination. New attractions like Minion Land and the Singapore Oceanarium have already opened, with plans for a Super Nintendo World and a new luxury hotel to continue enhancing the resort's appeal to international tourists.</p>

          <h2>US and China Agree to Extend Trade Truce for an Additional 90 Days</h2>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>The United States and China have extended their ongoing trade truce for another 90 days, narrowly avoiding a new round of tariff hikes. President Trump signed an executive order to continue the pause until November 10, maintaining the current 30% U.S. levy on Chinese imports, while Beijing will keep its 10% tariff on American goods. The White House stated the extension provides more time for negotiations aimed at resolving trade imbalances and what it calls unfair trade practices. While the move averts immediate escalation, some U.S. business owners express frustration over the prolonged uncertainty, which makes long-term planning difficult.</p>

          <p>Taylor Swift has officially announced her forthcoming 12th studio album, "The Life of a Showgirl," following a period of intense fan speculation. The reveal came via her website after a countdown timer expired, with further promotion on her boyfriend Travis Kelce's podcast. While a specific release date has not been set, pre-orders for vinyl editions are expected to ship before October 13. This will be her first new album since last year's "The Tortured Poets Department" and the first since she successfully regained control over her entire music catalog by purchasing her original master recordings.</p>

          <h2>Delaware Anglers Encouraged to Catch Invasive Fish, Resulting in State Records</h2>
          <div class="timestamp">2025-08-12 01:00:00 EDT</div>
        </div>
        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Anglers in Delaware have set new state records by catching two large invasive fish species, a 33-pound flathead catfish and a 15-pound northern snakehead. State environmental officials are actively encouraging the public to catch and kill these species, as both pose a significant threat to native aquatic wildlife. The flathead catfish, native to the Mississippi River basin, and the northern snakehead, originally from Asia, are aggressive predators that outcompete native fish like largemouth bass. This initiative is part of a broader effort to manage invasive species and protect the health and balance of local ecosystems.</p>
