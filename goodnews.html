          <p>UCLA will distribute revenue sharing to athletes after a judge approved a House settlement in an antitrust lawsuit, with plans to distribute $20.5 million in revenue sharing while keeping its Olympic sports programs and athletic department staff intact. The school will also preserve scholarship limits at their current levels for at least one year in order to distribute more revenue sharing money to each player. Martin Jarmond, UCLA's athletic director, discussed the department's operations in the new college sports world created by the House settlement agreement with the NCAA. Payments will rise each year as part of the 10-year settlement agreement, and UCLA will reevaluate this arrangement in a year to ensure it was best serving the school‚Äôs athletes.</p>

          <p>Gizmo, the second eaglet of Big Bear eagles Jackie and Shadow, has taken its first flight from the nest, following in the footsteps of its sister Sunny. The eaglet's initial flight attempt was brief, but it successfully soared into the air shortly after. Both eaglets, born in March, have been practicing for their first flights by flapping their wings and jumping between branches. While it's unclear where the young eagles will go, they tend to return to the nest soon after their first flight.</p>

          <p>Charlotte Edwards' tenure as head coach of England's women's cricket team began with a clean sweep over the West Indies in both T20 and ODI series. While the wins were dominant, they came against a depleted West Indies side, prompting caution about drawing definitive conclusions. The series win comes with a word of caution, as England has previously dominated home series before faltering on the big stage. Tougher tests await, including a series against India and the 50-over World Cup in India and Sri Lanka.</p>

Reform leader Nigel Farage expressed delight at Yusuf's return, stating he will now take on a more public role. Yusuf said his earlier decision was born of exhaustion after working for 11 months to build the party.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Los Angeles Mayor Karen Bass has reached an agreement with the City Council President to restore police officer hiring that had been cut from the city budget. The agreement will ensure funds are allocated for an additional 240 police recruits within 90 days. The move aims to address a shortfall in the budget while ensuring adequate resources for public safety. The council will need to identify funds, potentially tapping the city's reserve or pulling money from other spending obligations, to cover the cost.</p>
