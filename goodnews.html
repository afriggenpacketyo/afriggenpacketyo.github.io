          <h2>Musk Expresses Remorse for Social Media Posts About Trump</h2>
          <div class="timestamp">2025-06-11 05:06:04 EDT</div>

          <p>Elon Musk stated on X that he regrets some of his recent social media posts about President Trump, acknowledging that they "went too far." This public statement comes after an explosive dispute between Musk and Trump, which had initially disrupted their close alliance and caused market concerns regarding Tesla and SpaceX. The conflict was triggered by Musk's opposition to Trump's tax and spending bill, which Musk criticized for undermining the work of the Department of Government Efficiency (DOGE) and increasing the U.S. budget deficit. Despite the initial fallout, Tesla's shares have since recovered from their biggest hit following the row. Optimism surrounding the situation is moderate as Musk attempts to smooth over the rift.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>UniCredit CEO Andrea Orcel told CNBC that Commerzbank's current share price is too high for a takeover bid. UniCredit has acquired a 28% stake in Commerzbank since September through derivatives, with ECB authorization to hold up to 29.9%. Orcel stated that a merger bid at a premium to Commerzbank's current share value would not be viable for UniCredit's investors. He also noted UniCredit faces resistance from the German government and is focusing on finding a "constructive solution" before considering a merger, as the share price has exceeded fundamentals. The CEO's comments come as Commerzbank has experienced a surge in share price, but Orcel remains patient.</p>
