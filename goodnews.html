          <p>Cuban authorities have arrested Zhi Dong Zhang, an alleged fentanyl kingpin known as "Brother Wang," who is wanted by both the United States and Mexico for drug trafficking and money laundering. Zhang, who had previously escaped house arrest in Mexico, is accused of working with the Sinaloa and Jalisco cartels to move fentanyl precursors from China to the Americas. His capture represents a significant development in the international effort to combat the flow of synthetic opioids fueling the overdose crisis in the U.S., with Mexican authorities now awaiting his extradition.</p>

          <p>The rate of rent growth for single-family homes in the U.S. has slowed to its lowest level in 15 years, with an annual increase of just 1.4% in August. This cooling trend, observed across all price tiers, is attributed partly to a surge in new multifamily apartment construction, which has increased housing supply. While national trends show moderation, regional variations persist, with cities like Chicago experiencing strong rent growth while Dallas saw a slight decline. The data suggests that the rental market is stabilizing after a period of rapid price increases. (not investment advice)</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>This opinion article contends that the contemporary debate over free speech often overlooks the essential prerequisite of free thought. Drawing on John Stuart Mill, the author argues that speech is not truly "free" if it stems from prejudice, manipulation, or fear rather than a conscientious pursuit of truth through learning and open discussion. The piece identifies threats to free thought, such as cognitive biases, propaganda, and the consolidation of media ownership. It advocates for fostering cultural norms that support education, inquiry, and empathetic engagement to protect genuine free speech.</p>
