          <p>A federal judge in Maryland has issued a preliminary injunction, becoming the fourth court to block the Trump administration's executive order aimed at ending birthright citizenship. The ruling prevents the government from denying citizenship to children born in the U.S. to parents who are in the country illegally or on temporary visas. The judge certified a nationwide class action, stating the plaintiffs were highly likely to succeed in their argument that the order violates the 14th Amendment. This decision follows a complex legal battle and a Supreme Court ruling that limited but did not eliminate such nationwide injunctions.</p>

          <p>Shares of SoftBank Group surged by 13% to a new record high after the Japanese investment firm reported a fiscal first-quarter profit that significantly surpassed analyst expectations. The company posted a profit of 421.8 billion yen, a stark turnaround from the loss recorded in the same period last year. This strong performance was driven by a $4.8 billion gain in the value of its Vision Funds, their largest gain since 2021, boosted by investments in companies like Grab and Swiggy. The positive results are further supported by the anticipated public offerings of several portfolio companies. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>California Governor Gavin Newsom has publicly stated that the University of California should not "bend on their knees" while negotiating with the Trump administration to restore over half a billion dollars in frozen research grants for UCLA. The federal funding was suspended amid allegations of antisemitism on campus, and Newsom cautioned against settlements like those made by Columbia and Brown universities, which involved large payouts and concessions. He emphasized the importance of upholding principles of academic freedom against political pressure. UC leadership is currently in dialogue with the administration, aiming to restore funding crucial for research.</p>

          <p>Gareth Ward, an Australian politician found guilty of sexually assaulting two men, has resigned from the New South Wales parliament. His resignation came just before a scheduled vote to expel him, following the dismissal of his legal challenge to remain in office. Ward, who is in custody awaiting sentencing, had argued that his expulsion would be an "affront to democracy." His departure from the seat he held as an independent triggers a by-election and ends his parliamentary salary. The state's premier stated that Ward's resignation "should have come earlier," questioning how a community can be represented from behind bars.</p>

          <p>A federal judge has issued a temporary restraining order to stop any new construction at the controversial immigrant detention facility in Florida known as "Alligator Alcatraz." The ruling came after environmental groups and the Miccosukee Tribe argued that the facility was built without required environmental impact studies, posing a threat to the sensitive Everglades ecosystem and sacred tribal lands. While the facility can continue to house detainees, the 14-day pause on construction is intended to prevent further potential harm. The state of Florida has vowed to fight the ruling, which is the latest legal challenge to the facility's operation.</p>

          <p>A species of butterfly known as the Southern Small White has been officially recorded in the United Kingdom for the first time, marking a significant northward expansion of its habitat. The butterfly, previously confined to Southern Europe, was photographed by a volunteer at the Landguard Nature Reserve in Suffolk. Conservation experts have tracked the species as it rapidly colonized Northern Europe over the past decade, moving at a rate of about 100 kilometers per year. While a warming climate is considered a contributing factor to this "ecological leap," it is not yet certain if the species will establish a permanent breeding population in the UK.</p>

          <p>A growing number of people, particularly millennials and Gen Z, are moving away from dating apps and seeking romantic connections through old-fashioned, in-person events. Companies like Date Cincy are capitalizing on this trend, hosting singles events for those experiencing "swipe fatigue" and craving face-to-face interaction. This shift is reflected in business trends, with dating app Bumble's value dropping significantly and attendance at singles events rising. Participants find that meeting in person allows for a more authentic assessment of chemistry, avoiding the potential for misrepresentation common on digital platforms.</p>

          <p>Tonia Haddix, an exotic animal broker featured in the HBO docuseries "Chimp Crazy," has been sentenced to 46 months in federal prison. Haddix pleaded guilty to perjury and obstruction of justice for lying to a judge about the death of a chimpanzee named Tonka, whom she was hiding in her basement to avoid a court order. The celebrity chimp was later discovered and relocated to a sanctuary. Animal rights group PETA, which had pursued legal action against Haddix for years, praised the sentence as a just outcome for the suffering she inflicted on animals.</p>

          <p>Major Chinese electric vehicle manufacturers have begun to scale back on steep price cuts, aligning with a push from Beijing to stabilize the automotive market. An intense price war, driven by overcapacity and weak consumer spending, had led to record-high industry-wide discounts in recent months. While the government's intervention has brought some temporary relief, analysts remain cautious, noting that the fundamental issue of overcapacity has not been resolved. A sustainable recovery of the price environment may still be a long way off, as the sector continues to navigate challenging economic conditions. (not investment advice)</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Travel companies in the United Kingdom are observing a new trend where holidaymakers are booking shorter vacations, closer to home, and at the last minute. Firms like Booking.com and Pitchup.com report a significant increase in spontaneous domestic trip planning, a shift attributed to both budget constraints and the desire to take advantage of good weather. This "later, closer, shorter" approach allows people to save money compared to foreign travel while still enjoying a getaway. Holiday parks and campsites are seeing a surge in late bookings as families opt for more convenient and affordable UK-based breaks.</p>
