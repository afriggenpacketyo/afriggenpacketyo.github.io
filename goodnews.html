          <p>Tom Brady, the seven-time Super Bowl champion, revealed on the "IMPAULSIVE" podcast the NFL players he was "afraid" to get hit by during his career. He mentioned Ray Lewis, Ndamukong Suh, J.J. Watt, and Haloti Ngata as some of the most formidable defenders he faced. Despite being sacked 565 times, Brady managed to avoid serious injuries for most of his career, with a notable exception in 2008 when he tore his ACL after a hit by Bernard Pollard. Brady retired following the 2022 season, holding records for passing yards and touchdowns.</p>

          <p>For Prime Minister Keir Starmer of Britain, the news of a trade agreement with the United States is a much-needed political victory, as well as vindication of his strategy of assiduously cultivating President Trump. According to the New York Times article, the agreement, the first of its kind since Trump imposed tariffs on trading partners, is seen as a testament to the "special relationship" between the two countries. Starmer's efforts to build a relationship with Trump, including delivering an invitation from King Charles III, have positioned Britain favorably in trade negotiations. The deal could boost Britain's economy but may also present challenges in its relationship with the European Union.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>President Trump indicated that new trade agreements could be announced soon, as his administration faces pressure to finalize deals before a 90-day pause on tariffs expires in July. CBS News reports that the U.S. is in negotiation mode with several countries, including the UK, Canada, Italy, India, and Japan. While Treasury Secretary Scott Bessent anticipates deals being mostly wrapped up by year-end, experts suggest negotiations may extend into June. The administration's overtures aim to alleviate economic uncertainty caused by tariffs, although China remains largely absent from current trade talks.</p>

          <p>Britain is set to announce a trade deal with the United States, offering a potential boost to the country's economy amid ongoing global economic challenges. According to the New York Times article, the deal is expected to ease the impact of recent US tariffs and support sectors like the auto industry. While the agreement is likely to improve consumer and business sentiment, its overall impact on the British economy may be limited due to the dominance of services in trade flows. The Bank of England recently cut interest rates, reflecting concerns about economic growth and trade uncertainty.</p>

          <p>An interim report states that the root cause of a fire that led to the shutdown of Heathrow Airport remains unknown, according to the BBC. The airport was closed to all flights for much of March 21 after a fire at a nearby electrical substation caused a power outage. The report notes that detectives found no evidence to suggest the incident was suspicious. Power was restored to Heathrow's terminals hours before flights resumed, but the airport's management has been criticized for the decision to close the airport and the long shutdown that followed.</p>

          <p>Amid concerns about the safety of mRNA vaccines, The New York Times provides an explainer on how the technology works, its safety, and its potential in medicine. mRNA vaccines use strands of mRNA to code for specific viral proteins, triggering an immune response in the body. The article emphasizes that mRNA cannot affect a person's DNA and that while side effects are possible, long-term safety signals have not been observed. mRNA technology is also being studied for use in treating cancer, cardiovascular disease, autoimmune disorders, and rare diseases.</p>

The deal is expected to be a narrow agreement, with months of negotiations and legal paperwork to follow. A reduction in the UK's digital services tax on US firms is also speculated.</p>
