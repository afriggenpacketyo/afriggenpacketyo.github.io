          <p>After 21 years, the identity of a woman whose body was discovered on a Dutch beach in 2004 has finally been confirmed as 35-year-old German citizen Eva Maria Pommer. Her identification came through a crucial tip-off to Dutch police, part of the international "Operation Identify Me" campaign which shares Interpol "black notices" with the public. While this breakthrough brings long-awaited closure to her family, the cause of Pommer's death remains unexplained, prompting ongoing investigation into the circumstances surrounding her mysterious demise. This success highlights the power of international collaboration in cold cases.</p>

          <p>Scientists from China and Spain have made a significant discovery, finding that salt-doped ice can generate electricity when subjected to bending. This phenomenon, attributed to flexoelectricity, allows for the creation of an electrical response comparable to high-performance ceramic materials. The research team successfully fabricated devices using saline ice, demonstrating its potential as a low-cost and innovative source of energy in cold environments. This breakthrough opens new avenues for harnessing clean power and could have far-reaching implications for sustainable technology development.</p>

          <p>A powerful magnitude 7.5 earthquake struck off the southern Philippines, initially triggering tsunami warnings for the Philippines, Palau, and Indonesia. Coastal residents in affected areas were strongly advised to evacuate to higher grounds due to the expectation of life-threatening wave heights. However, the Pacific Tsunami Warning Center later lifted its alert, confirming that there is no longer a tsunami threat from this seismic event. Authorities are now assessing the situation and deploying search-and-rescue teams to ensure public safety.</p>

          <p>The New York Giants delivered a stunning 34-17 defeat to the Philadelphia Eagles, marking the defending Super Bowl champions' second consecutive loss. Rookie running back Cam Skattebo rushed for three touchdowns, and fellow rookie quarterback Jaxson Dart overcame an injury scare to lead the Giants' offense. This dominant performance, which included three sacks and an interception against Eagles quarterback Jalen Hurts, secured a rare victory for the Giants against their NFC East rivals. The Eagles' repeated "tush push" plays and defensive struggles contributed to their unexpected downfall.</p>

          <p>Chinese regulators, including the National Development and Reform Commission and the State Administration for Market Regulation, have unveiled new measures to combat "disorderly price competition" across key industries. The joint policy paper aims to mitigate the negative effects of intense price wars on industry development, innovation, and product quality. Authorities will guide industry associations to establish reasonable pricing, monitor for suspected price wars, and intervene with cost investigations and inspections when necessary.

          <p>Tropical Storm Jerry is forecast to intensify into a hurricane by late Friday or Saturday, as it approaches the northern Leeward Islands. Tropical storm warnings are currently in effect for several islands, including Anguilla and Sint Maarten, with tropical storm watches for others. Forecasters anticipate two to four inches of rain, posing a risk of flash flooding in urban and steep terrain areas. While Jerry is the tenth named storm of the 2025 Atlantic hurricane season, it is not currently posing a direct threat to southern Florida.</p>
