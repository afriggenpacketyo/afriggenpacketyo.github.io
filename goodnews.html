          <p>Patrick Schwarzenegger discusses his role as Saxon Ratliff in "The White Lotus," a character he describes as a sex-obsessed and self-absorbed individual, and how he prepared for the part by focusing on a short sentence describing Saxon's excitable personality during the audition. He acknowledges concerns about being typecast but credits the role with showcasing his acting abilities beyond his famous lineage. Schwarzenegger also reflects on his upbringing, his relationship with his parents Arnold Schwarzenegger and Maria Shriver, and his early entrepreneurial ventures, such as managing his father's memorabilia for nonprofit purposes. He hopes his performance will dispel notions of nepotism and establish him as a serious actor in the industry. The article also touches on his family's reaction to his role and his interest in public service. Optimism score is not applicable in this context.</p>

          <p>U.S. Defense Secretary Pete Hegseth stated that Iran's nuclear ambitions have been "obliterated" following U.S. attacks on three major nuclear enrichment facilities. Hegseth emphasized that the mission was a focused and precise operation to neutralize threats to U.S. national interests posed by Iran's nuclear program and to defend U.S. troops and ally Israel. He echoed President Trump's remarks about the destruction of Iran's nuclear enrichment capacity. The full extent of the damage to Iran's nuclear capabilities was not immediately clear, but the U.S. government portrayed the strikes as a significant success in curbing Iran's nuclear ambitions.</p>

          <p>Senator Lisa Murkowski of Alaska discusses her experiences as a moderate in a polarized Washington, D.C., highlighting themes from her new memoir, "Far from Home: An Alaskan Senator Faces the Extreme Climate of Washington, D.C." She emphasizes her allegiance to the people of Alaska rather than to the Republican Party, noting her independent write-in victory in 2010 reinforced this commitment. Murkowski reflects on her role in Congress, particularly regarding oversight of government spending and the importance of maintaining congressional authority, especially in the context of President Trump's executive orders. She expresses concern about the Republican conference's willingness to cede power to the executive branch and stresses the need for Congress to fulfill its constitutional duties, regardless of the president's party affiliation. Her effectiveness is tied to relationships and navigating an administration where she and the president have had disagreements.</p>

          <p>Prime Minister Shigeru Ishiba's Liberal Democratic Party (LDP) is expected to face record-low results in the Tokyo assembly election, a bellwether for the upcoming House of Councillors race, as he navigates a minority government in national politics. Tomin First no Kai, a regional party led by Tokyo Gov. Yuriko Koike, is poised to become the largest force in the assembly, reflecting the appeal of her policies focused on quality of life. This year's election coincides with the upper house election, a rare occurrence that happens once every 12 years.

          <p>Markets across the Middle East mostly ended higher on Sunday after the United States struck three key Iranian nuclear sites, with stocks in Tel Aviv reaching an all-time high on bets that Washington's entrance into the conflict would help it to come to an end. Saudi Arabia's Tadawul closed down slightly, while Qatar and Bahrain gained modestly. Egypt's benchmark EGX30 was a major gainer in the region. Analysts suggest the Gulf's distancing from the conflict and calls for appeasement have helped insulate it from major market impact, with the removal of the Iranian threat potentially seen positively by international investors.

          <h2>Toxic Phrases Parents Should Avoid and What to Say Instead</h2>

        </div>
        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>A study of over 200 parent-child relationships reveals that parents who avoid defiance do not use threats, bribes, or harsh consequences, but instead use language that encourages cooperation. Traditional parenting phrases can trigger a child's fight-or-flight response, while language that honors autonomy and sets boundaries fosters cooperation. Examples of phrases to avoid include "Because I said so," "If you don't listen, you'll lose [X privilege]," and "Stop crying. You're fine." Instead, parents should explain their reasoning, give children agency over their behavior, validate their emotions, and invite problem-solving instead of blame. By shifting from punishment to partnership, parents can create conditions where cooperation feels natural, fostering trust, self-regulation, and emotional resilience in children.</p>

          <p>Despite ongoing challenges such as tariffs, inflation, labor shortages, and higher financing costs, small business owners in the US are maintaining a cautious optimism about the economy. Recent surveys indicate that many small businesses report business growth and have maintained or grown their workforce, with some increasing wages. However, optimism is tempered by a weakening outlook on future economic growth and concerns about the financial health of their businesses. While few are jumping for joy, even fewer are abandoning their businesses, indicating a resilience in the face of economic uncertainty. This article is not intended as investment advice.</p>
