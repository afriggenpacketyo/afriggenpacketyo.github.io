          <p>A daring daylight robbery at the Louvre, where thieves stole jewels valued at over $100 million, has unexpectedly become a viral internet phenomenon. While French authorities continue their investigation, the heist has captured the public's imagination, leading to a wave of memes, Halloween costumes, and cheeky advertisements from brands like IKEA. The crime's cinematic quality has drawn comparisons to the "Ocean's" film franchise, with even actor George Clooney joking about the thieves' success. This cultural response has turned a serious criminal act into a source of widespread online entertainment and fascination.</p>

          <p>In a recent interview with the BBC, former Vice President Kamala Harris indicated that she is considering another run for the presidency, stating, "I am not done." While promoting her new book, Harris reflected on her 2024 campaign loss to Donald Trump, whose presidency she described as authoritarian. She did not commit to a 2028 run but left the possibility open, saying she still sees a future for herself in public service. However, a recent poll in her home state of California showed that fewer than a third of voters endorsed her for another presidential attempt.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>The popular investment strategy of passively buying S&P 500 index funds, known as "VOO and chill," may be losing its appeal due to a lack of diversification. Financial experts note that with the technology sector now comprising a record 35% of the index, investors are increasingly looking elsewhere for broader market exposure. This has led to renewed interest in small-cap stocks, with the Russell 2000 index recently hitting an all-time high. The trend suggests a shift away from relying solely on large-cap benchmarks to build a well-rounded portfolio. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>Billionaire investor Mark Cuban has shared unconventional financial advice, suggesting that practical saving habits can be more beneficial for the average person than trying to pick winning stocks. He argues that buying household consumables like toilet paper and toothpaste in bulk can result in significant annual savings, representing a guaranteed return on investment. Cuban emphasizes that this strategy is particularly effective when purchases are made with cash, not credit, as he warns against the pitfalls of credit card debt, which can quickly negate any savings achieved.

          <p>A year after the largest dam removal project in U.S. history, the Klamath River is showing remarkable signs of ecological recovery, with salmon returning to headwaters for the first time in a century. To mark the milestone, a group of Indigenous teenagers completed a 310-mile kayak journey down the newly freed river, a feat not possible for over 100 years. This event not only symbolized a new beginning for the local tribes and the ecosystem but also inspired Indigenous-led river restoration movements from around the world who gathered to witness the finish.</p>

          <p>U.S. stock markets surged to record highs, with the S&P 500 and Nasdaq posting gains of 2% and 2.3% for the week, respectively.

This positive economic data, combined with a strong corporate earnings season where 87% of reporting companies beat expectations, overshadowed ongoing political drama related to trade and the government shutdown.

Beyond its presidential connection, the house is renowned for its storied past and numerous reports of paranormal activity, including unexplained sounds and ghostly apparitions, which have contributed to its reputation as one of the city's most haunted locations.</p>

It was later determined that the flight attendants were simply trying to get the pilots' attention, and the incident was resolved without any injuries.</p>

          <p>Researchers at China's Northwestern Polytechnical University have developed a bionic robot designed to look and move like a jellyfish for underwater surveillance. Nicknamed the "underwater phantom," the drone is made of a transparent hydrogel material, making it difficult to detect, and it operates with low power and near-silent propulsion. Its lifelike design makes it suitable for a range of applications, including covert monitoring, observing fragile marine ecosystems without disturbance, and conducting precise inspections of underwater infrastructure.</p>
