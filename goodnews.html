        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>This article explains the current monthly cost of a $75,000 Home Equity Line of Credit (HELOC), noting that recent interest rate cuts have made this form of borrowing more affordable. It compares current payment estimates for 10- and 15-year terms to costs from earlier in 2025 and the summer of 2024, highlighting the savings for homeowners. The piece suggests that with the Federal Reserve expected to continue cutting rates, the variable nature of a HELOC could lead to even lower payments in the future without the need for refinancing.

          <p>Shares of Canadian minerals explorer Trilogy Metals soared over 250% in premarket trading following a White House announcement of a partnership that includes a $35.6 million investment, making the U.S. government a 10% shareholder. This move is part of a broader U.S. strategy to secure domestic supply chains for critical minerals like copper and cobalt by developing the Ambler mining district in Alaska. The decision reverses a previous rejection of the Ambler Road project, signaling a renewed federal commitment to resource development despite environmental concerns. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>Arsenal has rewarded goalkeeper David Raya with an improved contract, reflecting his key role in the team under manager Mikel Arteta. While the length of his contract, which expires in 2028 with an option to extend, remains unchanged, the new terms provide the Spanish international with a significant pay increase. This agreement, reportedly struck earlier in the summer but not officially announced by the club, solidifies his status as a valued player for the foreseeable future and signals the club's confidence in his abilities.</p>

          <p>In a humorous critique, a columnist expresses frustration with the party invitation app Partiful, describing its Y2K-inspired design as a "purple mess" and its features as annoying. The author laments the fragmentation of social media functions that were once centralized on platforms like Facebook, pointing out Partiful's passive-aggressive prompts to commit to events. As a solution to the digital clutter and social pressure, the writer ironically suggests a return to handwritten invitations, arguing the sheer effort involved would mercifully reduce the number of parties being thrown.</p>

          <p>Electric vehicle maker Rivian is preparing for its next phase with the smaller, more affordable R2 SUV and R3 hatchback, aiming to broaden its market beyond its premium R1T truck and R1S SUV. The company's chief design officer, Jeff Hammoud, explained that the new models were designed through "subtraction" to maintain the brand's ethos while reducing costs. This expansion comes as Rivian navigates financial challenges, with the company breaking ground on a new $5 billion factory in Georgia to scale up production for these next-generation vehicles.</p>

          <p>Michaela Del Barrio, a 37-year-old mother with a family history of breast cancer, shares her story of receiving an early-stage diagnosis after persistently requesting early screening. Despite having no symptoms, a breast MRI revealed two suspicious masses, leading to a diagnosis of invasive ductal carcinoma. Her experience highlights the importance of self-advocacy and understanding personal risk factors, as early detection significantly improves survival rates for the most common type of breast cancer. Del Barrio is now undergoing long-term therapy to reduce the risk of recurrence.</p>

          <p>A new study in Uganda has found that treating baby wraps with permethrin insecticide, a method inspired by U.S. military uniforms, can dramatically reduce malaria infections in young children. The randomized controlled trial showed a 65% reduction in malaria cases among babies carried in the treated wraps compared to a control group. This simple, low-cost intervention offers a promising new tool to protect children under five, who are most vulnerable to the disease, especially during daytime hours when bed nets are ineffective, representing a major public health breakthrough.</p>

          <p>For the first time in history, renewable energy sources became the world's leading source of electricity in the first half of this year, according to a report from the energy think tank Ember. The rapid growth in solar and wind power met 100% of the new global electricity demand, even causing a slight decrease in fossil fuel use. However, the report notes a global divide, with developing nations like China leading the clean energy transition, while developed countries, including the U.S. and EU, increased their reliance on fossil fuels during the same period.</p>

She attributed the lower presence of corporate lobbyists to the party being in opposition, claiming the conference is now more focused on grassroots members who are "thrilled" with recent policy announcements and party direction.</p>
