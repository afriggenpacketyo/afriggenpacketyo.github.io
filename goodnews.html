          <p>Following an $8-billion takeover, new Paramount chief David Ellison and his leadership team have detailed their plan to rebuild the media company. The strategy involves significantly increasing film production from eight to eventually 20 movies per year, with a strong focus on major intellectual property like "Top Gun," "Star Trek," and "Yellowstone." Ellison emphasized a goal to move the company away from political divisions to appeal to a broader audience and restore Paramount as a top destination for talent. The new leadership has also committed to finding $2 billion in cost savings, signaling future restructuring and layoffs.</p>

          <p>Alaska's capital, Juneau, avoided a catastrophic flooding event after a glacial outburst from the nearby Mendenhall Glacier sent record-breaking floodwaters down the Mendenhall River. The river crested at an unprecedented 16.65 feet, but newly installed temporary barriers, known as Hesco barriers, largely held and protected hundreds of homes that had been damaged in previous years. The flooding is an annual event caused by the release of water from Suicide Basin, a phenomenon exacerbated by climate change. Officials reported minimal damage this year, crediting the effectiveness of the new infrastructure and the timely evacuation of residents.</p>

          <p>Brazilian President Luiz Inácio Lula da Silva has announced a substantial economic plan to support the country's exporters, who have been impacted by new U.S. tariffs of up to 50%. The package includes 20 billion reais ($5.5 billion) in credit, tax deferrals for affected businesses, and incentives for local production. President Trump justified the high tariffs by citing the legal situation of his ally, former president Jair Bolsonaro, a reason Lula dismissed as non-existent. While refraining from retaliatory tariffs, Lula emphasized Brazil's commitment to negotiation but insisted that its national sovereignty is "untouchable." (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>A Texas state judge has ordered that the assets of Infowars and its parent company be turned over to a court-appointed receiver for liquidation. This action will force the sale of company property, including the brand name itself, to begin paying the $1.3 billion defamation judgment owed to the families of Sandy Hook victims. The families' lawyers expressed satisfaction with the ruling, stating it will finally bring accountability for Alex Jones's harassment. The decision shifts the case out of federal bankruptcy court, potentially clearing the way for a sale to the satirical site The Onion, which has vowed to buy and parody Infowars.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>A comprehensive study based on over 148,000 people in Sweden suggests that medication for ADHD provides benefits beyond managing core symptoms. The research, published in the British Medical Journal, found that drug treatment was associated with significant reductions in the risk of substance misuse, suicidal behavior, transport accidents, and criminal behavior. Researchers believe this is because the medication helps reduce impulsivity and improve concentration, which are linked to these negative outcomes. The findings provide new evidence on the wider potential benefits of treatment, which could help patients make more informed decisions about starting medication.</p>

          <p>In response to U.S. tariffs targeting China's shipbuilding industry, South Korean firms are increasing their investments in Southeast Asia to maintain a competitive edge. HD Hyundai, a major Korean conglomerate, plans to invest $550 million to revive a defunct shipyard in the Philippines, aiming to hire 7,000 workers and build up to ten vessels annually. Analysts suggest this move allows Korean companies to overcome domestic constraints like high labor costs and union tensions. By shifting operations to countries with lower costs, they can strengthen their market position against Chinese competitors. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>Tottenham Hotspur lost the UEFA Super Cup to Paris St-Germain in a penalty shootout after a dramatic late collapse, but the performance showed promising signs under new manager Thomas Frank. For 85 minutes, Spurs led 2-0, effectively executing a pragmatic, counter-attacking game plan that neutralized the European champions, with both goals coming from set-pieces. While the team's inability to close out the game highlighted areas for improvement, the disciplined 3-5-2 formation and tactical flexibility were seen as a positive departure from the previous season's approach. The result was a blow, but the overall performance offered a basis for optimism.</p>

The author, an independent journalist on social media, notes that while millions seek factual information online, they struggle to distinguish it from a flood of misinformation. The piece suggests that the current media landscape is in an "awkward adolescence," similar to the music industry after streaming emerged. Proposed solutions include an independent certification system for creators who adhere to journalistic standards and shared-ownership models to provide resources like legal protection and marketing.</p>

          <p>Brinker International's CEO, Kevin Hochman, reported that the Chili's restaurant chain has seen significant growth, with same-store sales increasing by nearly 24%. He attributed this success to a major boost in the company's marketing budget, which grew from $32 million to $137 million, and the standardization of its $10.99 value meal across the country. Hochman highlighted that giving social media influencers creative freedom has been effective in generating buzz, both paid and organic. This growth-focused strategy is helping the company combat inflationary pressures on labor and goods by increasing leverage on fixed costs. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>With the upcoming summit between President Trump and Russian President Putin set to take place in Alaska, this article revisits the history of how the territory was sold by Russia to the United States in 1867. The brief historical overview explores the context of the sale, which was orchestrated by U.S. Secretary of State William Seward. It also touches upon the lingering sentiment among some in modern Russia who still question the legitimacy of the transaction and view Alaska as historically Russian land. The piece provides relevant background as the two leaders prepare to meet on what was once Russian soil.</p>
