          <p>Dame Patricia Routledge, the celebrated British actress best known for her iconic role as the snobbish Hyacinth Bucket in the BBC sitcom "Keeping Up Appearances," has passed away at the age of 96. Her career spanned over seven decades, earning her prestigious awards on both stage and screen, including a Tony for her Broadway performance and an Olivier Award in London. Beyond her famous comedic roles, she was highly regarded for her dramatic work, including performances in Alan Bennett's "Talking Heads" monologues, and was honored by the nation for her significant contributions to entertainment.</p>

          <p>The Church of England has named Dame Sarah Mullally as the next Archbishop of Canterbury, making her the first woman to hold the principal leadership role in its nearly 500-year history. A former chief nursing officer for the NHS, Mullally became the Bishop of London in 2018 and will now succeed Justin Welby, who resigned amidst a safeguarding scandal. Her appointment is a landmark moment for the Church, which first ordained female priests in 1994, though it has drawn criticism from conservative Anglican factions. She will face significant challenges, including rebuilding trust after abuse scandals and navigating divisions over issues like same-sex marriage.</p>

          <p>After nearly 34 years, a major breakthrough has been made in the infamous 1991 Austin yogurt shop murders, where four teenage girls were killed. Law enforcement announced that new DNA and ballistics technology has linked the crime to Robert Eugene Brashers, a serial killer who died by suicide in 1999. This development brings potential closure to the victims' families and is expected to fully exonerate two men who were wrongly convicted after coerced confessions and spent years in prison. The advancement highlights the power of modern forensic science in resolving decades-old cold cases and identifying previously unknown perpetrators of heinous crimes.</p>

          <p>According to Brendan Wallace, CEO of venture capital firm Fifth Wall, the property technology sector is emerging from a challenging three-year "winter," with recent IPOs and new unicorns signaling a recovery. However, he warns that the climate-related subsector of property tech is struggling due to a negative political shift away from sustainability and ESG initiatives in the U.S. Despite this, Wallace remains optimistic about the long-term prospects for climate tech in real estate, citing the financial needs of local governments that may turn to carbon taxes. Fifth Wall continues to invest in the space, taking advantage of lower valuations during the current downturn.</p>

          <h2>Vinyl Records Exempt from New US Tariffs Due to Cold War-Era Law</h2>
          <div class="timestamp">2025-10-03 07:55:22 EDT</div>
        </div>
        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Physical music formats like vinyl records, CDs, and cassettes have been spared from the Trump administration's recent rollback of the "de minimis" import exemption, which now applies tariffs to many packages valued under $800. This protection stems from the Berman Amendment, a Cold War-era law that prevents the regulation of "informational materials." The exemption is a significant relief for the booming vinyl industry, which has seen explosive growth driven by artists like Taylor Swift and a younger generation of collectors. While consumers and major labels benefit, some U.S.-based record manufacturers argue that applying tariffs would have supported domestic production and jobs.</p>

          <h2>Financial Advisor Dave Ramsey Outlines Retirement Savings Strategy for Late Starters</h2>

          <p>Financial personality Dave Ramsey advised a 51-year-old Arkansas mother with no retirement savings that she could still accumulate a nest egg of $600,000 to $800,000 by age 70. His strategy involves consistently investing 15% of her income, which includes earnings from a second job, and taking full advantage of her employer's 401(k) match. This advice comes as many Americans express low confidence in their retirement savings, with median account balances falling far short of what is needed for a comfortable retirement. The guidance emphasizes disciplined, process-driven investing and leveraging catch-up contributions to build wealth later in life. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>England manager Thomas Tuchel has stated he has "no problem" with Jude Bellingham, Phil Foden, or Jack Grealish, despite leaving the prominent players out of the squad for upcoming matches against Wales and Latvia. Tuchel explained the decision was made to maintain the cohesion of the group that achieved a decisive 5-0 victory over Serbia in their last outing. He acknowledged that Bellingham, who is returning from injury, wanted to be included but noted the midfielder has not yet regained his full rhythm at Real Madrid. The manager stressed that the omission was tactical and not personal, aiming to reward the previous squad's performance.</p>

          <p>China's extended "super golden week" holiday has started with a surge in domestic travel, signaling a positive boost for the country's tourism sector and consumer spending. On the first day of the holiday, the national railway system handled a record number of passengers, with major hubs like Guangzhou South Station reporting their busiest day ever. Other forms of transportation, including air and waterway travel, also saw year-on-year increases. This strong start is a welcome sign for Beijing, which has been implementing measures to stimulate domestic consumption and support its economic recovery.</p>

          <p>OnePay, the financial technology firm majority-owned by retail giant Walmart, is set to integrate cryptocurrency trading and custody services into its mobile banking application later this year. According to sources, the platform will initially offer access to Bitcoin and Ether through a partnership with the startup Zerohash. This move positions OnePay to compete with other major financial apps like PayPal and Cash App, which already offer crypto services. By adding digital assets, OnePay continues its strategy of building a financial "super app" and leveraging its vast distribution network through Walmart's 150 million weekly U.S. shoppers.</p>

          <p>Aston Martin's Fernando Alonso surprisingly set the fastest time during the first practice session for the Singapore Grand Prix, outpacing Ferrari's Charles Leclerc and Red Bull's Max Verstappen. Alonso finished 0.150 seconds ahead of Leclerc, with championship contenders Oscar Piastri and Lando Norris of McLaren finishing fifth and sixth, respectively. While Aston Martin is not expected to be a top contender for pole position, the result is encouraging for the team on a low-speed track that suits their car's high-downforce design. Alonso's performance was likely aided by a lower fuel load or a higher engine mode compared to his main rivals.</p>

          <p>In what is being called one of the largest single confiscations of the endangered species, eleven cheetah cubs have been rescued from illegal traffickers off the coast of Somaliland. The cubs were discovered packed in sacks on a small boat, likely destined for the exotic pet market in Gulf countries. The Cheetah Conservation Fund (CCF), which is now caring for the surviving animals, reports the cubs were severely malnourished, and two have since died despite intensive care. The rescue highlights Somaliland's role as a major transit hub for the illegal wildlife trade, which conservationists warn is driving cheetahs toward extinction.</p>
