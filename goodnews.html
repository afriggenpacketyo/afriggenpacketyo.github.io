        </div>
        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>A U.S. Court of Appeals panel has largely upheld a lower court's ruling that restricts federal immigration agents from conducting "roving" raids in the Los Angeles area based on factors like race or language. The ruling affirms that agents must have reasonable suspicion before detaining individuals and cannot base arrests solely on ethnicity, speaking Spanish, or being in a particular location. This decision is a setback for the Trump administration's aggressive immigration enforcement tactics, which critics argued led to unconstitutional racial profiling. The court found that such broad factors do not meet the Fourth Amendment's protection against unreasonable seizures.</p>

          <p>Seven-time world champion Lewis Hamilton described his own performance as "useless" after a disappointing qualifying session for the Hungarian Grand Prix, where he secured 12th place. In contrast, his Ferrari teammate Charles Leclerc captured a surprise pole position, the team's first of the season. Hamilton expressed frustration with his driving, stating it had "nothing to do with the car," and congratulated Leclerc on his achievement. Leclerc's pole was unexpected, as he credited a sudden change in wind conditions and recent car upgrades for the improved performance, which allowed him to outperform the dominant McLaren drivers.</p>

Despite being down 9-0 early and later 15-6, the Rockies mounted a sustained offensive effort throughout the game. The comeback culminated in a dramatic ninth inning, where a two-run walk-off home run by Brenton Doyle sealed the win. According to Elias Sports Bureau, this victory marks one of the few times in modern MLB history a team has won after allowing nine or more runs in the opening frame.</p>

          <p>Ukraine's independent anti-corruption bodies, NABU and SAPO, have exposed a significant corruption scheme involving the procurement of military drones and jamming systems at inflated prices. The announcement came just two days after the agencies' independence was restored by parliament following public protests. According to investigators, a sitting lawmaker, officials, and national guard personnel were involved in taking kickbacks of up to 30% on state contracts. President Volodymyr Zelenskiy, who had initially sought to curb the agencies' power, praised the investigation and reaffirmed his commitment to a zero-tolerance policy on corruption.</p>

          <p>Organizations like Black People Will Swim are working to combat the historical legacy of segregation that has led to significant disparities in swimming ability among Black Americans. Due to decades of exclusion from public pools, research shows Black children are far more likely to have little or no swimming ability and face a higher risk of drowning. Non-profits are providing accessible lessons and "swimmerships" to break down barriers and create a new generation of swimmers, instructors, and lifeguards. Participants and organizers emphasize that learning to swim is a vital life skill and a public health necessity.</p>

          <p>Florida has surpassed California in adding new utility-scale solar capacity, a shift driven primarily by large power companies rather than rooftop installations. Utilities like Florida Power & Light are leveraging the state's favorable economics for solar, as it is often cheaper than natural gas, and a streamlined permitting process for projects under 75 megawatts. However, the industry's future momentum faces challenges from the federal rollback of solar tax credits, which is expected to decrease rooftop installations by 42% in the coming years, and growing constraints on the state's power grid.

Australia, under coach Joe Schmidt, showed significant improvement throughout the series after a slow start in the first match.

          <p>A recent study indicates that tailoring fitness routines to individual personality traits may help people enjoy their workouts more and stick with them longer. Published in Frontiers in Psychology, the research found connections between the "Big Five" personality traits and exercise preferences. For instance, extroverts tended to enjoy high-intensity group activities like HIIT or team sports, while conscientious individuals preferred goal-oriented training like preparing for a marathon. The findings suggest that instead of forcing a particular regimen, individuals may find more success by exploring different activities that better suit their natural inclinations.</p>

          <p>The late Malcolm-Jamal Warner, who passed away at 54, is being remembered for his skillful and complex portrayal of Theo Huxtable on "The Cosby Show." Throughout the series, Warner balanced Theo's teenage hubris and apparent apathy with a deep-seated vulnerability, preventing the character from becoming a simple punch line. His character's journey, from a high schooler with poor grades to a college graduate, was central to the show's narrative. Warner's performance was pivotal in exploring themes of parental expectation and self-discovery, particularly after Theo's dyslexia diagnosis reframed his struggles and allowed him to find his purpose.</p>

          <p>In his new HBO Max special, "Panicked," comedian Marc Maron continues to blend his signature cantankerous and ruminative style to tackle both catastrophic current events and personal anxieties. The article describes the special as part of a loose trilogy where Maron confronts everything from climate change and political decline to his father's dementia and his own childhood trauma. Rather than seeking simple entertainment, Maron uses comedy as a vehicle for recursive self-reflection and emotional excavation. His style remains consistent, offering a raw and unflinching look at a world that provides little solid footing.</p>
