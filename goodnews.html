          <p>A Chinese study of dinosaur feathers trapped in Burmese amber has revealed insights into the evolution of flight feathers, which played a crucial role in birds surpassing dinosaurs in conquering the sky. The study, which examined feathers dating back 99 million years, focused on the development of feathers that generate thrust and lift. While modern birds are descendants of dinosaurs, most feathered dinosaurs lacked the ability to fly. The research highlights the significance of feather evolution in the transition from dinosaurs to birds.</p>

          <p>UK scientists have discovered that the first bacteria our bodies encounter after birth can protect against dangerous infections. The research indicates that good bacteria can halve the risk of young children being admitted to the hospital with lung infections. Researchers at University College London and the Sanger Institute collected stool samples from newborns and tracked their health for two years. The study found that Bifidobacterium longum, an early inhabitant of the human body, appeared to have a protective effect, with only 4% of babies with this species needing hospitalization for lung infections.</p>

          <p>A judge has sided with environmental groups challenging an offshore oil operation along Santa Barbara County's coastline, granting a temporary restraining order against Sable Offshore Corp. The order halts restart efforts on the operation's onshore pipeline system, which suffered a major rupture and spill in 2015. The fire marshal regulates oil and gas pipelines across the state and must approve the pipelines' full restart, which is key to the company's commercial success. Sable officials said the decision would force them to push back their restart timeline to August 1, 2025.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Health and Human Services Secretary Robert F. Kennedy Jr. has requested that the FDA Commissioner review the latest data on mifepristone, commonly known as the abortion pill. The FDA has confirmed the plans for the review but has not provided details on the scope or timeline. The review comes amid concerns about the drug's safety, fueled by a report from the Ethics and Public Policy Center, which lacks medical training. Mifepristone, taken with misoprostol, was approved by the FDA in 2000 and has undergone periodic reviews since then. </p>

          <p>Women using weight-loss jabs are being advised to stop if they are trying for a baby, have fallen pregnant, or are breastfeeding. Drug safety experts in the UK say it is not known whether taking medicines like Wegovy and Mounjaro could harm an unborn baby. The advice already appears in patient information leaflets, but there are concerns that the growing popularity of 'skinny jabs' means many women are not using the drugs safely or getting the right advice. The UK drugs regulator, as well as doctors and pharmacists, are worried that popular GLP-1 medicines, known as Wegovy, Mounjaro, Saxenda, Victoza and Ozempic, are not being used safely.</p>

          <p>The Japanese government is planning to tighten measures against unpaid medical bills left by foreign tourists who receive treatment during their stay. The measure, to be included in an upcoming annual basic policy on economic and fiscal management, is expected to state that the government will review insurance coverage for foreigners. This move aims to address the issue of increasing unpaid medical expenses incurred by tourists. The government's decision reflects a growing concern over the financial burden placed on the healthcare system.</p>
