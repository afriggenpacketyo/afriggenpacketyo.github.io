          <p>Chess is experiencing a global resurgence, and India is at the forefront of this boom, boasting 85 grandmasters and some of the world's youngest top-ranked players. Chennai, Tamil Nadu, has become the epicenter of Indian chess, driven by a grassroots teaching system where schools and local businesses support promising players. Parents play a crucial role, encouraging their children's chess pursuits, sometimes at the expense of traditional academics. YouTube channels like the Tamil Chess Channel are expanding access to chess education, aiming to make India a chess powerhouse by nurturing talent at all levels. The popularity of chess has increased so much that players can now make a living from it, especially in a country with limited job opportunities. Optimism is high for India's continued success in the chess world.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>An opinion piece in The Guardian discusses the phenomenon of "anticipatory compliance" with Donald Trump's policies and argues for a strategy of "anticipatory noncompliance." The author cites examples of universities, law firms, and corporations preemptively censoring themselves or altering their behavior to avoid Trump's ire. The article contends that this compliance paves the way for autocracy and calls for active resistance to unconstitutional actions. Examples of anticipatory noncompliance are provided, such as universities pushing back against demands and states challenging the administration's reading of civil rights law. The piece suggests that restoring democracy requires a multifaceted approach, including demonstrations, boycotts, litigation, and political organizing.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>A network of women in Latin America transformed safe abortion practices by spreading information about misoprostol, a drug that enables self-managed abortions. Activists shared knowledge about the drug at feminist gatherings, leading to the establishment of abortion hotlines and accompaniment networks. These networks provided information and support to women seeking abortions, often in countries where it was illegal. The work of these activists contributed to the legalization of abortion in Argentina, Colombia, and Mexico. The networks continue to provide support even in countries where abortion is legal, offering a warm, friendly, and committed approach that complements medical care.</p>

          <p>Scotland's national football team has called up free agent Ross Doohan and Bournemouth's 18-year-old Callan McKenna to address a goalkeeping crisis ahead of their friendly match in Liechtenstein. Angus Gunn and Robby McCrorie had to leave the squad following a defeat by Iceland, and Cieran Slicker suffered a difficult debut after replacing the injured Gunn. Head coach Steve Clarke had previously expressed concern about the team's lack of options in the goalkeeping position. With Craig Gordon, Zander Clark, and Liam Kelly already missing due to injury, the team has been forced to turn to Doohan and McKenna to fill the void. The team hopes that the new players will be able to step up and provide stability in goal.</p>
