        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Comedian Jim Gaffigan offers a humorous commentary on his annual gardening cycle, detailing his ambitious plans in May that consistently lead to an overwhelming cucumber surplus by August. He explains how techniques like "succession planting," intended to ensure a steady harvest, instead result in a dramatic overabundance that leaves him desperately trying to give away cucumbers. Through his self-deprecating narrative, Gaffigan touches upon the common experience of amateur gardeners whose enthusiasm often outweighs their practical planning, leading to comical and relatable summertime predicaments. The piece serves as a lighthearted reflection on the misadventures that can arise from a simple hobby.</p>

          <p>Musician John Fogerty reflects on his career and the emotional journey of re-recording his iconic Creedence Clearwater Revival hits for a new album, "Legacy: The Creedence Clearwater Revival Years (John's Version)." The article details the legal battles that followed the band's breakup, which left him without control over his own songs for decades, a struggle he compares to Taylor Swift's recent fight for her music rights. Encouraged by his wife Julie, Fogerty collaborated with his sons, who are part of his touring band, to create new versions of classics like "Proud Mary," finally reclaiming ownership of his musical legacy after years of feeling silenced.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>In an opinion piece, a student recounts the personal decision to decline an admission offer from Yale University in favor of attending a small Bible college. The author explains that the choice was driven by a conviction that elite institutions like Yale have shifted from fostering intellectual rigor to promoting ideological conformity, citing instances of disinvited speakers and faculty disputes. The student argues that the Bible college offers a different, more profound challenge focused on character and spiritual formation rather than prestige and networking. This path, while closing doors to elite circles, has opened doors to authentic intellectual freedom and personal growth.</p>

          <p>Dr. Sanjay Gupta delves into the complex nature of chronic pain, highlighting that its source often lies in the brain rather than the site of an old injury. The article features the story of Ed Mowery, who suffered from a rare and excruciating condition until he participated in a clinical trial for deep brain stimulation. This experimental treatment successfully mapped his brain's pain signals and used targeted electrical impulses to interrupt them before he could consciously feel them. This breakthrough illustrates a new frontier in pain management, suggesting that future treatments could target the brain's neural circuitry to provide relief for millions.</p>

          <p>Susan Zirinsky honors the life and career of veteran CBS News correspondent Mark Knoller, who recently passed away after 32 years with the network. Knoller was renowned in Washington as the unofficial record-keeper of presidential statistics, meticulously logging every trip, speech, and public comment of the presidents he covered, from Bill Clinton to Barack Obama. Respected by colleagues and presidents from both parties, he was considered the ultimate authority on presidential trivia, with even the White House staff often consulting him for data.

          <p>Renowned figurative artist Alex Katz, now 98, is shifting his focus to championing the work of other artists by gifting a collection of over one hundred paintings to the Portland Museum of Art in Maine. The exhibition, titled "Painting Energy," features pieces by emerging and established artists that Katz selected for their dynamic and powerful presence. Having faced rejection early in his own career for defying the abstract and pop art trends, Katz says he wants to support others who have experienced similar difficulties. Still painting daily, Katz emphasizes the importance of taking creative risks and helping the next generation of artists.</p>

          <p>A child psychology expert who has studied over 200 parent-child relationships suggests that long-term cooperation is built on emotional safety and connection, not just immediate obedience. The article outlines six "magic phrases" designed to calm a child's nervous system and make them more receptive, such as "I believe you" to defuse shame and "Let's figure this out together" to prevent power struggles. Other phrases like "I'm on your side" and "I've got you, no matter what" shift the dynamic from adversarial to supportive. The expert emphasizes that these phrases are most effective within a broader parenting pattern of respect and consistent boundaries.</p>

          <p>The United Kingdom and Norway have finalized a £10 billion agreement for the UK to supply the Norwegian navy with at least five new Type 26 frigates. Described by the Ministry of Defence as the UK's largest-ever warship export deal by value, the project is expected to support 4,000 jobs, primarily at BAE Systems' shipyards in Glasgow. This strategic partnership will create a combined fleet of 13 advanced anti-submarine frigates operating in Northern Europe, significantly bolstering NATO's northern flank. The deal represents a major victory for the British defense industry over international competitors and strengthens defense cooperation between the two nations.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>The rise of artificial intelligence is raising concerns about its effect on the job market, particularly for recent graduates seeking entry-level positions. While job postings are down, economists suggest this is part of a broader market correction after post-pandemic over-hiring, not solely due to AI. The article identifies roles that are more susceptible to AI automation, such as coding, copywriting, and customer service, which often serve as entry points for young workers. However, it also highlights fields requiring empathy, physicality, and creative thinking—like healthcare, teaching, and skilled trades—that are less likely to be replaced, suggesting a shift in necessary skills rather than a total job apocalypse.</p>

          <p>In a personal essay, a liberal-leaning writer who took up hunting in Montana challenges the reflexive disdain for the practice often found on the political left. The author argues that hunting for food is a more honest and sustainable way to consume meat compared to industrial factory farming, forcing a direct confrontation with the reality of life and death. The piece also highlights the crucial role hunters play in wildlife conservation through taxes on firearms and ammunition, as well as their deep understanding of local ecosystems. The author contends that hunters and vegetarians share common ground in their concern for ethical food sourcing and animal welfare.</p>

          <p>A new museum exhibition in Santa Cruz, California, sheds light on the origins of surfing in the mainland United States, crediting three teenage Hawaiian princes with introducing the sport in 1885. The royal brothers, sent to a nearby military school to receive a modern education, fashioned surfboards from local redwood and demonstrated their native sport of "surfboard swimming" to amazed locals. This historical event, documented in a local newspaper at the time, planted the seed for a culture that would eventually grow into a major coastal phenomenon. The exhibition aims to recognize the crucial role of these Hawaiian royals in the history of American surfing.</p>

          <p>The Australian state of South Australia is banning single-use, fish-shaped soy sauce containers as part of its ongoing effort to reduce plastic pollution. The small, iconic packets, common in sushi takeaways, are made of recyclable plastic but are often too small to be processed by recycling machinery, leading them to end up in the environment for centuries. The ban is the latest step in legislation that has already phased out plastic straws, bags, and stirrers. While consumers can still get soy sauce from larger bottles or sachets, the move aims to protect marine life and cut carbon emissions.</p>

        </div>
        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>An opinion piece explores the moral dilemma of feeling personal happiness while being aware of widespread suffering and political turmoil in the world. The author references ancient philosophical and religious traditions that view humanity as a single body, where if one part suffers, all suffer. However, these same traditions also suggest that if one part is honored, all should rejoice. The essay argues against becoming fixated on either despair or forced positivity, advocating instead for embracing the full spectrum of human emotion. Acknowledging both the world's horrors and its joys is presented not as an act of ignorance, but as a form of resistance and self-preservation.</p>

          <p>The Internal Revenue Service has clarified that consumers can still qualify for the federal electric vehicle tax credit of up to $7,500 even if they take possession of the car after the September 30 deadline. According to new IRS guidance, a taxpayer is eligible for the credit as long as they have a "written binding contract in place" and make a payment, such as a deposit or trade-in, on or before September 30. This provides a crucial loophole for buyers who may face delivery delays, allowing them to lock in the credit before it is eliminated by a new tax law.</p>
