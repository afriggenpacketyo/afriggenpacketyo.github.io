          <p>Hainan, a duty-free island off China's southern coast, is positioning itself as a major shopping destination amid the intensifying trade war with the United States. The island plans to launch its own separate customs regime, avoiding the high retaliatory tariffs Beijing has placed on American imports. The hope is that the promise of cheaper US goods, such as iPhones and cosmetics, will drive a surge in visitors to Hainan's duty-free stores, which have struggled due to sluggish domestic consumption and a recovery in overseas tourism.</p>

          <p>Taylor Swift's representative has denied the singer had any involvement in creative decisions on ‚ÄúIt Ends With Us,‚Äù the movie starring her friend, Blake Lively, that has been at the center of a legal battle. Swift was reportedly subpoenaed in the lawsuit between Justin Baldoni and Blake Lively, with Baldoni's team alleging Lively made changes to the script under pressure from Swift and Ryan Reynolds. Swift's spokesperson stated that her only involvement was licensing her song ‚ÄúMy Tears Ricochet‚Äù for the film's trailer and a scene, dismissing the subpoena as a tabloid clickbait tactic.</p>

          <p>Pharmaceutical companies have agreed to pay Hawaii $700 million to settle its lawsuit over the efficacy and safety of the blood thinner Plavix. A court ruling last year ordered Bristol Myers Squibb Company and three U.S.-based subsidiaries of French pharmaceutical company Sanofi to pay a combined $916 million. Judge James Ashford found that about 30% of patients, particularly non-Caucasians, might have a "diminished response" to Plavix but the companies did not update their labels, though neither company has admitted wrongdoing.</p>

          <p>Rumeysa Ozturk, a Turkish doctoral candidate at Tufts University, was released from immigration custody after a judge ruled her continued detention could not stand. Judge William Sessions cited concerns that her First Amendment and due process rights were violated when she was detained following the Trump administration's revocation of her student visa. Ozturk was arrested for co-authoring an opinion piece about Israel's war with Hamas, with the judge noting there was no evidence she engaged in violence or advocated violence. The university is pleased with her release and looks forward to welcoming her back to campus.</p>

          <p>In Bristol, police are targeting kerb crawlers rather than street sex workers to combat night-time exploitation, focusing on criminalizing the men rather than the women. The Op Boss and Night Light police teams engage with street sex workers while disrupting those buying sexual services. The National Police Chiefs' Council recommends not criminalizing the women, who are often vulnerable, and instead targeting the men. The Night Light team collaborates with the police, children's charity Barnardo's, and the city council to offer support and gather intelligence from the street workers about any young people at risk.</p>

The bill prohibits entities and individuals affiliated with governments designated as national security threats from buying real estate if it poses risks to public health or safety. The law empowers the state's attorney general to investigate, block, and reverse such land deals through court-ordered receivership. The bill includes exemptions for U.S. citizens, lawful permanent residents, and property intended as a personal homestead.</p>

          <p>Hollywood studios are increasingly shifting productions to the UK due to generous tax incentives, lower labor costs, and centralized national funding for film.

The high school student has drawn comparisons to junior champion Rio Nakata from judges and coaches inside Japan. During an event in mid-April in his native Yokohama, Nishino landed a quad toe loop for the first time in a competition, albeit slightly under-rotating. Having begun skating at 5, following in the footsteps of his elder sister, Nishino became the junior high national champion in his second year.</p>
