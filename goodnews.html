          <p>AI infrastructure company CoreWeave announced plans to sell $1.5 billion in bonds due in 2031, causing its stock to climb. The capital raised will be used for general corporate purposes, including paying down existing debt. This follows a previous successful debt offering and a major data center project announcement, reflecting strong investor confidence despite some concerns about the company's debt levels. CoreWeave, a key partner for Nvidia and Microsoft, has seen its share price more than triple since its public debut. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>The All England Club's plans to nearly triple the size of the Wimbledon tennis site can move forward after a High Court judge dismissed a legal challenge from a local campaign group. The Save Wimbledon Park group had argued the development on a former golf club was unlawful due to protective restrictions on the heritage land. The expansion includes thirty-eight new courts, an 8,000-seat stadium, and public parkland access, which will allow the club to host its qualifying tournament on-site.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Following several high-profile incidents, this article details the ongoing challenge airports face in preventing bird strikes, which cost U.S. airlines an estimated $461 million in 2023. At airports like Boston's Logan, wildlife management teams use pyrotechnics, air cannons, and habitat modification to deter birds from flight paths, with lethal measures as a last resort. The problem is complex, as even positive environmental changes, like cleaner harbors, can attract more wildlife, creating a perpetual and evolving risk that requires constant mitigation efforts.</p>

          <p>This opinion article challenges the Silicon Valley belief that the creation of artificial general intelligence (AGI) is inevitable. The author argues that technology is a product of deliberate human choices and that history provides numerous examples of humanity restraining or regulating powerful technologies, such as recombinant DNA and human cloning. Citing the immense risks of AGI, including potential human extinction, the article calls for a civilization-scale effort to regulate its development through compute governance and international treaties, rather than succumbing to a deterministic view of technological progress.</p>

          <p>This feature explores the practice of applying sunscreen to animals, from zoo elephants to household pets, to protect them from sunburn and skin cancer. While wild animals have evolved natural protections, those in captivity or domesticated breeds with light-colored skin can be vulnerable to sun damage. Vets often recommend sunscreen for pets like white cats and short-haired dogs, though the process can be challenging.

        </div>
        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>As many high-yield certificates of deposit (CDs) from the past two years reach maturity, financial experts warn savers against common pitfalls. One major mistake is allowing a CD to automatically renew at what may be a significantly lower interest rate without shopping around for better offers. Experts also caution against chasing the highest rate without considering the term length and your own liquidity needs. Instead, they recommend using the maturity date as an opportunity to reassess financial goals and consider alternatives like high-yield savings accounts. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>According to leadership expert Jennifer Schielke, bosses who use excessive flattery to be liked by their employees are making a mistake. She argues that this approach often stems from insecurity and can appear manipulative, whereas genuine leadership involves authentic investment in employees and addressing difficult issues directly. Instead of insincere compliments, leaders can show value by truly listening to employee perspectives and needs. Building a positive culture through genuine interaction and team-building is far more effective than trying to win a popularity contest.</p>

          <p>According to a Reuters poll of economists, Brazil's economy is expected to maintain its growth trajectory despite the threat of significant U.S. tariffs. Analysts forecast GDP growth of 2.2% this year and 1.7% in 2026, supported by a strong domestic labor market. However, the poll also indicates an increased risk of worsening inflation if trade negotiations with the U.S. fail. Most economists believe the August 1 deadline for the threatened 50% tariff will be extended to allow for diplomatic talks. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>This article argues that involving children in household chores is crucial for developing motor skills, responsibility, and confidence, but parents often hinder this process. By prioritizing speed and neatness, parents may take over tasks or micromanage, discouraging a child's natural desire to help and contribute to the family. Researchers suggest that chores serve as "social glue," integrating children and giving them a sense of purpose. The most effective approach is to make chores a collaborative activity and allow children to participate from a young age, even if their initial efforts are imperfect.</p>
