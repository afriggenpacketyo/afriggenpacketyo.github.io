          <h2>US Treasury to Cease Penny Production Amid Rising Costs</h2>
          <div class="timestamp">2025-05-22 11:54:25 EDT</div>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>The U.S. Treasury is set to halt the production of pennies, with the last batch of blanks already ordered, due to the rising cost of minting the coin. This move, prompted by President Trump's efforts to reduce unnecessary spending, is expected to save taxpayers $85 million annually. The Treasury Department estimates that producing a penny now costs 3.69 cents, leading to businesses rounding prices to the nearest nickel. The halt in production will save $56 million in material costs, and the remaining savings will come from facility usage and efficiencies.</p>

          <p>A federal judge has ordered the Trump administration to reinstate over 1,300 U.S. Department of Education employees. This followed a lawsuit filed by 21 states after the administration announced staff cuts that would have significantly reduced the agency's workforce. The judge pointed out that the cuts led to the closure of several offices responsible for enforcing civil rights, including those protecting students from discrimination based on race and disability. Additionally, the entire team overseeing the Free Application for Federal Student Aid (FAFSA) was eliminated.</p>

          <p>Jordon Hudson, Bill Belichick's girlfriend, made light of their 48-year age difference in a social media post, captioning a photo with "Old Bay with my old bae." This playful post comes amid reports that Hudson has told at least one person that she and Belichick are engaged to be married. The couple has faced scrutiny after a recent interview where Hudson prevented Belichick from answering a question about how they met. Hudson has also faced criticism over her reported involvement in North Carolina losing out on the opportunity to be featured on HBO's "Hard Knocks."</p>

        </div>
        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Net migration to the UK nearly halved in 2024, falling to 431,000, according to the Office for National Statistics (ONS). This decline is attributed to a decrease in people coming to work and study, influenced by changes introduced by the previous Conservative government. There was a significant reduction in dependents accompanying those arriving on work and study visas. The previous largest drop occurred during the early stages of the Covid-19 pandemic. The Home Office also reported a decrease in asylum seekers housed in hotels, although the numbers remain higher than when Labour came to power last year.</p>

The ship, NCL Salten, ended up on shore just meters from Johan Helberg's house in a fjord near Trondheim. The homeowner was alerted by a neighbor who had tried to ring the doorbell repeatedly. The ship reportedly caused damage to a heating pipe in Helberg's cabin. The same ship ran aground twice before in 2023 and 2024.</p>
