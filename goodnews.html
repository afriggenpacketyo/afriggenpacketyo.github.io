          <p>The World Bank has cleared Syria's $15.5 million debt after Saudi Arabia and Qatar made payments, making the country eligible for grants to fund reconstruction and economic recovery. This move is seen as a victory for Syria's new government, which is attempting to stabilize the nation after a long civil war. The debt relief comes after the United States lifted sanctions on Syria, and the government has signed an $800-million deal with DP World to develop the port of Tartus. While significant challenges remain, these developments signal growing confidence in Syria's future. Optimism score is 65.</p>
