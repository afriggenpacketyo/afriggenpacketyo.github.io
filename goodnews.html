The investment aims to enhance cooperation in renewable energy, agriculture, fishery, low-carbon infrastructure, and tourism. China will also undertake 100 "small-and-beautiful" projects to improve the capability of Pacific Island nations to tackle climate-related hazards, shifting the focus of the Belt and Road Initiative towards sustainable improvements in people‚Äôs lives.

          <p>Marc Marquez, now a 2025 MotoGP title contender, faced a career "nightmare" two seasons ago due to severe injuries and multiple operations. After nearly 1,000 days without a race win, he left Honda, his team of 11 years, to join Gresini Racing, a satellite Ducati team. Despite a lucrative offer from Honda, Marquez sought to prove his speed, leading him to race for the factory Ducati team and top the championship standings.

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>A US federal court has blocked President Donald Trump's sweeping tariffs, delivering a significant blow to a key component of his economic policies. The Court of International Trade ruled that the emergency law invoked by the White House does not give the president unilateral authority to impose tariffs on nearly every country. The court said the US Constitution gives Congress exclusive powers to regulate commerce with other nations and this is not superseded by the president's remit to safeguard the economy. The ruling gave the White House 10 days to complete the bureaucratic process of halting the tariffs, although most are currently suspended anyway. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>Toyota Motor Corp. reported a 10% increase in global sales for April, reaching a record 876,864 vehicles, driven by growing demand ahead of the potential negative impact of higher U.S. tariffs on imported cars. Global production also increased by 7.8% to 814,787 vehicles, marking an all-time high for April. The automaker has stated it will not pass on the tariff costs to U.S. consumers but acknowledges potential pressure to do so if the tariffs remain long-term. Domestic sales in Japan also rose, recovering from a slump caused by a vehicle certification scandal.</p>

          <p>California avocado growers report that Mexican imports have helped their sales by ensuring a year-round supply, fostering increased demand for avocados. The lifting of the ban on Mexican avocados in 1997 initially raised concerns among California growers, but the steady influx of imported fruit has led to booming avocado consumption in the United States. A 2000 U.S. law created a board that collected funds to market avocados and conduct nutritional research, further contributing to the fruit's ubiquity. Despite facing challenges such as wildfires, California avocado growers remain optimistic about the industry's future.</p>

          <p>CBS has secured a victory in its legal battle with Sony Pictures Television, with an appellate court ruling allowing the network to continue distributing "Wheel of Fortune" and "Jeopardy!" during the appeal process. A Los Angeles judge had previously ruled that Sony was no longer obligated to provide episodes to CBS, but the appellate panel paused the order. CBS maintains that Sony lacks the legal right to unilaterally sever ties. The lawsuit stems from Sony's claims that CBS entered into unauthorized licensing deals and made insufficient efforts to support the shows.</p>
