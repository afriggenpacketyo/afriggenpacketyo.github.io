          <p>A reported lightning strike at a South Carolina lake injured twenty people, including eight adults and twelve minors. First responders assessed the victims for electrocution after the incident at Dominion Beach Park at Dreher Dam. Twelve individuals were transported to local hospitals with non-life-threatening injuries and are expected to recover. The National Weather Service indicated the lightning struck around 4:43 p.m., and multiple agencies responded to the scene, with strong inter-agency coordination facilitating a quick and efficient response.

          <p>Chinese astronomers have used the cosmic dance of stars to look into the Milky Way‚Äôs past, finding that stars born today spin much faster than those formed billions of years ago. Researchers at the Changchun Observatory studied thousands of stars, each with a mass roughly 1¬Ω times that of the sun, using data from Europe‚Äôs Gaia space telescope and other sky surveys. They found that newly formed stars spin up to 10 times faster than their older counterparts, causing gas clouds to break into smaller fragments, making it harder for massive stars to take shape. The study presents the first direct evidence that the galaxy‚Äôs star-forming clouds have grown more turbulent over time, offering a new way to study how the galaxy has changed. </p>

          <p>Former college football coach Steve Spurrier has expressed skepticism regarding the hype surrounding Arch Manning, who is set to become the starting quarterback for the Texas Longhorns. Spurrier questioned why coach Steve Sarkisian chose to start Quinn Ewers over Manning in previous seasons, considering Manning's highly touted potential. Manning, who appeared in 10 games last season, has affirmed his commitment to the Longhorns, expressing his desire to remain in Austin and become the team's quarterback. Texas is set to open the 2025 season against Ohio State in Columbus. </p>

          <p>A brutal heat wave has settled across the eastern United States, with several days of record-high temperatures in the forecast. Temperatures are expected to soar 15-25 degrees above average, with heat index readings reaching 110 degrees Fahrenheit in some areas. More than 160 million Americans are under extreme heat alerts, with a total of about 200 million affected. The heat is due to a heat dome, an area of high pressure that traps heat and humidity, and experts warn that the first heat waves of the season are particularly dangerous as the human body has yet to adjust. </p>

          <p>The rise of lab-grown meat, officially known as cultivated meat, has sparked debate over its environmental benefits and potential drawbacks. Advocates claim it can meet the growing demand for meat with fewer carbon emissions and less land use, while critics argue that the benefits have been oversold. A comprehensive assessment of the climate impact of lab-grown meat found that its carbon footprint can vary widely depending on the energy intensity of the production process. While some estimate that it has the potential to lead to significant reductions in greenhouse gas emissions, others worry that the emergence of cultivated food is an acceleration of a long-term trend away from environmentally sustainable, locally sourced, whole foods and toward factory mass-produced fare. </p>
