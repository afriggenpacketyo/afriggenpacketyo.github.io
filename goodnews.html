          <p>In a recent interview, United CEO Scott Kirby discussed the recent radar outages at Newark International Airport and assured the public that flying in and out of Newark is safe, citing backup procedures and pilot training. Kirby mentioned that United has proactively reduced flights to accommodate ongoing runway construction and to ensure on-time arrivals. He also addressed concerns about potential ticket price increases due to reduced supply, stating that demand is down due to safety concerns, and United is using larger planes to maintain seat capacity. The CEO emphasized that safety and customer satisfaction are the airline's top priorities, even if it means taking a financial hit, and expressed optimism about the future improvements to the FAA's air traffic control system.</p>

          <p>As Democrats look ahead to the 2028 presidential election, the party must first decide which state will kick off the nominating calendar. Following President Biden's decision to elevate South Carolina in 2024, traditionally early-voting states like Iowa, New Hampshire, and Nevada are vying for the top spot. The decision is complicated by questions about the party's direction and the need to engage a diverse electorate. Potential 2028 candidates are already visiting early states, signaling their interest in shaping the nominating process. Iowa Democratic leaders are emphasizing their focus on the 2026 election, while also hoping to be considered as an early state in 2028.</p>

          <p>The article presents the poem 'Infant Longing' by Li-Young Lee, which delves into themes of loss, memory, and the profound connection between individuals. The poem uses the imagery of a mother finding her own among the slaughtered and feeding her child longing at both the beginning and end of the world. Through kisses, the speaker seeks to both seal and open the mouth, eyes, and soul, ultimately finding an infinite longing that transcends time and space. The poem suggests that in moments of deep connection, the boundaries of self and other blur, revealing a shared human experience.</p>

          <h2>American Identity Increasingly Tied to Doomsday Prepping</h2>
          <div class="timestamp">2025-05-11 08:00:00 EDT</div>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>A university-level investigation into doomsday-prepping kits reveals that preparing for adverse events is becoming a mainstream American cultural phenomenon. FEMA's 2023 results indicate that about half of Americans are engaged in some kind of preparedness for some sort of adverse event. The reasons include fears of nuclear war, societal collapse, and extreme weather events coupled with an inadequate government response. This has created a neoliberal condition of American political life where individuals feel they can't rely on the government and must take responsibility for their own preparation through consumption choices. While some ultra-rich people are buying private islands and building bunkers, many middle-class Americans are also engaging in prepping by purchasing shelf-stable food and other supplies.</p>

          <h2>More Parents Are Seeking Support by Raising Kids With Friends</h2>
          <div class="timestamp">2025-05-11 08:00:00 EDT</div>
        </div>
        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Many American parents struggle to balance raising children with maintaining friendships, leading some to create intentional communities with their friends. One example involves three couples who moved into adjacent townhouses to share child-care responsibilities and create a supportive village. This arrangement reflects a broader historical trend of children being raised with the help of adults who aren't their biological parents, known as alloparents. While such arrangements require coordination and compromise, they can provide much-needed support and deeper friendships for parents. This article explores different models of raising children alongside friends, including co-housing communities and shared homes.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Emily Howell won a police auction bid on a truck in Louisville, Kentucky, largely because the photos showed items like a kayak and fishing poles that she wanted. However, upon delivery, these items were missing, revealing a potential problem at the Louisville Metro Police Department (LMPD) tow lot. An internal investigation found employees allegedly removing items from cars before they went to auction. Kentucky law states that vehicles impounded for 45 days become government property, but the ownership of personal items inside remains unclear, creating situations where buyers are disappointed.</p>

          <p>British plane parts are expected to be exempted from US import tariffs as part of a trade agreement with the Trump administration. Engines from Rolls-Royce and similar plane parts would be able to enter the US market without tariffs, providing certainty to a ¬£40bn sector that supports 450,000 jobs in the UK. The deal would also benefit the US, as Boeing imports Rolls-Royce engines for its commercial airliners. The agreement follows relief for the car and steel industries, with car tariffs expected to decrease from 27.5% to 10% on at least 100,000 vehicles a year and steel tariffs reduced to zero.</p>

          <p>South Korea's upcoming presidential election features Lee Jae-myung and Kim Moon-soo, representing opposing sides of a country polarized over the impeachment of former President Yoon Suk Yeol. Lee, a former sweatshop worker, leads in pre-election surveys, promising to end the old era of insurrection and regression. Kim, Yoon‚Äôs former labor minister, has veered further to the right, warning that Lee would make South Korea more friendly toward China and North Korea at the cost of its alliance with the United States. The election is seen as a referendum on Yoon and his right-wing People Power Party.</p>

          <p>This article presents a brief excerpt from a review of Ron Chernow‚Äôs biography of Mark Twain, suggesting that the book paints Twain as a ‚Äúborn sucker‚Äù who embraced the crackpot theory that Francis Bacon wrote Shakespeare‚Äôs plays. The excerpt contrasts this with Northrop Frye‚Äôs wry observation about the limited biographical information known about Shakespeare, leading to the conclusion that he was ‚Äúclearly an idiot.‚Äù This article is very short, but is included because it has no duplicate coverage with the other articles.</p>
