          <p>In response to the devastating floods in south central Texas that have caused numerous fatalities and left many missing, NASA has dispatched specialized aircraft to aid in search and recovery operations. A high-altitude WB-57 aircraft and a Gulfstream III equipped with advanced imaging radar are being used to survey the flood-ravaged areas along the Guadalupe River. The technology, including a sensor that can detect water through vegetation, will provide high-resolution data to emergency responders. This effort, coordinated with FEMA and state agencies, aims to accelerate rescue efforts and damage assessment.</p>

          <p>The U.S. Supreme Court has declined to lift a lower court's injunction against a controversial Florida immigration law. The law, signed by Governor Ron DeSantis, would have made it a state felony for certain undocumented immigrants to enter Florida. A federal judge had previously blocked the law, ruling that it unconstitutionally encroaches on the federal government's exclusive authority over immigration policy. The Supreme Court's decision means the law will remain unenforceable while legal challenges proceed, a move praised by civil liberties advocates as a reaffirmation of established legal precedent.</p>

          <p>India's women's cricket team has won its first-ever T20 series in England, defeating the hosts by six wickets with a game to spare at Old Trafford. After restricting England to a modest score of 126-7, India's batters chased the target comfortably, led by a strong opening partnership. Captain Harmanpreet Kaur and Jemimah Rodrigues guided the team to victory in the 17th over. England's performance was hampered by a batting collapse against India's spin bowlers, a recurring issue they will need to address before the upcoming one-day international series.</p>

Finding commercially available options inadequate for its scale, Amazon developed the "In-Row Heat Exchanger" (IRHX) to manage the massive energy consumption and heat output of chips like Nvidia's Blackwell series. This custom hardware allows AWS to efficiently deploy dense computing power in its data centers, supporting advanced AI models.

While this could increase access to homeownership, the Bank also noted that millions of existing mortgage holders face significant monthly payment increases as their fixed-rate deals expire.
