          <p>The Florida Panthers delivered a decisive 6-1 victory over the Edmonton Oilers in Game 3 of the Stanley Cup Final, securing a 2-1 series lead. Veteran Brad Marchand continued his scoring streak, while Sam Bennett, Carter Verhaeghe, and Sam Reinhart contributed to the Panthers' offensive surge. Goaltender Sergei Bobrovsky's stellar performance stifled the Oilers' attempts to rally, as the Panthers capitalized on Edmonton's penalty troubles and lack of discipline. The lopsided victory showcased the Panthers' depth and resilience, positioning them closer to a potential championship as the series progresses.</p>

          <p>Ren Zhengfei, the founder of Huawei Technologies, stated that while Huawei's Ascend chips lag behind US counterparts, state-of-the-art performance can still be achieved through techniques like stacking and clustering. Ren emphasized China's advantages in AI development, including a large young population, sufficient electricity, and a developed information network. His comments come amidst increasing US restrictions on China and Huawei, with the US Department of Commerce potentially interpreting the use of Ascend chips as a violation of export controls. Ren's perspective suggests that China remains confident in its technological advancement despite ongoing challenges.</p>

          <p>The Japanese government plans to release another 200,000 tons of rice from its stockpiles through direct contracts with retailers, aiming to curb elevated rice prices. Farm Minister Shinjiro Koizumi announced the move, which will leave the country with a 100,000-ton rice reserve. The released rice will be directed to smaller supermarket operators in addition to major retailers, and the government expects the cheaper rice to lower overall prices. The decision follows previous releases and aims to address rice prices that have doubled compared to last year, impacting consumers and the agricultural sector.</p>

          <p>U.S. and China are set to continue trade talks in London, aiming to resolve differences following a recent call between the leaders of both countries.

National Economic Council Director Kevin Hassett expressed optimism, seeking confirmation that China would restore flows of critical minerals, as the discussions aim to ease trade tensions and foster a more stable economic relationship.

          <p>The UK government has committed ¬£14.2 billion of investment to build the new Sizewell C nuclear plant on the Suffolk coastline. The Treasury states that the project will create 10,000 direct jobs and generate enough energy to power six million homes. Chancellor Rachel Reeves hailed the decision as a kickstart for economic growth, while Energy Secretary Ed Miliband emphasized its necessity for a golden age of clean energy. However, critics like Alison Downes of Stop Sizewell C argue that ministers have not been transparent about the project's full cost, and the investment is a major step in the UK's energy transition.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>New government guidance in England states that teachers can use artificial intelligence (AI) to automate routine tasks such as marking and writing letters home. The training materials say teachers can use the technology to free up time for quality face-to-face interactions with students, and the Department for Education (DfE) advises transparency and careful checking of AI-generated results. While AI is recommended for low-stakes tasks, teachers must ensure accuracy and avoid outsourcing completely, and the guidance highlights both the opportunities and risks associated with AI in education.</p>
