          <p>The White House has indicated that President Trump's self-imposed July deadlines for striking trade deals and avoiding tariff hikes are "not critical." Press Secretary Karoline Leavitt stated the deadlines could be extended, particularly for countries negotiating in good faith. This suggests a potential softening of the administration's hardline stance on imposing new universal tariffs, providing relief to markets.</p>
