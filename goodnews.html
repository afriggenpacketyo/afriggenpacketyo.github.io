          <p>The White House announced that it reached a trade deal with China after two days of negotiations in Switzerland, though specifics remain unclear. U.S. Trade Representative Jamieson Greer stated that the deal would help resolve the "national emergency" related to trade, while Treasury Secretary Scott Bessent acknowledged "substantial progress" but stopped short of touting a full agreement. President Trump had previously announced a trade deal with the United Kingdom, signaling a potential wave of agreements during a reciprocal tariff pause.

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>A new study suggests that sleep is important for memory processing and helps us process not just past memories, but also future ones. The study highlights two parallel processes unfolding in post-learning slumber: engram cells that initially encoded a memory show predictable reactivation patterns, and "engram-to-be cells," which grow increasingly synchronized and later encode new memories. The researchers also developed a neural network model to simulate activity in the hippocampus, pointing to synaptic depression and scaling as likely important for organizing these engram-to-be cells. These findings add to the existing evidence that we should all take sleep seriously.</p>
