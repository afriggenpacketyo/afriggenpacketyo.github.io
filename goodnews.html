          <p>France is making a significant strategic investment in satellite operator Eutelsat, positioning it as Europe's potential competitor to Elon Musk's Starlink. The French state led a ‚Ç¨1.35 billion investment, becoming the company's largest shareholder in a bid to enhance Europe's technological sovereignty in space. However, industry experts express doubt about Eutelsat's ability to challenge Starlink's dominance in the near future, citing major disparities in scale, launch capabilities, and infrastructure. Eutelsat's current constellation of 650 satellites is vastly outnumbered by Starlink's network of over 7,000. (not investment advice)</p>

Developed by Mitsubishi Heavy Industries and JAXA, the H2A has been a reliable workhorse for deploying satellites and probes.

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Chinese civil servants in some regions are increasingly avoiding dining out due to stringent, locally-imposed austerity measures that can be stricter than central government regulations. An official from Sichuan province noted that his department head had announced a ban on eating out, reflecting a trend of "ceng ceng jia ma," or adding extra layers of control. This shift in lifestyle, even if temporary, is a direct consequence of the evolving and often unpredictable anti-corruption and austerity campaigns within the country. The measures aim to curb lavish spending and project an image of frugality among public officials.</p>

The high-stakes negotiations and narrow margin underscore the difficult path the bill faces, with opposition from all Democrats and some Republicans.
