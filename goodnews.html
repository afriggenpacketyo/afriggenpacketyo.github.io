The 48-year-old has officiated in minor league baseball since 2016 and has worked MLB spring training games for the past two years. Her debut marks a significant milestone for women in sports officiating. The article also highlights other female pioneers who broke barriers in prominent men's leagues, including Sarah Thomas in the NFL, Violet Palmer in the NBA, and Stéphanie Frappart in the men's World Cup, placing Pawol's achievement in a broader historical context.</p>

          <p>China's trade data for July revealed surprisingly strong performance, with exports growing 7.2% year-over-year, surpassing economists' expectations. Imports also saw their most significant increase in a year, rising 4.1% and suggesting a potential recovery in domestic demand. This economic activity comes as a tariff truce with the United States approaches its deadline, with some analysts suggesting businesses may be front-loading shipments to get ahead of potential new levies. Despite the positive trade figures, China's factory activity unexpectedly slowed, indicating some underlying weakness in the broader economy. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>United Airlines experienced a significant technology disruption that led to a nationwide ground stop, affecting major hubs like Chicago, Denver, and Houston for several hours. The airline confirmed the issue was resolved but warned passengers of residual delays as it works to restore normal operations. The Federal Aviation Administration acknowledged the outage and offered support to manage the flight backlog. United stated the problem was a preventable internal issue, not related to cybersecurity, and that it would cover customer expenses like hotels where applicable.</p>

          <p>NASA astronaut Butch Wilmore is retiring just months after returning from a challenging test flight of Boeing's Starliner spacecraft. The mission, which also included astronaut Suni Williams, was extended from eight days to over nine months after the vehicle experienced multiple thruster failures and gas leaks en route to the International Space Station. NASA ultimately deemed a return on the Starliner too risky, and the crew came home on a SpaceX capsule instead. Wilmore, a 25-year NASA veteran, maintained that the crew was prepared for the extended stay and not "stranded" in orbit.</p>

          <p>In a joint announcement with President Trump, Apple revealed it will increase its investment in U.S. manufacturing by an additional $100 billion, bringing its total four-year commitment to $600 billion. The investment is expected to create 20,000 new jobs and includes plans for a smart glass manufacturing line in Kentucky and a server facility in Houston. This move is seen as a step toward Apple producing more components and potentially entire products domestically, a goal emphasized by the president. The commitment comes amid threats of tariffs on goods manufactured overseas. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>Conductor Gustavo Dudamel made a celebrated return to the Hollywood Bowl, marking the 20th anniversary of his U.S. debut with the Los Angeles Philharmonic. The performance featured a blend of Duke Ellington and Maurice Ravel, with pianist Seong-Jin Cho as the soloist for Ravel's two piano concertos. The review praises the orchestra's ability to handle the jazz-infused Ellington pieces, a rare feat for a classical ensemble. While the concert was a joyful homecoming, it was also bittersweet, as Dudamel's upcoming performances with his Venezuelan orchestra at the Bowl have been canceled due to travel issues.</p>

          <p>The UK government is planning a crackdown on the non-surgical cosmetic industry to protect consumers from harm. Under the new proposals, clinics will need to obtain a license to offer popular treatments like Botox and dermal fillers, requiring them to meet strict safety and training standards. The riskiest procedures, such as non-surgical Brazilian butt lifts (BBLs), will be restricted to qualified health professionals only. The move, which has been welcomed by industry watchdogs, follows growing concern over the lack of regulation and reports of dangerous complications from procedures performed by unqualified practitioners.</p>
