          <p>Nearly six decades after the first moon landing, space agencies and commercial entities are again focusing on lunar missions, driven by the moon's rich resources and its potential as a gateway to Mars. NASA's Artemis program and a joint China-Russia project aim to establish permanent lunar bases for scientific research and resource extraction, including water ice and helium-3. These lunar bases could serve as transit points for astronauts traveling to Mars, with lunar resources potentially used to create rocket propellant. The renewed interest in the moon is also expected to spur technological advancements with benefits for life on Earth.</p>

Cole believes that offering more flexible options, especially for new parents, is crucial for addressing recruitment and retention issues in the teaching profession. The government is attempting to improve this area as part of its pledge to recruit 6,500 new teachers, with the Education Secretary advocating for more schools to offer flexible hours.

The study, published in Science, demonstrates the potential of tellurium nanowire implants for treating human blindness. Tellurium's photoelectric properties allow it to convert light into electrical signals, offering a promising alternative to traditional photoreceptor cells in the retina.

          <p>New research suggests that subsidizing men's participation in household chores and childcare could help reverse declining birth rates in countries like China. The study argues that subsidies for fathers produce greater long-term fertility gains compared to subsidizing mothers alone. This proposal comes as China faces a rapidly aging population and shrinking workforce. The researchers found that traditional expectations placing the burden of childcare on women persist in China, clashing with economic changes.</p>
