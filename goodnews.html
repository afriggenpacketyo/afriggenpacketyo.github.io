          <p>Madame Gandhi's latest album, "Let Me Be Water," was inspired by the musician's experience with excessive waste during the pandemic in Los Angeles, prompting her to reflect on unsustainable urban lifestyles. Gandhi, whose real name is Kiran Gandhi, realized the impact of her New York City upbringing, where convenience often overshadowed environmental consciousness. The album serves as a message to raise awareness about climate change and sustainability, urging listeners to reconsider their consumption habits and environmental impact. Gandhi hopes to inspire a shift towards more sustainable practices and a greater appreciation for the planet through her music.</p>

          <p>King Charles III made his first trip to Canada since his coronation to deliver the Speech from the Throne, opening the 45th session of the Canadian Parliament in Ottawa. Prime Minister Mark Carney invited the King, a move viewed as strategic amid strained relations with the United States, to underscore Canada's sovereignty. This marks the first time a king has opened a new session of parliament, with the last monarch to deliver the address being Elizabeth II in 1977. The King's visit included meetings with Canadian leaders and participation in a tree-planting ceremony, symbolizing the enduring relationship between Canada and the Crown.</p>

          <p>Following an incident in Liverpool where a car rammed into a crowd, injuring dozens, the Merseyside Police promptly released details about the driver being a 53-year-old white British man. This quick disclosure aimed to prevent the spread of false anti-Muslim speculation online, as had occurred after a previous violent episode in Southport where a false name circulated for a day before authorities clarified the suspect's identity. The police's proactive approach reflects a lesson learned from past incidents where delayed information led to the spread of misinformation and subsequent social unrest. The police are still investigating the motive, but it is not being treated as terrorism.</p>

          <p>The UK government is considering abolishing the two-child benefit cap, a policy that restricts means-tested benefits for families with more than two children born after April 2017. Education Secretary Bridget Phillipson acknowledged the policy has contributed to poverty but cautioned that reversing it would be costly. The decision is expected in the autumn, coinciding with the publication of the government's child poverty strategy, spearheaded by Phillipson and Work and Pensions Secretary Liz Kendall. The Child Poverty Taskforce is assessing the cap, with Phillipson emphasizing that "nothing is off the table."</p>

          <p>The Japanese government has called on domestic universities to consider temporarily accepting students enrolled at U.S. schools after Washington's move to bar foreign students from Harvard University. The University of Tokyo is already considering accepting affected international students. The Japan Student Services Organization plans to release each university's stance on providing support, with the education ministry offering consultation services for students studying in the United States. This move follows a U.S. administration decision to end Harvard's ability to accept foreign students.</p>
