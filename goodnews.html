          <p>Mitch Brown, a former Australian Football League (AFL) player for the West Coast Eagles, has publicly come out as bisexual, marking a historic moment as the first openly gay or bisexual man in the league's 129-year history. Brown revealed that hiding his sexuality significantly influenced his decision to retire, citing a culture of "hyper-masculinity" and homophobic comments within the AFL. He hopes his announcement will foster a safer environment for others. Experts believe his openness about the sport's cultural issues could drive significant change at all levels of Australian men's sports.</p>

          <p>SpaceX's Starship rocket successfully completed its tenth test flight, deploying its first batch of dummy Starlink satellites and stress-testing its reusable heat shield. The more than 400-foot rocket, crucial for SpaceX's commercial ambitions and NASA's lunar return plans, also relit its Raptor engine in orbit before a controlled splashdown. This success follows earlier fiery setbacks and marks a significant step towards developing a fully reusable spacecraft. NASA congratulated SpaceX, noting the flight paves the way for Starship's role in the Artemis III mission to return astronauts to the Moon.</p>

The EU granted Moldova candidate status in 2022, and European leaders, including Germany's Chancellor Merz, are attending its independence anniversary in a show of solidarity. The article details Moldova's history, language, ethnic groups, and the unresolved Transnistria conflict, where Russian troops have been stationed since 1992. Despite historical ties and a significant number of citizens holding Romanian passports, reunification with Romania is not currently favored by most Moldovans, though ties are expected to deepen.</p>

          <p>China's embattled property market is showing tentative signs of recovery, with major developers like China Resources Land (CR Land) and Sunac reporting improved interim results. CR Land's first-half net profit rose 16.2% to 11.9 billion yuan, while Sunac significantly narrowed its losses. These positive outcomes are attributed to government stimulus measures and a recovery in retail consumption. The article suggests these results indicate a shift from the crisis mode many developers faced just a year ago, driven by strong property development revenue and increased profitability in shopping center segments.</p>

          <p>Denmark's National Museum has unveiled a miniature 10th-century figurine, believed to be the first 'portrait' of a Viking, depicting a well-groomed man with an imperial mustache and braided beard. Carved from walrus tusk, the 1.2-inch piece, found in Norway in 1796 and forgotten in archives, challenges perceptions of Vikings as savage. Its detailed carvings and unique smiling expression contrast with simpler Viking art, leading curators to suggest it might represent King Harald Bluetooth. This artwork offers unprecedented insight into individual representation during the Viking Age.</p>

          <p>Lewis Hamilton's challenging first 14 races with Ferrari, marked by inconsistent performance and self-criticism, have sparked discussion about his adaptability and the potential impact of age in Formula 1. While his qualifying pace against teammate Charles Leclerc has improved since early season, he struggles with the current generation of cars that require a different driving style. The article explores how F1 car design changes since 2022 do not suit Hamilton's traditional cornering strengths, leading to a lack of confidence in the car's rear. The physiological aspects of aging and the mental toll of a long career are also considered as factors affecting his performance.</p>

          <p>China has successfully tested a new passive residual heat removal system, a crucial step towards making its next-generation, radioactive waste-recycling nuclear power plants more meltdown-proof. The China Institute of Atomic Energy announced this breakthrough in developing fourth-generation integral fast reactors, which use liquid metal as a coolant and a closed-loop fuel cycle for reprocessing spent fuel within the same facility. Unlike conventional reactors, fast reactors utilize high-energy neutrons, making them more fuel-efficient and capable of breeding more fissile material. This advancement significantly enhances the safety profile of future nuclear energy technologies.</p>

          <p>China's industrial profits saw a narrowed decline of 1.5% year-on-year in July, a significant recovery from steeper drops in previous months. This improvement signals that Beijing's campaign against intense price wars, known as "anti-involution," is beginning to ease the financial strain on companies. While profits in the mining sector continued to plunge, manufacturing and utilities saw improvements. The article highlights that state-backed firms experienced a drop, but businesses with foreign investments and private enterprises saw profit increases, indicating a complex economic landscape influenced by government policies aimed at stabilizing consumer prices and fostering balanced growth.</p>

This trend, also supported by data from BCD Travel and American Express Global Business Travel, suggests that corporate interests in the US are unaffected by broader negative travel sentiments and global economic shifts.
