          <p>The Scottish Parliament is preparing to vote on a bill that would legalize assisted dying for terminally ill adults, marking the third time such a proposal has been debated in Holyrood. The legislation requires two doctors to confirm the patient's terminal illness and mental capacity, and the patient must administer the substance themselves with a healthcare professional present. The bill includes safeguards, such as allowing patients to change their mind at any point and protecting doctors who object from legal consequences. The vote is expected to be close, with several MSPs undecided, and the Scottish government remaining officially neutral on the matter.</p>

          <p>Proposed "baby bonuses" from the Trump administration to encourage childbirth have been met with skepticism and indignation from many Americans, particularly women. Critics argue that $5,000 is insufficient to cover the high costs of raising a child in the U.S., citing expenses such as childcare, housing, and food. Many suggest that more comprehensive pro-family policies, such as affordable healthcare and childcare, are needed to address declining birth rates. Some also express concerns that the pronatalist movement is intertwined with racism and ableism, focusing primarily on incentivizing white couples to have more children.</p>

          <p>The Trump administration has reduced its tariffs on Chinese goods from 145 percent to 30 percent for at least a few months, with China reciprocating by lowering its retaliatory levies. This decision comes after Trump made big claims about what his tariffs could achieve, only to back down without securing meaningful concessions from China. The move reflects the reality that America needs other countries' trade as much as they need ours, diminishing Trump's negotiating position. While tariffs remain higher than before Trump's second term, the cut is temporary, and uncertainty persists in the trade landscape.</p>
