          <p>The Eurovision Song Contest 2025 is underway in Basel, Switzerland, featuring artists from 26 countries and an estimated 160 million viewers worldwide. Sweden's comedy trio KAJ is favored to win with their sauna-themed song, but Austria, France, the Netherlands, Finland, and Israel are also contenders. The event is marked by political discord, particularly regarding Israel's participation due to the ongoing conflict in Gaza, which has led to pro-Palestinian and pro-Israel protests in Basel. Organizers anticipate over 500,000 attendees throughout the week, with fans praising the contest's increasing diversity and the potential appearance of Celine Dion, who represented Switzerland in 1988. </p>

          <p>Federal courts, including the Supreme Court, are pushing back against the Trump administration's aggressive deportation policies, insisting on due process for immigrants facing removal. The Supreme Court recently rebuked the administration for providing only a day's warning to Venezuelan immigrants facing deportation under an 18th-century wartime law, emphasizing the need for immigrants to challenge their deportations. This stance aligns with the Constitution's protection of 'persons,' not just citizens, and comes amid concerns that the administration is manipulating the process to avoid judicial review. The courts are ensuring immigrants have the opportunity to contest their deportations, especially when novel powers are claimed by officials.</p>
