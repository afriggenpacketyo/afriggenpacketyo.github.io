          <p>A large and exceptionally bright meteor, described as a fireball, was witnessed across Georgia and South Carolina before exploding over Georgia with the energy of about 20 tons of TNT. NASA reported that the space rock, estimated to be three feet in diameter and weighing over a ton, entered the atmosphere at 30,000 miles per hour. The explosion created a pressure wave that resulted in sonic booms heard by residents on the ground. The American Meteor Society received over 160 reports of the rare daylight event, which may have been part of the Beta Taurid meteor shower.</p>

          <p>An excerpt from Sam Tanenhaus's new biography, "Buckley: The Life and the Revolution That Changed America," details the formative years of conservative intellectual William F. Buckley, Jr. The book explores his upbringing, the influence of his oil-speculator father, and the family's deep Catholic faith, which shaped his worldview. Tanenhaus positions Buckley as a pivotal figure who inherited and then catalyzed the modern conservative movement, paving the way for political figures from Barry Goldwater to Donald Trump. The excerpt provides a glimpse into the family's life at their Connecticut estate, "Great Elm," and the origins of Buckley's drive.</p>

          <p>In a 6-3 decision, the Supreme Court has rejected a challenge to the U.S. Preventive Services Task Force, a key component of the Affordable Care Act (ACA). The ruling preserves the mandate requiring insurers to cover a wide range of preventive health services, such as cancer screenings and certain medications, at no cost to patients. The challenge was brought by a group of Christian-owned businesses arguing the task force was unconstitutionally structured and wielded unchecked power. Public health advocates had warned that dismantling the task force's recommendations would have devastating consequences for the health of roughly 150 million Americans who benefit from the provision.</p>

          <p>This article examines the potential monthly income from a $300,000 annuity purchased at age 65, a strategy gaining attention amid economic uncertainty. Based on current data, a 65-year-old man could expect around $1,942 per month, while a woman might receive about $1,861, with the difference due to longer female life expectancy. A joint-life annuity for a couple would pay less, around $1,684, as it covers two lives. The article stresses that these figures depend on interest rates and the specific type of annuity chosen, and advises considering liquidity trade-offs and tax implications before investing.

          <h2>Analysis: Supreme Court's Ruling on Nationwide Injunctions is More Nuanced Than a Simple Trump Victory</h2>
          <div class="timestamp">2025-06-27 11:05:24 EDT</div>
        </div>
        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>This analysis argues that the Supreme Court's decision to limit nationwide injunctions is not the straightforward win for Donald Trump that it may appear to be. While the ruling restricts the ability of a single judge to block a policy nationwide, it leaves the door open for such injunctions when necessary to provide "complete relief," potentially including the birthright citizenship case itself. The article points out that the practice of "judge-shopping" for nationwide injunctions has been used against both parties, and reining it in could benefit future Democratic administrations as well. Ultimately, the decision resolves little, suggesting these broad court orders are still permissible in some circumstances.</p>
