          <p>Germany's socialist Left Party is experiencing a surge in popularity, defying earlier predictions of failing to meet the threshold for Bundestag representation. Recent polls show the party's support nearly doubling, especially among young voters attracted to their focus on affordable housing. The party aims to leverage this momentum with a strategic plan emphasizing peace and diplomatic solutions, particularly regarding the Russia-Ukraine conflict. Despite past internal conflicts, the Left Party has nearly doubled its membership and seeks to influence policy by engaging in negotiations with other parties, signaling a renewed sense of self-confidence on the political stage.</p>

          <p>Chinese exports experienced a notable surge in April, driven by increased shipments to Southeast Asian countries, which helped offset a sharp decline in trade with the United States due to tariffs. The data highlights a shift in global trade flows, with Chinese exports to ASEAN countries jumping significantly while shipments to the U.S. plummeted. Despite the overall export increase, economists caution about potential unemployment spikes if factory orders continue to decline. The Chinese government is signaling readiness to boost domestic demand to mitigate the impact of the trade war, cutting interest rates and encouraging spending.</p>

          <p>India is reportedly considering eliminating tariffs on certain imports from the U.S., including steel, auto components, and pharmaceuticals, signaling a potential shift from its protectionist trade policies. This move comes as India seeks to finalize a trade deal with the U.S., its largest trading partner, amidst pressure from tariffs imposed by the U.S. The proposed deal aims to boost India's economic growth by attracting foreign investment and ensuring access to global markets. Experts debate the potential impact on India's domestic manufacturing sector, with some suggesting that certain industries may not be significantly affected.</p>

          <p>China's exports surged in April, fueled by a jump in shipments to Southeast Asian countries, offsetting a decline in exports to the U.S. due to tariffs. Overall exports rose by 8.1%, surpassing expectations, while imports experienced a slight decrease. The increase in exports could be attributed to transshipment through third countries and contracts signed before the tariffs were implemented. China's exports to ASEAN countries increased significantly, with Vietnam and Malaysia remaining key destinations, while exports to the European Union also rose.</p>
