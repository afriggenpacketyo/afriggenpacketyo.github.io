          <p>The ultra-wealthy are increasingly storing their gold in Singapore due to growing economic and geopolitical uncertainty, with The Reserve, a precious metals repository near Singapore's airport, experiencing an 88% increase in storage orders from the beginning of the year to April. Clients are seeking safe jurisdictions like Singapore, viewed as the 'Geneva of the East,' due to tariffs and potential instabilities. The wealthy are opting for physical gold bars over paper to mitigate counterparty and geopolitical risks, with concerns about the health of the global financial system driving this preference. Spot gold prices are trading near historic levels, currently at $3,346.32 per ounce.</p>

          <p>British-South African endurance athlete Lewis Pugh became the first person to swim around Martha's Vineyard, completing a 60-mile trek over 12 days to raise awareness about the plight of sharks. Pugh, a United Nations Patron of the Oceans, aims to change public perceptions of sharks, which he believes have been unfairly maligned by the film "Jaws." The swim was one of his most difficult, due to cold water, wind, and waves, and it coincided with the New England Aquarium's first confirmed sighting of a white shark this season. Pugh hopes his swim will encourage policy makers to protect sharks, which are being killed at an alarming rate.</p>

          <p>Tripadvisor's "Transparency Report 2025" reveals that approximately 8% of the 31.1 million reviews submitted in 2024 were fake, more than double the number detected in 2022, though this is also due to more aggressive policies against incentivized reviews. The company defines a fake review as biased or non-firsthand content intended to manipulate a property's reputation. Tripadvisor uses a three-pronged process involving auto-detection, human review, and community feedback to identify and remove fake reviews. The company's trust and safety team moderated over 4.2 million reviews, and the system relies less on the review's content and more on how it is posted, using AI and behavioral biometrics to detect patterns.</p>

          <p>The Japanese government plans to spread soil collected from near the Fukushima Daiichi nuclear power plant on the grounds of the prime minister's office and other government buildings to demonstrate its safety. The soil, which retains low-level radioactivity, will be used in flowerbeds and for other purposes on government office grounds, marking the first time it has been repurposed outside Fukushima Prefecture. Chief Cabinet Secretary Yoshimasa Hayashi emphasized the importance of securing public understanding of the soil's safety and utility. The government guidelines prohibit soil with more than 8,000 becquerels per kilogram of radioactive cesium to be used in any public works projects.</p>

His statement follows complaints from the Hong Kong Journalists Association that at least 20 of its members were asked to prepay about HK$1 million after a tax review, which the association argued was supported by insufficient evidence.</p>

          <p>China's industrial profits rose for a second consecutive month in April, with growth improving despite U.S. tariffs and deflationary pressures, supported by Beijing's policy measures. Cumulative profits at major industrial firms climbed 3% compared to a year earlier, accelerating from 2.6% growth in March. The boost in industrial firms' profits was largely due to Beijing's efforts to support the private sector, offsetting some of the negative impacts from the U.S. tariffs. Profits in the high-tech manufacturing industry climbed 9% from a year earlier, with notable improvement in the biopharmaceutical products and aircraft manufacturing. (not investment advice)</p>

Moss also used her roles as executive producer and director to focus on the show's look and how June came across on camera, drawing inspiration from Stanley Kubrick's films to convey fury and dark intent. She loves the idea that at the end, June begins to tell the story that is the book, highlighting the circular nature of the narrative.</p>

          <p>Han Song, a leading Chinese science fiction writer, explores the disorientation accompanying China‚Äôs modernization in his stories, often writing of unthinkable things that later came true. His stories are bleak, grotesque, and graphic, scrutinizing the gap between China and the West and imagining China surpassing the United States as a superpower. As his health declines, Han has become more skeptical about the ability of medicine and science to improve humanity. He has also been experimenting with DeepSeek, the Chinese A.I. chatbot, to help him polish drafts or even write stories.</p>
