          <p>Nvidia CEO Jensen Huang lauded China's generative artificial intelligence models, highlighting their open-source nature as a key catalyst for global progress and AI safety. His praise came during a supply chain expo in Beijing, where he emphasized the significant number of Chinese developers building on Nvidia's platform. This context is crucial as Nvidia expects to soon resume shipments of its H20 AI chip to China, after new U.S. export restrictions had previously halted sales and impacted the company's revenue.

          <p>The National League defeated the American League 4-3 in the MLB All-Star Game, which was decided by a home run swing-off for the first time in the event's history. After the game ended in a 6-6 tie, a new tiebreaker format was implemented where three batters from each league took three swings each to determine a winner. The NL's Kyle Schwarber, who went 0-for-2 in the game itself, was named MVP after hitting three decisive home runs in the swing-off.</p>

          <p>Worldwide sales of electric and plug-in hybrid vehicles increased by 24% in June compared to the previous year, reaching a total of 1.8 million units.

In contrast, sales in North America experienced a 9% decline, positioning the U.S. market as a laggard in the global electric transition. (not investment advice)</p>
