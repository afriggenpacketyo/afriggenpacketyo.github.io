          <p>Grant Hardin, also known as the "Devil in the Ozarks," has been apprehended after escaping from an Arkansas prison where he was serving time for murder and sexual assault. Hardin, a former police chief, escaped by disguising himself in an outfit resembling a law enforcement uniform. He was captured a short distance from the prison, and his identity was confirmed through fingerprint analysis. Authorities have stated that there is no longer an active threat to public safety, and an investigation into the escape is ongoing. Hardin had been serving an 80-year sentence for the murder of James Appleton and the sexual assault of an elementary school teacher.</p>

          <div class="timestamp">2025-06-06 18:33:53 EDT</div>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Yoga classes have resumed at San Diego beaches following a federal appeals court ruling that a city ordinance restricting such activities was unconstitutional. The court found that teaching yoga is "protected speech" under the First Amendment. The city had argued the rule targeted commercial activity, as instructors received donations for the classes. One instructor who was cited multiple times for holding classes on the beach has resumed teaching, emphasizing the service outdoor yoga provides to those who are disabled or cannot afford classes elsewhere. The ruling is seen as a triumph of community over a few elites who did not want people disturbing their oceanfront views.</p>

          <p>Yoga classes are back on at San Diego beaches this week after a federal appeals court ruled that a city ordinance restricting such activities was unconstitutional and that teaching yoga was ‚Äúprotected speech‚Äù. The three-judge panel of the US ninth circuit court of appeals on Wednesday overruled a San Diego judge and decided in favor of two instructors who had sued over a law that San Diego passed in 2024 banning yoga classes of four or more people at shoreline parks and beaches. The ruling stated that the ordinance violated the instructors‚Äô rights, as it targets teaching yoga, implicating their first amendment right to speak. Outdoor yoga is a service to those who are disabled or cannot afford yoga classes elsewhere.</p>
