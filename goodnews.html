          <p>Elon Musk's tenure in the Trump administration as part of the Department of Government Efficiency (DOGE) has ended after 129 days marked by significant spending cuts and controversy.

However, this has led to chaos, with federal judges halting mass firings and concerns over potential conflicts of interest due to Musk's companies' ties to the government.
