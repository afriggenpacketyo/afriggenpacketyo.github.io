The bill, which would allow terminally ill adults to choose to end their lives, has undergone intense scrutiny and numerous amendments. While a final vote is unlikely on Friday, the debate comes as the government admits to errors in its impact assessment, revising the estimated number of assisted deaths in the first year. The revised assessment has sparked controversy and debate among MPs on both sides of the issue.</p>

          <p>A 9¬Ω-month-old boy with a rare genetic disorder, CPS1 deficiency, has been successfully treated with a custom gene-editing therapy, marking a medical first. Doctors at Children‚Äôs Hospital of Philadelphia used CRISPR technology to fix the precise mutation in his genome. The treatment, which built on decades of federally funded research, offers a new path for developing personalized treatments for thousands of other uncommon genetic diseases. The article highlights the potential of this technique to transform health care.</p>
