          <p>The UK Aids Memorial Quilt, a collection of 42 quilts and 23 textile panels representing nearly 400 people who died from HIV/Aids in the UK, is on display at the Tate Modern in London. The quilt was created in 1994 by loved ones as a tribute to those lost during the epidemic. Frankie O'Reilly, who lost his partner Georgie to an Aids-related illness, participated in the project to cope with his grief and honor his friend. Cathy John and Grace McElwee also created a panel for their friend Michael Trask, describing the quilt as having "stitches of love in it". The exhibition aims to provide a space for grieving and remembrance after the stigma surrounding HIV prevented many from properly mourning their loved ones. The optimism score reflects the memorial's intention to honor and celebrate the lives of those lost, while acknowledging the pain and stigma of the past.</p>

          <p>With the U.S. restricting China's access to advanced semiconductors for AI development, Beijing is focusing on domestic alternatives like Huawei. U.S. curbs inhibit China's access to advanced chips and technology vital for creating an AI chip ecosystem. China has mobilized billions to fill these gaps, achieving some breakthroughs but still lagging behind. Huawei's Ascend chips show progress but remain behind Nvidia's, with SMIC struggling to mass-produce advanced GPUs due to equipment limitations. China is exploring alternative technologies and lithography techniques to innovate rather than imitate, while also focusing on memory components through companies like CXMT.
