          <p>Actor Pierce Brosnan discussed the immense responsibility he felt towards fans while starring as Ron in the film adaptation of Richard Osman's "Thursday Murder Club" series, which has sold over 10 million copies. The movie features a star-studded cast including Dame Helen Mirren, Celia Imrie, and Sir Ben Kingsley, portraying a quartet of amateur sleuths in a retirement village. Despite some critics calling the adaptation "nefariously lazy" and others praising its "camp and quietly sad" tone, the cast expressed enjoyment during filming and enthusiasm for potential sequels. The film combines cozy crime with deeper themes of aging and loss, resonating with the books' blend of sadness and humane comedy.</p>

          <p>The winning numbers for the year's largest Powerball jackpot, an estimated $700 million, were drawn on Saturday night: 11, 14, 34, 47, 51, and red Powerball 18. This drawing marked the 37th consecutive occasion without a grand prize winner since the last claim in May. Despite no one matching all six numbers for the top prize, several participants achieved significant wins, including a Tennessee player who secured $2 million by matching five numbers with the Power Play option. The fortunate grand prize winner could opt for either annual installments over 29 years or a substantial one-time cash payment of $316.3 million before taxes, highlighting the immense stakes involved in the popular lottery game.</p>

          <p>Taiwan AI Cloud, a subsidiary of Taiwanese laptop maker Asus, is developing a new supercomputer to significantly boost the island's computing capacity. The initial phase of this infrastructure, located in Tainan, is expected to launch in December with an 80 petaflop capacity, eventually reaching 250 petaflops. This project is a collaboration with Taiwan’s National Centre for High-Performance Computing and aims to increase the island's total computing power by at least 50 percent. It forms a crucial part of Taiwan's strategic goal to become a "top three computing power in Asia" by expanding its overall capacity to approximately 1,200 petaflops by 2029.</p>

          <h2>Vivo Challenges Apple Vision Pro with Lighter, More Affordable Mixed-Reality Headset</h2>
          <div class="timestamp">2025-08-23 21:00:19 EDT</div>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Chinese smartphone maker Vivo has introduced the Vivo Vision, a new mixed-reality headset that directly challenges Apple's Vision Pro in both name and design. The Vivo device features an intuitive interface controlled by eye tracking and hand gestures, similar to its American counterpart. However, the Vivo Vision distinguishes itself by being approximately 35% lighter than the Apple gadget, addressing a common concern regarding the weight of high-end virtual-reality headsets. Powered by Qualcomm’s Snapdragon XR2 Plus Gen 2 Platform, it delivers an impressive 8K resolution across its dual organic-light-emitting-diode displays. This potentially more affordable and lighter option is currently compatible with certain Vivo phones and Windows computers for screen projections, aiming to capture a significant share of the evolving VR market.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>The UK Parliament's e-petitions system, celebrating its 10th anniversary, continues to attract public engagement, with 57% of people having signed a petition in the past year. While some petitions have led to significant legislative changes, like "Finn's Law" for police service animals, many serious campaigns and numerous humorous ones rarely lead to direct government action. The system, designed to give the public a voice and allow backbench MPs to debate issues, is criticized by some for offering an "illusion of a feedback loop" rather than tangible change. Despite this, its chair defends it as a vital "bridge between the public and Parliament," demonstrating ongoing democratic engagement beyond elections.</p>

        </div>
        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Young adults, some as young as 23, are increasingly opting for "preventative botox" to pre-empt the formation of wrinkles, a trend highlighted by Sydney Brown, who started injections at 23 with her plastic surgeon mother's guidance. This approach aims to reduce dynamic wrinkles and slow the aging process, with botox users in their 20s and early 30s now making up nearly a quarter of cosmetic clientele worldwide. While some practitioners support its long-term benefits, others, like Nora Nugent of BAAPS, advise against starting too early, calling it a waste of money and preferring to treat existing faint lines. Concerns are also raised about peer pressure, mental health impacts, and potential complications from unregulated practitioners, alongside the risk of building tolerance.</p>

          <p>Patrick Cantlay dramatically challenged Tommy Fleetwood for the Tour Championship title, birdying four of his last five holes to post a 64 and draw even at 16 under par. Fleetwood, who had led, responded with late birdies to maintain a tie at the leaderboard summit heading into the final 18 holes. This sets up a compelling Sunday showdown, with Cantlay aiming to deny Fleetwood his long-awaited American win, reminiscent of their Ryder Cup clash. Keegan Bradley also made a significant move with a 63, bolstering his chances for a Ryder Cup captain's pick, potentially becoming the first playing captain since 1963.</p>

          <h2>Researchers Reconstruct Faces of 2,500-Year-Old Skulls from Ancient Indian Civilization</h2>
          <div class="timestamp">2025-08-23 18:42:59 EDT</div>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Researchers at Madurai Kamaraj University in India, in collaboration with Face Lab at Liverpool John Moores University, have digitally reconstructed the faces of two 2,500-year-old male skulls excavated from Kondagai, an ancient burial site near Keeladi. This effort aims to understand the early inhabitants of the region, where state archaeologists claim an urban civilization existed as early as 580 BC, challenging existing narratives about Indian urbanization primarily in the north. The reconstructed faces show features of Ancient Ancestral South Indians with traces of Middle-East Eurasian and Austro-Asiatic ancestries, suggesting global migration. This research sparks discussions on Indian history, ancestry, and cultural identity, highlighting the diversity embedded in ancient DNA.</p>
