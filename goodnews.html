          <p>Apple is requesting a court to pause a recent contempt ruling in its case against Epic Games, arguing that complying with the order could cost the company substantial sums. According to CNBC, Judge Yvonne Gonzalez Rogers found Apple in violation of her original court order by continuing to charge commissions on in-app transactions that link out for payment. Apple claims the required changes would negatively impact its business by reducing consumer choice and impeding in-app purchases. Epic Games CEO Tim Sweeney celebrated the ruling as forcing Apple to compete, but Apple contends the order is punitive and plans to appeal the contempt ruling.</p>
