          <p>A Chinese national known as "Brother Wang," accused of being a major fentanyl trafficker and money launderer, has been extradited from Cuba into U.S. custody. The transfer was facilitated by the Mexican government, from which the suspect, Zhi Dong Zhang, had previously escaped house arrest. U.S. authorities allege Zhang ran a vast operation importing fentanyl and cocaine from Mexico and laundering at least $20 million, working closely with the Sinaloa and Jalisco New Generation cartels. This extradition is part of a broader U.S. effort to pressure Mexico and China to curb the flow of fentanyl and its precursor chemicals.</p>

          <p>A judge has ordered the S&W Atlas Iron & Metal recycling facility in Watts, Los Angeles, to cease operations permanently and pay $2 million in penalties. For decades, the scrap yard operated next to Jordan High School, exposing students and staff to toxic dust, explosions, and flying shrapnel. The owners pleaded no contest to criminal charges related to hazardous waste handling after a compressed gas canister exploded on the first day of school. The ruling provides long-awaited justice for the community, which has suffered from the environmental and safety hazards posed by the facility for generations.</p>

          <p>The Consumer Price Index indicated that inflation rose at a 3% annual rate in September, a figure slightly cooler than the 3.1% anticipated by economists. This report, released by the Labor Department despite the ongoing government shutdown, is crucial for determining the Social Security cost-of-living adjustment. Economists note that while tariffs have exerted some upward pressure on prices, their full impact has been partially absorbed by businesses. The data complicates the Federal Reserve's upcoming interest rate decision, though markets still widely expect a rate cut due to a weakening labor market. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>Kansas City Chiefs tight end Travis Kelce has partnered with activist investment firm JANA Partners to acquire a combined stake of about 9% in Six Flags Entertainment. This move makes them one of the largest shareholders in the amusement park company, which has been struggling with significant debt and declining attendance since its 2024 merger with Cedar Fair. As an activist investor, JANA Partners aims to push for operational and managerial changes to enhance shareholder value and improve the guest experience. Kelce, a self-described "lifelong Six Flags fan," brings significant celebrity influence that analysts believe could help revitalize the brand's image.</p>

          <p>FBI Director Kash Patel is scheduled to travel to China next month to address the production and supply of precursor chemicals used to manufacture fentanyl. The visit is a key part of the administration's strategy to combat the U.S. opioid crisis by targeting international supply chains. The U.S. has increasingly blamed Chinese companies for fueling the crisis and has recently indicted several firms for their alleged role. The trip underscores the administration's focus on pressuring China to take more decisive action against the illicit drug trade.</p>

          <p>With two months until Christmas, retailers are preparing for a holiday shopping season marked by more cautious and price-sensitive consumers. Executives from companies like Kohl's and Academy Sports and Outdoors note that shoppers are making more frequent trips but with smaller purchases, actively seeking the best deals. In response, many stores are launching their holiday marketing campaigns and sales earlier than usual to capture a larger share of consumer spending. Retailers also anticipate a trend of shoppers "trading down" from premium brands to more affordable private-label options to manage their budgets amid economic uncertainty.

          <p>Quincy Cross, who is serving a life sentence for the 2000 murder of 18-year-old Jessica Currin, has been granted a new evidentiary hearing scheduled for November 25th. Cross was convicted in 2008 based largely on the testimony of two witnesses, one of whom has now recanted. The Kentucky Innocence Project, which is representing Cross, filed a motion that included an affidavit from the witness stating she lied at the trial. This new development offers a potential path to overturn the conviction in a case that has spanned a quarter of a century.</p>

          <p>This article examines the current state of mortgage interest rates ahead of the Federal Reserve's meeting on October 29, where another rate cut is widely expected. The average rate for a 30-year mortgage is currently around 6.19%, significantly lower than at the start of the year but still volatile due to factors like inflation and the government shutdown. While a Fed rate cut could lead to lower mortgage rates, much of this expectation may already be priced in by lenders. The article advises potential homebuyers and refinancers to assess their affordability now, as there is no guarantee that rates will fall further after the Fed's decision. (not investment advice)</p>

Newsom asserted that the city is effectively confronting crime, pointing to data showing a potential 70-year low in homicides and an overall decline in violent crime. The president ultimately called off the plan after speaking with local leaders.

The endorsement came on the eve of early voting, after Jeffries had long withheld his support for the progressive candidate who won the Democratic primary. In his statement, Jeffries cited Mamdani's focus on the affordability crisis and his commitment to being a mayor for all New Yorkers. The delay was reportedly due to concerns over Mamdani's past rhetoric on Israel and his progressive policies, which some moderate Democrats view as a potential liability.</p>
