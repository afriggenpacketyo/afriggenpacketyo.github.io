          <p>A federal judge in Brooklyn has issued a ruling that prevents the Trump administration from terminating Temporary Protected Status (TPS) for nearly 350,000 Haitian migrants this year. The judge determined that the Department of Homeland Security secretary lacks the authority to partially vacate a country's TPS designation before its scheduled expiration in February 2026. This decision provides temporary relief to migrants who have established lives in the U.S., citing their enrollment in schools, employment, and medical treatments. The White House has announced its intention to appeal the ruling, arguing that district courts cannot prohibit the executive branch from enforcing immigration laws.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Intel's new CEO, Lip-Bu Tan, is reportedly exploring a significant strategic change for the company's contract chip manufacturing business to attract major clients like Apple and Nvidia. The proposed shift involves discontinuing the marketing of its 18A manufacturing process to external customers, a technology heavily promoted by his predecessor. Instead, resources would be focused on the next-generation 14A process, where Intel believes it can gain a competitive edge over rival TSMC. This potential pivot could result in a multi-billion dollar write-off but is seen as a necessary step to revive the U.S. chipmaker's fortunes. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>Preliminary government data reveals that the number of migrants apprehended for illegally crossing the U.S.-Mexico border fell to a historic monthly low of just over 6,000 in June. The Trump administration attributes this dramatic decrease to its aggressive deportation policies, which include empowering border officials to swiftly deport migrants without asylum hearings. For the second consecutive month, no migrants were released into the U.S. interior, a stark contrast to previous years. This lull in illegal immigration is occurring alongside an intense messaging campaign and increased interior enforcement actions by ICE.</p>

          <p>President Donald Trump has announced that Israel has agreed to the "necessary conditions" for a 60-day ceasefire in Gaza, urging Hamas to accept the deal. In a social media post, Trump stated that during the truce, parties would work towards a permanent end to the war, with Qatar and Egypt set to deliver the final proposal. The announcement comes ahead of a scheduled meeting between Trump and Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu. It remains unclear what the specific conditions are or whether Hamas will agree to the terms, which Trump warned would only get worse for them if rejected.</p>

          <p>Minnesota has implemented the nation's most stringent law regulating PFAS, also known as "forever chemicals," found in many consumer products and linked to health issues. The legislation, called "Amara's Law," is named after Amara Strande, who testified before lawmakers while dying of a rare cancer at age 20. The law will phase out the manufacture and sale of nonessential PFAS products by 2032. Strande's advocacy was inspired by the belief that her illness was linked to PFAS waste from a nearby 3M plant, which contaminated local groundwater for decades.</p>

The move could see British landmarks, animals, or cultural symbols replace figures like Winston Churchill on the next series of banknotes.

          <p>California has passed its most significant reform to the California Environmental Quality Act (CEQA) in decades, a move intended to spur housing construction. The new law, championed by Governor Gavin Newsom, largely waives CEQA requirements for most low- and mid-rise housing projects in urban areas zoned for multifamily use. This eliminates a major tool that opponents, including labor unions and neighborhood groups, have used to delay or block development through lengthy studies and lawsuits. The reform signals a major political shift toward prioritizing housing abundance over other concerns.</p>
