          <p>The NATO summit in the Netherlands will decide on a proposed defense spending increase.  Allies are under pressure to raise spending to 5% of GDP by 2035, a target some find unreasonable.  President Trump's questioning of Article 5's definition adds to the complexity, though NATO's Secretary General aims to reassure allies of continued U.S. commitment.
