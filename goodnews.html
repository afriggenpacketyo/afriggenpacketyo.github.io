          <p>California Governor Gavin Newsom proposed a $7.5 billion federal film tax credit to support the entertainment industry after President Trump suggested tariffs on movies filmed overseas. This initiative aims to counter the industry's shift towards states and countries offering more attractive tax incentives and cheaper labor. Senator Adam Schiff is also working on a federal film incentive proposal. The proposal is essentially a tax credit modeled after California‚Äôs incentive program. The industry has lost thousands of jobs in the past two years due to generous government incentives and cheaper labor luring film and television studios to shoot many projects far from Hollywood.</p>

          <p>Columbia student activist Mohsen Mahdawi, a green card holder, spoke out after being detained during a citizenship interview, stating that President Trump "will not silence me." Mahdawi, who helped lead protests against the Israel-Hamas war, was detained under a law allowing the government to revoke visas for people deemed to pose "adverse foreign policy consequences." He argued that his detention was a betrayal of the Constitution and an attempt to intimidate him. Mahdawi was released after a judge ruled that his detention raised concerns about retaliation for protected speech. He plans to continue protesting.</p>

          <p>A judge ordered the Trump administration to admit approximately 12,000 refugees into the United States under a court order partially blocking the president's efforts to suspend the refugee admissions program. The order followed arguments over the interpretation of a federal appeals court ruling. The judge dismissed the government's analysis, stating that the administration was not free to disobey statutory and constitutional law. The appeals court said the government must continue processing refugees who already had "arranged and confirmable" travel plans before January 20. The judge ordered the administration to resume processing cases and facilitate admission for those refugees.</p>

          <p>Elon Musk's SpaceX rocket company's South Texas home, Starbase, is on its way to becoming an official city. A vote to formally organize Starbase as a city was approved by a small group of voters, mostly Musk's employees at SpaceX. The election victory was personal for Musk, whose popularity has diminished since he became the public face of President Donald Trump's federal job and spending cuts. The creation of an official company town has drawn critics who worry it will expand Musk's personal control over the area, with potential authority to close a popular beach and state park for launches.</p>
