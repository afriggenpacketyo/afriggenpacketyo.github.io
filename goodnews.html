          <p>Italian luxury brand Prada is facing accusations of cultural appropriation from artisans in Kolhapur, India, after releasing a line of sandals with a striking resemblance to the traditional Kolhapuri design. Local artisans, who handcraft the leather sandals for a fraction of Prada's expected retail price, have expressed outrage. The controversy has prompted Prada to acknowledge the sandals' origins and has sparked a broader debate about the protection of traditional crafts. Industry associations are now seeking better recognition and potential profit-sharing to support the artisans keeping the centuries-old craft alive.</p>

          <p>A recent public display of emotion by a UK politician has reignited the conversation about the acceptability of crying in the workplace. The article explores differing views, with some considering it a sign of weakness or instability, while others see it as a mark of emotional intelligence and humanity. Executive coaches and employees share experiences, highlighting a shift away from the traditional belief that professionalism requires suppressing all emotion. The discussion suggests that while biases still exist, many modern workplaces are becoming more compassionate and understanding of employees' emotional well-being.</p>

          <p>New research reveals that tiny marine creatures called zooplankton are crucial allies in the fight against climate change, locking away vast amounts of carbon in the deep ocean. These animals gorge on carbon-rich phytoplankton near the surface in Antarctica, grow fat, and then sink to the depths to burn this fat over winter. This process, known as the seasonal vertical migration pump, sequesters an estimated 65 million tonnes of carbon annually, equivalent to the emissions of 55 million cars. The discovery highlights the underappreciated importance of these creatures to the planet's climate regulation.</p>

          <p>A pair of male Humboldt penguins, named Scampi and Flounder, are successfully raising a chick at the Chester Zoo in the United Kingdom. Zookeepers entrusted one of two eggs laid by another pair to the male couple to improve the survival chances for both chicks. This event is part of a successful breeding season for the vulnerable species at the zoo. Same-sex penguin parenting has been observed in other zoos, with both parents typically sharing incubation and feeding duties, contributing to conservation efforts for the at-risk species.</p>

          <p>Germany's women's football team started their Euro 2025 campaign with a 2-0 win over Poland, thanks to goals from Jule Brand and Lea Schüller. However, the victory was overshadowed by a potentially serious knee injury to team captain Giulia Gwinn, who left the field in tears during the first half. Given her history of two previous ACL injuries, her participation in the rest of the tournament is now in significant doubt. While the win provides a solid start, the team will be anxiously awaiting the results of an MRI to determine the extent of their captain's injury.</p>
