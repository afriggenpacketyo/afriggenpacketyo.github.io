          <p>In a significant development at the Tour de France, pre-race favorite Remco Evenepoel has abandoned the competition during a challenging mountain stage in the Pyrenees. Evenepoel, who was third overall, faltered on the first climb of stage 14 and had to withdraw. Meanwhile, Dutch cyclist Thymen Arensman clinched his first-ever stage win. Race leader Tadej Pogacar slightly extended his overall lead by finishing second on the stage, just ahead of his main rival, Jonas Vingegaard, who placed third.</p>

          <p>Indiana Fever guard Kelsey Mitchell addressed the public discourse surrounding the fan treatment of Chicago Sky's Angel Reese, urging for a focus on humanity over race. Mitchell emphasized that Reese is a formidable player and that women in the league should support each other against disrespectful online commentary. The article also references a past WNBA investigation into alleged hateful comments against Reese by fans, which was not substantiated. The ongoing rivalry between Reese and Caitlin Clark continues to draw significant attention and record viewership to the league.</p>

          <p>Los Angeles Dodgers third baseman Max Muncy is recovering from a left knee bone bruise much quicker than initially expected, providing a potential boost for the team's struggling offense. Although first projected to miss six weeks, Muncy is already running, playing catch, and taking swings without significant discomfort. Doctors informed him he narrowly avoided a more severe, season-ending injury. His return could be crucial for the Dodgers, who have seen a significant offensive decline since their slugger was sidelined earlier in July.</p>

          <p>The British men's 4x400m relay team from the 1997 world championships was awarded their gold medals in a ceremony at the London Diamond League, 28 years after the event. The team was upgraded from silver after the original winners, the United States, were disqualified due to a doping admission by team member Antonio Pettigrew in 2008. The athletes received a warm reception from the 60,000-strong crowd. The belated ceremony highlights the long-term consequences of doping in sports and corrects a historical injustice.</p>

          <p>Bestselling author and self-made millionaire Scott Galloway argues that the worst career advice billionaires give is to "follow your passion," calling it a luxury for those who are already wealthy. Instead, Galloway advocates for a more practical approach: finding an intersection between one's talents and what is financially viable. He emphasizes that success often comes from enduring rejection and pivoting when necessary, rather than blindly pursuing a passion. The article suggests that combining personal strengths with profitable opportunities is a more effective path to career success.</p>

          <p>FC Barcelona has reportedly initiated talks to sign Manchester United forward Marcus Rashford, a move the player has favored since falling out with his club's management. The proposed deal is structured as an initial loan with an option to buy, which would provide significant wage bill relief for Manchester United. Rashford, one of the club's highest-paid players, has been training separately from the first team and was not given a squad number for the new season. The transfer would see him join the Spanish champions under manager Hansi Flick.</p>

          <p>This article fact-checks a recurring social media claim that sunscreen use increases the risk of skin cancer, finding it to be false. Health officials and scientific studies confirm there is no evidence to support this assertion. The rising number of diagnosed skin cancer cases is attributed to factors like better diagnostics, increased awareness, and more time spent outdoors, not sunscreen itself. While global sunscreen sales are rising, data shows inconsistent use, and experts emphasize that proper sun protection remains a critical tool for preventing skin cancer.</p>

          <p>Activist investment firm Elliott Management has reportedly acquired a stake in the payment processing company Global Payments. This move comes after the company's stock fell significantly following its controversial and complex acquisition of Worldpay and divestiture of its Issuer Solutions business. The article suggests Elliott's involvement could restore investor confidence, which has been shaken by management's perceived poor track record with large integrations. An activist presence on the board could enforce accountability, an M&A moratorium, and better execution of the Worldpay integration. (not investment advice)</p>
