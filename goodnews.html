        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>New data from the UK's Department for Education reveals a strong link between school attendance in the first week of term and persistent absence throughout the year. Figures show that 57% of pupils who missed some school in the first week of September 2024 later became "persistently absent," compared to just 14% of those with full attendance. Education Secretary Bridget Phillipson is urging schools and parents to prioritize attendance from day one to improve student outcomes, as overall absence rates remain higher than pre-pandemic levels.</p>

          <p>This opinion article posits that Indonesian President-elect Prabowo Subianto is positioned to introduce a new model of "constructive pragmatism" to international relations. As a leader of a major economy that bridges competing global ideologies, Indonesia is not tied to a single political camp. The article suggests Prabowo could leverage this unique position to champion a diplomatic framework focused on cooperation over confrontation, offering a practical alternative to the current, often dysfunctional, international system.</p>

          <div class="timestamp">2025-08-30 18:04:19 EDT</div>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Director Guillermo del Toro's long-awaited adaptation of "Frankenstein" has premiered at the Venice Film Festival, starring Oscar Isaac as Victor Frankenstein and Jacob Elordi as his creation. The ambitious, nearly two-and-a-half-hour film is described as a passion project for del Toro, who has been developing it for decades. Early reviews are divided, with some critics praising its epic scale, beauty, and artistry as one of del Toro's finest works, while others found it somewhat lacking in substance despite its visual mastery.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>The US Open has been marked by several high-profile displays of anger from top tennis players, including Daniil Medvedev, Stefanos Tsitsipas, and Jelena Ostapenko. The article explores potential reasons for the heightened emotions, citing the pressures of the final Grand Slam of a long season, the intense and vocal New York crowds, and the individual players' histories of volatility. Fellow players like Jessica Pegula and Coco Gauff suggest that the New York environment amplifies drama that might otherwise be less noticed on the tour.</p>

          <p>This article examines the historical cooperation between China and the United States during World War II as a potential foundation for improving current strained relations. It highlights forgotten stories of collaboration, such as American airmen being protected by Chinese villagers, as a reminder of a shared past. The piece suggests that remembering this joint history, ahead of the 80th anniversary of Victory Day, could offer a formula for building better bilateral ties from a grassroots, historical perspective.</p>

          <p>Tennis player Jelena Ostapenko has issued a social media apology for telling opponent Taylor Townsend she had "no education" following their match at the U.S. Open. Ostapenko explained that as a non-native English speaker, she was attempting to comment on what she perceived as poor tennis etiquette, not Townsend's intelligence. In response, Townsend acknowledged the apology, stating it was a learning lesson for Ostapenko and that it's better to focus on oneself rather than trying to control others.</p>

          <p>The town council of Machynlleth, Wales, has denied a proposal from a local hotel to silence the town's historic clock between midnight and 7:00 a.m. The hotel owner argued that the clock, which chimes every fifteen minutes, leads to regular complaints from guests, making the request reasonable. However, councillors rejected the plan, stating that the chimes are an integral part of the town's character, especially after a recent £55,000 restoration of the 150-year-old landmark.</p>

          <p>This article synthesizes advice from doctors, psychologists, and educators on managing screen time for children at different developmental stages. The consensus recommends being screen-free until age three to allow for sensory exploration, followed by limited and supervised use in kindergarten and elementary school to foster imagination and social skills. While acknowledging the difficulty of restricting adolescents, experts stress the importance of open communication about online content and habits over strict time limits, and for parents to model healthy digital behavior.</p>

Everton boss David Moyes praised Grealish as a "maverick" who is making a significant difference, suggesting the player is motivated to prove his quality after limited playing time at his parent club, Manchester City.</p>

The environmental agency, Natural Resources Wales, had cautioned that moving fish during extreme heat can cause more harm, but the residents felt they had no choice but to act.</p>
