          <h2>Canada Withdraws Digital Services Tax to Resume Trade Negotiations with the U.S.</h2>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Canada has rescinded its controversial digital services tax, which was set to take effect and apply retroactively to large technology firms. The decision came after U.S. President Donald Trump announced a halt to all trade discussions with Canada in protest of the 3% levy, which he described as discriminatory against American companies. Following the reversal, Canadian Prime Minister Mark Carney confirmed that trade negotiations have resumed, aiming to secure a comprehensive economic and security agreement. The tax was originally intended to address a gap where major tech companies earned significant revenue from Canadians without being taxed locally.</p>

          <p>A black bear has been spotted for the second time in recent weeks in Greene County, Ohio, prompting a public reminder from local police and wildlife officials. The Yellow Springs Police Department confirmed the sighting on social media, humorously naming the bear "Mosey" and advising residents that it is likely just looking for food and solitude. The Ohio Department of Natural Resources (ODNR) reiterated that black bears are typically shy and will avoid humans. To prevent encounters, ODNR advises residents to secure trash, take down bird feeders, and keep pet food indoors, while emphasizing that people should not approach or feed the animal.</p>
