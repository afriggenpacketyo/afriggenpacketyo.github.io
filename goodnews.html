          <p>A power outage disrupted the final day of the Cannes Film Festival, with French authorities investigating possible arson at an electrical substation. The outage affected 160,000 households and disrupted traffic and train service in Cannes. Despite the disruption, festival organizers confirmed that all scheduled events, including the Palme d'Or ceremony, would proceed as planned using an independent power supply. The Palme d'Or was awarded to Jafar Panahi's "It Was Just an Accident."</p>

          <p>President Trump delivered a commencement address at West Point, congratulating cadets and claiming credit for rebuilding the U.S. military. He detailed a shift in U.S. foreign policy, emphasizing a move away from nation-building crusades.

          <p>Billy Joel has canceled his summer concerts after being diagnosed with normal pressure hydrocephalus (NPH), a condition causing issues with hearing, vision, and balance. Doctors advised against performing, and Joel is undergoing physical therapy, hoping to return to the stage. NPH occurs when cerebrospinal fluid builds up in the brain, and while symptoms can be mistaken for normal aging, it is treatable with surgery to relieve pressure. By going public, Joel aims to raise awareness and help others seek timely medical attention.</p>

          <p>The cost of driving lessons is increasing, creating financial strain for learners, with instructors justifying the prices due to their own rising expenses. Many learners are forced to cut back on lessons, prolonging the learning process, while a backlog in practical tests requires learners to take more lessons to maintain their skills. Some individuals are delaying learning to drive altogether due to the high costs, impacting their ability to access jobs and other opportunities. The Transport Secretary has pledged to reduce driving test waiting times to no more than seven weeks by summer 2026.</p>

          <p>Young American men are increasingly joining Russian Orthodox churches, drawn to a perceived sense of traditional masculinity and a rejection of modern American values. These churches, particularly those within the Russian Orthodox Church Outside Russia (ROCOR), promote traditional gender roles and home-schooling, attracting converts who feel alienated by mainstream culture. Some converts express concerns about negative American views on Russia and embrace the church's stance on issues like contraception and same-*sex* marriage. This trend reflects broader political shifts and a search for identity among men in a rapidly changing society.</p>
