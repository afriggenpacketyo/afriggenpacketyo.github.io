          <p>A Santa Cruz sea otter, potentially the infamous "841" or a new individual, has resumed its curious and bold behavior of attacking surfers and stealing their boards at Steamer Lane. Two years after 841 garnered international attention for similar antics, this un-tagged otter exhibits identical patterns, leading to speculation about its identity or a learned behavior. Federal wildlife officials previously attempted to capture 841 without success, and currently, the state agency has no plans to intervene. This ongoing interaction highlights unique animal behaviors and the challenges of managing wildlife in close proximity to human recreation.</p>

          <p>As clocks go back and darkness increases, particularly in northern UK regions like Orkney and Shetland, many individuals face challenges like Seasonal Affective Disorder (SAD). This recurring seasonal depression, characterized by low mood and anxiety, affects over a million people in the UK. Experts recommend developing "light routines" and embracing outdoor life, with initiatives like Orkney's "Wintering Well" boxes offering therapeutic lamps and activity guides. The article suggests adopting Scandinavian cultural attitudes towards winter by creating cozy interior light environments and utilizing available daylight to mitigate SAD symptoms, promoting mental well-being during darker months.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>The Treasury Select Committee has strongly advised Chancellor Rachel Reeves against cutting the cash ISA tax-free allowance in the upcoming Budget, arguing it would likely fail to promote an investment culture in the UK. Reeves is reportedly considering reducing the cash ISA limit from £20,000 to £10,000 to encourage investment in stocks and shares, amidst a £22bn budget shortfall. However, the committee, supported by banks and consumer campaigners, believes such a move would not achieve its intended effect and could harm savers. The decision highlights a tension between government fiscal needs and supporting individual savings. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>A quiet shift is occurring in UK driving, with automatics now comprising one-third of cars and a quarter of driving tests, driven by the impending 2030 ban on new petrol and diesel cars. New drivers face the dilemma of choosing between a manual license, offering versatility, and an automatic, which restricts them to automatics/EVs. Many prefer automatic for an easier test, but face challenges like fewer instructors and higher lesson costs. While the manual test has a higher pass rate, accessibility for individuals with disabilities and the future dominance of electric vehicles are influencing this evolving choice.</p>

          <p>Counting for the Irish presidential election is set to begin, following Friday's polls to elect the 10th Irish president, succeeding Michael D. Higgins. Two primary contenders, independent Catherine Connolly and Fine Gael candidate Heather Humphreys, vie for the position, alongside Jim Gavin whose withdrawal came too late for ballot removal. Early indications suggest a potentially low turnout. Connolly, backed by left-wing parties, and Humphreys, a former cabinet minister, represent different political backgrounds. The results, tallied across 43 constituencies, are expected to be announced later Saturday at Dublin Castle.</p>

          <p>Magnesium has emerged as a popular supplement, with a booming global market, touted for benefits ranging from improved sleep to digestion and mental health. While magnesium is crucial for over 300 bodily processes, including nerve function and blood sugar regulation, experts caution that supplements are primarily beneficial for those with a deficiency, which is difficult to diagnose. Social media influencers often promote various magnesium compounds, but strong scientific evidence for their widespread positive effects on healthy individuals is limited. Dietitians recommend focusing on magnesium-rich foods first and consulting professionals, as excessive intake can pose health risks, particularly for those with kidney disease.</p>
