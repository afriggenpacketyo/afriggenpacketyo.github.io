        </div>
        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Dell Technologies CEO Michael Dell stated that while demand for AI computing power is currently "tremendous," the proliferation of AI data centers will eventually reach a saturation point, though no signs of this are evident yet. His company's server networking business saw significant growth, up 58% last year, fueled by the evolving needs of large language models and customers like xAI and CoreWeave. Dell highlighted energy supply as a critical constraint, with major tech firms investing billions but facing challenges in securing adequate power for these massive facilities. The article suggests that despite engineering efforts for energy efficiency, the sheer scale of AI infrastructure will ultimately require massive energy consumption that may not be readily available, posing a significant challenge.</p>

          <p>England midfielder Jordan Henderson admitted to experiencing "tough moments" and suggested he might have made "different decisions" after his controversial move from Liverpool to Saudi Arabia's Al-Ettifaq. Henderson, a vocal supporter of LGBTQ+ rights, faced widespread criticism for joining a country where same-sex relationships are illegal, leading to his apology upon joining Ajax six months later. Now back in the Premier League with Brentford and the England squad, he maintains his Saudi move wasn't why he missed the Euros.

          <p>An analysis indicates some erosion of support within Donald Trump's 2024 voter coalition, particularly among Hispanic/Latino Americans and young people. While an overwhelming majority of Republicans and conservatives still back him, economic perceptions are identified as the biggest risk to this alliance. These voters, who initially supported Trump due to dissatisfaction with the status quo and economic conditions, are now expressing disapproval as the economy remains a concern. The article suggests this shift is more a reaction to underlying economic conditions and a desire for change, rather than a direct political statement against Trump himself.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>A bipartisan group of U.S. lawmakers is advocating for a "dramatic" expansion of export controls on chip manufacturing equipment to China, urging allies to align with these restrictions. Congressman John Moolenaar emphasized that countrywide technology controls are essential for limiting Chinese semiconductor advancement, stating current controls "leak like a sieve." The House Select Committee on the Chinese Communist Party's report argues that existing restrictions are insufficient, as Chinese entities can still evade controls without formal corporate links. This article highlights ongoing efforts to strengthen technological competition and national security against China.</p>

          <p>A psychology expert suggests that true happiness stems from contentment rather than material wealth, outlining five rules for a more satisfied life. The article emphasizes appreciating the ordinary, understanding that the happiest individuals are the most content, and recognizing that desiring what you lack fuels unhappiness. It also highlights how low expectations can create "psychological wealth," citing an example of a grandmother-in-law who was content despite living on little money. Ultimately, happiness is defined as the state where nothing is missing, irrespective of one's lifestyle, focusing on the gap between expectations and circumstances.</p>

          <p>Tesla has launched more affordable versions of its Model Y SUV and Model 3 sedan, with the Model Y standard variant priced just under $40,000 and the Model 3 starting around $37,000.

          <p>Illegal crossings at the US-Mexico border have plummeted to their lowest level in over 50 years, according to federal data obtained by CBS News. During the first eight months of the Trump administration, fewer than 9,000 illegal crossings were recorded monthly, a significant drop from the previous administration. White House spokeswoman Abigail Jackson attributed this success to President Trump's policies, including troop deployment, ending asylum requests, and expanding ICE's arrest powers. This article highlights a dramatic shift in border enforcement and its immediate impact on migration statistics, which the administration frames as a fulfillment of campaign pledges.</p>
