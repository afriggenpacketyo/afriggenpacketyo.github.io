          <p>UK Prime Minister Sir Keir Starmer has arrived in Egypt to participate in an international peace summit in Sharm El-Sheikh, focused on formalizing a Gaza peace plan. Starmer is expected to acknowledge the significant contributions of US President Donald Trump, alongside Egypt, Qatar, and Turkey, in brokering the recent ceasefire and initial hostage exchange agreement. The summit aims to solidify the truce, ensure the delivery of urgently needed humanitarian assistance to Gaza, and lay the groundwork for a durable peace and security in the Middle East. This diplomatic gathering is considered a pivotal moment for resolving the two-year conflict and addressing regional stability.</p>

          <p>US President Donald Trump has boldly declared "the war is over" in Gaza as he embarks on a diplomatic trip to Israel, coinciding with the expected release of hostages under the recent ceasefire agreement. Speaking aboard Air Force One, Trump lauded the efforts of Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu and Qatar, a key mediator in the negotiations. The ceasefire, which commenced Friday, is facilitating the exchange of hostages for Palestinian prisoners and the delivery of increased humanitarian aid to Gaza. President Trump is slated to address Israel's parliament, the Knesset, and later co-chair an international summit in Egypt focused on securing enduring peace and stability in the Middle East.</p>

          <p>Eighteen-year-old darts sensation Luke Littler secured his inaugural World Grand Prix title, delivering a dominant 6-1 victory over world number one Luke Humphries in Leicester. Despite Humphries achieving a slightly higher average in the final, Littler's exceptional precision and composure, particularly in winning five of his six sets through final-leg deciders, proved decisive in earning him the £120,000 prize. This triumph marks Littler's seventh PDC major televised title, significantly narrowing the financial gap between him and Humphries at the top of the PDC's order of merit. The intense rivalry now sets the stage for a compelling battle for the world number one ranking ahead of the upcoming World Championships.</p>

Discovery, a move poised to dramatically alter the Hollywood media landscape. Warner Bros. Discovery's board has rejected Paramount's initial offer of around $20 per share, but discussions are reportedly continuing, with expectations of a revised bid. This potential merger is largely motivated by Paramount's strategic need to expand its content library to better compete with dominant tech and streaming platforms such such as Netflix and Amazon. Warner Bros. Discovery, which includes HBO, CNN, and its prolific studio, has been actively reducing its considerable debt and had previously announced plans to divide its assets.</p>

          <p>Indian Prime Minister Narendra Modi and Chinese President Xi Jinping recently convened, agreeing their nations should function as "partners" rather than "rivals" and committing to a "fair, reasonable and mutually acceptable settlement" for their border dispute. This landmark meeting, Modi's first visit to China in seven years, indicates India's strategic pivot to mend historically strained relations with China and forge a coalition of eastern powers. The article suggests this diplomatic overture also serves as a subtle rebuff to US President Donald Trump's unexpectedly firm stance on India. Both leaders envision their strengthened ties as fundamental to a multipolar global order and the dawn of a new Asian century.</p>

          <p>Matt Cross, a first-time competitor hailing from Lincolnshire, has been crowned the World Conker Champion following a fiercely contested event in Northamptonshire. The 60th annual competition attracted 256 participants from nine different countries and garnered increased attention due to last year's cheating scandal. In response, organizers implemented stringent "airport-style" security checks, including scanners and magnets, to ensure fair play, even leading to the disqualification of one individual attempting to use their own conker. Cross expressed his astonishment at the victory, attributing his success to a combination of "force and accuracy" alongside a degree of chance inherent in the game. The event successfully navigated concerns about potential cancellation caused by a summer drought impacting conker availability.</p>

          <p>A recent agreement in Schleswig-Holstein, formalizing the option for Muslim employees and students to request unpaid leave on two major Islamic holidays, has sparked public debate in Germany. While tabloids sensationalized the news as "extra holidays" for Muslims, legal scholars and the Ministry of Education clarified it merely formalizes an existing legal practice rooted in religious freedom. The article highlights Germany's patchwork of state-regulated religious holidays, predominantly Christian, and the ongoing national conversation about integration and cultural identity. It emphasizes that the agreement extends the same principles of religious observance to Muslims as are already afforded to other faiths, without creating new entitlements.</p>

In the Donetsk region, near Dobropillia, Ukrainian forces also continued their counteroffensive actions. These reports come amidst conflicting accounts from Ukraine and Russia regarding battlefield situations, with President Putin previously claiming Russian forces had captured 5,000 sq. km of territory this year.
