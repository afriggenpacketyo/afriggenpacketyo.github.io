          <p>A SpaceX Falcon 9 rocket successfully launched the Crew-11 mission, carrying an international team of four astronauts to the International Space Station. The crew, comprising members from NASA, Japan's JAXA, and Russia's Roscosmos, will spend six months in orbit conducting scientific research. This mission is notable as it marks the first spaceflight for commander Zena Cardman, whose original flight was rescheduled due to issues with Boeing's Starliner spacecraft. The launch continues SpaceX's role as NASA's primary partner for transporting astronauts, a partnership that began in 2020.</p>

          <p>A crew of four astronauts, whose mission was previously delayed by ongoing problems with Boeing's Starliner, has successfully launched to the International Space Station aboard a SpaceX capsule. The flight provides a ride for astronauts who were sidelined, including commander Zena Cardman, to make room for the return of the Starliner test pilots on a different SpaceX craft. This launch highlights the current reliability of SpaceX for crewed missions in contrast to the technical challenges and delays grounding the Starliner program. The crew is scheduled for at least a six-month stay on the orbiting laboratory.</p>

          <p>150 years after his death, Danish author Hans Christian Andersen remains a globally celebrated figure whose fairy tales continue to captivate audiences. Rising from a difficult childhood, his stories like "The Ugly Duckling" and "The Little Mermaid" explore timeless themes of social injustice, longing, and personal transformation. While often seen as children's stories, his work contains subtle social criticism and profound messages that resonate with both young and old readers. Andersen's legacy is cemented by countless adaptations, including famous Disney films, and the prestigious children's literature award that bears his name.</p>

          <p>The U.S. Border Patrol reported a new record low for monthly apprehensions at the southwest border, with only 4,399 recorded in July. This figure represents a dramatic decrease from the peak of the crisis during the previous administration, which saw over 249,000 apprehensions in December 2023. The Trump administration attributes the sharp decline to its enforcement policies, including the deployment of troops and the replacement of the CBP One app with a self-deportation tool. For the third consecutive month, there were zero migrant releases into the U.S., signaling a significant shift in border management.</p>

          <p>As summer temperatures rise, portable neck cooling fans have gained popularity as a way to beat the heat, but their actual effectiveness is debated. These devices work by blowing air across the neck and face, which can enhance the body's natural cooling process of sweat evaporation. However, experts note that in high humidity, this process is less effective, and the fans primarily create a sensation of being cooler rather than significantly lowering core body temperature. While users report feeling more comfortable, physiologists caution that this could lead to a false sense of security, potentially causing overexertion in dangerous heat.</p>

          <h2>UK Government Restricts Civil Service Internships to Applicants from Lower Socio-Economic Backgrounds</h2>

          <p>The UK government has announced a significant change to its civil service internship program, restricting eligibility exclusively to university students from lower socio-economic backgrounds. The policy, driven by Chancellor of the Duchy of Lancaster Pat McFadden, aims to increase representation from working-class families within Whitehall. A student's background will be determined by their parents' occupation when they were 14. Successful interns will be prioritized for the Fast Stream graduate program, a primary entry point into the civil service, in an effort to make the institution more reflective of the country it serves.</p>

          <p>Utility workers installing an underground gas network in Lima, Peru, have discovered two pre-Incan tombs estimated to be over 1,000 years old. One of the tombs contained the remains of an individual from the Chancay culture, found wrapped in a bundle and accompanied by ceramic vessels and other artifacts. This discovery highlights the rich archaeological landscape of Lima, where hundreds of ancient sites are located beneath the modern city. The gas company, Cálidda, has a history of such finds, having made over 2,200 archaeological discoveries during its two decades of excavation work in the region.</p>

          <p>Amid economic uncertainty, annuities can provide a guaranteed retirement income stream, but it is crucial to understand several key principles before investing. This article outlines five important rules, including keeping total annual fees below 1% and not committing funds to a deferred annuity unless you can wait at least a decade for returns. It also advises using annuities to first cover essential living expenses and limiting the total allocation of your retirement portfolio to annuities to no more than 25%. These guidelines can help prospective buyers make informed decisions and avoid common financial pitfalls. (not investment advice)</p>
