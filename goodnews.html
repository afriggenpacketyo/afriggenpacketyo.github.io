        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>The UK government is set to allocate an ¬£86 billion package to the science and technology sector in the upcoming Spending Review. The funding aims to support research into drug treatments and longer-lasting batteries, with up to ¬£500 million earmarked for regions across the UK to direct towards local expertise. Chancellor Rachel Reeves stated that investing in the sector would create jobs and boost security. However, research backers have cautioned that the government needs to address issues such as visa costs for scientists and financial challenges at universities to maintain the UK's reputation for science on the world stage.</p>

          <p>Archaeologists have excavated an ancient workshop on the Greek island of Paros, revealing a trove of unfinished marble sculptures and other artifacts. The workshop, located at the Floga archaeological site, dates back to the late 5th to the 4th century BC. Excavations uncovered new architectural remains, eating vessels, storage items, and rooms with well-preserved walls. The findings indicate the site was reorganized at the end of the third century B.C., serving as both a residential space and a sculpture workshop, providing insights into ancient Greek artistic practices.</p>

          <p>Space agencies and commercial companies are increasingly focused on returning to the moon, driven by the prospect of using it as a gateway to Mars and for scientific research. NASA and ESA are collaborating on the Artemis program, aiming to establish a permanent base at the moon's south pole. Simultaneously, China and Russia are jointly planning to construct the International Lunar Research Station by 2035. The moon's appeal lies in its abundant resources, including iron, silicon, hydrogen, and rare earth elements, which could support lunar bases and future missions. These lunar bases could also serve as transit points for astronauts traveling to Mars.</p>

          <p>An analysis of the upcoming UK Spending Review suggests that the Labour government must use this opportunity to demonstrate a confident and deliverable economic vision to the private sector and international investors. While the government is planning a substantial allocation for long-term capital spending, concerns remain about whether it can effectively execute these plans. The article questions whether the government, with its large majority, will prioritize long-term challenges like industrial energy prices and social care costs or succumb to short-term political pressures. The review also highlights the need for the government to learn from past capital spending failures and ensure that investments are strategically directed to boost economic growth.</p>

          <p>Chinese researchers have utilized a rare mineral, tellurium, to develop an artificial retina that restored sight in blind animals and granted them the ability to see infrared light. The mineral, a byproduct of copper refining, has excellent photoelectric properties that convert light into electrical energy. The study, published in Science, demonstrates the potential for treating human blindness by replacing damaged photoreceptor cells with tellurium-based nanowire implants.

          <h2>Subsidizing Male Childcare Could Ease China's Demographic Crisis</h2>

          <p>New research suggests that subsidizing men's participation in household chores and childcare could help reverse declining birth rates in countries like China. The study, co-authored by researchers from Fudan University and the University of Hong Kong, argues that subsidies for fathers produce significantly higher long-term fertility gains than solely subsidizing mothers. The findings come as China faces a rapidly aging population, shrinking workforce, and strained social welfare system. The study also found that traditional expectations placing the burden on women to perform most childcare duties persist in China, clashing with rapid economic changes.</p>
