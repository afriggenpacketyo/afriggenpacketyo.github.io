          <p>Nvidia has clarified that it is not sending graphics processing unit (GPU) designs to China, despite reports of a potential research and development center in Shanghai. The company stated that it will not modify GPU designs to comply with U.S. export controls, following a Financial Times report suggesting CEO Jensen Huang discussed the new center with Shanghai's mayor. The center was intended to assess how to meet U.S. restrictions while catering to the local market, but production and design will remain outside of China.</p>

          <p>CoreWeave, an artificial intelligence infrastructure provider, has experienced a significant surge in its stock value, increasing nearly 60% this week, boosting its market cap to approximately $38 billion, more than doubling since its IPO in late March. This growth is attributed to a reported 420% revenue increase in its first earnings report as a public company and guidance surpassing full-year expectations. Additionally, Nvidia's disclosure of a 7% stake in CoreWeave, now worth around $2 billion, has further fueled investor confidence in the company's potential within the booming generative AI market.</p>

          <p>Eight stocks within Jim Cramer's Charitable Trust portfolio, including Meta Platforms, Goldman Sachs, Microsoft, Palo Alto Networks, Texas Roadhouse, Disney, Nvidia, and Broadcom, have turned positive for the year after a significant market rally. This rebound followed a period of market downturn driven by concerns over President Trump's tariffs, which briefly pushed the S&P 500 into bear market territory. The recovery underscores the importance of staying invested during market volatility, as these stocks erased their losses and benefited from easing U.S.-China trade tensions and business deals announced during Trump's Mideast tour.

          <p>Home equity line of credit (HELOC) interest rates have experienced fluctuations in 2025, influenced by the Federal Reserve's decisions to maintain the federal funds rate. After a period of decline that saw rates reach an 18-month low in January and a two-year low in March, HELOC rates have recently increased slightly in response to market conditions. Despite these recent upticks, HELOC rates remain relatively affordable compared to alternatives like personal loans and credit cards, making them an attractive option for borrowers seeking financing, particularly with potential rate cuts anticipated later in the year.</p>

          <p>Following a report revealing high levels of arsenic in rice brands sold across the U.S., experts recommend several strategies to reduce exposure, including using rice alternatives like quinoa and barley, which contain substantially lower levels of heavy metals. Other suggestions include looking at labels to identify the growing region, as rice grown in California has lower arsenic levels than rice grown in the Southeast U.S., and cooking rice like pasta by using 6 to 10 cups of water per 1 cup of rice and draining the excess water before eating.</p>
