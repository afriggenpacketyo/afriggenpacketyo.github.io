          <p>A federal appeals court has partially granted a stay, allowing the Trump White House to restrict Associated Press (AP) access to spaces like the Oval Office. The court's decision temporarily blocks a lower court ruling that deemed the ban unconstitutional, arguing these spaces are not public forums. The ruling permits the White House to selectively admit journalists based on viewpoint, citing presidential independence. The AP, which reaches billions daily, sued after being denied access for refusing to rename the Gulf of Mexico as the Gulf of America in its Stylebook. The White House plans to expand access to new media outlets. The tone of the article is neutral, reporting on the legal back-and-forth and the White House's stance.</p>

          <p>Kilmar Abrego Garcia has returned to the U.S. to face federal charges after being mistakenly deported to El Salvador nearly four months ago. An indictment unsealed on Friday shows Abrego Garcia facing charges of conspiracy to transport aliens and unlawfully transporting undocumented people. Maryland Senator Chris Van Hollen stated that the case is about upholding constitutional rights, not about the individual. ICE admitted Abrego Garcia's deportation was due to an administrative error, and a federal judge and the Supreme Court ordered his return. The Trump administration has alleged Abrego Garcia is a member of MS-13, allegations his attorneys deny.</p>
