          <p>An anonymous group buried a treasure chest filled with gold and San Francisco artifacts somewhere in the city and posted clues on Reddit. The treasure, valued at over $10,000, was found within eleven hours by three friends in Mount Sutro Open Space Reserve. The chest contained items such as a gold nugget, silver and copper coins, baseball cards featuring Barry Bonds, and a ticket to the 1939 Golden Gate International Exposition. The organizers expressed surprise at the speed of the discovery and hinted at the possibility of another treasure hunt in the future.</p>

          <p>A new genetics study traces the migration of the first people to colonize the Americas from Asia 20,000-30,000 years ago. Researchers sequenced the genomes of 1,537 individuals from 139 ethnic groups in northern Eurasia and the Americas and compared them with ancient DNA. The study reveals that early settlers split into isolated groups, with genetic codes showing how these groups adapted to different environments. The findings are particularly important for understanding and preserving the cultural heritage of endangered Indigenous groups, such as the Kaw√©sqar people of Patagonia.</p>
