          <p>Following recent fighting prompted by a militant attack in Indian-administered Kashmir, a ceasefire between India and Pakistan appears to be holding. During these military exchanges, Chinese-supplied weaponry played a significant role in Pakistan's defense capabilities against India's arms, which come from Russia and the West. China stands as Pakistan's primary arms supplier, accounting for 81% of its arms imports between 2020 and 2024, as reported by the Stockholm International Peace Research Institute. Key Chinese weapons used by Pakistan include the Chengdu J-10C Vigorous Dragon fighter jet, considered the most upgraded version of the J-10 series, equipped with advanced radar and compatible with advanced Chinese munitions.</p>

          <p>During his visit to Saudi Arabia, former President Trump received a warm and opulent welcome from Crown Prince Mohammed bin Salman, underscoring the strong diplomatic and business ties between the two families. Trump was escorted through Saudi airspace by fighter jets and traveled to the Royal Court in Riyadh with an Arabian horse guard, where he admired the gold-leaf d√©cor reminiscent of his own Mar-a-Lago estate. Trump also attended the Saudi-U.S. Investment Forum, where he toured a gallery showcasing the history of Saudi-American partnership and visited Diriyah, a historic town being developed into a tourism hub. The visit highlighted the close relationship between Trump and the Saudi royals, contrasting with the cooler reception President Biden received in 2022.</p>

          <p>French President Emmanuel Macron has expressed openness to discussing the potential deployment of French nuclear weapons in other European countries. He noted that the United States already stations nuclear-armed aircraft in Europe and stated that France is ready to open this discussion.

Germany and other Eastern European countries have expressed interest in the proposal amid concerns about Russian aggression and the reliability of the US' nuclear commitment to Europe.</p>
