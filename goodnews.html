          <p>As autumn brings a rise in respiratory illnesses, this article provides expert advice on distinguishing symptoms of colds, flu, and COVID-19. Colds typically begin gradually, affecting the nose and throat, while flu often includes aches, fevers, and muscle weakness. COVID-19 may present with loss of smell or taste, a "razor-sharp" sore throat, or diarrhea, especially with new variants. Dr. Oscar Duke recommends rest, paracetamol or ibuprofen for symptom relief, and adequate hydration. The article also discusses the limited evidence for Vitamin C but supports Vitamin D supplements in colder months, alongside cautionary advice for decongestant use.</p>

          <p>Yunnan, China's primary coffee-producing region, has significantly boosted its coffee and derivative product exports, reaching US$1.1 billion in the first eight months of 2025. This surge, driven by record-high global coffee futures and rising raw bean prices, reflects a 358% year-on-year increase in export volume for 2024. The booming overseas demand is also catalyzing industrial reforms, with local factories upgrading technology to meet evolving consumer needs. Yunnan's coffee is now shipped to over 30 countries, including Germany and Vietnam, solidifying its position as a major player in the global coffee market and providing a windfall for local growers.</p>

          <p>Don Rea Jr., President of the PGA of America, issued a belated apology for the "disrespectful" and "inappropriate" fan behavior at this year's Ryder Cup, after initially downplaying the abuse. European players, including Rory McIlroy and his wife, endured vitriolic insults, homophobic slurs, and even a thrown beer. Rea's initial comparison to "a youth soccer game" drew criticism, but he now acknowledges that some conduct "clearly crossed the line." This apology follows CEO Derek Sprague's earlier condemnation and personal apology, highlighting the organization's efforts to address the controversy and uphold the sport's integrity.</p>

This development follows recent Trump administration investments, including a 5% equity stake in Lithium Americas and a 15% stake in MP Materials, aimed at reducing US dependence on China. Humpton expressed support for these government deals, emphasizing the need for multiple players to build out the marketplace. USA Rare Earth is developing a mine in Texas and a magnet production facility in Oklahoma, aligning with the administration's goal to boost American manufacturing competitiveness.</p>

          <p>Following a deadly attack on a Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints chapel in Michigan, a church member from Utah, David Butler, initiated a crowdfunding campaign for the gunman's family. The gunman, Thomas Jacob Sanford, killed four and injured eight before being killed by police, leaving behind a wife and chronically ill son. Butler, citing Christian principles of loving enemies and caring for the vulnerable, aimed to raise $10,000 but has received over $300,000. Despite backlash, Butler emphasizes the family's victimhood, highlighting their sudden loss of a father and economic support, and the collective empathy shown by thousands of donors.</p>

          <p>Chinese investors holding US$21 billion in gold exchange-traded funds (ETFs) are experiencing substantial gains, with gold prices reaching a 50-year high. Swiss banks Julius Baer and Lombard Odier predict further increases to around US$4,000 an ounce in the next year, while JPMorgan is even more bullish. Gold is seen as an effective diversifier and hedge against political and economic risks, benefiting from a weaker dollar, robust central bank demand, and concerns over government debt. The 13 gold ETFs on Shanghai and Shenzhen exchanges have returned 42% this year, reflecting a global trend of central banks increasing gold reserves. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>The EAT-Lancet Commission has released a major update to its "planetary health diet" report, advocating for a varied menu of nuts, legumes, whole grains, fruits, and vegetables, with less meat, dairy, and sugar.

Despite widespread scientific acceptance, the report faces renewed, coordinated misinformation campaigns, often linked to the meat and dairy industry. The report emphasizes that it offers flexible guidelines, not a restrictive diet, and aims to counter disinformation with rigorous science and relatable examples.</p>

          <p>California's Department of Motor Vehicles (DMV) has introduced a redesigned driver's license and identification card, incorporating new security measures. Starting Wednesday, newly issued cards will feature a first-in-the-nation digital signature on one of the barcodes, and the magnetic strip has been removed. The new aesthetic includes California's redwoods, poppies, and coastline, replacing previous imagery. Existing licenses remain valid until their expiration date, and renewals cost $45 for licenses and $39 for IDs. These periodic updates aim to improve security and combat counterfeiting, building on previous enhancements like the REAL ID program implemented after 9/11.</p>

Coach JJ Redick has emphasized intense drills and running, which Doncic and teammates have embraced. While teammates like Gabe Vincent praise Doncic's "greatness" and court vision, the team is still adapting to his reactive style of play.

          <p>The Trump administration has achieved a significant victory by securing a deal with pharmaceutical giant Pfizer to lower drug costs in the United States. Pfizer pledged to match the lower prices it charges other developed countries for its drugs and participate in TrumpRx, a new website offering discounted medications. This marks a breakthrough for Trump, who has long criticized drugmakers for high US prices and previously failed to secure such concessions. The deal was reportedly motivated by the administration's threat of 100% tariffs on drug companies not manufacturing in the US, granting a three-year exemption as incentive. While the full impact on patients remains unclear, it signals a shift in power dynamics within the pharmaceutical industry.</p>

          <p>College rankings, now a cultural staple, began as a controversial experiment, evolving from informal lists to the influential U.S. News & World Report. Edwin Embree's 1934 "eminence" list sparked outrage and consumer demand, foreshadowing the impact of modern rankings. Early attempts, like Kendric Babcock's 1911 classification, were suppressed due to controversy. The article highlights how rankings gained traction as higher education became a mass-consumer good post-WWII, shaping public perception and student destinies. While methods have evolved to include more metrics, institutions have also learned to "game" the system, reflecting the enduring anxiety and strategic responses to these influential evaluations.</p>

          <p>China is undergoing a profound economic transformation, driven by a new generation of entrepreneurs and consumers, rather than experiencing stagnation. This cohort, born after the famine era, differs from their predecessors by being technically trained, innovation-driven, and adept at co-creation with government and other partners. Many hail from provinces known for strong business cultures and blend past experiences of scarcity with current market opportunities. This entrepreneurial dynamism is fostering competitiveness at scale and deepening China's integration into global systems, highlighting a resilient and restructuring economy that is often overlooked when viewed solely through a lens of challenges.</p>
