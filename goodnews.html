          <p>Nvidia CEO Jensen Huang has downplayed concerns that the company's advanced chips could be utilized by the Chinese military, arguing that China already possesses sufficient computing capacity and cannot rely on American technology that could be restricted at any time. He reiterated his criticism of U.S. export controls, stating that for America to lead in AI, its technology must be available to global developers, including the large community in China. These comments come as Huang prepares for another trip to China, navigating the complex relationship between Washington's security policies and Nvidia's market access. The discussion highlights the ongoing tension between national security and the commercial interests of U.S. tech giants.</p>

          <p>Singapore's economy grew by 1.4% in the second quarter, successfully avoiding a technical recession after contracting in the previous quarter. The growth, which surpassed analysts' expectations, was primarily driven by a strong performance in the manufacturing sector, which benefited from businesses front-loading exports ahead of potential tariff changes. Despite the positive figures, the Ministry of Trade and Industry warned of significant downside risks for the second half of the year due to global economic uncertainty, particularly surrounding U.S. tariff policies. Economists remain divided on the outlook, with some forecasting a slowdown while others expect growth to continue. (not investment advice)</p>

          <h2>Archaeologists Unearth Multistory Buildings in Ancient Egyptian City</h2>
          <div class="timestamp">2025-07-14 04:00:51 EDT</div>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>In the Nile Delta, archaeologists have discovered the remains of multistory buildings in the ancient Egyptian city of Imet, now known as Tell el-Fara’in. The excavation, a collaboration between British and Egyptian experts, utilized remote sensing and satellite imagery to identify dense architectural remains, including tower houses with thick foundation walls. These structures, dating to the Ptolemaic Period, suggest Imet was a thriving, densely populated urban center. The findings, which also include granaries and a ceremonial road, provide new insights into the urban planning, religious life, and economic activity of the region during that era.</p>

In an interview, Bailey stated that he believes the path for rates is downward, citing economic "slack" that should help reduce inflation. His comments follow recent data showing a drop in job vacancies to their lowest level since 2021 and are seen by analysts as a strong signal that a rate cut is likely at the Bank's next meeting in August. The potential cuts aim to stimulate an economy that contracted in both April and May. (not investment advice)</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>China's exports grew by 5.8% in June, exceeding economists' forecasts, largely due to a temporary 90-day tariff truce with the United States that encouraged front-loading of shipments. The data also showed a notable surge in exports of steel and rare earths, while imports saw their first increase of the year. Despite the positive short-term results, analysts caution that this export momentum may not be sustainable, given the persistent uncertainty over future U.S. tariff policies. The strong trade figures are expected to help China's Q2 GDP growth remain close to the government's 5% target. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>China's top leadership has recently signaled a policy shift to address what it calls "disorderly and low-price competition" within its domestic market. This phenomenon, known as 'neijuan' or involution, refers to excessive competition that leads to diminishing returns for businesses. The rhetoric echoes the 2015 "supply-side structural reform" initiative, which targeted excess capacity in industries like steel and coal. However, analysts note that tackling the issue today is more complex due to a different economic landscape characterized by weaker growth, limited fiscal space, and a larger role for private firms.
