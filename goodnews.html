          <p>The U.S. has announced a significant trade deal with Japan, which President Trump described as the "largest ever," involving reciprocal 15% tariffs. Japan is also set to invest $550 billion in the United States, a move projected to create hundreds of thousands of jobs. The agreement includes opening Japan's market to American cars, trucks, and agricultural products. This development comes after Japanese Prime Minister Shigeru Ishiba's coalition lost its majority, potentially strengthening the U.S. negotiating position. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>A new student loan repayment plan, named the "Repayment Assistance Plan" (RAP), was established as part of the "big beautiful bill" signed into law by President Trump. As an income-driven repayment option, RAP will calculate monthly payments based on a borrower's adjusted gross income, ranging from 1% to 10%. The plan, available by July 2026, will offer loan forgiveness after 30 years and includes benefits like a monthly bill reduction for dependents. For new borrowers after that date, RAP and the standard repayment plan will be the only two options available. (not investment advice)</p>
