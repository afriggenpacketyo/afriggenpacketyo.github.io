          <p>Elon Musk confirmed Tesla has secured a major semiconductor deal with Samsung Electronics, valued at $16.5 billion. The contract, running until 2033, is for Samsung to produce Tesla's next-generation AI chips at its new Texas facility. This strategic partnership is crucial for Tesla's future AI development, even as Samsung's foundry business faces competition and challenges in other areas like high-bandwidth memory chips. The deal highlights the increasing importance of custom silicon for advanced automotive and artificial intelligence applications.</p>

          <h2>Analysis: US-EU Tariff Agreement Seen as Major Trump Victory but Not a Total Loss for Brussels</h2>

          <p>The new framework trade deal between the U.S. and the European Union is being framed as a significant political win for President Donald Trump. The EU accepted a 15% baseline tariff on many goods, a substantial increase from previous rates, though less than the 30% threatened. In return, the EU avoided a full-blown trade war and secured zero tariffs on key exports like pharmaceuticals and semiconductors, while committing to large purchases of U.S. energy and arms. The agreement removes economic uncertainty for a sluggish European economy, a trade-off Brussels deemed necessary despite the concessions. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>The southern Chinese tech hub of Shenzhen has introduced new rules mandating leniency for researchers whose government-funded innovation projects fail. The policy states that innovators should not be punished or held accountable if their projects stall due to reasonable issues like technical difficulties or market changes, provided there was no misconduct. This move is designed to encourage researchers to "boldly explore uncharted territories" and take risks without fear of reprisal. The rules aim to foster a more forgiving environment for scientific and technological exploration in the region.</p>

          <p>Five Eastern Caribbean nations are experiencing a spike in demand for their "citizenship by investment" programs, largely fueled by Americans seeking a backup plan amid political and social volatility. Countries like Antigua and Barbuda offer a passport, and its associated visa-free travel benefits, in exchange for a real estate purchase starting around $200,000. While these programs are a vital source of revenue for the small island nations, they face scrutiny from the EU and US over concerns about security and financial crime. For wealthy buyers, the programs offer an "insurance policy" and potential tax advantages.</p>

As part of the deal, the EU has committed to investing hundreds of billions in the U.S., including major purchases of American energy and military equipment. While the 15% rate is a concession by the EU, the deal averts a more damaging economic conflict.</p>

These findings have sparked a fierce debate, challenging the long-held narrative that civilization and literacy spread from northern to southern India. The discovery has become a symbol of Tamil pride and identity, fueling a political battle between state and federal authorities over the interpretation and control of the historical narrative. The site's significance is now contested by archaeologists, historians, and politicians, reflecting deep-rooted cultural divides.</p>
