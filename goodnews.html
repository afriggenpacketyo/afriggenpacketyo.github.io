          <p>Pfizer has announced a deal to acquire weight-loss drugmaker Metsera for an enterprise value of $4.9 billion, which could rise to $7.3 billion based on future milestones. This strategic move aims to bolster Pfizer's position in the lucrative obesity drug market after the company faced significant setbacks with its own candidates. Metsera brings a promising pipeline of oral and injectable treatments, including a GLP-1 drug that showed positive results in early trials. The acquisition is seen by analysts as a way for Pfizer to accelerate its entry and compete with market leaders Eli Lilly and Novo Nordisk.</p>

          <p>Meta's new AI-powered smart glasses are being adopted by the blind and visually impaired community as a tool to enhance daily independence. The technology, when paired with apps like "Be My Eyes," connects users with volunteers or uses AI to perform tasks such as reading menus, identifying objects, and navigating public spaces. While advocates like the National Federation of the Blind praise the technology as a useful step forward, they also note its current limitations, such as battery life and occasional inaccuracies. The glasses are viewed as a supplemental aid that can make life easier but do not replace traditional skills and human assistance.</p>

          <p>A senior White House official has clarified the terms of a preliminary deal to prevent a U.S. ban on TikTok, stating that the federal government will not take an equity stake or a "golden share" in the new entity. The popular video app's U.S. operations will be based in a new joint venture with a majority-American board of directors, and tech giant Oracle will be responsible for overseeing its security operations. This structure addresses national security concerns raised by Congress about the app's Chinese parent company, ByteDance, while allowing the platform to continue operating in the United States.</p>

          <p>An earthquake with a preliminary magnitude of 4.3 struck the San Francisco Bay Area early Monday morning, centered near Berkeley. The shaking was felt widely across the region, with over 22,000 people reporting the event to the U.S. Geological Survey. While the quake woke many residents and caused a temporary slowdown of the BART transit system for track inspections, there were no immediate reports of significant damage or injuries. City officials in San Francisco confirmed that first responders were assessing any potential impact from the early morning tremor.</p>

          <p>Germany's state-owned railway, Deutsche Bahn, has appointed Evelyn Palla as its new CEO to lead a major overhaul of the beleaguered system. The company has been plagued for years by severe delays, frequent cancellations, and dilapidated infrastructure, with only 63.4% of long-distance trains running on time in the first half of the year. The German government is backing a new plan that includes billions in investment to renovate dozens of critical routes by 2036. Palla and the transport minister have set a more realistic punctuality target of 70% by 2029 as the extensive repair work gets underway.</p>

          <p>The organizers of the annual World Conker Championships in Northamptonshire feared the event might be canceled due to a shortage of usable conkers. A record-hot and dry summer, linked to climate change, caused horse chestnut trees to drop their nuts prematurely before they could fully mature. Facing a potential cancellation, the event's organizer issued a public appeal for help. The call was met with a nationwide response, and with enough suitable conkers now sourced from across the country, the quirky competition is set to proceed as planned.</p>

          <p>Amid speculation that the Trump administration may announce a link between acetaminophen use during pregnancy and autism, leading medical experts and organizations are pushing back, stating the evidence does not support such a claim. The American College of Obstetricians and Gynecologists affirmed that there is no clear proof of a direct relationship and that Tylenol remains one of the safest pain relief options for pregnant women. While some small studies have suggested a possible association, larger and more robust research, including a recent study of 2.5 million children, found no increased risk of autism from acetaminophen use.</p>

Key drivers include the fundamental economic principles of supply and demand, broader global economic conditions, and inflation rates, as gold is often used as a hedge against eroding currency value.

          <p>Manchester City's recent draw against Arsenal has highlighted a significant tactical shift by manager Pep Guardiola, whose team recorded its lowest-ever possession percentage in a Premier League game. The move to a more defensive formation, featuring four central defenders by the end of the match, suggests a departure from the possession-based style that has defined his career. This cautious approach is seen by some analysts as part of a broader trend at the highest level of football, where physical, defensive strategies are gaining prominence over the pass-heavy paradigm that Guardiola himself helped establish.</p>

Her daily habits include avoiding looking at her phone for the first 30 minutes to protect her prefrontal cortex, hydrating with warm water and a pinch of salt, and getting direct exposure to morning sunlight to set her body's circadian rhythm. The final step is engaging in some form of physical movement, even if brief, to release dopamine and norepinephrine, which she says boosts mood, sharpens focus, and improves learning for hours afterward.</p>

          <p>The number of "solopreneurs," or businesses with no paid employees, is booming in the United States, now contributing $1.7 trillion to the national economy. This trend is fueled by a convergence of factors, including the accessibility of artificial intelligence as a virtual assistant and the power of social media platforms like TikTok to build a customer base instantly. Experts note that technology has significantly lowered the barriers to entry for starting a business. This economic shift also reflects a growing preference among workers for flexibility, autonomy, and purpose over traditional corporate career paths.</p>

          <p>With the Federal Reserve beginning a cycle of interest rate cuts, financial experts are advising savers that the high returns recently seen on cash will diminish. As rates on high-yield savings accounts and money market funds are expected to fall, now may be an opportune time to lock in higher rates for a fixed period. Certified financial planners suggest considering Certificates of Deposit (CDs), which allow savers to secure a specific return for a set duration, such as one to five years. However, it is important to balance the higher returns of CDs with the need for liquidity for emergency funds. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>Following a recent downward trend, home lending experts are forecasting that mortgage interest rates will likely continue to fall modestly through the end of the year. The initial descent is attributed to the Federal Reserve's first rate cut of the year and signs of a cooling economy, including a slowing job market. While further rate cuts from the Fed are anticipated, experts caution that their impact on mortgage rates is indirect and that any future drops will likely be gradual rather than dramatic. They advise prospective homebuyers to get pre-approved to be ready to act if rates become more favorable. (not investment advice)</p>
