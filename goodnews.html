          <p>Chinese Foreign Minister Wang Yi described the relationship between China and Russia as more mature and stable than any other major global partnership. The statement came during a meeting with his Russian counterpart, Sergey Lavrov, where preparations for Vladimir Putin's upcoming visit to Beijing were a top priority. Both ministers emphasized their commitment to implementing the consensus reached by their heads of state and collaboratively addressing global challenges through their comprehensive strategic coordination. This meeting precedes a broader Shanghai Cooperation Organisation gathering.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Bitcoin's price surged past the $120,000 mark to set a new record, a rally largely attributed to significant inflows into Bitcoin exchange-traded funds (ETFs). Institutional buyers are seen as the primary drivers of this momentum, with bitcoin ETFs logging over $1.18 billion in a single day. The rally is also fueled by growing investor confidence as the U.S. Congress moves closer to passing clearer regulatory legislation for the digital asset industry. Analysts suggest the cryptocurrency could reach $125,000 in the coming months, though potential U.S. Federal Reserve policies remain a risk. (not investment advice)</p>

          <h2>China's Export Growth Surpasses June Expectations Amid U.S. Tariff Truce</h2>
          <div class="timestamp">2025-07-14 01:55:14 EDT</div>
        </div>
        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>China's exports grew by 5.8% in June, exceeding forecasts, as shipments to non-U.S. markets like Southeast Asia and the European Union remained robust. A temporary tariff truce with the U.S. also helped slow the decline in exports to America, while imports saw their first year-over-year growth in 2025. This trade performance has helped offset weak domestic demand, though economists caution that momentum could falter due to continued uncertainty over U.S. tariff policies. The trade surplus for the first half of the year stands nearly 35% higher than the previous year. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>Nvidia CEO Jensen Huang has downplayed U.S. fears that China's military could leverage his company's advanced artificial intelligence chips. In a recent interview, Huang argued that China cannot truly rely on American technology because access could be restricted at any time, and that the country already possesses significant computing capacity. He reiterated his criticism of U.S. export controls, suggesting they are counterproductive to maintaining America's global tech leadership. Huang continues to navigate a delicate path between appeasing Washington and maintaining access to the critical Chinese market.</p>

          <p>In Hungary, the 1,000-year-old Pannonhalma Archabbey is undertaking a massive preservation project to save a quarter of its library from a severe beetle infestation. Restoration workers are removing approximately 100,000 centuries-old books to undergo a six-week disinfection process in an oxygen-free, pure nitrogen environment to kill the pests. The drugstore beetles, attracted to the starch-based adhesives in the bookbindings, have caused significant damage. Restorers believe the infestation may have been worsened by climate change, as warmer temperatures allow the beetles more reproductive cycles annually.</p>

Originally a biennial U.S.-Australia exercise, it has expanded significantly and is being held partly in Papua New Guinea for the first time. Australian defense officials fully expect Chinese surveillance ships to monitor the naval exercises, a practice that has occurred since 2017.

          <p>Chinese electric vehicle manufacturers like BYD, XPeng, and MG are rapidly capturing market share in Norway, which is considered a key test market for EVs in Europe. These brands have secured roughly 10% of the Norwegian market by offering technologically advanced and competitively priced vehicles, posing a challenge to Tesla and other Western automakers. Unlike the U.S. and E.U., Norway has not imposed tariffs on Chinese EVs, allowing for direct competition. This success in Norway's EV-friendly environment is seen as a crucial entry point for Chinese brands into the broader continent.</p>

          <p>To combat soaring electricity consumption, India's government has proposed a new rule requiring all new air conditioners to have a default minimum temperature setting of 20 degrees Celsius (68°F). With 10 to 15 million AC units sold annually, officials hope this small change will yield massive energy savings and help prevent power shortages. The country's demand for energy, largely met by fossil fuels, is a major contributor to emissions. While some experts support the move, they also argue that mandating more energy-efficient units would have an even greater impact.</p>
