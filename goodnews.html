          <h2>Trump Announces Initial Terms of Trade Agreement with the United Kingdom</h2>

          <p>President Trump and Prime Minister Keir Starmer have announced the initial framework of a trade deal between the U.S. and the U.K. from the Oval Office, which aims to increase trade while maintaining certain tariffs. The agreement includes increased access to the U.K. market for U.S. agricultural products and reduced non-tariff barriers, with Britain set to reduce or eliminate discriminatory practices against U.S. products. The deal also involves keeping a 10% tariff on U.K. imports, with exemptions for the first 100,000 vehicles, and Rolls Royce engines not being subject to tariffs. The framework is expected to generate $6 billion in revenue for the U.S. and includes a British airline purchasing $10 billion in Boeing planes.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Despite the imposition of tariffs by the United States, China's exports experienced an 8.1% year-on-year increase in April, demonstrating resilience in the face of trade pressures. This growth exceeded market expectations, though exports to the U.S. specifically saw a decline of 21%. Meanwhile, China's imports contracted slightly by 0.2% year-on-year. The country's trade surplus for April was recorded at US$96.18 billion, a decrease from the previous month. The U.S. had announced reciprocal tariffs on Chinese imports, leading China to retaliate with duties on American goods.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Developed nations are beginning to diversify their tungsten supply sources after China imposed export restrictions on critical industrial metals, including tungsten. The restrictions, part of China's retaliation against U.S. tariffs, have caused panic in the industry, which has relied on Chinese raw materials for 30 years. The element is crucial for cutting tools, ammunition, and clean energy applications. The US defense contractors must stop using Chinese tungsten by January 1, 2027. China accounted for 82.7 per cent of global raw tungsten ore mined last year.</p>

          <p>The U.S. government has granted refugee status to 54 Afrikaners, white South Africans of Dutch descent, who are scheduled to arrive in the U.S. The move follows President Trump's executive order prioritizing humanitarian relief for Afrikaners facing racial discrimination in South Africa. The Afrikaners have been given P1 refugee status, providing them with a pathway to U.S. citizenship and government benefits. The South African government has criticized the decision, arguing that Afrikaners are among the most economically privileged in the country.</p>

          <p>An Arizona court allowed the use of an AI-generated likeness of a man killed in a road rage incident to deliver a victim impact statement during the sentencing of his killer. Stacey Wales, the victim‚Äôs sister, created the AI avatar of her brother, Christopher Pelkey, to speak at the sentencing. The video, which included a disclaimer about its AI origin, made a favorable impression on the judge, who praised its message of forgiveness. While some legal experts are concerned about the potential for manipulation, others found no ethical or legal issues with its use in the sentencing phase.</p>

          <h2>Analysts Assess the Impact of US-UK Trade Deal</h2>

        </div>
        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Analysts are offering mixed reactions to the new trade deal between the US and the UK, with some describing it as a symbolic political victory for President Trump while others point to its limited substantive benefits. The deal maintains existing tariffs on most UK goods but rolls back some import taxes on strategic sectors like cars and steel. In return, the US secured expanded access for American agricultural products in the UK market. Experts suggest the deal primarily serves Trump's goal of having an agreement, regardless of its actual impact.</p>

          <p>President Trump announced a trade agreement with Britain, increasing market access for American farm exports. The agreement allows Britain to export 100,000 cars per year into the U.S. with a 10 percent tariff, while the U.S. will remove its additional tariffs of 25 percent on steel and aluminum. The deal expands market access for American farm products, such as beef and bioethanol, and reduces nontariff barriers. This agreement provides some hints for other countries on where the Trump administration stands on its tariff approach.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>India appears ready to strike a trade deal with the U.S., potentially at the cost of some of its domestic manufacturing ambitions. Recent reports suggest India has proposed zero tariffs on imports of steel, auto components, and pharmaceuticals from the U.S. on a reciprocal basis up to a certain quantity. Analysts suggest that even if the deal involves India abolishing tariffs on certain sectors, it won't be particularly detrimental to all of those industries. A trade deal could also benefit logistics companies, while consultancy giants Tata Consultancy Services and Infosys are set to outperform, irrespective of a deal.</p>

          <p>Luke Pritchard of The Kooks and Richard Archer of Hard-Fi discuss the revival of British guitar bands in the 2000s and their recent resurgence. Both bands, which experienced success in the mid-2000s, are finding renewed popularity with younger audiences. They attribute this to a cyclical nature of music trends and the return of anthemic choruses. They reflect on the challenges facing new artists today, including the shrinking live music scene and the decline of music TV shows.</p>
