          <div class="timestamp">2025-05-17 17:50:01 EDT</div>
        </div>
        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Prime Minister Keir Starmer has indicated that a youth mobility scheme could be included in a new agreement with the EU, allowing young people to work abroad for up to two years on a reciprocal basis. The UK already has similar agreements with countries like Australia. While Starmer insists this isn't a return to pre-Brexit freedom of movement, critics like Kemi Badenoch view it as "free movement through the back door." The proposal aims to address gaps in sectors like hospitality and creative industries, but details on eligibility and quotas remain unclear. Universities and students note that Brexit has made studying in the UK less attractive, and this scheme could help reverse that trend.</p>

          <p>Former President Donald Trump has publicly rebuked Walmart after the retailer warned that tariffs would necessitate price increases for consumers. Trump suggested Walmart and China should "eat the tariffs" rather than passing costs onto customers. Walmart CFO John David Rainey cited unprecedented price increases due to tariffs, despite some relief from earlier levels. Walmart maintains it will try to keep prices low and expects suppliers to absorb some costs. The situation is unfolding as other companies like Microsoft and Mattel also warn of tariff-related price hikes.</p>

          <p>The Atlantic Coast Conference (ACC) reported record revenues and member payouts for the 2023-24 season, reaching approximately $711.4 million, with an average of nearly $45 million distributed to its football-playing members. However, legal expenses surged by 70.2% to over $12.3 million due to lawsuits from Clemson and Florida State challenging exit fees. The launch of the ACC Network has significantly boosted TV revenue. Commissioner Jim Phillips emphasizes the league's efforts to generate more revenue amidst growing financial gaps with the Big Ten and Southeastern conferences, even as the conference has revamped its revenue-distribution plan to factor in TV viewership and reward top-draw schools.</p>

          <p>Paleontologists have discovered a 500-million-year-old fossil of a three-eyed predator named Mosura fentoni, nicknamed the "sea moth," in the Burgess Shale of the Canadian Rockies. This creature, part of the extinct group radiodonts, was about the length of an index finger and had a circular mouth lined with teeth. The discovery reveals that Mosura had a more complex anatomy than previously known for radiodonts, with a multi-segmented abdomen-like region lined with gills, similar to modern arthropods. The findings provide new insights into the diversity of life during the Cambrian period.</p>
