          <p>President Trump is scheduled to hold a rally at a U.S. Steel plant in Pennsylvania, a week after suggesting he approved a controversial merger with Japan's Nippon Steel. Investors and union members are keen to understand the structure of the deal, particularly after President Biden previously blocked the acquisition on national security grounds. Trump has described the deal as a "partnership" that would keep U.S. Steel headquarters in Pittsburgh and involve a significant investment from Nippon. Senator Dave McCormick indicated that the U.S. government would retain a "golden share" to influence board appointments and ensure production levels are maintained. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>President Trump hosted a press event to celebrate Elon Musk as the Tesla CEO concluded his official government service after leading the Department of Government Efficiency (DOGE) for four months. Musk's departure coincides with the exit of several top staffers from DOGE, including Steve Davis and Katie Miller. Despite public clashes with Trump and Cabinet members on issues like tariffs and the federal budget deficit, Trump lauded Musk as "terrific" and stated that he would continue to assist the administration. Musk's DOGE aimed to cut government spending, but its reported savings have fallen short of initial predictions.</p>

          <p>Mondelez International, the maker of Oreo and Wheat Thins, has filed a lawsuit against Aldi, accusing the supermarket chain of copying its packaging designs. The lawsuit alleges that Aldi's store-brand products mimic the look and feel of Mondelez's popular snacks to mislead customers. Mondelez seeks monetary damages and a court order to prevent Aldi from selling these alleged look-alike products. Aldi has faced similar accusations in the past regarding its product packaging, as the company continues to offer budget alternatives to brand name products.</p>

          <p>Joe Flacco, the veteran quarterback for the Cleveland Browns, drew criticism from former Baltimore Ravens teammate Chris Canty for his candid remarks about mentoring younger quarterbacks. Flacco stated that he is not a mentor and focuses on playing football, leading Canty to argue that mentoring benefits the team by improving younger players. Canty emphasized the importance of sharing experience and knowledge within the quarterback room, especially given Flacco's age and potential for injury. Flacco is entering his second stint with Cleveland after a successful 2023 season where he earned Comeback Player of the Year honors.</p>

          <p>The CDC has updated its guidance on COVID-19 vaccines for children, now stating that healthy children "may receive" the vaccine, replacing the previous broad recommendation for all children. This change follows a directive from HHS Secretary Robert F. Kennedy Jr., who cited a review of data suggesting the risks of the vaccine outweigh the benefits for healthy children. The agency still recommends the vaccine for immunocompromised children and most adults. The CDC also removed the recommendation for COVID-19 vaccines during pregnancy, listing it as "No Guidance/Not Applicable," despite existing webpages still recommending vaccination for pregnant women.</p>

          <p>Jamie Dimon, CEO of JPMorgan Chase, is known for his cautious and often pessimistic views on the economy, even as his bank achieves record profits. Over the past two decades, Dimon has consistently warned of potential economic crises, geopolitical turmoil, and market meltdowns. Despite these warnings, JPMorgan has outperformed its rivals, generating record annual profits and becoming the world's most valuable publicly traded financial firm. Some analysts suggest Dimon's rhetoric serves to keep his management team focused on future risks and prevent complacency, while others believe it's a strategy to enhance his reputation as a cautious and thoughtful banker.

He emphasized that France does not want to depend on either China or the U.S., but rather cooperate with both for growth, prosperity, and stability.

        </div>
        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>The film *Bring Her Back* showcases Sally Hawkins as Laura, a foster mother with ulterior motives, who takes in two teen siblings, Andy and Piper, after their father dies. While the film provides an excellent vehicle for Hawkins, it swerves away from the youthful energy of the director's previous work, *Talk To Me*, and leans into a story about trauma and loss with a supernatural element. The film explores the nature of abuse that children can face from adults, though it is treated as a plot twist. The movie comes to life in the nastier, grislier set pieces, as the director showcases the portrayal of Laura's story, building to a devastating and intense conclusion about the extent of her loss and her inability to deal with it.</p>

Kell Morris was hiking with his wife below a glacier when a rock slide sent him into the creek, pinning his leg. His wife, Jo Roop, positioned his head out of the water and hiked to find cell service to call for help. A rescue crew arrived by helicopter and used tools to lift the boulder, working against the clock as the glacier-fed creek was rising.

Musk, wearing DOGE-branded apparel, stated that it was "not the end of DOGE, but the beginning" and that the team would continue to grow stronger. As head of DOGE, Musk oversaw cuts to government spending, particularly in humanitarian efforts, leading to criticism. While promising significant savings, DOGE currently estimates its efforts have saved $175 billion, though questions have been raised about the accuracy of these figures.</p>
