          <p>Warren Buffett's Berkshire Hathaway is reportedly in advanced talks to purchase Occidental Petroleum's petrochemical division, OxyChem, for approximately $10 billion. The acquisition could be finalized within days and would represent Berkshire's largest deal since its 2022 purchase of Alleghany, deploying a portion of its record $344 billion cash reserve. This move comes as Buffett prepares to step down as CEO, with his successor, Greg Abel, having deep expertise in the energy sector. Berkshire already holds a significant 28.2% stake in Occidental Petroleum, a position Buffett began building in 2022. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>The Supreme Court has issued a temporary stay preventing President Trump from firing Federal Reserve Governor Lisa Cook, allowing her to remain in her position until the court hears the case in January. This decision maintains, for now, the central bank's traditional independence from political interference from the White House. The case arose after Trump, who has been pressuring the Fed for lower interest rates, moved to oust Cook based on allegations of misstatements on a mortgage application, which she denies. Critics of the President's move argue that compromising the Fed's autonomy could lead to poor economic outcomes.</p>

          <p>Walmart has announced a plan to remove synthetic dyes and over 30 other ingredients, such as artificial sweeteners and certain preservatives, from its private-label food products by 2027. The change will impact approximately 1,000 items across brands like Great Value and is a response to consumer demand for simpler, more familiar ingredients. This move by the nation's largest grocer is expected to have a significant effect on the food market and follows similar initiatives by other major food manufacturers. The company stated that 90% of its private brand products are already free from synthetic dyes, aligning with its broader transparency goals.</p>

          <p>Internet connectivity is being restored across Afghanistan following a 48-hour nationwide blackout ordered by the Taliban government. The shutdown prompted widespread international condemnation, with the United Nations warning it could exacerbate the country's severe humanitarian crisis. The blackout disrupted businesses, flights, and access to emergency services, further isolating a population already facing significant restrictions. For many Afghans, particularly women and girls who are barred from education and most jobs, the internet serves as a crucial link to the outside world and a source of information and communication.</p>

Led by Jane Fonda, whose father was an original member, the committee includes artists like Spike Lee, Barbra Streisand, and Billie Eilish. In a public letter, the group states its mission is to defend constitutional rights against what they describe as a new, coordinated campaign to silence critics. Fonda characterized the current political climate as the "most frightening moment" of her life, emphasizing solidarity as the only effective response to repressive forces.</p>

          <p>The recent passage of the GENIUS Act stablecoin bill and the IPO of USDC issuer Circle are fueling mainstream adoption of dollar-pegged cryptocurrencies. Small and medium-sized businesses are now exploring stablecoins as a way to significantly cut down on payment processing fees, which totaled a record $187.2 billion in 2024. Companies like Prevail Coffee Roasters are testing payment apps that allow customers to pay with stablecoins, aiming for lower transaction costs and near-instantaneous settlement. Proponents believe this technology has the potential to disrupt the traditional credit and debit card payment systems by offering faster and more efficient transactions.</p>

          <p>British toy company Jellycat more than doubled its pre-tax profit in 2024, driven by a surge in demand from adults and Gen Z consumers. The company, known for its soft, huggable toys, saw revenue climb 66% to $449 million as more adults, or "kidults," purchase toys for comfort and nostalgia. This trend reflects a broader market shift, with adults now being the largest and fastest-growing segment of toy buyers, spending $1.8 billion in the first quarter of the year. Industry analysts suggest that in times of global turmoil, consumers are turning to nostalgic items that provide a sense of joy and escapism.</p>

          <p>Microsoft's Chief Technology Officer, Kevin Scott, announced the company's long-term strategy to primarily use its own custom-designed chips in its data centers for artificial intelligence workloads. While Microsoft currently relies heavily on GPUs from Nvidia and AMD, this move signals a strategic shift to reduce that dependence and optimize its entire system, from silicon to cooling. The company has already developed its own AI-focused chips, including the Azure Maia AI Accelerator and the Cobalt CPU. This vertical integration approach aims to achieve better price-performance and give Microsoft greater freedom in designing its data center infrastructure to meet massive AI demand.</p>

          <p>One of Nigeria's largest oil workers' unions, PENGASSAN, has ended its two-day strike at the Dangote refinery, Africa's largest, following a meeting with company management and government officials. The union initiated the strike after accusing the company of firing 800 unionized workers and replacing them with foreign labor. Under the agreement, the union will call off the strike while Dangote begins the process of transferring the dismissed employees to other companies within its group without any loss of pay. The company had previously stated the dismissals were part of a reorganization and denied the union's allegations.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Ford Motor reported an 8.2% increase in its third-quarter U.S. sales, with strong performances from its electric vehicle and large SUV segments. Sales of all-electric vehicles surged by 30.2% to a new quarterly record, while sales of larger SUVs also saw significant gains. The growth in EV sales was likely boosted by consumers rushing to purchase vehicles before federal incentives of up to $7,500 expired in September. Industry-wide, EV sales are expected to have hit a record high in the third quarter, capturing a market share of around 10%. (not investment advice)</p>
