          <p>The Federal Reserve has decided to keep its benchmark interest rate unchanged, maintaining a range of 4.25% to 4.5% as it continues to monitor economic conditions. The decision reflects ongoing concerns about elevated inflation, which remains above the Fed's 2% target, despite a solid GDP growth report. The committee was divided, with two members dissenting in favor of a rate cut, a rare occurrence highlighting the complex economic landscape. Officials indicated that future decisions, including a potential cut in September, will depend heavily on upcoming inflation and employment data. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>Meta CEO Mark Zuckerberg has articulated a new vision for artificial intelligence centered on creating "personal superintelligence" to empower individuals. This personalized AI could act as a companion, helping with personal tasks and goals, and would be integrated into devices like AI-powered glasses developed with Ray-Ban. This strategic pivot towards AI, away from the metaverse, coincides with strong financial performance, as Meta reported a 36% increase in quarterly profit. The company's focus on AI is seen as a move to future-proof its growth amid changing social media trends and antitrust scrutiny.</p>

The surge was fueled by 18% revenue growth, the fastest in over three years, driven by its booming Azure cloud computing business. If the gains hold, Microsoft will join Nvidia as the only two companies in the exclusive $4 trillion club, solidifying their positions as top beneficiaries of the artificial intelligence boom. This milestone further cements the shift in market leadership, with the two AI-focused giants now valued significantly higher than Apple. (not investment advice)</p>

          <h2>Kamala Harris Announces She Will Not Seek California Governorship in 2026</h2>

          <p>Former Vice President Kamala Harris has officially announced she will not run for governor of California, ending months of speculation about her next political move. Her decision opens up the race to lead the nation's most populous state, which had been largely frozen while potential candidates awaited her announcement. In her statement, Harris indicated her public service would not be in elected office "for now," but vowed to remain politically active by helping elect Democrats nationwide. The move leaves the door open for a potential third presidential campaign or other roles in public life, such as leading a nonprofit organization.</p>

          <h2>Analysis: Forgoing Governor's Race, Kamala Harris Keeps 2028 Presidential Path Open</h2>
          <div class="timestamp">2025-07-30 17:19:37 EDT</div>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Kamala Harris's decision to not run for California governor is being interpreted as a strategic move to keep a 2028 presidential bid viable. Running the nation's most populous state while simultaneously pursuing the presidency would have been practically and politically difficult, likely requiring her to swear off a White House run to win over California voters. By stepping back, she avoids these hurdles and can position herself as a national party leader without the constraints of state governance. While she would enter a 2028 primary with high name recognition, she would also face a potentially large field of Democratic rivals.</p>

          <div class="timestamp">2025-07-30 17:02:17 EDT</div>
        </div>
        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Ford has reinstated its full-year financial guidance after suspending it due to tariff uncertainty, now projecting an adjusted EBIT of $6.5 billion to $7.5 billion. This new forecast incorporates an estimated $3 billion gross impact from tariffs, of which the company believes it can offset $1 billion. For its second quarter, the automaker reported revenue that beat expectations but saw net income fall due to special charges, including a major vehicle recall. The company's performance reflects resilience in its commercial "Pro" division, while its "Model e" electric vehicle unit continues to post significant losses. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>A Senate committee has advanced legislation to ban members of Congress and their spouses from owning or trading individual stocks, with Republican Senator Josh Hawley joining all Democrats on the panel in an 8-7 vote. The bill, which now faces an uncertain future on the Senate floor, aims to prevent potential conflicts of interest and restore public trust. The vote featured a tense exchange between Hawley and fellow Republicans who defended wealth and the use of blind trusts. Former President Trump offered conceptual support for the bill before later attacking Hawley on social media for working with Democrats.</p>

          <p>The U.S. State Department has announced the repatriation of an American child from the al-Hol camp in northeastern Syria, a facility housing tens of thousands of people, mostly women and children with alleged links to ISIS. The child, who has spent their entire life in the camp, will be reunited with family in the U.S. The State Department used the announcement to reiterate its call for other nations to repatriate their own citizens from the camps, calling it the only "durable solution" to the humanitarian and security crisis. Conditions in the camps have long been described by human rights groups as dire and violent.</p>
