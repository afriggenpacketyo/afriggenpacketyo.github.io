        </div>
        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>In a detailed explanation of his investment philosophy, Warren Buffett categorizes investments into three types: currency-denominated assets like bonds, non-productive assets such as gold, and productive assets like farms or businesses. He argues that non-productive assets rely solely on the hope that someone else will pay more for them in the future, as they generate no intrinsic value. Buffett states his preference for productive assets, which are valued based on the output they can deliver over time, making them a more rational and dependable choice for long-term investment.</p>

          <p>Cities across the globe, including New York, London, and Montreal, are experiencing a transformation by prioritizing cycling over car traffic, leading to cleaner and quieter urban environments. This shift is driven by the construction of protected bike lanes, safer intersections, and traffic signal adjustments that make cycling a viable option for people of all ages. The rise of e-bikes has further expanded accessibility, and the combined benefits include reduced carbon emissions, lower transportation costs for families, and improved public health, signaling a positive evolution in urban planning.</p>

          <p>Following her recent death at age 87, this tribute celebrates Susan Stamberg as the foundational voice of National Public Radio. As the first woman to co-host a nightly news broadcast, her irreverent, boisterous, and curious style set NPR apart from traditional, sonorous news outlets. The article reflects on her key lessons for journalism, such as the importance of active listening and asking simple, profound questions. Stamberg is remembered for giving the network its unique personality and making it a companion in the lives of millions of listeners.</p>

          <h2>Examining the Deep Economic Interdependence Between the US and China Amid Trade Tensions</h2>

          <p>Despite an escalating trade war involving tariffs and export restrictions, the economies of the United States and China remain deeply intertwined. The U.S. relies heavily on China for rare-earth minerals and consumer goods, while China depends on American aerospace and semiconductor technology. In response to U.S. tariffs, Beijing has retaliated with its own measures, such as boycotting American soybeans and restricting mineral exports. However, China has also successfully redirected trade to other regions like Africa and Southeast Asia, reducing its dependency on the U.S. market.</p>

          <p>Several influential figures from England's Football Association are moving to Bay Collective, a new U.S.-based multi-club ownership group focused on women's soccer. High-profile recruits like former FA technical director Kay Cossington and England's general manager Anja van Ginhoven are drawn to the opportunity to build a progressive and sustainable ecosystem from the ground up. They describe the move as shifting from a large, slow-moving 'tanker' to a nimble 'speedboat,' allowing them to innovate quickly and put players at the center of their strategy.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>According to a Pew Research Center analysis, remarriage is a common outcome for divorced Americans, with two-thirds choosing to marry again. The data indicates that men are slightly more likely to remarry than women, and remarried households often achieve a higher median net worth than those of divorced individuals or even those in their first marriage. While divorce rates have generally declined since the 1980s, the trend of remarriage reshapes family structures, with nearly half of remarried individuals having a child with their new spouse.</p>

          <h2>Essay Argues the 'Cringe' Idealism of the Anti-Trump Resistance is a Strength</h2>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>This article analyzes the anti-Trump "Resistance" movement, arguing that its earnest and sometimes "cringe" idealism is not a weakness but a powerful tool against the cynicism of authoritarianism. While critics dismissed the movement's aesthetics, its grassroots organizing led to concrete political victories, such as the 2018 midterm elections. As the movement continues with protests like "No Kings," the essay suggests that its unironic belief in democracy and community provides a necessary antidote to political nihilism, turning perceived naïveté into a form of effective opposition.</p>
