          <h2>Analysis Suggests Trump's Tariffs Have Not Significantly Increased US Inflation</h2>
          <div class="timestamp">2025-06-27 15:13:19 EDT</div>
        </div>
        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Despite widespread concerns, President Trump's recent tariffs have not led to a significant spike in U.S. inflation, with key price indexes remaining relatively stable. Economists attribute this to several factors, including companies pre-ordering inventory to avoid duties, absorbing some costs to protect consumers, and utilizing legal loopholes like bonded warehouses to delay payments. While these short-term strategies have buffered the initial shock, experts caution that prices could still rise in the latter half of the year. The ongoing uncertainty surrounding trade negotiations has also made businesses hesitant to immediately pass on increased costs to customers.</p>

          <p>Cryptocurrency exchange Coinbase has emerged as the best-performing stock in the S&P 500 for June, driven by its recent inclusion in the index, positive regulatory news, and new product launches. The stock's rally is also fueled by its close revenue-sharing relationship with Circle, the issuer of the USDC stablecoin, which has seen its own stock soar. Analysts suggest that as legislative clarity for the crypto industry improves, such as with the passage of the GENIUS Act for stablecoins, investor sentiment is shifting. Coinbase is increasingly seen as a key way to invest in the evolution of crypto from a speculative asset to one with practical utility. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>The United States and China have finalized an agreement aimed at accelerating the shipment of rare-earth minerals to the U.S., a move that briefly sent stock markets to new highs. The deal addresses China's previous suspension of critical mineral exports, which had disrupted global supply chains for industries like automotive manufacturing and defense. As part of the understanding, China will streamline export permit approvals, and the U.S. will subsequently remove its countermeasures. This development signals potential progress in easing trade tensions, although the situation was complicated by a simultaneous announcement of terminated trade talks with Canada.</p>

        </div>

          <p>Homeowners with significant equity are weighing whether a home equity line of credit (HELOC) or a traditional home equity loan will be the more affordable borrowing option this summer. While both currently have similar interest rates, the variable nature of HELOC rates means they could decrease if the Federal Reserve enacts anticipated rate cuts. This positions HELOCs to potentially become cheaper, though they also carry the risk of rising rates if economic predictions are wrong. In contrast, home equity loans offer a fixed rate, providing certainty for borrowers who prioritize stable payments over potential future savings. (not investment advice)</p>

Cramer advises investors who have profited from the stock's surge to secure their initial investment by selling a portion of their holdings.

The Force, who finished low in the Super Rugby standings and are missing key players, are considered underdogs.

In 1996, the unconscious child was gently picked up by Binti Jua, who cradled him and carried him to a service door for zookeepers, protecting him from other gorillas. The event garnered international praise, with many attributing her actions to maternal instincts, as she had her own baby at the time. Binti Jua, now 37, still resides at the zoo, a living hero whose compassionate actions stand in contrast to other, more tragic zoo incidents.</p>

          <p>For Americans struggling with debt, forgiveness through negotiation can be a viable path to relief, particularly for certain types of unsecured debt. Credit card balances and personal loans are often the most negotiable, as creditors lack collateral and are motivated to recover some portion of the owed amount rather than risk a total loss. Medical bills are also frequently eligible for reduction through hospital assistance programs or direct negotiation for a lower lump-sum payment. In contrast, debts like buy now, pay later plans and payday loans can be more challenging to settle due to their structure and collection practices. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>Lorde's fourth album, 'Virgin,' marks a return to the electronic, rhythm-driven sound of her earlier work while exploring themes of desire, heartbreak, and self-discovery in her late 20s. The album is set against a New York City backdrop and attempts to capture a visceral, physical energy, but is often diluted by a pervasive self-consciousness. This review suggests that while Lorde's influence on modern pop is undeniable, her once-pioneering introspective style now feels insular and circular. The album's production, though aiming for radicalism, often falls back on familiar textures, resulting in a work that feels more like a compromise than a breakthrough.</p>

          <p>The Los Angeles County Museum of Art (LACMA) held its first preview event inside its new, long-awaited David Geffen Galleries building. After five years of construction and considerable debate over its design, VIPs and media were invited for a sneak peek featuring an immersive concert by jazz composer Kamasi Washington. Musicians were staged throughout the still-empty concrete galleries, giving guests a sense of the space before art installation begins. The sprawling, curvilinear structure, which crosses over Wilshire Boulevard, is a new city landmark, though questions remain about how the museum's collection will function within the unique space.</p>
