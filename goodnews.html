          <p>Following the death of Giorgio Armani at age 91, industry experts are reflecting on his dual legacy as both a revolutionary fashion designer and a masterful business leader. He successfully built a multi-billion dollar empire by maintaining creative control and adhering to a consistent vision of accessible, quiet luxury. Armani's expansion from high fashion into a wide range of lifestyle products, including perfumes, home furnishings, and even chocolates, was unified by his sophisticated design ethos. His strategic use of celebrity endorsements and the creation of the iconic 'power suit' for both men and women cemented his brand's cultural and commercial dominance.</p>

          <p>The large, 32-foot-tall "LAX" sign at the entrance to Los Angeles International Airport is being temporarily dismantled to accommodate a major roadway reconfiguration project. The construction aims to improve traffic flow, enhance pedestrian access, and create more direct routes to parking ahead of the 2026 World Cup and 2028 Summer Olympics. Airport officials state the project is a key part of a broader modernization program designed to create a more efficient, world-class airport experience. The iconic letters will be stored safely and relocated to a new position compatible with the updated road design upon the project's completion.</p>

          <div class="timestamp">2025-09-05 15:25:49 EDT</div>
        </div>
        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>The average rate for a 30-year fixed mortgage fell significantly to 6.29%, its largest one-day drop since August 2024, after the release of a weaker-than-expected jobs report. This decline provides some relief for potential homebuyers facing high home prices, as the lower rate can reduce monthly payments by a noticeable amount. However, it remains uncertain if this drop will be substantial enough to reinvigorate the housing market, as mortgage demand has remained sluggish. Some analysts suggest that rates would need to fall into the 5% range to truly stimulate buyer activity amid ongoing economic uncertainty. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>A 40-year-old California man, Benjamin Bucur, was found to be secretly living in the crawl space of an Oregon condominium complex. Sheriff's deputies discovered the space had been converted into a makeshift living area, complete with a bed, television, fan, and lighting powered by an extension cord run through a vent. A resident alerted authorities after seeing Bucur enter the crawl space late at night. Inside, deputies also found a pipe with methamphetamine residue, and Bucur was arrested. Records show he has a prior criminal history in California for burglary and auto theft.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>An employment tribunal judge in the UK has ruled that spending less than an hour of work time on personal online activities, such as shopping or browsing property sites, does not constitute a sackable offense. An accountancy administrator was awarded over £14,000 after being fired for unfair dismissal when her employer used spy software to track her computer usage. The judge noted that the time spent on personal matters was not excessive, a large portion was used for professional development, and the company had no clear policy against it. The ruling suggests the dismissal was motivated by the owner's desire to remove the employee before she could claim unfair dismissal rights.</p>

          <p>The reunion of the iconic British band Oasis is creating a wave of excitement in Los Angeles, with their upcoming Rose Bowl concert being hailed as the must-see rock event of the year. For 15 years, fans had resigned themselves to the Gallagher brothers' acrimonious split, but the tour has been met with rapturous reviews and a notable lack of drama. The event has spurred numerous themed parties, tribute band performances, and a pop-up merchandise shop, transforming parts of L.A. into a hub for Anglophiles. For many fans, the tour offers a joyful and communal escape from a difficult year.</p>

          <p>A significant portion of the 405 Freeway through the Sepulveda Pass will be partially closed this weekend as Caltrans begins a multi-year repaving project. The freeway will be reduced to three lanes in each direction along a 10.2-mile stretch between Van Nuys and Westwood, and transportation officials are urging motorists to find alternate routes. The $143.7 million project, which will ultimately restore 92 lane-miles and require up to 25 weekend closures, is scheduled for completion in winter 2028-2029. The upgrades aim to improve safety on a crucial and heavily trafficked commuter and commercial route.</p>

          <div class="timestamp">2025-09-05 14:24:28 EDT</div>

          <p>President Donald Trump has increased the cap on the state and local tax (SALT) deduction to $40,000 for the 2025 tax year, a significant change from the $10,000 limit imposed by his 2017 tax law. The SALT deduction, which primarily benefits taxpayers in high-tax states, allows itemizers to deduct state and local income and property taxes from their federal tax liability. Proponents argue the higher cap reduces double taxation, while critics point to the substantial cost, with estimates suggesting it will add over $142 billion to the national debt over the next decade.
