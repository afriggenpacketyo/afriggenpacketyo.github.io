          <p>The UK's Competition and Markets Authority (CMA) is considering requiring Google to make changes to its search services to ensure greater competition. Google accounts for over 90% of searches in the UK, and the CMA is investigating whether Google holds too much power in the market. Potential changes could include choice screens for users to access different search providers and increased transparency for publishers. Google has expressed concerns about the potential implications of these changes. The investigation aims to promote a more open, competitive, and innovative online search market in the UK.</p>

Formed in 1949 to deter Soviet expansion, NATO now has 32 members and acts as a collective security alliance. Article 5, the collective defense clause, is a cornerstone of the organization, stating that an attack on one member is an attack on all. The article also discusses NATO's open-door policy and the aspirations of countries like Ukraine to join the alliance.

The subdued Iranian response to U.S. strikes on its nuclear facilities also contributed to the market's calm. The market's reaction reflects a sense of fatigue with policy-driven volatility.</p>

          <p>Germany is facing pressure to increase its defense spending to 5% of GDP, a target that could require tax hikes and increased debt. The country currently spends around 2% of its GDP on defense. A jump to 5% would necessitate additional tens of billions of euros annually. Experts suggest that the increase would likely be financed through loans, funding cuts, and tax increases. The move raises questions about Germany's fiscal rules and the potential impact on the EU's fiscal stability. (not investment advice)</p>
