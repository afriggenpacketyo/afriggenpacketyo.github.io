          <div class="timestamp">2025-08-22 08:30:12 EDT</div>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>As the U.S. under President Trump retreats from global clean energy investment, with Trump labeling wind and solar "the scam of the century," Chinese cleantech firms are aggressively expanding into emerging markets. These companies are deepening their influence in regions like Southeast and Central Asia and Latin America by embedding proprietary technologies and promoting Chinese technical standards through joint ventures and Belt and Road-funded infrastructure. This strategic push allows China to assert itself as a global clean energy hub, transferring selective know-how while retaining control of critical intellectual property. This contrasts sharply with the U.S.'s diminishing role, creating a significant shift in the international clean energy landscape.</p>

          <p>China is preparing to host the largest-ever Shanghai Cooperation Organisation (SCO) summit in Tianjin, set to gather over 20 world leaders and 10 heads of international organizations. This significant event offers China a prime opportunity to assert its diplomatic influence and solidify its standing as a major global power amidst escalating geopolitical tensions. The summit is particularly notable as it marks Russian President Vladimir Putin's first visit to China since his discussions with Donald Trump in Alaska, and Indian Prime Minister Modi's first trip to China in seven years. The gathering underscores China's strategic efforts to strengthen regional alliances and actively shape the evolving international order.</p>

          <p>Stellantis's Jeep brand has unveiled a redesigned 2026 Jeep Cherokee, featuring the company's first hybrid system in North America, in an effort to reverse six consecutive years of sales declines. The new model, which is longer, taller, and wider than its predecessor, aims to revitalize the iconic SUV line, previously discontinued in 2023. CEO Bob Broderdorf expressed confidence that reintroducing the Cherokee will invigorate sales, despite facing headwinds from President Trump's tariffs, which are projected to significantly impact the company's full-year earnings. Production for the new Cherokee will occur at Stellantis's Mexico plant, with vehicles expected to reach dealerships by the end of this year.</p>

          <p>John Deere is navigating a challenging period characterized by significantly weaker demand in the agricultural sector, resulting in decreased net income, sales, and recent layoffs across its U.S. factories. Farmers, grappling with lower crop prices and rising operational costs, have curtailed equipment purchases, a situation further complicated by an estimated $600 million impact from tariffs. Despite these considerable headwinds, the company maintains confidence in its long-term prospects, citing growth in European and South American markets and a substantial $20 billion investment in U.S. manufacturing over the next decade. Analysts suggest Deere's earnings have likely bottomed out, anticipating a rebound driven by cyclical trends and precision agriculture innovations. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>The New Jersey Meadowlands, historically notorious as a toxic wasteland and dumping ground, has undergone a remarkable "Lazarus-like" resurrection, now serving as a model of conservation that balances waste disposal, urban development, and environmental protection. This area, which hosts over 300 bird species, owes its revitalization to a combination of state and federal policies, including the Clean Water Act, which mandated ecological mitigation for development projects. However, a 2023 Supreme Court ruling that significantly restricted the Clean Water Act's reach now threatens these hard-won protections, potentially endangering millions of acres of wetlands nationwide. The article underscores the delicate and ongoing balance required to preserve such urban ecosystems against continuous human impact and shifting legal frameworks.</p>

Wilson, the reigning league MVP, secured her 18th double-double of the season and her seventh during this remarkable winning streak, underscoring her consistent impact.

        </div>
        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>A new GiveDirectly study conducted in rural Kenya found that one-time cash grants of approximately $1,871 significantly reduced infant and child mortality by 48%, an impressive and rare finding for an intervention not specifically designed for health. The article explores potential mechanisms for this impact, including increased hospital births and improved food security among recipient mothers. However, it also emphasizes crucial caveats, particularly that the cash program was not cost-effective as a direct life-saving tool when compared to highly targeted health interventions like Vitamin A supplements. This nuanced discussion cautions against overstating the findings, stressing that while cash grants effectively reduce poverty, they require complementary health infrastructure for broader public health impact.

Experts caution that designing an effective and comprehensive test is inherently challenging, especially given that many consumers already struggle with basic financial literacy.

          <p>Actor Noel Clarke lost his high-profile libel case against The Guardian after suing the newspaper for publishing allegations of sexual misconduct against him. The judge dismissed Clarke's claim, ruling that The Guardian successfully defended its stories on the grounds of truth and public interest. The judgment found the meaning of the newspaper's articles to be "substantially true" and explicitly deemed Clarke "not a credible or reliable witness." During the six-week trial, over a dozen women testified to experiencing misconduct by the actor. The judge concluded there was no "conspiracy to lie," marking a significant victory for investigative journalism and for the women who bravely came forward.</p>

This medium-sized herbivore, whose remains date back 125 million years, is distinguished by an "eye-catching sail" along its back, which directly inspired the "sail spine" part of its scientific name. Dame Ellen expressed immense privilege and honor at the recognition, particularly appreciating the symbolic connection between the dinosaur's distinctive sail and her own life spent sailing. This discovery and naming not only mark a scientific advancement but also serve as a distinctive tribute to a prominent and inspiring public figure.</p>
