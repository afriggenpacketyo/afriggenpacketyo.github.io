          <h2>Analysis Challenges Notion of America's Current Generation Being the 'Sickest Ever'</h2>
          <div class="timestamp">2025-09-13 08:30:00 EDT</div>
        </div>
        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>This article challenges the assertion, notably from Robert F. Kennedy Jr.'s 'Make America Healthy Again' movement, that the current generation of Americans is the sickest in the nation's history. It presents evidence showing significant progress in public health over the last century, such as a near doubling of life expectancy since the 1880s and drastic reductions in deaths from infectious diseases, cancer, and heart attacks. While acknowledging modern health issues like obesity and mental illness, the analysis argues that historical context reveals a much healthier present compared to a past where child mortality was rampant and environmental pollution was severe. The piece suggests that catastrophizing the present risks undermining the very public health foundations that have led to this progress.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Activist investment firm Sachem Head Capital Management is pressuring Performance Food Group to explore a merger with its competitor, US Foods. The firm has nominated four new candidates to the board to help facilitate this evaluation, citing massive potential synergies that could reach up to $1 billion. Sachem Head, which previously had a successful activist campaign at US Foods, argues that a stock-based combination would create significant long-term value for shareholders of both companies. The move comes as Performance Food Group's long-time CEO is rumored to be stepping down, creating a potential opening for a strategic transaction. (not investment advice)</p>

        </div>
        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Despite a nearly 30% surge in UnitedHealth Group's stock price since Berkshire Hathaway disclosed its new stake, the investment may not yet be profitable. Berkshire purchased over 5 million shares during the second quarter, a period of significant price volatility for the healthcare giant. Depending on the exact purchase price within that quarter's range, Berkshire's position could be anywhere from a substantial gain to a 42% loss on paper. The stock's recent rally was partly fueled by Berkshire's endorsement, but the article notes that the long-term investment horizon of Warren Buffett's firm means short-term fluctuations are less critical than the company's future turnaround potential.

          <p>Baseball Hall of Famer CC Sabathia has weighed in on a viral incident where a female fan aggressively took a home run ball from a father and his young son at a Philadelphia Phillies game. Sabathia described the fan's behavior as "crazy" and noted he had never seen a situation escalate to that extent, though disputes over baseballs are common. The story gained national attention after the family described the woman's vulgar demands on television. Sabathia praised the positive outcome, highlighting how the power of social media prompted the Phillies and player Harrison Bader to provide the child with a signed bat and other souvenirs, turning a negative experience into a memorable one.</p>

          <h2>Convenience Stores Gaining Breakfast Market Share from Fast-Food Chains</h2>

          <p>Fast-food giants like McDonald's are losing breakfast customers to convenience stores, which are increasingly investing in their prepared food offerings. According to market research, morning traffic to food-focused convenience stores like Wawa and Casey's General Store grew 9% in a recent three-month period, while fast-food breakfast visits rose only 1%. This trend is driven by budget-conscious consumers who perceive convenience stores as offering better value and a wider variety of options, from coffee and energy drinks to breakfast pizza. As fast-food chains report weakness in the breakfast daypart, they are beginning to look to their c-store competitors for strategies to win back morning customers.</p>

          <p>The artificial intelligence startup OpenAI has become a primary driver of growth for major technology companies through its enormous spending on cloud computing and infrastructure. Oracle recently experienced a historic stock surge after revealing massive contracts with OpenAI, which reportedly plans to spend $300 billion on computing power over five years. This follows similar boosts for Microsoft, its primary cloud partner; Nvidia, which supplies essential GPUs; and Broadcom, which is building custom processors for the AI firm. While this spending spree has added trillions in market value to these established tech players, some analysts express concern about the industry's heavy reliance on a single, cash-burning startup.</p>

          <h2>Travel Experts Advise Flexibility as the Key to Finding Cheaper Airfare</h2>
          <div class="timestamp">2025-09-13 07:00:01 EDT</div>
        </div>
        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>According to travel experts, including the product team at Google Flights, the single most effective strategy for securing affordable airfare is maintaining flexibility with travel dates. Data shows that flying midweek—on a Monday, Tuesday, or Wednesday—is generally cheaper than traveling on weekends, with potential savings of around 13-14% on domestic tickets. Similarly, traveling during a destination's off-season or shoulder season can lead to significant discounts. While many travelers believe the day of the week they book a flight matters, experts dismiss this as a myth, emphasizing that the actual day of travel has a much greater impact on the price.</p>

        </div>
        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Obtaining the latest COVID-19 vaccine has become more complex as the FDA has narrowed approval to specific high-risk groups, such as those 65 and older or with certain medical conditions. Unlike previous rollouts, healthy younger individuals may be turned away from pharmacies and might need to "self-attest" to a risk factor or get a doctor's prescription. The change in policy stems from the Trump administration's view that widespread immunity reduces the need for annual boosters for everyone, a stance contested by many medical groups. The CDC is expected to issue more specific recommendations soon, which could further clarify eligibility and insurance coverage for the shots.</p>

          <p>Energy Secretary Chris Wright has officially disbanded the Department of Energy's Climate Working Group (CWG), a panel of climate change skeptics whose report was widely condemned by the scientific community. The group's report, which was criticized for containing errors and misrepresenting climate science, was used by the EPA to support rolling back regulations on climate pollution. The decision to dissolve the group follows a lawsuit filed by environmental organizations alleging it was created in secret and violated federal law. In his letter to the members, Wright claimed the group's purpose was to "catalyze scientific and public debate" and that this goal had been successfully met.</p>

          <p>A new exhibition in Potsdam, Germany, is exploring the complex and divisive cultural legacy of the 'Plattenbau,' the prefabricated concrete slab apartment blocks that defined much of East German urban architecture. Initially promoted by the socialist state as a modern solution to housing shortages and a symbol of utopian community living, these buildings became associated with dystopia and social decay after German reunification. The exhibition, "Wohnkomplex: Art and Life in Plattenbau," uses artworks to explore these dualities, from the collective memory of a shared living environment to the painful transformation marked by unemployment and the rise of neo-Nazism in the 1990s. The show is part of a broader renewed interest in reassessing the architectural and social history of the GDR.</p>

          <p>The German language is experiencing a surge in popularity in Turkey, second only to English, as young people increasingly look to Germany for higher education and career opportunities. Faced with a difficult economic situation and stressful working conditions at home, many Turkish students see learning German as a pathway to studying at German universities or entering the German job market. Elite Turkish high schools report a dramatic increase in graduates choosing to study in Germany, and demand for German language courses is outpacing the supply of teachers. This trend reflects the close historical ties between the two nations and the desire of a new generation to seek opportunities abroad.</p>
