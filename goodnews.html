          <p>A federal judge in New York has blocked the Trump administration from deporting noncitizens detained under the Alien Enemies Act, stating that the administration failed to demonstrate the existence of a war, invasion, or predatory incursion as required by the 1798 law. This ruling marks the second time a federal judge has barred the administration from using the proclamation to remove certain Venezuelan migrants. Challenges to Trump's use of the Alien Enemies Act have been filed nationwide, following a Supreme Court decision that allowed removals under the law but required due process. The judge in this article was appointed by President Bill Clinton.</p>

          <p>In an Oval Office meeting with President Trump, Canadian Prime Minister Mark Carney rejected the idea of Canada joining the U.S. as the 51st state, stating Canada is "not for sale, it won't be for sale, ever." This exchange occurred after Trump romanticized the idea of Canada joining the U.S., suggesting it would be a "wonderful marriage." Carney emphasized the importance of partnership and building together, despite tensions on trade and borders. Trump, however, insisted "never say never" to the idea, despite Carney's firm stance.</p>

          <p>Sir David Attenborough is launching a new film, Ocean, which he considers one of the most important of his career, emphasizing the critical role oceans play in biodiversity and climate change mitigation. The film documents the decline in ocean life during Sir David's lifetime and warns that "we are almost out of time." The film showcases the damage of bottom trawling and how it releases vast amounts of carbon dioxide, contributing to the warming of the planet. Despite the dire situation, Sir David expresses optimism that the ocean can recover faster than imagined, highlighting the recovery of whale populations after the ban on commercial whaling.</p>

          <div class="timestamp">2025-05-06 12:30:05 EDT</div>
        </div>
        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Mattel CEO Ynon Kreiz stated that toy manufacturing is unlikely to return to America despite President Trump's tariffs against China. Kreiz explained that while design, development, product engineering, and brand management happen in America, manufacturing in other countries allows for affordable pricing. Mattel has been diversifying its global manufacturing for nearly a decade to reduce its dependence on China, and by the end of the year, less than 40% of Mattel's product will be sourced from China. Kreiz noted that in two years, no country will represent more than 25% of Mattel's sourcing.</p>

          <p>The UK and India have agreed to a trade deal after three years of talks, which aims to boost trade by an additional ¬£25.5 billion a year by 2040. The agreement will make it easier for UK firms to export whisky, cars, and other products to India, and cut taxes on India's clothing and footwear exports. UK consumers are likely to benefit from lower tariffs on goods coming from India, including clothing, footwear, and jewelry. Tariffs on gin and whisky will be halved to 75%, with further reductions in later years.</p>

          <p>First Minister John Swinney has announced that NHS Scotland will deliver an extra 100,000 appointments in GP surgeries over the next year to address the difficulties in securing appointments. The program aims to target key risk factors such as high blood pressure, high cholesterol, obesity, and smoking. The government will also permanently ban peak rail fares and end an alcohol ban on ScotRail trains. However, the BMA union expressed skepticism that the extra appointments would resolve the underlying issues, emphasizing the need for investment in general practice to boost staffing numbers.</p>

          <p>Home equity line of credit (HELOC) rates have been steadily declining this year, reaching their lowest point since 2023. However, HELOC rates can change, even for existing borrowers, thanks to a variable interest rate often adjusted monthly by lenders. HELOC interest rates, at least on the surface, are unlikely to adjust much (or at all) this week. The central bank is widely expected to keep its federal funds rate unchanged at the current range between 4.25% and 4.50%.</p>

          <p>A Soviet-era spacecraft, Kosmos 482, launched in 1972, is expected to plunge uncontrolled back to Earth. It's too early to know where the half-ton mass of metal might come down or how much of it will survive reentry, but it is predicted to reenter around May 10. The object is relatively small and, even if it doesn't break apart, "the risk is similar to that of a random meteorite fall, several of which happen each year. You run a bigger risk of getting hit by lightning in your lifetime." The spacecraft could reenter anywhere between 51.7 degrees north and south latitude.</p>
