          <p>A high school football player, Logan Coleridge, experienced debilitating concussion symptoms for months, which ultimately led doctors to diagnose a rare, underlying brain condition. After a helmet-to-helmet hit, he suffered from severe dizziness, headaches, and memory issues that did not improve with standard therapy. A concussion specialist finally ordered an MRI, which revealed an arteriovenous malformation (AVM), an abnormal tangle of blood vessels in his brain that was likely the true cause of his symptoms. Logan successfully underwent surgery to remove the AVM and is now recovering well, with his family advocating for earlier, more thorough diagnostic testing.</p>

The company, which initially focused on heating, uses a network of wireless sensors and weather algorithms to eliminate wasteful overheating and overcooling, claiming to have saved customers over $100 million in energy costs. Runwise recently secured a $55 million Series B funding round, which it will use for nationwide growth and to further integrate AI into its platform.

          <p>Amid rising ticket prices for major music tours, a significant number of Americans, particularly younger generations, are using "buy now, pay later" (BNPL) loans to afford concert tickets. A LendingTree survey found that 37% of Gen Z and 35% of millennials have used these services for such purchases. While BNPL offers interest-free installment payments, financial analysts caution that these loans may lack the consumer protections of credit cards, such as recourse if an event is canceled. Instead, experts recommend proactively budgeting for entertainment by creating dedicated savings accounts, humorously dubbed a "Beyoncé fund" or "Taylor Swift fund."</p>

          <p>This article pays tribute to Sandra Grimes, the CIA analyst instrumental in catching one of the most damaging spies in U.S. history, who passed away at age 79. In the early 1990s, Grimes postponed her plans to scale back her career to help investigate why CIA informants in the Soviet Union were disappearing. Her meticulous investigation, which involved scrutinizing financial records and activity logs, led directly to her colleague, Aldrich Ames. Ames was arrested in 1994 and convicted of espionage, having received millions from the Soviet Union for information that led to the execution of multiple U.S. assets.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>A San Francisco startup, Marathon Fusion, has proposed a modern form of alchemy: manufacturing gold by repurposing neutrons produced during nuclear fusion. The theory suggests that this process could transmute common metals like mercury into gold, creating a valuable byproduct to help subsidize the high cost of developing fusion energy. While scientists have created minuscule amounts of gold in labs before at exorbitant costs, Marathon's idea is to integrate this process into future commercial fusion reactors. The concept, though speculative and dependent on the advent of viable fusion power, has intrigued physicists as a clever potential revenue stream.</p>

          <p>Activist investment firm Carronade Capital Management is pushing satellite communications company Viasat to unlock shareholder value by spinning off its Defense and Advanced Technologies (DAT) division. Carronade argues that the market misunderstands Viasat, unfairly valuing it as a declining legacy satellite business threatened by competitors like Starlink. The firm believes the high-growth, high-margin DAT segment is a "hidden gem" whose true value is suppressed, and a separation could result in a significantly higher overall company valuation. This analysis suggests a potential upside for the company's stock price if the restructuring occurs. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>In a significant diplomatic development, the leaders of Armenia and Azerbaijan signed a historic peace agreement at the White House, officially ending decades of conflict. The U.S.-brokered deal includes provisions to reopen key transportation routes, including a major transit corridor linking Azerbaijan to its exclave of Nakhchivan, which will be named the "Trump Route." Both Azerbaijani President Ilham Aliyev and Armenian Prime Minister Nikol Pashinyan credited Donald Trump for the breakthrough. The agreement marks a major step toward normalizing relations after years of fighting over the Nagorno-Karabakh region and signals shifting geopolitical influence in the South Caucasus.</p>

          <p>OpenAI's newly launched GPT-5, touted as its most advanced AI model yet, has garnered mixed reviews from experts in China, a key market in the global AI race. While OpenAI CEO Sam Altman described the system as a "PhD-level expert in anything," some Chinese analysts found it lacking in revolutionary breakthroughs and memorable characteristics. The new model boasts improved performance in areas like coding, math, and visual perception, featuring a built-in "thinking" function that adapts its processing based on query complexity. The lukewarm reception highlights the heightened competition and high expectations within China's rapidly advancing AI landscape.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Stargazers hoping to catch the peak of the annual Perseids meteor shower next week may be disappointed, as a full moon is expected to diminish its visibility. According to NASA, the bright moonlight will likely wash out the view of all but the brightest meteors during the peak on the night of August 12th into the 13th. The Perseids, known for producing bright fireballs, originate from debris left by the Swift-Tuttle comet. While viewing conditions are not ideal this year, astronomers suggest that some meteors may still be visible in the predawn hours for patient observers in the Northern Hemisphere.</p>

          <p>In a tangible sign of easing tensions, North Korea has started to dismantle some of its propaganda loudspeakers along the heavily fortified border with South Korea. This move follows a similar action by Seoul, which halted its own broadcasts of K-pop music and news reports in a goodwill gesture under the new administration of President Lee Jae Myung. The reciprocal de-escalation marks a shift from the hard-line policies of the previous South Korean government. These cross-border loudspeaker campaigns have been a recurring feature during periods of heightened animosity between the two nations, which technically remain at war.</p>

          <p>Manchester United has completed the signing of 22-year-old Slovenian striker Benjamin Sesko from RB Leipzig for a total fee of £73.7 million. Sesko, who joins on a five-year contract, is the club's third major attacking acquisition under manager Ruben Amorim, following the arrivals of Matheus Cunha and Bryan Mbeumo. Known for his electrifying pace and physical presence, Sesko was a top young goalscorer in Europe's major leagues. His arrival at Old Trafford raises questions about the future of Danish striker Rasmus Hojlund, whom the club is reportedly prepared to sell.</p>

          <p>The Italian government has approved the revival of a long-stalled project to build the Strait of Messina Bridge, which would connect Sicily to the mainland. The proposed structure would be the world's longest single-span suspension bridge, costing an estimated €13.5 billion, with construction slated to begin in 2026. Proponents believe the bridge will bring economic prosperity to southern Italy, creating jobs and improving infrastructure. However, the project faces significant challenges, including its location in a seismically active zone and opposition from local residents who argue the funds should be used for existing infrastructure needs.</p>
