          <p>President Trump's trade agreement with the United Kingdom maintains a 10% baseline tariff on most goods, suggesting this could be the minimum tariff applied to other trading partners. The deal allows the UK to export 100,000 vehicles annually at a reduced 10% rate, with steel and aluminum exports tariff-free. Analysts suggest that while the UK secured carve-outs for its auto, steel, and aluminum sectors, the 10% baseline tariff is likely to remain for other countries with large trade surpluses. Some analysts believe the deal could negatively impact U.S. economic growth due to the continued tariffs.</p>

          <p>Former President Joe Biden, appearing on ABC's "The View," expressed that he wasn't surprised by Vice President Kamala Harris's loss in the 2024 presidential election, attributing it to sexism and racism. Biden highlighted the consistent campaign to undermine the notion of a woman, especially a woman of mixed race, leading the country. He also mentioned his ongoing self-reflection and work on a book to determine his most significant post-presidency role. Despite her loss, Biden hopes Harris will remain involved in a significant capacity, while sources suggest she may consider running for governor of California or president in 2028.</p>

Hochul emphasized the need to prioritize children's well-being over the influence of social media and tech companies.

          <p>A panel of federal judges has ruled that the Alabama Legislature intentionally drew its congressional district map to dilute Black voting strength, violating the Voting Rights Act. The court has barred the state from using the map in future elections. This ruling stems from a lawsuit that reached the U.S. Supreme Court, which agreed that Alabama's 2021 map discriminated against Black voters.

          <p>Chinese government data reveals that exports from China surged in April, driven by increased trade with Southeast Asian countries, while shipments to the United States sharply declined due to President Trump's tariffs. Chinese shipments to the U.S. fell by 21%, while exports to Southeast Asian countries jumped by 21%. This shift indicates a redirection of trade as Chinese factories leverage a pause in tariffs on countries across the region to fulfill orders destined for the U.S. The April data provides policymakers in Beijing with some relief amid concerns about the trade war's impact on China's economic outlook.</p>
