First-time homebuyers now make up a smaller percentage of the market, with the typical age hitting a record high.

          <p>A federal judge has ordered the release of Columbia University graduate Mahmoud Khalil from ICE detention, where he was held for over three months due to his activism against Israel's war in Gaza. Judge Michael Farbiarz stated Khalil is not a flight risk nor a danger to the community, criticizing the government's case for detention. Khalil's arrest was widely criticized as an attack on free speech, and his release marks a setback for the Trump administration's efforts to deport pro-Palestinian international students. Khalil's immigration case will proceed separately.</p>

The ruling favored a group of 20 states that sued, arguing the administration lacked the authority to tie transportation dollars to immigration enforcement. Judge McConnell stated that Congress did not authorize the Secretary of Transportation to impose immigration enforcement conditions on transportation funds. The administration's policy aimed to push back against "sanctuary" jurisdictions that limit cooperation with federal immigration authorities.</p>
