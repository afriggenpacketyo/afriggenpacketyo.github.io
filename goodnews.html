          <p>Ecuador has extradited notorious drug lord Adolfo "Fito" Macias to the United States to face charges of cocaine distribution, conspiracy, and firearms smuggling. This is the first time Ecuador has extradited one of its own citizens. Macias, leader of the powerful "Los Choneros" gang, was recaptured in June after a high-profile prison escape in January that led to a nationwide state of "internal armed conflict." His extradition marks a significant moment in Ecuador's struggle against organized crime, which has transformed the nation into a key hub for the global cocaine trade.</p>

          <p>A SkyWest pilot operating a Delta Connection flight from Minneapolis to Minot, North Dakota, performed an abrupt, hard turn to avoid a mid-air collision with a U.S. Air Force B-52 bomber. In an audio recording, the pilot apologized to passengers for the "aggressive maneuver," explaining that the military aircraft appeared suddenly and was not communicated by air traffic control. The flight landed safely, and passengers praised the pilot's transparency. The incident is now under investigation by SkyWest Airlines to determine how the two aircraft came into such close proximity.</p>

          <p>Following his victory at The Open, Scottie Scheffler is being hailed as the most dominant force in men's golf since Tiger Woods in his prime. An analysis of his performance reveals a remarkable run, including four major championships and 13 PGA Tour wins since 2021. While Scheffler himself dismisses direct comparisons to Woods, his peers and sports commentators point to his machine-like consistency and ability to close out tournaments as 'Tiger-like.' Key to his recent success has been a significant improvement in his putting after working with a specialized coach and adopting a new grip.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>A parenting expert who has studied over 200 parent-child relationships argues that the single most important skill to teach a child is 'self-connection'—the ability to understand one's own emotions and needs. The article suggests that common parenting phrases like "you're okay" can inadvertently teach children to distrust their feelings, leading to insecurity and anxiety. To foster this skill, parents are advised to validate emotions, welcome all feelings, avoid micromanaging, and model their own emotional regulation. This approach is said to build resilience, healthy boundaries, and authentic confidence.</p>
