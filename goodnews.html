          <p>American player Taylor Townsend delivered a stunning performance at the US Open, defeating No. 5 seed Mirra Andreeva 7-5, 6-2 to advance to the fourth round. Townsend, a doubles specialist ranked outside the top 100 in singles, utilized an aggressive net game to overwhelm her highly-touted teenage opponent. The victory comes after a controversial second-round match, and Townsend used her post-match interview to thank supporters and speak on the importance of representation. This marks her third career victory against a top-10 player and a significant moment in her singles career.</p>

          <p>Novak Djokovic advanced to the fourth round of the US Open after defeating Britain's Cameron Norrie in a four-set match, 6-4, 6-7, 6-2, 6-3. Despite struggling with a lower back injury that required a medical timeout, the 24-time Grand Slam champion recovered to end British singles participation in the tournament. Norrie expressed that he may have become "a little overconfident" after breaking Djokovic's serve early in the third set. Djokovic praised his own serving performance, hitting 18 aces, and continues his quest for a record 25th major title.</p>

          <p>Three brothers from Edinburgh, Jamie, Ewan, and Lachlan MacLean, have set a new record for the fastest non-stop, unsupported row across the Pacific Ocean, completing the 9,000-mile journey in just under 140 days. The trio rowed from Peru to Australia, overcoming violent storms that swept one brother overboard and forced significant detours. Their journey, which beat the previous record by over 20 days, has raised more than £700,000 for clean water projects in Madagascar. The brothers endured significant hardships but credited their fraternal bond for their success.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>A scenic 10-mile stretch of Angeles Crest Highway has reopened just before Labor Day weekend after being closed for years due to extensive storm and fire damage. The section between Islip Saddle and Vincent Gulch suffered from rock slides and pavement collapses during the winters of 2022 and 2023, with further damage from the 2024 Bridge fire. The $7.9 million repair project included new guardrails, retaining walls, and drainage systems. The reopening provides renewed access to popular hiking trails and is expected to alleviate overcrowding at other trailheads in the Angeles National Forest.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>As Chinese stock markets reach a 10-year high, analysts suggest the rally could be sustained by a combination of domestic and international factors. With yields on fixed-income products at record lows, China's massive US$22 trillion in household savings may rotate into equities. Furthermore, global investors are reportedly returning to Chinese markets, attracted by what some asset managers call "undervalued innovation" in sectors like advanced manufacturing and AI. This renewed interest from both retail and overseas investors is seen as a potent catalyst for continued market growth. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>The Department of Defense is reportedly considering measures to speed up the process for former service members to rejoin the military after being discharged for refusing the COVID-19 vaccine. Officials are also weighing whether to grant honorable discharges to those whose only infraction was vaccine refusal. This comes after President Trump signed an executive order to reinstate those who requested it, following the rescission of the Biden-era mandate. Hundreds of the roughly 8,700 discharged troops have applied for reinstatement, but have faced a slow and difficult process.</p>
