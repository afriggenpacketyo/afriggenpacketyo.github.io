          <div class="timestamp">2025-07-22 09:26:00 EDT</div>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Following President Trump's praise for Coca-Cola's plan to offer a cane sugar version, health experts are weighing in on the nutritional differences between it and high-fructose corn syrup. While there are minor chemical and metabolic distinctions, with some concern over corn syrup's higher fructose content, dietitians largely agree that both are empty calories with similar negative health impacts when consumed in excess. The American Heart Association recommends limiting intake of all added sugars, including both cane sugar and corn syrup. Experts emphasize that moderation is the most important factor for health, as both sweeteners contribute to inflammation and dental issues.</p>

          <p>Treasury Secretary Scott Bessent clarified his position on the Federal Reserve, stating that Chair Jerome Powell should not resign despite calls from President Trump. Bessent reiterated his belief that the central bank needs an internal review of its non-monetary policy operations, which he feels have grown without sufficient oversight. He suggested that leading such a review could be a positive legacy for Powell, allowing him to "right-size" the Fed's functions. This stance contrasts with the White House's direct pressure on the Fed to lower interest rates and criticism of its building renovation project. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>A father is being hailed as a hero for saving his four-year-old child during a mountain lion attack on a popular trail in Washington's Olympic National Park. The child was airlifted to a trauma center and has since been released in satisfactory condition. According to witnesses, the father intervened to get the child away from the cougar, an action they believe was lifesaving. Park rangers located the mountain lion, which was fitted with a tracking collar, and subsequently euthanized it, stating there are no current threats to the public in the area.</p>

          <p>UK Conservative Party leader Kemi Badenoch has conducted a significant reshuffle of her senior team, appointing former Home Secretary Sir James Cleverly as the new shadow housing secretary. This move places him in direct opposition to Deputy Prime Minister Angela Rayner in Parliament. The shake-up also includes new appointments for the roles of party chairman and shadow secretaries for culture and health. The changes are intended to reflect a new stage in the party's policy renewal and to unify the party as it continues to poll behind Labour and Reform UK.</p>

          <p>Public bus companies across China are facing severe financial pressure due to declining ridership and mounting losses, prompting them to explore unconventional business models. For example, the Zhengzhou Public Transport Group has partnered with courier SF Express to use idle buses for logistics and package delivery during off-peak hours. Other innovative ideas being tested include allowing pets as passengers on certain routes. These measures are a response to a dramatic drop in passenger volume since 2019, as commuters increasingly turn to subways, bike-sharing, and ride-hailing services, leaving bus operators in financial distress.</p>

          <p>Despite ongoing trade tensions and economic uncertainty, corporations are continuing to spend on business travel, though more strategically. A report from Navan shows a 15% year-over-year increase in corporate travel spending for the second quarter of 2025, with a focus on essential relationship-building meetings rather than large group events. However, the Global Business Travel Association notes that overall optimism is muted, and growth forecasts have been revised downward. Airlines report that while corporate travel has stabilized, it remains flat compared to last year, reflecting a cautious "wait and see" approach from business leaders. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>This article provides consumers with ten key signs to identify a trustworthy debt relief company and avoid predatory scams. Reputable firms do not charge upfront fees before settling a debt, provide transparent fee structures, and offer free initial consultations to assess a person's financial situation. Other positive indicators include proper state licensing, a strong track record with positive independent reviews, and providing realistic timelines and expectations. A legitimate company will also clearly explain the risks involved, such as potential credit score impacts, and offer ongoing support throughout the process. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>The Philadelphia Phillies defeated the Boston Red Sox in a bizarre walk-off victory decided by a catcher's interference call with the bases loaded in the 10th inning. Phillies batter Edmundo Sosa's swing made contact with the glove of Red Sox catcher Carlos Narvaez, automatically awarding him first base and allowing the winning run to score. This marked the first time a Major League Baseball game has ended on a walk-off catcher's interference since 1971. The unusual ending concluded a tight game, giving the Phillies a 3-2 victory without putting a ball in play during the final inning.</p>

The proposed cooperation would leverage Houston's Ellington Airport, which already has a spaceport license.
