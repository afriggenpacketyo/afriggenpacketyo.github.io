          <p>Mahmoud Khalil, a Columbia University graduate and activist, arrived in New Jersey after a federal judge ordered his release from ICE detention. Khalil was detained for over 100 days as the Trump administration sought his deportation for his role in campus protests against Israel. The judge ruled that Khalil was not a threat or flight risk, criticizing the government's actions as an attempt to punish him for his anti-Israel speech. Khalil vowed to continue advocating for Palestinian rights and accused the Trump administration of trying to dehumanize immigrants.</p>

          <p>A federal judge blocked the Trump administration from making drastic cuts to research funding provided by the National Science Foundation. Judge Indira Talwani struck down a policy change that would have capped indirect costs for universities at 15% of direct research costs. The University of California estimated the change would have cost it nearly $100 million annually. The ruling follows similar blocks against caps on grants by the Energy Department and the National Institutes of Health.</p>

          <p>Belarus released opposition leader Sergei Tikhanovsky and over a dozen other political prisoners following an appeal from the White House, signaling warming ties between Washington and Moscow. The release occurred after President Trump's special envoy for Ukraine and Russia met with Belarusian President Alexander Lukashenko in Minsk. Tikhanovsky's wife, Sviatlana Tsikhanouskaya, thanked President Trump for brokering the deal. Tikhanovsky had been imprisoned for more than five years after planning to run against Lukashenko in the 2020 presidential election.</p>

          <p>Pop-punk band South Arcade is riding the wave of Y2K core, a growing interest in 90s and early 2000s culture. The band's sound, inspired by artists like Rihanna, Korn, and Justice, evokes a nostalgic feel for the era. South Arcade gained traction on TikTok, where the Y2K hashtag has been used in millions of posts. The band believes the appeal of Y2K lies in its escapism and the sense of personality that people expressed through their rooms and collections during that time.</p>

          <p>A BBC report explores the complexities of stress and cortisol levels, questioning the effectiveness of social media "quick fixes" for lowering cortisol. Experts warn that simplistic solutions often fail to address the real issues causing stress and can prevent people from seeking necessary medical treatment. Jasleen Kaur Carroll, who experienced burnout, tried various social media hacks but found that therapy and mindfulness were more effective in managing her stress. Experts emphasize the importance of addressing the root cause of stress rather than just treating the symptoms.</p>
