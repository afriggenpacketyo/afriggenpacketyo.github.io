        </div>
        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>The UK's Conservative party has unveiled a significant policy proposal aimed at assisting young people with homeownership, offering a £5,000 tax rebate during their first year of employment. Dubbed the 'First Job Bonus,' this plan would divert the initial £5,000 of an individual's National Insurance contributions directly into a designated savings account, which could then be used as a deposit on a first home. This initiative is part of a broader economic platform that also includes the abolition of business rates for many high street retailers. The party states these programs would be financed through a substantial £47 billion savings drive derived from extensive cuts to welfare, the civil service, and foreign aid budgets.</p>

          <p>In a recent podcast interview, Ayesha Curry discussed her initial life plans before marrying NBA star Stephen Curry at a young age. She admitted that she originally did not want to get married or have children, instead focusing intently on her own career goals. Curry explained that after marrying at 22 and becoming pregnant shortly after, she had to re-evaluate her ambitions, feeling a distinct shift after her first child's birth that prompted her to pursue her own goals beyond motherhood. She also touched upon the challenges of navigating public scrutiny as the wife of a famous athlete while simultaneously building her own successful lifestyle brand.</p>

          <p>The first of three supermoons for the year is set to appear, offering a celestial event where the moon looks slightly larger and brighter than usual. This astronomical phenomenon occurs when a full moon coincides with its closest approach to Earth in its elliptical orbit, a point known as the perigee. According to NASA, this proximity can make the moon appear up to 14% bigger and 30% brighter than when it is at its farthest point in orbit. The spectacle is visible worldwide to the naked eye, provided the skies are clear, with the next two supermoons expected in the subsequent months of the year.</p>

          <h2>OpenAI to Acquire Major Stake in AMD Through Multi-Billion Dollar GPU Deal</h2>

          <p>OpenAI has entered into a landmark agreement with Advanced Micro Devices (AMD) that includes deploying 6 gigawatts of AMD's Instinct GPUs over several years. As part of this multi-billion dollar partnership, OpenAI has been issued a warrant that could allow it to acquire up to a 10% ownership stake in the chipmaker, contingent on deployment and performance milestones. This strategic deal positions AMD as a key hardware supplier for OpenAI's ambitious AI infrastructure projects, reducing its reliance on a single vendor like Nvidia. The collaboration underscores the immense and growing demand for high-performance computing power to train and operate next-generation artificial intelligence models. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>Japanese beverage giant Asahi has partially restarted operations at all six of its breweries in Japan after a significant cyberattack forced a complete shutdown of its systems. The attack disrupted the company's ordering and delivery networks, leading to product shortages at major retailers across the country. While the breweries are not yet fully operational, production of the popular Asahi Super Dry beer has resumed. The incident highlights the increasing vulnerability of major corporations to cyber threats, following a similar attack that recently crippled production at carmaker Jaguar Land Rover, affecting global supply chains and business operations.</p>

        </div>
        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Author Robert Kiyosaki, known for "Rich Dad Poor Dad," advocates for several unconventional retirement strategies to build and preserve wealth. He strongly advises against hoarding cash due to inflation's erosive effects, suggesting instead that liquidity be held in assets like gold, silver, or oil that can act as a hedge. Kiyosaki also emphasizes the importance of true diversification beyond traditional stocks and bonds to include real estate, commodities, business ventures, and cryptocurrency. He recommends focusing on acquiring income-generating assets to cover future expenses, particularly for healthcare, rather than relying solely on traditional savings or insurance products that may offer low returns.

          <p>Turkey has become the unofficial capital of the hair transplant industry, attracting approximately one million medical tourists in 2022 for this procedure alone. The country's appeal lies in significantly lower costs compared to the U.S. and Europe, with all-inclusive packages often including flights, hotels, and the surgery for a fraction of the price elsewhere. This has created a booming, multi-billion dollar industry for Turkey, transforming Istanbul's airports and public spaces with advertisements for hair clinics. However, the rapid growth has also raised concerns about oversight and the risks associated with unlicensed practitioners, prompting calls for stricter regulation from international medical societies.</p>

The report suggests that shoppers will be actively seeking discounts and promotions to manage their budgets amid economic uncertainty.

The organization praised Porter for her track record of holding powerful entities accountable and fighting for working families. With the 2026 race to succeed Governor Gavin Newsom still wide open, this key endorsement could provide Porter with crucial early momentum in a potentially crowded field of Democratic contenders.</p>

A major milestone was the rollout of the first routine malaria vaccinations across 17 African countries, targeting a disease that kills hundreds of thousands annually. This progress underscores the profound impact of vaccines as a cost-effective public health tool, despite growing anti-vaccine sentiment and declining global health funding.</p>

          <p>An article examines the practice of paying grandparents for childcare, drawing a contrast between cultural norms in Singapore and the United States. In Singapore, it is common for grandparents to be the primary caregivers for young children, often receiving a monthly allowance from their adult children that recognizes their labor as essential. This arrangement provides affordable, reliable childcare for parents, financial support for grandparents, and fosters strong intergenerational bonds. The article suggests that while cultural and logistical hurdles exist, a similar model could help alleviate the severe childcare crisis in the U.S., where costs are prohibitively high and availability is scarce for many families.</p>

Dr. Tsion Firew, an emergency medicine physician, describes the initial fear and chaos as colleagues fell ill and died, forcing her to send her own young children to another country for safety. The article highlights Rwanda's successful public health response, which included rapid testing, vaccine trials, and the pioneering use of experimental treatments. This effective, science-driven approach achieved a 23% mortality rate, the lowest ever recorded for the typically highly lethal virus, serving as a model for outbreak management.</p>

Dr. Sakaguchi first discovered this T cell subtype, while Brunkow and Ramsdell later identified the Foxp3 gene that controls their development.

Despite still being highly effective, Kershaw's move comes as the Dodgers have an unusually deep roster of healthy starting pitchers for the postseason.

The film follows a K-pop girl group, Huntr/x, who lead double lives as demon slayers, with a rival demon boy band as their antagonists. Its success is also driven by its soundtrack, which has produced four simultaneous top-10 hits on the Billboard Hot 100. Originally developed by Sony Pictures Animation, the studio passed on distributing the film, allowing Netflix to acquire it. Analysts attribute its massive appeal to its authentic celebration of K-pop culture, immersing viewers in its world without pandering to an outside perspective.</p>
