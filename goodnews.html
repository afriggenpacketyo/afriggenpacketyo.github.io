          <p>Senator John Fetterman of Pennsylvania discusses the scrutiny surrounding his mental health and attendance record in the Senate, attributing his absenteeism to a desire to spend more time with his family and a feeling that many senatorial duties are performative. Fetterman feels he has been unfairly shamed into attending hearings and votes, which he considers a waste of time. He also acknowledges that his openness about his mental health struggles has been weaponized against him, impacting his aspirations for higher office. Fetterman emphasizes his support for Israel, cracking down on immigration, and opposition to cancel culture, while maintaining his pro-LGBTQ+, pro-choice, and pro-union stances.</p>

          <p>During his commencement address at West Point, Donald Trump emphasized an "America First" approach to military engagement, criticizing past leaders for involving the U.S. military in nation-building crusades and ideological experiments. Trump stated that soldiers had been sent on "nation-building crusades to nations that wanted nothing to do with us," while also criticizing diversity, equity, and inclusion programs. He also repeated a false claim about Russia stealing U.S. hypersonic missile technology during the Obama administration. Outside the academy, protesters condemned what they viewed as the president's attack on American democracy.</p>

          <p>Podcast host Channing Crowder claimed that Jordon Hudson, who has been credited by Bill Belichick as the business brainiac to his brand, heavily influenced Belichick's recent interview on "The Pivot" podcast. Crowder stated that Hudson, who was present at the interview, seemed to coordinate and brand manage Belichick, particularly when personal topics arose, and also choreographed the opening. This contrasts with Belichick's discomfort discussing personal matters, with Crowder describing Hudson as "pretty much telling him what to do." Belichick has accused CBS of creating a false narrative with selectively edited clips, after a prior interview where Hudson interrupted and delayed the interview by 30 minutes.</p>

          <p>French authorities suspect sabotage as the cause of a power outage that disrupted the Cannes Film Festival on its final day, with about 160,000 homes in Cannes and surrounding areas losing power. The outage was attributed to arson at an electricity substation and damage to a pylon at another location. Despite the disruption, festival organizers confirmed that the closing ceremony would proceed as planned, thanks to an alternative power supply. The outage also affected traffic lights and some businesses in Cannes, but power was restored by the afternoon.</p>

          <p>The Pentagon briefly lost contact with an Army Black Hawk helicopter on May 1 as it approached for landing, causing two commercial jets to abort their landings at Ronald Reagan Washington National Airport. The loss of contact, lasting about 20 seconds, was attributed to a temporary antenna that did not maintain consistent communication. The FAA also didn't have a confident fix on the helicopter's location. The Army has paused all flights into and out of the Pentagon while addressing safety issues with the FAA.</p>

          <p>California has begun filling a complex of shallow ponds near the Salton Sea to create new wetlands, aiming to provide habitat for fish and birds while controlling dust from the shrinking lake. The project represents the state's largest effort to address the environmental problems plaguing the Salton Sea, which has been steadily retreating. The $200-million project was originally envisioned to cover 4,100 acres, for which the bulk of construction has been completed. The state's latest plan, however, calls for expanding the project to more than 9,000 acres, using an additional $245 million in federal funds that the state secured in 2022.</p>
