          <p>Tadej Pogačar is set to claim his fourth Tour de France championship after successfully defending his overall lead during the race's penultimate stage. Australian sprinter Kaden Groves secured the Stage 20 win with a solo attack, but Pogačar finished safely within the main group of riders. With only the final processional stage in Paris remaining, where the leader is traditionally not challenged, the 26-year-old Slovenian's overall victory is all but guaranteed, barring any unforeseen accidents.</p>

She was impressed by the vast selection of traditional Japanese foods, including a wide variety of seaweed, diverse soy-based products like tofu, and seasonal local produce. The article notes the availability of healthier ready-to-eat meals, traditional rice crackers, and a large assortment of green tea, items she wishes were more common in U.S. stores.</p>

          <p>Christopher Kennedy, a seemingly healthy dog trainer, was unexpectedly diagnosed with idiopathic pulmonary fibrosis (IPF), a terminal lung disease, after a routine pre-surgery X-ray revealed scarring on his lungs. Initially given less than a year to live, Kennedy became a candidate for a double-lung transplant at the Cleveland Clinic despite being older than most recipients. After a successful surgery and recovery from setbacks, he has regained 98% of his lung capacity and is now training a new therapy dog named Encore to celebrate his second chance at life.</p>

          <p>According to sources familiar with the matter, US President Donald Trump is interested in visiting China, with officials from both nations working to arrange a trip for October or November. A previously rumored September visit is reportedly no longer being considered. The potential visit could occur either before or after the APEC summit in South Korea, or a meeting between Trump and Xi Jinping could happen on the sidelines of the event. Recent talks between the US and Chinese foreign ministers were described as positive, an essential step before any potential leadership summit.</p>

          <p>Recent legislative changes under the Trump administration are making employer-sponsored student loan repayment programs more attractive for companies. The One Big Beautiful Bill Act made the tax-free status of employer contributions (up to $5,250 annually) a permanent feature, removing uncertainty and encouraging more businesses to adopt this benefit. As federal options for repayment and forgiveness are narrowed, these workplace programs are becoming an increasingly important tool for attracting and retaining talent, helping employees manage crippling student debt.

          <p>Justin Bieber's surprise new album, "Swag," is being hailed as a potential "song of the summer," with its lead single "Daisies" debuting at number two on the charts. The article suggests the album's success stems from its departure from upbeat pop to a more subtle, R&B-influenced sound that feels soothing and melancholic. This downtempo yet intricate style is seen as aligning with a broader cultural mood that is less about high-energy partying and more about reserved, simmering emotion, reflecting a collective sense of malaise or hangover from previous years.</p>

          <p>To combat devastating dengue fever outbreaks, Brazil is undertaking a massive public health initiative by releasing millions of specially bred mosquitoes. These "Wolbitos," developed by the nonprofit World Mosquito Program, are infected with a bacterium called Wolbachia, which prevents the dengue virus from replicating inside them, thereby stopping transmission to humans. A pilot program in the city of Niterói led to a 90% drop in dengue cases, prompting the government to build a new factory capable of producing billions of these mosquitoes to protect up to 140 million Brazilians over the next decade.</p>

          <p>Real estate investor Grant Cardone is challenging the common financial practice of including one's primary residence in their net worth. He argues that a home you live in is a liability, not an asset, because it does not generate income and incurs significant expenses like property taxes and maintenance. Cardone's philosophy is that real estate should only be considered an investment if it produces positive cash flow from tenants. He encourages people to rent where they live and focus on acquiring income-producing properties instead. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>Ozzy Osbourne, who died at 76, lived a life of multiple, unexpected acts that defied his "Prince of Darkness" persona. After being fired from Black Sabbath for substance abuse, he launched a massively successful solo career, though his personal struggles continued. He later found a new generation of fans through the MTV reality show "The Osbournes," which recast him as a bumbling but lovable suburban father. As musician Alice Cooper noted, Osbourne was a unique mix of dark performer and court jester, a man who ultimately did not die an ordinary man.</p>
