          <h2>UK Government Introduces Grants Up to £3,750 to Boost Electric Vehicle Sales</h2>
          <div class="timestamp">2025-07-15 02:11:38 EDT</div>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>The UK government is launching a new grant scheme to encourage the adoption of electric vehicles, offering discounts of up to £3,750 on eligible cars costing up to £37,000. This £650 million initiative aims to help meet the 2030 ban on new petrol and diesel car sales. While the government hopes the grants will make EVs more affordable, industry experts and some consumers argue that the primary barrier remains the insufficient number of public charging points. The government has also recently pledged £63 million to expand the charging infrastructure.</p>

          <p>This opinion article posits that for the United States to lead the global AI revolution, it must harness its abundant natural gas resources to power the massive energy demands of data centers. The author argues that relying solely on renewable energy is impractical at the required scale and that a pragmatic approach is needed to prevent AI innovation from moving overseas to countries with more favorable energy policies. The piece suggests that co-locating gas-powered generation with data centers can provide reliable, affordable electricity without straining the public grid, ensuring America's economic and national security leadership.

          <div class="timestamp">2025-07-15 01:44:24 EDT</div>
        </div>
        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>New government guidance for schools in England will update the sex education curriculum to include topics such as recognizing misogyny, the dangers of AI-generated deepfakes, and identifying positive male role models. The revised relationships, sex and health education (RSHE) guidance will also require schools to proactively engage with parents about the curriculum content. While previous plans for strict age limits on topics have been dropped, the guidance outlines what should be taught in primary versus secondary school. The updated curriculum, set to be legally enforced from September 2026, aims to help children navigate modern social challenges.</p>

          <p>World number one golfer Scottie Scheffler's game has been transformed since he began working with putting coach Phil Kenyon in late 2023. Previously ranked outside the top 150 in putting despite being the best from tee to green, Scheffler has since become a dominant force, winning seven PGA Tour events, including a second Masters. Kenyon helped Scheffler with green reading and a grip change, but a switch to a mallet putter proved to be the key catalyst. This turnaround highlights the critical impact of specialized coaching at the elite level of professional golf.</p>

          <p>China's economy expanded by 5.2% in the second quarter, slightly surpassing economists' expectations and keeping the nation on track to meet its annual 5% growth target. However, this represents a slowdown from the first quarter, and underlying data reveals significant weaknesses, including slowing retail sales and a deepening real estate slump. Despite resilient industrial output, a sharp decline in a broad measure of prices has intensified deflation fears, leading economists to call for substantial fiscal stimulus and deeper structural reforms to support fragile domestic consumption.

          <p>A U.S. appeals court has issued a temporary stay, preventing the Trump administration from ending Temporary Protected Status (TPS) for nearly 12,000 Afghans. The protections, which shield them from deportation and allow them to work, were set to expire as part of a broader administration effort to curtail the program. The court's intervention came after an immigrant advocacy group sued, arguing that conditions in Afghanistan remain unsafe for their return. This legal battle highlights the precarious situation of many Afghans who fled to the U.S., particularly those who assisted American forces.</p>

          <p>Norway has become a global leader in the transition to electric vehicles, with EVs now accounting for over 93% of new car sales and making up 40% of all passenger cars in its capital, Oslo. This success is attributed to a long-term strategy of strong government incentives, including tax exemptions and reduced fees, combined with high taxes on polluting vehicles. The country has also invested heavily in public charging infrastructure, demonstrating how consistent and comprehensive policy can effectively shift consumer behavior and create a thriving market for sustainable transportation, resulting in cleaner air and quieter cities.</p>

This achievement is a significant step forward for the company, coming a year after a previous static-fire test ended in an explosive mishap where the rocket unexpectedly lifted off and crashed. The successful test demonstrates progress in the development of the reusable rocket, which is crucial for its future missions.</p>

The administration had sought to end the program, arguing that conditions in Afghanistan have improved, a claim disputed by advocacy groups who sued the government.

          <p>New research suggests that animals can react to sounds produced by plants, potentially revealing a previously unknown ecosystem of communication. A study from Tel Aviv University found that female moths avoided laying eggs on tomato plants that were making ultrasonic noises associated with distress, such as dehydration. This is the first evidence of an animal responding to plant-produced sounds, which are inaudible to humans but can be perceived by many insects and some mammals. The findings open up a new field of inquiry into how plants and animals may have coevolved to use sound for interaction.</p>

          <p>The BBC's annual report on star salaries often raises questions about why many of its highest-profile personalities are not included on the list. This article explains that the disclosure requirement only applies to talent directly paid from the license fee, not those employed by independent production companies or the BBC's commercial arm, BBC Studios. Consequently, stars of major shows like Strictly Come Dancing, The Traitors, and many popular dramas and panel shows do not appear. This distinction means the public list provides an incomplete picture of the earnings of the corporation's top talent.</p>
