        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Senator Rand Paul expressed reservations about President Trump's "one big beautiful bill," citing concerns about the rising national debt. Paul opposes the legislation's provision to raise the debt ceiling, arguing that it would add trillions to the national debt and remove accountability for government spending. He suggested removing the debt ceiling component and voting on it separately, potentially allowing him to support the tax components of the bill. Treasury Secretary Scott Bessent defended the bill, pointing to potential revenue from tariffs, while emphasizing that the United States would not default on its debt. The debate highlights divisions within the Republican party regarding fiscal policy and the national debt. (not investment advice)</p>

Cunha's goal involvements and versatility align with Ruben Amorim's preferred 3-4-3/3-5-2 system. Securing Cunha would provide Amorim with a key resource to succeed and revitalize the team.</p>
