          <p>A federal judge blocked the Trump administration from deploying members of the California National Guard to Los Angeles, ordering President Trump to return control to Gov. Gavin Newsom. Judge Charles Breyer found that California officials are likely to succeed in their challenge to the president's decision to federalize the National Guard in response to protests in Los Angeles. Breyer stated that Mr. Trump circumvented Newsom when he called the California National Guard into federal service, violating the Tenth Amendment. Newsom expressed gratitude for the decision, calling it a victory for the Constitution and democracy, however, the Justice Department swiftly notified the court it is appealing the order. The optimism score reflects the positive outcome for state authority but also acknowledges the ongoing legal battle. </p>

          <p>A JetBlue flight rolled into a grass area off the runway after landing at Boston Logan International Airport on Thursday, but no injuries were reported, according to the Massachusetts Port Authority.

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>A federal judge issued a temporary ruling against President Trump's use of the National Guard in Los Angeles, siding with the state of California's argument that the president erred in how the guard was being activated. The order requires Trump to return control of the National Guard to California Gov. Gavin Newsom by noon Friday (Pacific Time), though the ruling could still be appealed. Judge Charles Breyer rejected the administration's argument that the courts do not have authority to review a president's decision on whether the National Guard is needed. Newsom had said that Trump's use of the military was unlawful, adding that the federal government is turning the military against American citizens. The optimism score reflects the legal challenge to federal power, but acknowledges the possibility of an appeal. </p>

          <h2>Study Suggests Pigs Were Domesticated in China as Early as Neolithic Period</h2>
          <div class="timestamp">2025-06-12 21:00:11 EDT</div>
        </div>
        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Research suggests that pigs were domesticated in southern China around 8,000 years ago, according to archaeologists from Chinese and US institutes. The team analyzed two early Neolithic sites in the Yangtze Delta region, finding that pigs were eating humans‚Äô cooked foods and waste. This suggests the domestication process of Sus scrofa occurred alongside the development of rice cultivation and sedentary lifestyles in ancient society. The conventional view is that pigs were first domesticated in the Near East. The optimism score reflects the positive contribution to our understanding of history. </p>

          <p>Chinese solar and energy-storage companies are continuing their overseas expansion despite ongoing trade tariffs, with production abroad being key to their long-term survival.

About 80% of existing Chinese solar manufacturers‚Äô overseas capacity is in Southeast Asia, while nearly 80% of their planned overseas capacity expansion is in the Middle East and Africa, followed by the US and Europe.

          <p>Japan's farm minister Shinjiro Koizumi has returned to the political spotlight by launching a push to lower rice prices amid rising household burdens. This move is reminiscent of his father, former Prime Minister Junichiro Koizumi. Koizumi has taken steps including releasing government stockpiled rice at about half the market value through direct contracts with retailers, drawing attention to a wide range of controversial issues in the agricultural sector. His theatrical style and strong media presence could make him a lifeline for the LDP as it faces this summer's national election. The optimism score reflects the potential for positive change in agricultural policy and the public's response. (not investment advice)</p>
