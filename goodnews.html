          <p>Google has appointed Koray Kavukcuoglu, Google DeepMind's chief technology officer, as its chief AI architect to accelerate the development and integration of artificial intelligence into its products. Kavukcuoglu will report directly to CEO Sundar Pichai and focus on product strategy, aiming for seamless integration and faster iteration of AI models. This move comes as Google faces pressure to monetize its AI technology, with the company investing $75 billion in AI infrastructure this year. Other tech giants like Meta, Microsoft, and Amazon are also heavily investing in AI, intensifying competition in the field, with Google announcing a new subscription plan for early access to AI tools and partnerships for its Android XR operating system. </p>

        </div>
        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>According to a recent survey, 45% of American homeowners have regrets about buying their current home, with the most common complaint being the high cost of maintenance and hidden fees. A typical homeowner spends over $18,000 annually on non-mortgage home expenses, which can be even higher in states like Hawaii and California. Experts recommend factoring in ongoing homeownership costs and obtaining thorough home inspections to avoid financial strain and potential debt. Regular maintenance and early repairs are also advised to prevent more expensive issues down the line. </p>

          <p>A second-grade class is working to save Boston's African Meeting House after it faced significant federal funding cuts. The historic site, built in 1806, is the oldest Black church in America and served as a gathering place for the 54th Regiment during the Civil War. The class, inspired by a recent field trip, wrote letters and advocated at the State House to raise awareness and funds. The museum has already raised $100,000 in donations from the community, which Chief Curator Angela Tate sees as a gift for future generations. </p>

          <p>Chime, a provider of online banking services, is set to launch its IPO on the Nasdaq, with an expected market cap of around $9.1 billion, a significant decrease from its 2021 valuation of $25 billion. This IPO will test the public market's enthusiasm for fintech companies, following successful debuts from eToro, Galaxy Digital, and Circle. Several other fintech firms, including Klarna and Gemini, are also considering going public. Chime's revenue in the latest quarter rose 32% to $518.7 million, with net income narrowing to $12.9 million, though this IPO could influence the prospects of other fintech companies.

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Despite Americans paying trillions in rent annually, few receive credit score boosts because most landlords don't report payments to credit bureaus. This lack of reporting leads to "credit invisibility" for over 50 million Americans, limiting their access to loans and other financial opportunities. Minorities and immigrants are disproportionately affected by this inequity. Companies like Esusu are working to change this by partnering with rental companies and providing direct reporting services for renters, helping to establish credit scores and unlock financial opportunities.
