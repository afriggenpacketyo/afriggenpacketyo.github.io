          <h2>Japan's Stockpiled Rice Now Available in Stores at Reduced Prices</h2>
          <div class="timestamp">2025-05-31 02:52:00 EDT</div>
        </div>
        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>The Japanese government has started releasing its stockpiled rice through direct contracts with retailers, resulting in cheaper rice products hitting store shelves. Major supermarket operator Ito-Yokado Co. and home appliance company Iris Ohyama Inc. were among the first to sell the rice at a price of 2,160 yen ($15) for a 5 kilogram-bag. Consumers have been flocking to purchase the more affordable rice, with some stores selling out within minutes of opening. The Ministry of Agriculture, Forestry and Fisheries hopes this initiative will effectively curb rising rice prices, switching from auctions to direct sales to retailers for better price control. Optimism for consumers is tempered by the underlying economic pressures driving the need for cheaper alternatives.</p>

          <p>Dodgers shortstop Mookie Betts will be absent from the weekend series against the New York Yankees after fracturing his toe in an accident at home. Despite the injury, both Betts and manager Dave Roberts are optimistic that he can avoid a stint on the injured list. Betts sustained the fracture when he hit his toe on a wall in the dark, and while he attempted to play, putting on a shoe proved too difficult. The team plans to evaluate his pain tolerance daily, with Miguel Rojas, Tommy Edman, and Hyeseong Kim as potential replacements at shortstop.</p>
