          <p>President Donald Trump has officially endorsed Georgia's Lieutenant Governor, Burt Jones, for governor well ahead of the Republican primary. The endorsement is a significant boost for Jones's campaign and a setback for his primary opponent, Attorney General Chris Carr. In his announcement, Trump highlighted Jones's early and steadfast support for his own presidential campaigns, reinforcing their long-standing political alliance. This move solidifies Trump's influence within the state's Republican party dynamics as the race to succeed the term-limited Governor Brian Kemp begins.</p>

After retiring from a career detecting human remains, Maple was trained to find the disease in beehives, a crucial task given the ongoing decline of pollinator populations. Dressed in a custom protective bee suit, her work is helping to diagnose the threat and create a guidebook for training other dogs to do the same.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>This opinion piece argues that Democrats should resist the impulse to engage in partisan gerrymandering as a response to Republican tactics in states like Texas. The author contends that such a "fight fire with fire" approach is strategically flawed, as it ultimately favors the Republican party, and violates the core democratic principle of voting equality. Instead of mirroring their opponents, the article suggests Democrats should focus on winning elections by advancing more attractive policy platforms and mobilizing voters.</p>

          <p>This opinion piece argues against the idea that Los Angeles should withdraw from hosting the 2028 Olympics, pushing back on negativity surrounding the event. The author defends LA28 Chairman Casey Wasserman's engagement with the Trump administration as a necessary part of organizing the games for the city's benefit. Citing the historical success and profitability of the 1932 and 1984 L.A. Olympics, the article contends that the city's legacy of hosting successful games is too valuable to abandon over political disagreements.</p>

          <h2>Historical Context: How Russia's 19th-Century Sale of Alaska Connects to the Upcoming Summit</h2>

          <p>The upcoming U.S.-Russia summit in Alaska is layered with historical significance, as the U.S. purchased the territory from a debt-ridden Russian Empire in 1867. Russia's decision to sell was driven by its financial struggles after losing the Crimean War in the 1850s. The article notes the irony that Presidents Trump and Putin will now meet in this former Russian colony to discuss another difficult and costly war involving Crimea, highlighting a fascinating and often overlooked chapter of shared history between the two nations.</p>

          <p>The United States and China have extended their tariff truce for another 90 days, narrowly avoiding a significant escalation in their trade war. President Trump's executive order acknowledged that Beijing was taking "significant steps" to address U.S. concerns, providing more time for negotiations. This de-escalation stabilizes the economic situation for consumers and businesses, with analysts suggesting it could pave the way for a leadership summit between Trump and Xi Jinping to forge a more concrete trade agreement.

          <p>Global investors are increasing their allocations to China's $25 trillion domestic bond market, a trend that analysts at UBS attribute to a broader search for alternatives to U.S. dollar-denominated assets. This new wave of investment is supported by Beijing's recent moves to simplify procedures for foreign capital and the inclusion of Chinese bonds in major global indices. As of May, foreign investors held $587 billion in yuan-denominated bonds, rebounding significantly from a low in early 2023. (not investment advice)</p>
