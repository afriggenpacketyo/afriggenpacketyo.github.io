          <p>Taiwan's chief trade negotiator has formally rejected a U.S. proposal for the island to manufacture half of the chips it currently supplies to America. The "50-50" split, which was pitched by the U.S. Commerce Secretary as a way to reduce American reliance on Taiwan, was reportedly not a subject of discussion during recent bilateral trade talks. Instead, negotiations were centered on lowering tariff rates and securing exemptions for Taiwanese exports. The proposal has drawn sharp criticism from Taiwanese political figures, who characterize it as an attempt to undermine the nation's critical "Silicon Shield" and its technology sector.</p>

          <p>An explosion in a boiler room caused an entire corner of a 20-story residential building in the Bronx to collapse on Wednesday morning. The blast, which occurred at a New York City Housing Authority building, sent a ventilation shaft and debris crashing to the ground but miraculously resulted in no reported injuries or fatalities. Officials believe the explosion happened as the heating system was being turned on for the season. While 38 apartments were evacuated as a precaution, inspections are underway to ensure the building's structural integrity, and the incident has raised residents' concerns about ongoing maintenance issues.</p>

          <p>Despite gold prices reaching record highs, consumers in Hong Kong and mainland China are continuing to purchase gold jewelry, particularly for traditional wedding ceremonies. Gold has surged over 48% this year, with local prices in Hong Kong rising in tandem with the international market. Retailers like Chow Tai Fook have observed that consumers are gradually adapting to the new, higher price levels, driven by cultural traditions such as the gifting of gold dragon and phoenix bracelets at weddings. This sustained demand highlights the cultural significance of gold, which often outweighs purely financial considerations for many buyers in the region.</p>

According to his agent, the women parked extremely close to his vehicle and began recording him, and any water that splashed on them was incidental.

          <p>In a satirical nod to the ongoing U.S. housing crisis, the 133-year-old coffee brand Maxwell House has launched a marketing campaign rebranding itself as "Maxwell Apartment Coffee." The campaign's ads humorously ask, "Maxwell House? In this economy?" while acknowledging that homeownership is increasingly out of reach for many Americans. The tongue-in-cheek effort aims to connect with the growing population of renters by positioning the brand as an affordable staple. This marketing strategy reflects a broader economic reality, as the median age of first-time homebuyers has hit an all-time high amid soaring home prices and interest rates.</p>

          <p>A federal judge has once again dismissed a lawsuit filed by Spencer Elden, the man who appeared as a naked baby on the cover of Nirvana's 1991 album "Nevermind." Elden had claimed the image constituted child pornography and had caused him lifelong harm. In his ruling, the judge stated that no reasonable jury would consider the photograph pornographic, comparing it to a typical family photo of a nude child. This marks the second time the case has been thrown out, with the judge previously dismissing it on the grounds that the statute of limitations had expired.</p>

          <p>Elon Musk's net worth has surpassed $500 billion, making him the first person ever to reach this financial milestone, according to the Forbes billionaires index. This achievement was driven by a recovery in Tesla's stock price and rising valuations for his other major ventures, including SpaceX and the artificial intelligence startup xAI. Musk's wealth remains heavily tied to his stake in Tesla, which has seen its shares rise over 20% this year as investor confidence grew. The milestone solidifies his position as the world's wealthiest individual, significantly ahead of his closest competitors in the global tech industry.</p>

His nomination in August followed President Trump's firing of the previous commissioner after a weaker-than-expected jobs report.

          <p>A federal judge has issued a temporary restraining order preventing the Trump administration from diverting or withdrawing $34 million in anti-terrorism funding for New York City's transportation system. The state of New York sued after the administration moved to cut the funds, arguing the action was a punitive measure for the city's lack of cooperation with federal deportation programs. In his ruling, the judge stated it was "quite likely" that New York could prove the funds were being improperly diverted. He cited the city's history as a target for terrorism as a key reason for maintaining the security grants.</p>
