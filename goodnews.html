          <p>In this New York Times article, columnists Gail Collins and Bret Stephens reflect on the end of their eight-year weekly dialogue, "The Conversation," which aimed to bridge the liberal-conservative divide. They discuss the transformation of the Republican Party, the degradation of public discourse, and the role of social media in political polarization. Collins and Stephens share insights on maintaining civil conversations, emphasizing the importance of humor and a willingness to understand opposing viewpoints, rather than trying to "win" an argument. The article emphasizes the importance of civil discourse in a time of division, and also the importance of media fact checking.</p>

          <p>Jack Goldsmith, in this New York Times guest essay, argues that Donald Trump's expansion of presidential powers builds on excesses from previous administrations, including those of Richard Nixon, George W. Bush, Barack Obama, and Joe Biden. He contends that this escalation of power grabs has put the country on a dangerous course, leading to extreme policies and the politicization of the Justice Department. Goldsmith calls for substantial limitations on the presidency, suggesting reforms through the Supreme Court, Congress, and even constitutional amendments to restore checks and balances and curb executive overreach. The article advocates for a return to a time when Congress played a more vital role in domestic policy and law and norms effectively checked presidential actions.</p>

          <p>Scientists have developed a potentially universal antivenom using antibodies isolated from the blood of Tim Friede, a man who intentionally exposed himself to venom from multiple deadly snakes over 18 years. The antivenom, created by combining two of Friede‚Äôs antibodies with another molecule, has shown promise in mouse trials against the venom of various snakes, including black mambas and king cobras. Researchers hope this approach could lead to a more broadly effective and easily deployable antivenom, potentially saving lives in rural areas. The research was published in the journal Cell Press.</p>

          <p>Kosmos 482, a Soviet spacecraft launched in 1972, is expected to reenter Earth's atmosphere this weekend after orbiting the planet for over half a century. The probe, originally intended to reach Venus, became stranded in low Earth orbit due to an engine malfunction. While there is a small chance it could damage property or injure someone, experts believe the spacecraft is more likely to splash down in a body of water or burn up during reentry, though its heat shield may allow it to survive largely intact.</p>

          <p>China‚Äôs offshore yuan has strengthened, surpassing the 7.2 level against the US dollar, driven by expectations of a potential rollback of tariffs and renewed interest in Chinese assets. This shift in market sentiment is fueled by indications that the US and China may begin trade negotiations, potentially leading to a reduction in tariffs. However, analysts caution that negotiations are likely to be lengthy and volatile, and global investors are awaiting tangible signs of China's ability to withstand economic challenges before increasing their investments.</p>

The researchers used image processing to convert ancient records into measurable celestial coordinates, confirming the catalogue's observations.

          <p>A new genetic study conducted by Chinese and Dutch researchers indicates that the earliest roses were likely yellow. The study, which analyzed domesticated and wild rose samples, revealed that the common ancestor of modern roses probably had single-petal flowers with a yellow color. Roses, revered as symbols of love and beauty, have been extensively cultivated into a diverse range of shapes, sizes, and colors, but the new findings suggest a different origin for this iconic flower.</p>
