          <p>The price of ether, the second-largest cryptocurrency, surged nearly 14% to $4,817.61, approaching its 2021 all-time high, after Federal Reserve Chair Jerome Powell hinted at upcoming interest rate cuts. Powell's annual address from Jackson Hole suggested that the shifting balance of risks may warrant adjusting the Fed's policy stance, which traders interpreted as dovish. This sentiment led to a "risk-on" market repositioning, triggering approximately $120 million in short liquidations for ETH within an hour. The subsequent buying to close these positions further propelled the coin's price, and shares of companies focused on accumulating ether also rebounded significantly. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>Alphabet shares increased over 3% following a Bloomberg report that Apple is in early discussions to license Google's Gemini AI models for an updated version of its Siri assistant, potentially launching next year. These reported talks are particularly significant as Google faces potential risks to its lucrative search deals with Apple, with a U.S. judge expected to rule soon on Google's alleged search monopoly. Apple is actively exploring partnerships with other leading AI developers, including Anthropic and OpenAI, as it strives to renew its AI roadmap and enhance its Apple Intelligence framework. Google's flagship Gemini models consistently rank atop key benchmarks for artificial intelligence advancements, showcasing advanced capabilities that extend beyond current Siri functions, such as summarizing videos and holding complex conversations.</p>

Despite a valiant effort from the American Eagles, ranked 10th globally, England's superior quality, particularly from their bench players, powered them to 11 tries. This strong performance, backed by a celebratory crowd, significantly bolstered belief that the Red Roses can fulfill their status as tournament favorites after reaching five of the past six finals.</p>

          <p>Kilmar Abrego Garcia, a Salvadoran national who was mistakenly deported in March, has been released from criminal custody in Tennessee and is now returning to his family in Maryland. He was brought back to the U.S. in June to face human smuggling charges, which his attorneys vehemently assert are "preposterous" and a "vindictive attack" by the government. A federal judge ordered his release and blocked immigration authorities from detaining or deporting him upon his return to Maryland, though his legal team remains concerned about potential future actions. This development offers significant relief for Abrego Garcia, who maintains his innocence against gang affiliation claims.</p>

          <p>President Trump announced that Intel CEO Lip-Bu Tan agreed to give the U.S. government a 10% equity stake in the embattled chipmaker, a deal Trump valued at approximately $10 billion. This highly unusual move, which would convert grants from the 2022 CHIPS and Science Act into non-voting equity, signals an escalation in the administration's efforts to boost domestic chip manufacturing. The development comes as Intel faces significant challenges in the competitive AI chip market, lagging behind rivals like Nvidia, and has recently delayed plans for its Ohio factory complex. Critics question the implications for corporate independence and the long-term effectiveness of such government intervention. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>Canadian Prime Minister Mark Carney announced that Canada will drop some of its billions of dollars in retaliatory tariffs on U.S. goods, though levies on autos, steel, and aluminum will remain. This decision, effective September 1, aims to re-establish free trade for the vast majority of goods covered under the US-Mexico-Canada free trade agreement (USMCA). The move follows a phone call between Carney and President Trump, who welcomed the development as "long overdue." While easing some trade tensions, the focus now shifts to accelerating negotiations on the significant remaining sectors, amidst ongoing political debate in Canada over the prime minister's approach.</p>

          <p>Federal Reserve Chair Jerome Powell indicated that economic conditions "may warrant" interest rate cuts, citing rising downside risks and "sweeping changes" in tax, trade, and immigration policies during his much-anticipated Jackson Hole speech. While acknowledging a resilient labor market, Powell noted that tariffs could reignite inflation, presenting a complex challenge that requires proceeding carefully. His remarks, though cautious, were interpreted positively by markets, sending stocks soaring and bond yields tumbling as traders increased bets on future rate cuts. Powell also reaffirmed the Fed's commitment to its 2% inflation target and emphasized the institution's crucial independence amidst political pressure. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>The federal EV tax credit, offering up to $7,500, is slated to expire on September 30, but the IRS has provided crucial clarification for car buyers. Shoppers can still qualify if they enter a binding contract to purchase a vehicle and make a payment before the deadline, even if the car's delivery occurs at a later date. This flexibility is particularly beneficial for those ordering custom vehicles or facing shipping delays. However, the Trump administration's broader rollback of EV policies is expected to cause a near-term bump in sales followed by a subsequent drop, posing significant challenges for automakers already navigating shifting tariffs and high interest rates.
