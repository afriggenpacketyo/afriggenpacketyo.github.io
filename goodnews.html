          <p>With high interest rates making savings products attractive, many are weighing whether to open a certificate of deposit (CD) or invest in the stock market. Experts advise that the choice depends on financial goals, timeline, and risk tolerance. CDs offer guaranteed, stable returns, making them suitable for short-term goals, while the stock market provides higher potential growth for long-term objectives like retirement. The article notes that stocks are more liquid but carry greater risk, whereas CDs protect the principal investment but may have early withdrawal penalties. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>President Trump is reportedly preparing to sign an executive order to ease U.S. sanctions on Syria, following the collapse of the Assad regime and the formation of a transitional government. The new government has been pushing for sanctions relief to help rebuild the war-torn country, pay civil servants, and restore essential services. The move is supported by regional allies like Turkey and Saudi Arabia, who see an opportunity to bring the new Syrian government into their sphere of influence. Some of the most punitive sanctions, however, would still require formal revocation by the U.S. Congress.</p>

The Economic Policy Institute estimates that over 800,000 workers will see their pay increase as a result of these changes, which are driven by ballot measures and inflation adjustments. These local and state-level hikes contrast with the federal minimum wage, which has remained at $7.25 per hour since 2009.

          <p>Canada has announced it will rescind its digital services tax on large U.S. technology firms, a move made just hours before the first payments were due. The decision came after President Donald Trump called off trade negotiations, describing the tax as a "blatant attack" and threatening higher tariffs on Canadian imports. The 3% tax would have affected giants like Amazon, Meta, and Google, and was expected to generate over C$1.5 billion in its first year. Canada's finance minister stated the country's preference has always been a multilateral agreement, and the reversal aims to restart crucial trade talks.</p>

          <p>Homeowners considering borrowing against their home's equity must choose between a home equity line of credit (HELOC) and a home equity loan, each with different interest rate structures. HELOCs typically have variable rates tied to the Federal Reserve's actions, making them unpredictable but potentially cheaper if rates fall. In contrast, home equity loans usually have fixed rates based on mortgage bond trading, offering stability but less direct correlation with Fed cuts. Experts suggest that while HELOC rates may decline later this year if the Fed cuts rates, home equity loan rates are less certain to follow suit. (not investment advice)</p>
