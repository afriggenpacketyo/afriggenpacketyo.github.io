          <p>The Trump Organization has announced the launch of a cellular phone service called T1 Phone by Trump Mobile, priced at $47.45 per month with unlimited calls, text, and data. The company also plans to release a $499 phone manufactured in the U.S., coinciding with the 10-year anniversary of President Trump's first presidential run announcement. Eric Trump stated the new phone and service align with his father's policy plans to boost American manufacturing and employment, and the plan includes free calls to over 100 countries, roadside assistance, and telehealth services. Robert Weissman of Public Citizen raised ethics concerns about potential market distortions and tariff issues.</p>

          <p>A federal judge in Boston has extended legal relief to Harvard University in its challenge against the Trump administration's effort to block the entry of international students. Judge Allison Burroughs extended a temporary restraining order until June 23, while she considers a longer-term injunction against the proclamation. The Trump administration cited Harvard's engagement with China and other national security concerns when issuing the proclamation on June 4. Harvard argues that the proclamation is an "end run around" a previous court decision and violates the First Amendment.</p>

          <p>President Trump attended the G7 summit in Canada, addressing trade tensions and the Israel-Iran conflict. He stated Iran wishes to de-escalate but must make a deal, confirming he has received messages from Iran through intermediaries. A draft G7 statement on Iran is circulating, but Trump is not expected to sign it, and the President also suggested potentially inviting China to join the G7 and discussed Vladimir Putin's exclusion from the group in 2014. Trump's stance on tariffs and past remarks about Canada have created unease among U.S. allies, and the meeting included bilateral discussions with Canadian Prime Minister Mark Carney, who emphasized Canada is not for sale.</p>

          <p>U.S. Steel shares experienced a rally after President Trump approved its merger with Japan's Nippon Steel, subject to a national security agreement. Trump issued an executive order allowing the deal to proceed, contingent upon the signing of the agreement, and the agreement includes a golden share for the U.S. government. The golden share grants the U.S. president veto power over decisions regarding U.S. Steel's headquarters, relocation, renaming, production, and plant closures. The company will become a wholly-owned subsidiary of Nippon Steel North America, pending customary closing conditions.</p>

          <p>JJ Spaun's US Open victory at Oakmont is celebrated, but the circumstances of the tournament, defined by chaos and carnage, are questioned. The course setup, with dense rough and slick greens, limited players' creativity and skill, leading to accusations of excessive difficulty and luck influencing the outcome. The USGA's setup is seen by some as a message about controlling hitting distances, and several top players struggled with the conditions, raising questions about fairness. The event has caused many questions about the way the course was handled.</p>

          <p>Tourists in Yellowstone National Park witnessed a German Shepherd leaping from a vehicle to chase a young wolf. The wolf was trying to access an animal carcass across the highway, and the dog ran towards the wolf, leading to a brief standoff before the dog's owner retrieved it. Park regulations require tourists to stay at least 100 yards from wolves and bears if they're outside their vehicles, and this incident highlights the importance of maintaining control over pets in the park. This is an example of what not to do when visiting national parks.</p>
