          <p>Berkshire Hathaway's board has unanimously voted for Greg Abel to succeed Warren Buffett as CEO on January 1, 2026, while Buffett will remain chairman. Buffett, 94, had surprised shareholders by announcing his intention to step down as CEO, designating Abel, the current vice chairman of noninsurance operations, as his successor. Buffett clarified that Abel, 62, will have the final say on company operations and capital deployment, but he will remain available to assist with significant acquisition opportunities. Berkshire shares experienced a slight dip despite the announcement, closing at a record high on Friday with a market value exceeding $1.1 trillion.</p>

          <p>Temu, the China-based retailer, has stopped shipping goods from China to the U.S. after the de minimis tariff exemption expired on May 2. This exemption previously allowed low-value parcels to enter the U.S. without tariffs. Now, Temu's products from China face tariffs as high as 145%, impacting its appeal to U.S. consumers. Temu is transitioning to a local fulfillment model, with sales handled by U.S.-based sellers and orders fulfilled from domestic warehouses. The company is actively recruiting U.S. sellers to join the platform, which President Trump said was a 'big scam going on against our country, against really small businesses.'</p>

          <p>Warren Buffett has announced that Greg Abel, his top lieutenant and energy executive, will succeed him as CEO of Berkshire Hathaway at the end of the year. Buffett has expressed confidence in Abel, who currently oversees all of Berkshire's non-insurance companies. Abel joined Berkshire in 2000 and transformed MidAmerican into Berkshire Hathaway Energy, a major wind energy producer. Abel's management style is considered more hands-on than Buffett's, and he is well-regarded by Berkshire's managers. Abel lived near Buffett in Omaha for six years but they never met during that time.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>A new study in the American Journal of Psychiatry reveals that more American adults are engaging in talk therapy, while the use of psychiatric medications without therapy has declined. Between 2018 and 2021, the number of adults receiving psychotherapy increased from 6.5% to 8.5%. The study also found that more people are adhering to therapy after starting it, with more visits recorded for new patients. The expansion of telehealth and the inclusion of licensed counselors and social workers as providers have contributed to increased access, though the benefits are primarily seen among affluent, educated individuals with private insurance.</p>

          <p>Comedian Michelladonna hosts a TikTok show called Shop Cats, where she "interviews" the feline residents of New York City bodegas. Bodega cats serve as vermin control and mascots in these corner stores, which function as community hubs. Social media accounts like @bodegacatsofinstagram have popularized these cats globally. Michelladonna's show highlights the cats and the bodega workers and customers who love them. She finds that supporting characters in the bodega workers and customers give some of the best commentary.</p>

Criminals use social engineering techniques to trick employees into handing over login passwords and security codes.

          <p>A history professor argues for the importance of the National Endowment for the Humanities (NEH) in understanding California's past. The professor's own research on colonial California has been made possible by NEH funding, which has allowed for the creation of online databases and museum exhibits. The NEH has played a vital role in our national search for meaning and self-knowledge, and its funding is a tremendously successful investment in our nation‚Äôs cultural fabric. The professor warns that cutting funding to the NEH would be a loss to society.</p>
