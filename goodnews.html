          <p>The Trump administration has announced a significant trade deal with Japan, which includes setting reciprocal tariffs at 15% and lowering the duty on Japanese auto imports to that level from 25%. President Trump stated that the agreement would involve a $550 billion investment from Japan into the United States and would open Japanese markets to American goods like cars, trucks, and agricultural products. The announcement prompted a surge in Japanese auto stocks, with companies like Toyota and Honda seeing major gains. This deal is seen as a political victory for Japanese Prime Minister Shigeru Ishiba, potentially strengthening his leadership. (not investment advice)</p>

Highlights include Lamar's commanding stage presence, particularly during his Drake diss tracks, and SZA's captivating vocals and creative, nature-themed set designs.

          <h2>Japanese Automaker Stocks Surge Following U.S. Tariff Reduction Announcement</h2>
          <div class="timestamp">2025-07-22 23:52:38 EDT</div>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>The stocks of major Japanese automakers, including Toyota, Honda, and Nissan, soared after the announcement of a new U.S.-Japan trade deal that lowers tariffs on imported vehicles from 25% to 15%. Toyota's shares jumped over 15%, while others like Mazda and Mitsubishi saw double-digit increases, reflecting significant investor relief as auto exports are a critical component of Japan's economy. The previous 25% tariff, enacted in April, had negatively impacted Japanese auto exports to the U.S. The reduction is seen as providing crucial short-term assurance for the industry's financial stability and competitiveness.

          <p>Economic experts are urging Chinese companies to more deeply integrate with local economies in Southeast Asian nations to mitigate the impact of U.S. tariffs on transshipped goods. The advice follows a U.S. announcement of steep tariffs on imports diverted through third countries like Vietnam to avoid direct levies on Chinese products. An economist from the ASEAN+3 Macroeconomic Research Office suggested that by becoming more ingrained in local supply chains, Chinese firms can build long-term resilience against unpredictable trade policies. This strategy is seen as crucial with U.S. tariffs on Chinese imports averaging 42%, compared to lower rates for other Asian countries. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>The Los Angeles Dodgers have placed closer Tanner Scott on the injured list due to elbow inflammation, though the team remains hopeful he can return this season. Scott exited a recent game with a "stinging sensation" in his forearm, but initial reports suggest the injury may not be season-ending. His absence is a blow to a bullpen already dealing with several key injuries and highlights the team's need to acquire another high-leverage reliever before the trade deadline. Despite Scott's inconsistent performance this season, losing him long-term would have significantly impacted the team's pitching depth.</p>

          <p>A haunting 1975 photograph of a woman and child falling from a collapsed fire escape in Boston not only won a Pulitzer Prize but also spurred significant changes in public safety regulations. The photo, taken by Stanley Forman, captured the tragic death of 19-year-old Diana Bryant, though her 2-year-old goddaughter survived the fall. The powerful image raised widespread public awareness about the dangers of neglected fire escapes. Within months, Boston enacted a new city code requiring fire escapes to be certified as safe every five years, a move that had a ripple effect on safety standards across the country.</p>

          <p>Archaeologists and local historians have identified a shipwreck discovered on the Scottish island of Sanday as likely being the Earl of Chatham, an 18th-century vessel with a rich history. Originally the HMS Hind, a Royal Navy frigate that served in the American War of Independence, the ship was later sold and repurposed as a whaler. Using tree-ring dating and historical records, researchers pieced together its story, which ended when it was wrecked in a storm in 1788. The discovery was driven by a community-led effort, with local residents helping to recover the timbers for preservation and study.</p>
