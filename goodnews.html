          <h2>Workplace Crying: A Sign of Weakness or an Indicator of Emotional Intelligence?</h2>

        </div>
        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>The act of crying at work is being re-evaluated, moving from a perceived career liability to a potential sign of emotional strength and authenticity. While some still view it as unprofessional, particularly for leaders, many experts and employees argue it reflects a more human-centric workplace where emotional intelligence is valued. The article shares anecdotes from various professionals, both men and women, who have cried at work due to stress, frustration, or personal grief. It concludes that while biases exist, a single emotional display is unlikely to ruin a career, and supportive employers often foster greater loyalty and motivation.</p>

          <p>Vice President JD Vance has demonstrated significant influence within the Trump administration, playing a crucial role in navigating a major tax and spending bill through Congress. He actively engaged with legislative holdouts in both the Senate and House, securing key votes and casting tie-breakers to ensure the bill's passage. Beyond domestic policy, Vance has also become a key defender of President Trump's foreign policy decisions, including actions related to Iran, despite his previous non-interventionist stance. This active, multi-issue role aligns with the expectation that he would serve as the president's "eyes and ears," solidifying his position as a powerful VP and potential 2028 presidential contender.</p>

          <h2>Experts Warn Against Sleeping with Wet Hair Due to Potential Scalp and Skin Issues</h2>
          <div class="timestamp">2025-07-05 05:00:41 EDT</div>
        </div>
        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Health and hair experts are advising against going to bed with wet hair, citing several risks to scalp, hair, and skin health. When hair is wet, it becomes more fragile and susceptible to breakage and split ends from friction against a pillowcase. The damp, warm environment created on the scalp can promote the growth of fungi and bacteria, leading to issues like dandruff, irritation, or even folliculitis. This moisture can also transfer to the pillowcase, potentially causing acne or exacerbating skin conditions like eczema, making it important to dry hair before sleeping.</p>

          <p>The recent Ethereum Community Conference in Cannes highlighted the blockchain's growing role as critical infrastructure for the financial industry, shifting focus from price speculation to utility. Major financial players are increasingly building on Ethereum, with Robinhood launching on-chain tokenized U.S. stocks and Deutsche Bank developing a tokenization platform on an Ethereum-based network. Institutions are reportedly valuing Ethereum not for hype, but for its stability, security, and decade-long operational track record without downtime. This institutional adoption signals a significant shift, positioning Ethereum as the potential backbone for the next generation of global finance. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>China's state-owned company Sinopec has advanced its renewable energy efforts by launching a large-scale floating solar power station in the coastal waters of Qingdao. This project, combined with a similar one from late May, forms a significant initiative that leverages the ocean's surface for energy generation. The solar panels, which rise and fall with the tide, are expected to be more efficient due to the cooling effect of the water. Together, the two offshore stations are projected to generate 16.7 million kilowatt-hours of electricity annually, which will significantly reduce carbon dioxide emissions by an estimated 14,000 tonnes.</p>

Statistical analysis suggests there is a 37% chance the tournament winner will emerge from this group. While England aims to continue its strong tournament record, Wales embraces its underdog status, hoping to build on recent competitive performances against top-ranked teams and cause an upset in their first-ever major tournament appearance.</p>

          <p>The article reflects on the return of competitive eating legend Joey Chestnut to the Nathan's Famous Fourth of July Hot Dog Eating Contest, framing the event as a uniquely honest, if bizarre, form of sport. It details Chestnut's intense training regimen and competitive mindset, likening him to other elite athletes in his dedication. The author views the contest as a satirical mirror to a culture of excess, an extreme spectacle that cuts directly to the consumerist desires underpinning many American activities. Despite its grotesque nature, the event is presented as a raw expression of will and a strange, compelling piece of performance art.</p>

          <p>Recent studies reignite the debate on whether people from different cultures perceive the world differently. One study found that people from Western, "carpentered" environments tend to see rectangles in an illusion where rural Namibians see circles, supporting an old hypothesis about environmental influence. However, a separate study convincingly argues against this hypothesis for the well-known Müller-Lyer illusion, showing it affects animals and even the newly sighted. The author suggests that while perceptual diversity between and within cultures is plausible, simple stereotypes are insufficient explanations, highlighting that all perception is an active construction by the brain, not a direct window onto reality.</p>

          <p>For the first time in over 100 years, Paris has opened three designated zones in the Seine River for public swimming, a legacy of the city's 2024 Olympic Games preparations. The ban, instated in 1923 due to poor water quality and safety concerns, was lifted after a €1.4 billion cleanup effort improved sanitation and reduced pollution. The project included building a massive underground wastewater storage tank to prevent sewage overflow. These new supervised swimming areas, complete with changing rooms and lifeguards, are part of a broader city initiative to enhance quality of life and adapt to climate change, fulfilling a long-held ambition.</p>

          <p>A team of Chinese scientists has made a significant breakthrough in regenerative medicine by discovering a "genetic switch" that allowed them to restore damaged ear tissue in mice. Their research, published in the journal *Science*, found that activating the production of retinoic acid, a vitamin A derivative, could trigger the complete regeneration of lost cartilage and tissue. The scientists believe this mechanism, which appears to have been disabled during evolution, might also be present in other organs. While human application is still a distant goal, the findings offer new hope and a promising new direction for the field of organ regeneration.</p>
