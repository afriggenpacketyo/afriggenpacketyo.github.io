          <div class="timestamp">2025-08-22 14:52:53 EDT</div>
        </div>
        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Intel shares saw a rise of approximately 6% following reports that the Trump administration plans to announce the U.S. government will acquire an equity stake in the struggling chipmaker. President Trump indicated the government should receive about 10% of the company, which has a market cap of just over $100 billion, though White House officials noted "ongoing discussions" and no explicit agreement from Intel's CEO. This move signifies a distinct shift in U.S. industrial policy, with the government taking an active role in corporate America, specifically in exchange for CHIPS Act funds. Commerce Secretary Howard Lutnick confirmed the government's pursuit of a non-voting equity stake, aiming to bolster domestic advanced chip manufacturing capabilities. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>The stock market experienced a significant rally on Friday, driven by Federal Reserve Chairman Jerome Powell's speech at the Jackson Hole symposium, which hinted at potential interest rate cuts due to growing downside risks in the labor market. This dovish stance led to surges in cyclical, economically sensitive stocks like Capital One, DuPont, and Home Depot, while defensive sectors lagged. The article also provides specific corporate updates: Starbucks anticipates non-binding offers for a stake in its China business from several private equity firms, and analysts are commenting on Honeywell's quantum unit, Quantinuum, which is seeking a $10 billion valuation, suggesting upside potential for Honeywell.

          <h2>"Splitsville" Film Review: A Comedy That Misses Its Mark on Satire and Male Friendship</h2>
          <div class="timestamp">2025-08-22 14:44:47 EDT</div>
        </div>
        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>The film "Splitsville," directed by and starring Michael Angelo Covino alongside Kyle Marvin, attempts to be a cutting comedy about modern marriage and male friendship but ultimately falls short. The narrative follows Carey, whose wife wants a divorce, leading him to his friends Paul and Julie, who are in an open relationship, complicating matters when Carey sleeps with Julie. While aiming to satirize bourgeois aspirations and the absurdities of male bonding, the review criticizes the film for its smug self-regard and for centering the male leads' antics excessively. Despite strong performances from Dakota Johnson and Adria Arjona, the movie struggles to reconcile its comedic elements with deeper meaning, often feeling too outlandish.</p>

          <p>Major League Baseball is reportedly close to finalizing new three-year media rights deals with Disney's ESPN, Comcast's NBC Sports, and Netflix for various packages of live games. ESPN, which previously opted out of its Sunday Night Baseball deal, is expected to acquire a new package of rights for $550 million, including MLB TV and in-market games for five local teams. NBC is anticipated to secure Sunday games and Wild Card playoff games for approximately $200 million annually, while Netflix is set to gain rights to the Home Run Derby for about $50 million a year. These agreements, ending after the 2028 season, allow MLB to reorganize its media rights and adapt to evolving broadcast landscapes. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>Kilmar Abrego Garcia, a Salvadoran native who was wrongly deported in March, has been released from criminal custody in Tennessee and is en route to Maryland. He was brought back to the U.S. in June to face human smuggling charges, to which he pleaded not guilty. A federal judge previously ruled that immigration authorities could not detain Abrego Garcia upon his release, ordering him to be placed under ICE supervision in Maryland, where he lived with his family. His attorneys accuse federal prosecutors of "vindictive and selective prosecution," arguing the government charged him because he resisted the violation of his due process rights. His criminal trial is scheduled for January 2027, continuing the legal saga.</p>

          <p>Fifteen young climate advocates, aged eight to 17, have filed a lawsuit against the state of Wisconsin, challenging its pro-fossil fuel policies. The plaintiffs argue that two specific state laws, which prohibit the public service commission from considering climate pollution in permitting new fossil fuel plants and from requiring increased carbon-free electricity, violate their constitutional rights to life, liberty, and the pursuit of happiness. Lead plaintiff Kaarina, 17, shared her traumatic experience of being displaced by climate-exacerbated flooding, inspiring her involvement. This case, supported by Our Children’s Trust and Midwest Environmental Advocates, seeks to overturn these laws and push Wisconsin towards its pledged 100% carbon-free electricity goal by 2050, highlighting the growing importance of state-level climate action amidst federal deregulation.</p>

          <p>Federal Reserve Chair Jerome Powell indicated that conditions "may warrant" interest rate cuts, noting a high level of uncertainty in his speech at the Jackson Hole symposium. He cited "sweeping changes" in tax, trade, and immigration policies, leading to a shifting balance of risks between full employment and stable prices. While acknowledging the resilient labor market, Powell stated rising downside dangers and the potential for inflation to rise again due to tariffs. Despite President Trump's demands for aggressive cuts, Powell emphasized the Fed's independence, stating decisions are based solely on data and economic outlook, allowing the central bank to proceed carefully with its policy stance.

          <p>Canadian Prime Minister Mark Carney announced that Canada will remove many of its retaliatory tariffs on U.S. goods covered under the USMCA agreement, effective September 1. This move aims to re-establish free trade for the majority of goods between the two nations, following a phone call with President Trump. However, Canada will maintain levies on U.S. autos, steel, and aluminum, matching the U.S.'s 35% tariff on non-compliant goods. Carney emphasized that this selective removal preserves Canada's trade advantage. The decision comes amidst ongoing negotiations and concerns from economists about the "hugely disruptive" impact of U.S. tariffs on Canadian industries like steel, aluminum, and auto manufacturing.

          <p>Kimbal Musk, Elon Musk's younger brother, publicly stated that Elon "deserves to be paid" amidst Tesla's ongoing legal battle over its CEO's compensation. He highlighted that Elon has received "zero pay for the past six to eight years," being compensated instead through performance-based stock options. Earlier this month, Tesla's board granted Elon an "interim" pay package of 96 million shares, valued at about $29 billion, without a shareholder vote, which will apply if Tesla loses its appeal in Delaware regarding a revoked $56 billion 2018 package. An investment group has since asked Nasdaq to investigate this new package for potential listing policy violations, adding complexity to the compensation saga. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>The UK government has agreed to an out-of-court settlement to pay compensation to over 7,700 Kenyans affected by a fire caused by a British military training exercise in the Lolldaiga conservancy four years ago. Claimants had sought redress for lost property and health complications due to the 2021 fire, which the UK Ministry of Defence previously attributed to a knocked-over camp stove. While the British High Commission called the fire "extremely regrettable," the specific amount paid was not confirmed by the government, though the lawyer in the case stated it was £2.9 million. This resolution follows a lengthy legal battle and highlights ongoing concerns regarding the conduct of British troops in Kenya, including previous allegations of misconduct and land disputes stemming from the colonial era.</p>

          <p>Major retailers like Walmart and Home Depot are adapting to President Trump's increased tariffs, implementing creative strategies to avoid widespread price hikes for consumers. While some tariff costs have been absorbed or passed on selectively, the overall impact on consumer spending has been less severe than initially feared. Retailers are diversifying sourcing, pushing back on vendors, and strategically managing price increases to avoid customer backlash and White House scrutiny. Despite steady consumer spending in some categories, lower-income shoppers remain sensitive to price changes. The ongoing trade uncertainty, particularly with China tariffs still in flux, continues to influence retailers' financial outlooks and operational decisions. (not investment advice)</p>
