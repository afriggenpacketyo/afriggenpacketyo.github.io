          <p>Bridgewater Associates founder Ray Dalio has advised investors to consider allocating up to 15% of their portfolios to gold, citing the current economic environment's similarity to the early 1970s. He argues that gold serves as an excellent diversifier and a reliable store of wealth during periods of high government debt and potential currency debasement. Dalio's recommendation comes as the precious metal's price has surged, reflecting growing investor concern over fiscal deficits and geopolitical instability, positioning gold as a key hedge against the declining value of traditional paper assets.

          <p>Dallas Cowboys owner Jerry Jones has commented on an incident where he was seen making an obscene gesture to fans, calling the moment "unfortunate." A video on social media showed Jones flipping his middle finger from a suite during a game against the New York Jets. Jones explained that the gesture was unintentional and that he had meant to give a thumbs-up to a group of Cowboys supporters following a touchdown. The incident occurred during a dominant 37-22 victory for the team, which improved their season record.</p>

          <p>England's cricket team began their Women's World Cup campaign with an unconvincing four-wicket victory over Bangladesh, thanks to a resilient unbeaten 79 from captain Heather Knight. Chasing a modest target of 179, England's top order faltered against spin, slumping to 103-6 and raising the prospect of a major upset. However, a composed and unbroken partnership between Knight and Charlie Dean guided the team to their target in the 47th over, highlighting both the team's ability to handle pressure and their ongoing struggles against spin bowling.</p>

          <p>The World Trade Organization (WTO) has increased its forecast for global trade growth in 2025 to 2.4%, a significant rise from its previous 0.9% estimate. This upward revision is attributed to strong demand for AI-related goods, front-loading of imports ahead of tariff implementations, and favorable macroeconomic conditions. However, the WTO issued a stark warning for the following year, slashing its 2026 trade growth projection to just 0.5%, citing an expected global economic slowdown and the delayed but full impact of higher tariffs.

          <p>The UK's Financial Conduct Authority (FCA) has outlined a compensation plan for millions of consumers affected by the mis-selling of car finance, with potential average payouts of around £700 per person. The investigation covers 14 million agreements made between 2007 and 2024, focusing on unfair discretionary commission arrangements that may have led to customers overpaying for loans. The total compensation from lenders could reach £8.2 billion as the regulator seeks to provide fair redress for those who received inaccurate information or were subject to unfair contracts.

          <p>Borrowers facing debt collectors have significant protections under the federal Fair Debt Collection Practices Act (FDCPA) that can help prevent harassment and unfair treatment. Key rights include the ability to be free from abusive tactics, the right to receive a validation notice and dispute the debt's accuracy, and the power to control communication by telling a collector to stop contact in writing. Understanding and exercising these rights allows consumers to navigate the collection process with more confidence and avoid paying debts that are incorrect or do not belong to them.</p>
