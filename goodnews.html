          <p>Aerospace company Firefly announced its acquisition of defense technology contractor SciTec in a deal valued at $855 million, consisting of cash and stock. The move is intended to bolster Firefly's national security capabilities by integrating SciTec's expertise in missile warning, tracking, and autonomous command and control systems. This acquisition follows a recent rocket explosion during a ground test but also comes amid a series of major government contracts for Firefly, including with NASA. The deal signals Firefly's strategic focus on strengthening its position within the defense and space sectors, with SciTec set to operate as a subsidiary.</p>

        </div>
        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>For senior homeowners considering a reverse mortgage to supplement retirement income, lenders typically require at least 50% to 60% equity in their home. This loan, most commonly the FHA-backed Home Equity Conversion Mortgage (HECM), allows individuals aged 62 and older to convert home equity into cash without monthly repayments. The actual amount that can be borrowed depends on factors like the borrower's age, current interest rates, and FHA lending limits. Homeowners who don't meet the equity threshold can explore options such as paying down their existing mortgage, waiting for their home value to appreciate, or downsizing to a less expensive property.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>The International Criminal Court (ICC) has found Ali Muhammad Ali Abd–Al-Rahman, a former leader of Sudan's Janjaweed militia, guilty of war crimes and crimes against humanity in Darfur. This marks the court's first conviction for the atrocities committed in the region over 20 years ago, which are widely considered the 21st century's first genocide. Abd–Al-Rahman, also known as Ali Kushayb, was convicted on 27 counts, including murder, rape, and torture, carried out as part of a government-backed plan to suppress a rebellion. The verdict is a landmark moment for international justice, though arrest warrants for other Sudanese officials, including former president Omar al-Bashir, remain outstanding.</p>

          <p>Specialty glass manufacturer Corning is gaining attention from investors due to its integral role in the ongoing buildout of artificial intelligence infrastructure. The exponential growth of AI is fueling a massive demand for fiber optic cables within modern data centers, a core market for Corning's products. Analysts observe that new AI data centers require four to sixteen times more fiber than previous generations, positioning the company for significant growth. Corning's strong, long-term partnership with Apple to supply cover glass for iPhones and Apple Watches further strengthens its financial outlook and market position. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>For over 60 years, the Bread and Puppet Theater has been a fixture of American political protest, known for its giant puppets and distribution of homemade sourdough bread at performances. Founded in 1963 by Peter Schumann, the troupe continues its annual national tour, presenting shows that blend medieval play traditions with sharp political commentary on issues like labor rights, foreign policy, and the Palestinian cause. Despite facing criticism and potential risks to their free expression, the performers remain committed to their ethos of anti-capitalism and social revolution.

          <p>Indirect talks between Israel and Hamas have begun in Sharm el-Sheikh, Egypt, aimed at ending the two-year war in Gaza. The negotiations, mediated by Arab officials, are centered on a 20-point plan proposed by U.S. President Donald Trump. Hamas has reportedly agreed to key aspects of the plan, including the release of all remaining hostages in exchange for Palestinian prisoners and handing Gaza's control to a transitional international body. While significant hurdles remain, particularly concerning Hamas's disarmament, the talks represent the most promising diplomatic effort to date to resolve the long-standing conflict and secure the release of captives.</p>

In a recent podcast interview, Lynch emphasized his long-held principle of "know what you own," admitting he doesn't understand the technology well enough to invest confidently and couldn't even pronounce Nvidia until recently. He cautioned investors against "playing the market" and instead advocated for buying into good companies whose businesses they fundamentally understand.

          <p>The Trump administration is reportedly developing a financial aid package that could exceed $10 billion to support U.S. farmers impacted by trade disputes. The relief is primarily aimed at soybean farmers, who have been severely affected by a Chinese boycott of American soybeans, a major export market. Top economic adviser Kevin Hassett confirmed that discussions are underway and that "big measures" would be announced soon to address the issue of unsold crops. The potential aid follows President Trump's suggestion that revenue collected from new tariffs could be used to support the agricultural sector through the economic disruption.</p>
