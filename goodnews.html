          <p>This article provides an overview of the annual "Money Issue" from CBS's "Sunday Morning," which focuses on the multifaceted topic of retirement. The segments cover a range of subjects, from the financial security of the Social Security system and the FIRE (Financial Independence, Retire Early) movement to lifestyle choices like creating bucket lists and moving abroad. The program also highlights unique retirement paths, including social media "grandfluencers," the use of an Air Force base as a home for retired warplanes, and a sanctuary for chimpanzees retired from scientific research.</p>

          <p>A small, magnitude 3.0 earthquake struck near Hasbrouck Heights, New Jersey, causing a brief tremor that was felt across the New York metropolitan area. The event occurred at a depth of about 6.2 miles and, while noticeable to residents, was not strong enough to cause any damage. New York City's emergency management confirmed no immediate reports of major impacts. Such mild tremors are somewhat uncommon in the northeastern United States, prompting a flurry of social media activity.</p>

          <p>A team of Chinese scientists has successfully developed a new type of cryogenic steel, CHSN01, designed to withstand the extreme conditions inside a nuclear fusion reactor. This breakthrough material addresses a critical challenge for projects like the International Thermonuclear Experimental Reactor (ITER), which require materials that can endure both near-absolute zero temperatures and immense magnetic forces. The development of this high-strength, low-temperature steel positions China as a leader in materials science for fusion energy. The material has already been deployed in the construction of the world's first fusion nuclear power generation reactor.</p>

          <p>Dylan Field, the 33-year-old CEO of design software company Figma, has become a tech billionaire following his company's highly successful IPO. A former Brown University student and Thiel Fellow, Field co-founded Figma, which has become a dominant tool for web-based app and website design. The company's market debut comes after a proposed $20 billion acquisition by Adobe was scrapped due to regulatory concerns in late 2023. Field's journey from a college dropout to leading a company with a market capitalization exceeding $70 billion marks a significant success story for Silicon Valley.</p>

          <p>This article presents a short poem by Kevin Young titled "Faith." The poem uses the imagery of small birds in a road, observing how they know precisely when to fly away from approaching danger. They feast on unseen things and then escape to sing, an act the narrator seems to view as a form of faith. The piece contemplates their instinct for survival and their ability to find sustenance and joy amidst peril.</p>

          <p>Researchers at Zhejiang University in China have developed the "Darwin Monkey," the world's first brain-like computer built with over 2 billion artificial neurons. The system is powered by 960 proprietary Darwin 3 neuromorphic chips, which simulate over 100 billion synapses, the connections between neurons in a biological brain. This groundbreaking computing system has already been used to perform complex tasks such as content generation and logical reasoning. The development marks a significant step toward achieving more advanced, brain-like artificial intelligence.</p>

          <p>UCLA's new offensive coordinator, Tino Sunseri, is tasked with quickly integrating transfer quarterback Nico Iamaleava into the Bruins' system ahead of the season opener. Sunseri has a track record of success with new quarterbacks at his previous coaching stops and is impressed with Iamaleava's self-driven and focused approach. The offensive philosophy will emphasize physicality and running the ball, utilizing a deep group of running backs to keep players fresh. Sunseri aims to create an offense that stretches the field and forces defenses to account for every area.</p>

          <p>Dan Ardell, a former Los Angeles Angels first baseman, had a brief and unusual MLB career in 1961, most noted for his only hit resulting in a walk-off loss due to a baserunning error. However, Ardell's life was not defined by baseball; he found the professional game boring and retired at 23 to pursue a successful career in real estate and asset management. This article profiles his journey from a reluctant ballplayer to a philanthropist focused on making a positive difference, a path deeply influenced by his late wife, a baseball academic who rekindled his appreciation for the sport.</p>

          <p>Scottie Scheffler, the world's number-one golfer, has made a cameo appearance in the movie "Happy Gilmore 2," which could help soften his public image as an unflappable, robotic competitor. In the film, Scheffler playfully references his real-life arrest earlier this year at the PGA Championship, engaging in self-effacing comedy. This appearance provides fans a glimpse of a more fun-loving personality, contrasting with his intensely focused and often drama-free dominance on the golf course. The role is seen as a positive move for both the player and the sport.</p>

          <p>As major donors like the United States and the United Kingdom slash their foreign aid budgets, a few other countries are bucking the trend by increasing their commitments. Spain, for example, has pledged to more than double its aid budget by 2030, joining nations like Ireland, South Korea, and Italy in boosting their spending. This shift comes amid a projected $56 billion funding gap in global development, which threatens progress on health and poverty. The article suggests this changing landscape could lead to a more collaborative and less paternalistic future for foreign aid.</p>

          <h2>Study Suggests Earthquakes May Sustain Life in Earth's Deep Biosphere</h2>
          <div class="timestamp">2025-08-03 06:03:29 EDT</div>
        </div>
        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>A new study led by Chinese and Canadian researchers suggests that earthquakes may play a crucial role in powering life in the deep biosphere, one of Earth's most isolated environments. This vast, hidden ecosystem is estimated to contain a significant portion of the planet's microbial life. The research proposes that the energy released during seismic events provides the power necessary for these deep-earth microbes to survive. This discovery offers a new answer to the long-standing question of how life can thrive in such extreme and dark depths.</p>
