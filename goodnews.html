          <p>Decades after leaving high school to serve in the Vietnam War, Dennis Snyder and Richard Hill received their diplomas as part of the Muscatine High class of 2025. Snyder, who volunteered for the Navy before his junior year, always regretted missing his high school graduation. They are part of Operation Recognition, an Iowa Department of Veterans Affairs program that has granted diplomas to over 100 veterans. Snyder shared the honor with high school friends who died in Vietnam, emphasizing the importance of recognizing veterans' service.</p>

          <p>A Japanese startup, Craif Inc., has developed a urine-based cancer risk screening kit that shows promise in detecting cancer at its earliest stages. The "miSignal" test kit can simultaneously assess the risk of up to seven types of cancer without requiring a blood test. A survey using the test kits detected a tumor in the lungs of a woman and precancerous cells in the colon and pancreas of six others. The test detects microRNA, a biomarker linked to early cancer biology, making it valuable in areas with limited medical resources.</p>

          <p>Chinese researchers have used mathematical analysis to decode the metabolic cycle of yeast, revealing parallels with the ancient Chinese philosophy of yin and yang. Professor Li Lei's team reorganized yeast metabolism into four interconnected phases, each reflecting a unique metabolic state. These phases mirror the concept of mutual promotion and restraint, known as xiang sheng xiang ke in traditional Chinese medicine. The model aligns with the "four symbols" theory, which seeks balance between yin and yang to maintain health and harmony.</p>

Key issues include support for households grappling with inflation, political funding scandals, child-rearing policies, and measures to prevent heatstroke.</p>

          <p>After their son, Blaze Bernstein, was murdered by a neo-Nazi, a California family transformed their grief into a kindness movement called "BlazeItForward." Blaze was targeted because he was gay and Jewish, and his killer, Samuel Woodward, was a member of a violent hate group. The family promotes positivity and random acts of kindness in Blaze's name, and they have received hundreds of hand-painted stones with messages of tolerance, love, and peace. Woodward was found guilty of first-degree murder with a hate crime enhancement and sentenced to life in prison without parole.</p>

          <p>Chinese authorities are introducing "property supermarkets," both online and offline, to support the country's struggling housing market. Chengdu is the latest city to launch a homebuying platform, partnering with state-owned and private developers to feature over 50 projects on a mobile app. These platforms aim to improve transparency and efficiency in homebuying, with similar initiatives in other cities including Suzhou and Weihai. The goal is to consolidate information, bundle services, and minimize false promotions to revive the property sector. (not investment advice)</p>

The eastern province of Shandong urged wider adoption of such supermarkets in February, and the city of Weihai unveiled its version last week, with a local bank leading the efforts, bypassing property agents.

          <p>Chinese tourists are increasingly seeking adventure tourism experiences in remote and off-the-beaten-path locations, often inspired by social media. These travelers are drawn to once-in-a-lifetime experiences that offer a disconnect from daily life and immersion in nature. For example, Huang Yihe, a Shanghai-based foreign trade worker, prioritizes avoiding popular sights in favor of unique adventures, such as searching for the world's largest rafflesia in the jungles of Malaysia. This trend reflects a growing desire for authentic and thrilling travel experiences.</p>

          <p>Jane Dorotik's conviction for the murder of her husband, Bob, was overturned after she spent two decades in prison fighting for her freedom. New testing of evidence, conducted with Loyola Project for the Innocent, revealed that some blood spots were never tested and others were not blood at all. While she was behind bars, Dorotik filed motions citing insufficient evidence and ineffective assistance of counsel, and the prosecution ultimately conceded that the new DNA evidence cast doubt on the verdict. Although the case was dismissed without prejudice, Dorotik is now working to rebuild her life and advocate for other incarcerated women.</p>
