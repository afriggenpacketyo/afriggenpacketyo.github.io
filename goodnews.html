          <p>President Trump met with conservative Republicans to address concerns about the budget bill, which includes his second-term agenda, but faces opposition from both fiscal conservatives and blue-state Republicans. House Speaker Mike Johnson described the meeting as productive, while some Republicans voiced strong disagreement with the bill's spending cuts. The Rules Committee held an overnight meeting as conservatives pushed for steeper cuts to Medicaid and the elimination of clean energy subsidies, while blue-state Republicans sought an increase to the state and local tax deduction cap. The budget bill is estimated to add trillions to the deficit over the next decade.</p>

          <p>A New York City pilot program is helping formerly incarcerated individuals find jobs in the trucking industry, which currently faces a shortage of about 60,000 drivers. The Commercial Driver's License Workforce Development Program, a partnership between New York City's Mayor's Office of Criminal Justice and Emerge Career, trains formerly incarcerated people for trucking jobs, helping them obtain commercial driver's licenses and connecting them with trucking companies. Participants in the program have a significantly lower rate of recidivism, and graduates receive job offers with an average starting salary of $75,000 per year. The program aims to provide a second chance for individuals re-entering society while addressing a critical need in the American supply chain.</p>

Representatives of the Chagossian community have been invited for discussions, while the government has yet to spell out the estimated cost to British taxpayers.

          <p>The leaders of the United States Institute for Peace regained control of their offices after a judge declared the Trump administration's takeover "null and void." The ruling came after USIP leaders sued the government following their ejection from their positions in March. The events started with President Trump's Executive Order declaring USIP "unnecessary" and terminating its leadership, staff, and board. Representatives of DOGE, led by Elon Musk, seized control of the institute's headquarters, prompting a legal battle.

The long-term goal is to coat bed nets with a drug cocktail to combat insecticide resistance. Vaccines to protect children living in high-risk malaria areas are also recommended.</p>
