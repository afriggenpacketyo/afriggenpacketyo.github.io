          <p>Following a session where all major stock indexes closed at record levels, CNBC's Jim Cramer argued against market pessimism, suggesting that positive economic indicators will continue to drive growth. He acknowledged that factors like national debt and geopolitical tensions fuel bearish sentiment, but contended that many individual stocks remain undervalued and poised for further gains. Cramer pointed to a strong IPO market and Oracle's recent rally as evidence of underlying market strength. He concluded that bearish money managers will soon be forced to adopt a more bullish stance or risk losing their clients. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>A potential offer from Paramount Skydance to acquire Warner Bros. Discovery would consolidate a vast and valuable portfolio of entertainment and sports media assets. The deal would combine Paramount's franchises like "Star Trek" and "Mission: Impossible" with Warner Bros. Discovery's iconic properties, including the DC superhero universe, "Harry Potter," and "Game of Thrones." Furthermore, it would merge Paramount's exclusive UFC rights with WBD's broadcast rights for the NHL, MLB, and March Madness basketball. Such a merger would create a media giant with an immense library of intellectual property and a formidable presence in live sports broadcasting.</p>

          <p>English golfer Matt Fitzpatrick had a bizarre incident during the first round of the BMW PGA Championship that may have inadvertently helped his score. After his tee shot on the 18th hole went into the bushes just before a weather delay, his ball could not be found upon resumption of play. Witnesses reported seeing two people run out of the bushes with a golf ball, leading to the conclusion it was stolen. This allowed Fitzpatrick to take a penalty drop instead of playing a provisional ball from a worse position, which he believes saved him at least one stroke in his six-under-par round.</p>

          <p>Manchester United goalkeeper Andre Onana has been sent on a season-long loan to Turkish club Trabzonspor. The move was completed just before the close of the Turkish transfer window. Onana, who was signed from Inter Milan for £47.2 million in 2023 to be the team's starting keeper, had not featured in any of the club's first three Premier League games this season under new manager Ruben Amorim. His only appearance was in a Carabao Cup loss, signaling his fall in the team's pecking order and prompting the temporary move to secure more playing time.</p>
