          <p>Australia is set to lift its ban on blood and plasma donations from gay and bisexual men, becoming the first country to remove all sexual activity-based restrictions on plasma donation. The changes, approved by the country's health products regulator, are expected to significantly expand the donation pool. Under the new rules, donors will be asked about anal sex with new or multiple partners, rather than their sexual orientation, and those taking HIV prevention drugs will be eligible to donate plasma. The updated approach to blood donations will be implemented sometime in 2026.</p>
