          <p>Germany commemorates the 20th anniversary of Berlin's Holocaust Memorial, a field of 2,711 concrete steles, underscoring the nation's commitment to remember the Holocaust's atrocities. This month also marks the 80th anniversary of the end of World War II and the defeat of Nazi Germany, a period responsible for the systematic murder of six million European Jews. In London, NATO allies, including personnel from the US, France, and Germany, will participate in a procession to mark Victory in Europe Day, with Ukrainian troops symbolically included, reflecting the ongoing geopolitical context. The royal family will also make a balcony appearance as part of the four-day VE Day celebration.</p>

          <p>The offshore yuan has risen to a six-month high against the US dollar, fueled by optimism that the US and China may soon begin negotiating a rollback of tariffs. Experts suggest that the current tariffs are unsustainable and expect both countries to reduce them, though negotiations are anticipated to be lengthy and volatile. Despite renewed interest in Chinese assets, global investors remain cautious and require tangible evidence of China's ability to withstand US challenges before increasing their investments. Remarks from President Trump hinting at potential tariff reductions have further bolstered market sentiment.</p>

          <h2>Chinese Scientists Claim Ancient Star Catalogue Is World's Oldest</h2>
          <div class="timestamp">2025-05-05 03:32:35 EDT</div>
        </div>
        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Two Chinese scientists assert that the "Shi's Star Catalogue," an ancient astronomical record, is the world's oldest star log, dating back approximately 2,400 years. Using image processing technology, researchers converted ancient records into measurable celestial coordinates, confirming the approximate years of observations around 335BC. If validated, this would predate the Hipparchus star catalogue from Greece, previously recognized as the oldest known human record of the stars. This discovery could shift historical understanding of early astronomical studies.</p>

          <h2>Study Finds Early Roses Were Likely Yellow, Not Red</h2>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>A new study by Chinese and Dutch researchers suggests that the earliest roses were likely yellow, contrary to the popular association of roses with the color red. The genomic analysis of domesticated and wild rose samples revealed that the common ancestor of roses probably had single-petal flowers with yellow color and seven leaflets. Roses, often regarded as a symbol of love and beauty, have been extensively cultivated worldwide, leading to a diverse array of shapes, sizes, and colors.</p>
