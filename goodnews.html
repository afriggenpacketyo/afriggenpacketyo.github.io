        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>A federal appeals court has sided with President Trump, extending the order that allows him to deploy the National Guard to Los Angeles, overriding a judge's previous order to return control to California Governor Gavin Newsom. The unanimous decision from the 9th Circuit Court of Appeals supports the president's invocation of Title 10, which permits federalizing the National Guard in cases of rebellion or inability to enforce U.S. laws. The court found that the administration presented sufficient facts to suggest a valid basis for using Title 10, citing instances of protesters interfering with immigration agents. Newsom expressed disappointment but affirmed his intent to challenge what he views as Trump's authoritarian use of the military against citizens.</p>

          <p>China is allowing Indian pilgrims to resume visits to Tibet, a move some hope will help improve relations between the two countries after years of border tensions. The pilgrimages, which involve travel to Mount Kailash and Lake Mansarovar, sacred sites for multiple religions, had been suspended for five years due to COVID-19 and cross-border issues. This year, over 5,500 people applied, with 750 being allowed to travel. Some experts believe these pilgrimages can play a positive role in restoring stability during times of crisis between China and India.</p>

This decision comes after the PBOC cut lending rates last month for the first time since October, aiming to mitigate the impact of trade tensions.
