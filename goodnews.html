          <p>This article addresses the claim by the Trump administration linking Tylenol (acetaminophen) use during pregnancy to rising autism rates. It consults with scientific experts who state there is no causal evidence, emphasizing that autism is a complex neurodevelopmental disorder with polygenetic risks and potential environmental factors. The piece also explains that the increase in autism diagnoses is largely attributed to broader diagnostic criteria, greater awareness, and improved screening methods. It firmly debunks the long-disproven theory that vaccines cause autism, highlighting the scientific consensus against such claims.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>The NHS in England is launching a new initiative called "Jess's Rule," urging general practitioners to reconsider a patient's diagnosis if they present with the same symptoms three times without improvement. The rule is named after Jessica Brady, a 27-year-old who died from advanced cancer after her symptoms were repeatedly dismissed as long Covid. This guidance, while not a law, aims to improve patient safety by encouraging doctors to order more tests, seek second opinions, or refer to specialists, particularly for younger patients whose serious illnesses are sometimes overlooked.</p>

          <p>Hemant Taneja, CEO of the venture capital firm General Catalyst, has outlined four critical components for companies aiming to successfully transform their operations with artificial intelligence. He argues that many AI initiatives are "hitting a wall" because they fail to address all necessary pillars. The first step is preparing a robust data infrastructure, followed by training large language models specifically on the company's unique business context. The final two steps involve transforming the workforce to facilitate human-AI collaboration and securing courageous, committed leadership from the top to drive the complex changes required.</p>

          <h2>Forty Years On, Tony Jacklin's Captaincy Remembered for Reviving the Ryder Cup</h2>

          <p>This article reflects on the 40th anniversary of Europe's historic 1985 Ryder Cup victory, crediting captain Tony Jacklin with reviving a competition that was dying due to decades of American dominance. Before Jacklin took over in 1983, the event was a one-sided affair, but he professionalized the European team, demanding better travel, attire, and resources to match their American counterparts. He successfully brought star player Seve Ballesteros back into the fold and fostered a new sense of belief. After a narrow loss in 1983, his team's triumph at The Belfry in 1985 transformed the Ryder Cup into the premier event it is today.</p>

          <p>Issuers from China are returning to the offshore dollar bond market, with total issuance reaching its highest point since 2022. Among them is struggling developer Seazen Group, which is pursuing a second bond deal after a successful offering earlier this year, signaling a reopening of financing channels that had closed during the property crisis. The renewed interest is driven by a more favorable interest-rate environment, allowing companies to refinance on better terms. This trend suggests a potential rebuilding of trust in sectors that many global investors had previously considered too risky for investment. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>A much-anticipated meeting between U.S. President Donald Trump and Chinese President Xi Jinping is now more likely to happen next year rather than this fall, according to U.S. Ambassador to China David Perdue. The statement followed a visit by a bipartisan U.S. congressional delegation to Beijing, the first since 2019. Ambassador Perdue characterized the current relationship between the two leaders as "very good and very encouraging." The U.S. lawmakers, led by Representative Adam Smith, aimed to improve communication between the two countries, particularly on military deconfliction and technology issues like the ownership of TikTok.</p>

          <p>Week three of the NFL season was marked by a series of dramatic finishes and surprising outcomes, with five games decided on the final play. The Philadelphia Eagles remained undefeated after blocking a last-second field goal attempt by the Los Angeles Rams and returning it for a game-winning touchdown. In a major upset, the Cleveland Browns defeated the Green Bay Packers with a 55-yard field goal after blocking a potential game-winner from Green Bay.

          <p>A federal judge has ordered the Trump administration to restore $500 million in federal grant funding to the University of California, Los Angeles (UCLA). The funds, primarily from the National Institutes of Health for medical research, were suspended by the administration over allegations of civil rights violations. The judge ruled that the government likely violated the Administrative Procedure Act by failing to provide specific reasons for the cuts. This ruling is part of a broader conflict where the administration has used federal funding as leverage against elite universities it accuses of liberalism and antisemitism.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>This article explores how modern football coaching trends, such as an increased emphasis on set-pieces and direct, long-ball tactics, are reminiscent of the style famously employed by manager Sam Allardyce. Allardyce, who was often criticized for his pragmatic approach, notes that many top clubs are now adopting strategies he pioneered years ago, including having coaches watch from the stands for a better tactical overview. The piece discusses the resurgence of tall, physical strikers and a move away from possession-based play starting from the goalkeeper, suggesting a tactical shift in the sport's highest levels.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Chinese buyers have secured at least 10 cargoes of soybeans from Argentina after Buenos Aires temporarily scrapped its grain export taxes. This move makes Argentine soybeans more competitive and serves as another setback for U.S. farmers, who are largely excluded from the Chinese market due to the ongoing trade war. The purchases are for the fourth quarter, a period typically dominated by U.S. suppliers. The deals underscore China's strategy of diversifying its soybean sources away from the United States, with South American nations like Argentina and Brazil filling the supply gap.

He was granted a presidential pardon and has been reunited with his family. Abdel Fattah was arrested in 2019 and sentenced to five years for "spreading false news." His release follows a long and arduous campaign by his family, including an extensive hunger strike by his mother, and significant diplomatic pressure from the UK government and international human rights organizations who had deemed his imprisonment arbitrary and unjust.</p>
