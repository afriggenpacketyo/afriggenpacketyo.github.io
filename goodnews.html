          <p>Melissa Tran, a Maryland business owner and mother of five, has been released from federal immigration custody after being detained for over five months. Her detention stemmed from a non-violent theft conviction that occurred two decades ago when she was a teenager. Although a federal judge ordered her release, finding the lengthy detention unnecessary, Tran still faces the possibility of deportation as her legal team works to reopen her immigration case. She had legally entered the U.S. as a refugee from Vietnam in the 1990s and had been complying with regular ICE check-ins for over 20 years before her sudden detainment.</p>

          <p>United Airlines reported third-quarter earnings that surpassed Wall Street expectations and issued a strong profit forecast for the final quarter of the year. The carrier anticipates earning between $3.00 and $3.50 per share, well above the $2.86 analyst consensus. For the third quarter, United posted an adjusted earnings per share of $2.78, beating estimates, although its revenue of $15.23 billion slightly missed projections. The positive outlook comes as the airline continues its strategy of expanding flight capacity and investing in premium services to attract high-value customers, despite facing macroeconomic volatility earlier in the year.

The BlackRock Select Treasury Based Liquidity Fund (BSTBL) will manage the cash reserves that back stablecoins, complying with new U.S. regulations under the GENIUS Act. This move aims to capitalize on the rapidly growing stablecoin market, which some analysts predict could reach $4 trillion by 2030. The initiative builds on BlackRock's existing partnership with Circle, the second-largest stablecoin issuer, and signals the firm's broader strategy to bridge traditional finance with the crypto ecosystem.

          <p>In a speech to the German parliament, Chancellor Friedrich Merz called for enhanced economic and defense cooperation across Europe to counter external security threats and prevent economic decline. He emphasized that Germany must take a more assertive role within the EU and NATO to ensure peace through strength. Merz also commented on the recent Gaza ceasefire, crediting US and Israeli leadership, and reiterated his call to use frozen Russian assets to fund weapons for Ukraine. He stressed that European nations are individually too small to influence global events but can collectively shape a better world through unified action.</p>

          <p>A 28-year-old former security guard at the U.S. Embassy in Oslo has been convicted of espionage and sentenced to three years and seven months in prison for spying on behalf of Russia and Iran. The Norwegian national admitted to sharing sensitive information, including details about embassy diplomats, floor plans, and security protocols. Prosecutors stated that the man's actions were motivated by American ties to Israel and the war in Gaza. His defense attorneys argued that the information he shared was worthless and that he exaggerated his role, but the court found him guilty on five espionage-related charges.</p>

          <p>Following the signing of the Israel-Hamas ceasefire agreement, Germany is positioning itself to play a significant role in Gaza's future, primarily through humanitarian and reconstruction efforts. Chancellor Friedrich Merz confirmed that Germany will not send soldiers but will focus on providing medical care and rebuilding infrastructure, pledging an initial €29 million in immediate aid. Germany is also set to co-host a donor conference with Egypt to raise funds for the extensive reconstruction, which is estimated to cost over $50 billion.

          <p>Uruguay's senate has passed a law decriminalizing euthanasia, making it the first country in Latin America to do so via legislative action. The law permits a healthcare professional to end the life of a patient suffering from an incurable illness that causes "unbearable suffering," without requiring a terminal diagnosis. The move reinforces Uruguay's reputation as one of the most socially liberal nations in the region, having previously legalized same-sex marriage, abortion, and recreational marijuana. The legislation was passed despite opposition from the Catholic Church, reflecting the country's strong secular traditions.</p>

          <p>The British Library has posthumously reissued a reader's card to celebrated Irish writer Oscar Wilde, 130 years after his original was revoked following his 1895 conviction for "gross indecency." At the time, homosexual relationships were a criminal offense, and Wilde was sentenced to two years of hard labor, leading to his exclusion from the library. The new card, which will be collected by his grandson, Merlin Holland, is a symbolic gesture to "acknowledge the injustices and immense suffering" the author faced. The library holds handwritten drafts of many of Wilde's most famous works, and the ceremony coincides with what would have been his 171st birthday.</p>
