          <p>President Trump hosted a dinner for prominent tech and business leaders, including Mark Zuckerberg, Tim Cook, and Bill Gates, in the newly renovated White House Rose Garden. The event aimed to foster relationships between the administration and the technology sector, though Tesla CEO Elon Musk was a notable absentee, citing a prior commitment. Musk's absence follows a public falling out with the president after a brief stint in the administration. Despite this, Trump recently commented that he believes Musk, a "man of common sense," will eventually realign with the Republican Party, characterizing their disagreement as a minor deviation.</p>

Levy's tenure recently concluded with the club securing a Europa League trophy, its first major silverware in 17 years. In his departure statement, Levy expressed pride in the club's growth into a "global heavyweight" and thanked the fans for their support throughout what he acknowledged was not always an easy journey.</p>

          <p>Lindsey Stewart's new book, "The Conjuring of America," examines the historical and cultural significance of conjure, a spiritual tradition developed by enslaved people in the United States. The book argues that the figure of the conjure woman has profoundly shaped American life, influencing everything from medicine and cuisine to music genres like the blues. Stewart traces these practices, rooted in West and Central African religions, through centuries of American history, highlighting the often-overlooked contributions of Black women. Amid a resurgence of interest in conjure in popular culture, the book makes a case for recognizing these traditions as a form of power and resilience.</p>

          <p>CEOs of major sportsbooks like DraftKings and BetMGM are forecasting a record-breaking betting season as the NFL kicks off, with the American Gaming Association projecting an 8.5% growth to $30 billion in legal wagers. Despite broader economic concerns, the industry reports no slowdown in consumer activity, with pre-season volume up significantly and customer acquisition costs declining. Executives also highlighted the lucrative cross-selling opportunities, as a majority of sports bettors tend to also engage in higher-margin online casino games. The sector appears resilient, showing contrarian strength amidst volatility in discretionary spending. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>The National Weather Service has expanded its Flood Inundation Mapping (FIM) tool, which now provides crucial forecasting information to areas covering 60% of the U.S. population. This experimental tool offers near real-time, interactive visualizations of current and predicted flooding, allowing emergency managers and residents to better prepare for and respond to flood events. The expansion includes new coverage for the Great Plains, Southwest, West Coast, Hawaii, and parts of Alaska. Officials state the tool has already proven to be a "game-changer" in providing actionable intelligence, such as facilitating National Guard evacuations in Kentucky before floodwaters reached homes.</p>

          <p>Shares of asset manager T. Rowe Price jumped nearly 6% following the announcement of a strategic collaboration with Goldman Sachs, which will invest up to $1 billion in the company. The partnership aims to develop and offer private market investment products to a broader retail audience, including individual investors and retirement plan participants. This move is seen as a significant step for T. Rowe Price, whose stock has underperformed in recent years due to its slower adoption of ETFs. The deal aligns with a recent executive order aimed at increasing access to alternative assets within 401(k) plans. (not investment advice)</p>

Born at home in Georgia during the segregation era, she never had her birth officially recorded, which became a significant problem with the implementation of the federal Real ID law. Without the document, she could not prove her citizenship and faced daily anxieties. After a lengthy legal process initiated by her son and aided by media attention, she successfully proved her existence and has now obtained her Real ID, opening the door to new possibilities like international travel.</p>

          <p>Prime Minister Keir Starmer has confirmed that the UK government is considering the implementation of a digital ID system as a tool to address illegal immigration and employment. He suggested that such a program could play an "important part" in reducing incentives for unauthorized entry into the country. Acknowledging past privacy concerns that led to the scrapping of a physical ID card scheme over a decade ago, Starmer stated that public perception has likely evolved with the widespread use of digital identification in daily life.

          <p>The average interest rate for a 30-year fixed-rate mortgage has fallen to 6.5%, marking its lowest level since October of the previous year. This continued decline in borrowing costs, reported by Freddie Mac, provides increased purchasing power for prospective homebuyers. The trend is largely attributed to growing market expectations that the Federal Reserve will cut its benchmark interest rate at its upcoming policy meeting. While the Fed does not directly set mortgage rates, its decisions significantly influence the bond market, which lenders use as a guide for pricing home loans. (not investment advice)</p>

        </div>
        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Drawing on the philosophy of Søren Kierkegaard, this article explores the idea that anxiety, when managed properly, can be a catalyst for personal growth and adventure rather than a purely negative state to be eliminated. While acknowledging the seriousness of clinical anxiety disorders, the author argues that everyday anxiety serves as a protective alarm system. Research suggests that moderate levels of anxiety can enhance performance and lead to "flow" states. The article proposes a two-step approach: first, accepting anxiety as a normal occurrence, and second, reframing the physiological response not as dread, but as excitement for an opportunity or challenge.</p>
