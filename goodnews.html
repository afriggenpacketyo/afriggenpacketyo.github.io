          <p>Alex Palou, representing Chip Ganassi Racing, achieved a significant milestone by becoming the first Spanish driver to win the Indianapolis 500, triumphing over Marcus Ericsson in the final laps. The race was marked by several unusual incidents, including Scott McLaughlin crashing during warm-up laps and Alexander Rossi's pit stop resulting in a fire. Kyle Larson's attempt to complete the "double" was cut short by a three-car collision, preventing him from reaching the Coca-Cola 600 in time. Palou's victory was celebrated by his team and family, marking a significant achievement in his racing career, adding to his already impressive record of three IndyCar titles in four years.</p>

          <p>The United States and the European Union have reached an agreement to postpone the imposition of tariffs until July, providing a window for further trade negotiations. This decision follows President Trump's earlier threat to impose 50% tariffs on goods entering the US from the EU, which sparked concerns of a potential trade war. EU trade chief Maros Sefcovic emphasized the need for mutual respect in trade relations, stating the EU's readiness to defend its interests. The postponement aims to facilitate a trade deal between the two powers, averting immediate economic conflict.</p>

          <div class="timestamp">2025-05-25 17:59:02 EDT</div>
        </div>
        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>After studying over 200 parent-child relationships, a new parenting framework called "emotionally safe parenting" has emerged, emphasizing emotional attunement, self-awareness, and inner healing. This style focuses on accepting a child's emotions without dismissing them, responding without shame, and viewing "bad" behavior as stress signals. Emotionally safe parents take responsibility after conflicts, do internal work to become less reactive, and create an environment where children feel safe expressing their authentic selves. Practicing this involves inner reflection, seeing behavior as communication, setting boundaries with empathy, and preventing shame through healthy repair, fostering resilience and connection.</p>
