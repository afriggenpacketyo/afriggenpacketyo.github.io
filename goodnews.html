          <p>The Los Angeles Dodgers defeated the Kansas City Royals 5-4, claiming the best record in Major League Baseball. Despite a performance their manager described as incomplete, key plays from Shohei Ohtani, who hit a leadoff home run and a triple, and a game-winning single from Mookie Betts were decisive. The bullpen managed to hold the lead by pitching five scoreless innings, culminating in a game-ending double play with the bases loaded. This victory highlights the team's ability to win even when not playing at their peak potential.</p>

          <p>Amazon MGM Studio has announced that acclaimed director Denis Villeneuve will helm the next installment of the James Bond franchise. Known for his work on "Dune" and "Blade Runner 2049," Villeneuve expressed his deep respect for the series, calling it "sacred territory." This decision places the iconic spy series under a new creative direction following Amazon's acquisition of MGM and the departure of the Broccoli family from creative control. Production is anticipated to begin in 2026 for a potential 2027 release, though a new actor for the role of 007 has not yet been named.</p>

          <p>Chelsea's manager, Enzo Maresca, has publicly stated the club has no intention of selling 19-year-old defender Josh Acheampong this summer, despite interest from other clubs. Maresca emphasized his high regard for the player, viewing him as a potential top defender for Chelsea in the future. Acheampong, an academy product who signed a new five-year contract last year, is considered a key part of the team's long-term plans. The manager's clear stance aims to quell speculation and reinforce the young player's importance to the club's strategy.</p>

          <p>Four giant pandas, including 24-year-old Rauhin and her three offspring, have left Japan's Adventure World zoo to return to China as their loan agreement expires. Their departure leaves only two pandas remaining in Japan, both at Tokyo's Ueno Zoo, who are also scheduled to return next year. The Wakayama zoo, which has successfully raised 17 cubs since 1994 in a joint program with China, held a farewell ceremony attended by thousands of visitors. This event marks a potential end to an era of "panda diplomacy" between the two nations for the time being.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>A new study from the Japan Institute for Health Security has found a correlation between consuming a traditional Japanese-style diet and lower rates of depressive symptoms among working-age people. The research assessed diets rich in rice, miso soup, fish, soy products, and vegetables. The findings suggest that certain components of the diet, such as the omega-3 fatty acids in fish and the folic acid in vegetables, may contribute to improved mental well-being by aiding neurotransmitter release. While researchers state more study is needed, the results align with previous findings on the mental health benefits of the Mediterranean diet.</p>

          <p>Law enforcement has captured Antoine Massey, the ninth of ten inmates who escaped from the Orleans Justice Center six weeks ago. Massey was arrested peacefully at a residence in New Orleans and will be transferred to a secure state correctional facility. The May 16 jailbreak, which officials have called one of the worst in recent state history, has led to criticism of the parish sheriff's management of the facility. With Massey's capture, only one inmate, Derrick Groves, remains at large, with a $50,000 reward offered for information leading to his arrest.</p>

          <p>The BAFTA-winning BBC dark comedy "Such Brave Girls" is returning for a new series, created by and starring sisters Kat Sadler and Lizzie Davidson. The show follows two sisters and their mother as they navigate financial struggles and chaotic relationships, using dark humor to tackle taboo subjects like mental health and abortion. Sadler, the writer, says the new series is influenced by the "bleak" modern dating scene and a desire to satirize the pressure to be in a relationship. The comedy is praised for its raw, female-led perspective, which the creators say is inspired by their own all-woman household upbringing.</p>

          <p>Scientists are revisiting phage therapy, a medical approach that uses bacteriophages‚Äîviruses that prey on bacteria‚Äîto treat infections. With the rise of antibiotic-resistant superbugs, this century-old concept is seen as a promising alternative. The process involves finding a precise phage to match and kill a specific harmful bacterium, offering a targeted treatment with fewer side effects than broad-spectrum antibiotics. A UK project is even enlisting the public to collect samples from dirty water to build a library of these "friendly viruses," one of which has already proven effective in the lab against a patient's recurring infection.</p>

She then gifted the paintings to each student, an act that was met with astonishment and appreciation.

          <p>A fourth federal judge has permanently blocked one of President Trump's executive orders aimed at punishing an elite law firm, in this case, Susman Godfrey. The judge ruled that the order, which sought to impose punitive measures like suspending security clearances, was "unconstitutional from beginning to end." This ruling is the latest in a series of defeats for the administration's campaign against law firms it perceives as political opponents. The court found the order violated the firm's constitutional rights and represented an attack on the independence of the American legal system.</p>
