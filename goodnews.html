          <p>With gold and silver prices reaching new record highs, investors are presented with fresh opportunities but also significant risks. This article outlines several strategies for safely investing in these precious metals, emphasizing the importance of a measured approach. Key recommendations include understanding the varying risks of different investment types like ETFs, stocks, and physical bullion. It also suggests splitting investment funds between both metals and adhering to the conventional wisdom of limiting total precious metal holdings to no more than 10% of an overall portfolio to maintain diversification.

          <p>Deutsche Bank has identified DuPont as a short-term catalyst buy, anticipating that the upcoming spinoff of its Qnity Electronics division on November 1 will unlock significant shareholder value. Analysts believe the company currently trades at a substantial discount to the sum of its parts, presenting a favorable investment opportunity. The CNBC Investing Club has stated its intention to hold shares of both the parent company and the new entity post-spinoff. They see the new Qnity company as a particularly strong long-term investment due to its growth potential tied to the semiconductor industry. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>A federal judge has removed travel restrictions on Palestinian activist Mahmoud Khalil, permitting him to travel across the U.S. for speaking engagements while he contests a deportation order from the Trump administration. Khalil, a former Columbia University graduate student and a prominent figure in campus protests, had been confined to several states since his release from an immigration jail in June. The government opposed the move, but the judge ruled Khalil is not a flight risk and has complied with all release conditions. His case is part of a broader crackdown by the administration on pro-Palestinian campus activists.</p>

          <p>The UK Conservative Party has given a seat on the influential Public Accounts Committee to Rupert Lowe, an independent Member of Parliament who was formerly with the Reform UK party. The committee, which is responsible for overseeing government spending, typically has seats reserved for major parties, but the Conservatives stated they appointed Lowe because he "shares our values on cutting waste." Lowe, who was expelled from Reform UK after a dispute with its leadership, expressed his delight with the appointment and promised to ask tough questions about how taxpayer money is spent. This move reflects a broader Conservative strategy of collaborating with non-party MPs who align with their objectives.</p>

          <p>In his new book, astrophysicist Neil deGrasse Tyson explores a range of scientific questions, from the practical effects of the moon exploding to the physics of time travel in movies. He critiques modern AI like ChatGPT for lacking the "soul" and "personality" of human inquiry, which he aims to celebrate. While acknowledging the high probability of life existing elsewhere in the universe, Tyson remains skeptical that aliens have visited Earth, citing the lack of credible evidence despite the ubiquity of high-resolution cameras. The book serves as a playful exploration of the universe, driven by curiosity and a desire to make complex science accessible.</p>

          <p>The Democratic National Committee's rules panel is set to begin the process of selecting which states will hold the first presidential nominating contests in 2028. This influential decision shapes the entire primary landscape, giving early states significant political power and media attention. The party previously overhauled its calendar, replacing the Iowa caucuses with South Carolina in the first position, a move that benefited Joe Biden in 2020. States like New Hampshire, Nevada, and Michigan are expected to compete fiercely for the four or five coveted early-window slots, each arguing that their demographics and political landscape offer the best test for a future nominee.</p>

          <h2>Record Gold Prices Drive Shift Away From Traditional 60/40 Investment Portfolio</h2>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>The historic surge in gold prices is accelerating a strategic shift away from the classic 60/40 portfolio of stocks and bonds. Some market strategists are now advocating for a 60/20/20 model, which reduces the bond allocation and introduces a 20% share for alternatives like gold and cryptocurrency. This change is driven by the belief that bonds no longer offer reliable protection amid inflation and geopolitical risk, while assets like gold provide a better hedge. The trend is reflected in massive inflows into gold ETFs, as investors seek to diversify and capitalize on the metal's strong performance. (not investment advice)</p>

          <h2>Understanding Federal Limits on Wage Garnishment for Credit Card Debt</h2>
          <div class="timestamp">2025-10-17 11:20:16 EDT</div>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>For individuals with delinquent credit card debt, wage garnishment is a serious potential consequence that allows creditors to take a portion of earnings directly from a paycheck. Federal law limits this amount to the lesser of 25% of disposable income or the amount by which weekly earnings exceed 30 times the federal minimum wage. However, many states have enacted stricter rules that offer greater protection for debtors, with some even prohibiting wage garnishment for unsecured debts entirely. The article advises that addressing delinquent debt through negotiation, debt management plans, or, as a last resort, bankruptcy is crucial to avoid this outcome.</p>

          <p>Four years after the Taliban's return to power effectively banned women's sports, Afghanistan's women's refugee football team is set to compete in its first official tournament. The team, comprised of players now living in the UK, Australia, and Europe, will participate in a FIFA-hosted series in the United Arab Emirates. For the players, the matches represent more than just a game; they are a powerful act of defiance and a way to represent the silenced women and girls in their homeland. The tournament marks a significant step towards the team's readmission into the official FIFA structure, a goal they have tirelessly pursued since being forced to flee.</p>

          <p>The 2025 Campus Project, a collaboration between Germany's Beethovenfest and DW, brought together young musicians from Nigeria and Germany for a unique cultural and musical exchange. Guided by the Afrobeat collective BANTU, the participants blended their disparate traditions, merging Nigerian protest songs with Beethoven's compositions. The project culminated in a concert in Bonn, where the ensemble performed new work by British-Nigerian composer Cassie Kinoshi that featured the West African "talking drum." The journey aimed to foster cross-cultural understanding and demonstrated how music can bridge different worlds, creating a powerful and harmonious fusion.</p>
