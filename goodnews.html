          <p>CNBC's Jim Cramer posits that a new generation of younger investors is significantly shaping current market dynamics by backing companies with bold, forward-thinking ideas. He argues that these investors favor growth potential and innovative concepts, rewarding companies like Robinhood and Reddit while penalizing established giants like Apple for what they perceive as a lack of new ideas. According to Cramer, this shift marks a move towards an "idea market" focused on individual company stories rather than a market dominated by institutional investors reacting to Federal Reserve policies.

          <p>Amazon CEO Andy Jassy reported that the company has not observed significant price increases for consumers despite the implementation of broad U.S. tariffs. He explained that Amazon and its third-party sellers mitigated the impact through strategies like forward-buying inventory before the tariffs took full effect. Jassy also noted that the competitive nature of the marketplace helps keep prices stable as many choose to absorb costs rather than lose market share. The discussion also touched upon the transformative potential of generative AI, which Jassy believes will fundamentally change both work and home life. (not investment advice)</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Starting this week, approximately 21 million households in England, Scotland, and Wales will see a 7% reduction in their energy bills under the latest Ofgem price cap. This translates to a monthly saving of about ¬£11 for a typical household, bringing the annual bill down to ¬£1,720. However, experts express concern that prices, which remain significantly higher than pre-pandemic levels, may not fall much further and could be impacted by geopolitical uncertainty. Analysts urge consumers to consider shopping for fixed-rate deals for more payment certainty.</p>

          <p>The Trump administration has signed an executive order to end the comprehensive US sanctions program against Syria, which has been in place since 2004. The move aims to support the country's path toward peace and economic recovery following the ousting of Bashar Assad. While broad sanctions are being dismantled, targeted sanctions will remain on Assad, his associates, and other entities involved in human rights abuses or terrorism. The order also mandates a review of the terrorist designations for the group Hayat Tahrir al-Sham and Syria's new transitional president, Ahmed al-Sharaa.</p>

          <p>GE Appliances is investing $490 million to bring 800 manufacturing jobs from China to a new plant in Kentucky, a move accelerated by the current U.S. tariff environment. An executive stated that while reshoring production aligns with the company's long-term strategy of building appliances closer to where they are sold, the tariffs introduced an added cost that made the decision more urgent. The company will cease its washer and dryer manufacturing in China once the new Louisville facility becomes operational, which is expected by early 2027. The new positions will include roles in research, engineering, and supply chain management.</p>

          <p>The Privy Council in London, the highest court of appeal for the Cayman Islands, has upheld the British overseas territory's Civil Partnership Law. The ruling rejected a challenge that argued the governor had overstepped his authority by enacting the law in 2020 after local lawmakers had voted it down. The law was originally introduced to comply with a court ruling that found same-sex couples were entitled to legal protections equivalent to marriage. LGBTQ+ rights campaigners have hailed the decision as a significant victory that could positively influence similar legal battles in other British overseas territories.</p>

          <p>Film producer Randall Emmett has been removed from the Writers Guild of America's "strike list" after paying over $630,000 to resolve a long-standing dispute. The payment settles a judgment from 2021 related to unpaid compensation and health benefits for four writers who worked on a proposed television show that fell through in 2019. The resolution means WGA members are now permitted to work with Emmett and his current production company, Convergence Entertainment Group. The unpaid debt had previously clouded Emmett's efforts to mount new projects.</p>
