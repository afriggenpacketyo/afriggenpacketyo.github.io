          <p>CBS secured an appellate court ruling allowing it to continue distributing Sony's "Wheel of Fortune" and "Jeopardy!" while its legal battle with Sony Pictures Television continues. Sony, which owns and produces the shows, had sought to terminate the distribution deal with CBS, alleging unauthorized licensing deals and budget cuts. CBS maintains that Sony lacks the legal right to unilaterally sever ties. The appellate panel granted CBS's request to keep the stay in place, allowing the network to continue its distribution duties during the appeal.</p>

          <p>The government is fast-tracking two new reservoir projects in East Anglia and south Lincolnshire to shore up England's water supplies. These projects have been declared "nationally significant," allowing them to speed through the planning process. However, overriding local objections can be unpopular, and the reservoirs could still be more than a decade away from opening. Scientists warn that household consumption of water may also need to fall to secure supplies amid rising temperatures and a growing population.</p>

In a statement, Furness said she believes in a higher power and that the universe is always working for her. She added that she gained "much knowledge and wisdom" from the "breakdown" of her marriage to Jackman. Jackman has not directly responded to Furness's statement, but posted a video to Instagram in which he is skipping to the NYSNC song 'Bye Bye Bye'.</p>
