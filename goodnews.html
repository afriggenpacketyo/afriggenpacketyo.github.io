          <p>Manchester United's new head coach, Ruben Amorim, is implementing significant changes to restore the club's success following a self-described "disaster season." His strategy involves a tactical shift to a 3-5-2 formation, which has required major roster changes, including nearly £200m in new attacking players. Amorim is also fostering a more positive and player-led dressing room culture, a departure from the previous manager's prescriptive style. The club faces a difficult early schedule, which will be a crucial test for his new system and leadership approach.</p>

          <p>Actress Sydney Sweeney has broken her social media silence three weeks after her "Great Jeans" ad campaign for American Eagle sparked online debate. The campaign, which played on the term "genes," drew criticism from some for perceived racial undertones, while others defended it as a rejection of "woke" advertising. The article notes that Sweeney has not directly commented on the controversy but returned to Instagram with photos from a night out with friends. Public relations experts quoted in the article offer differing opinions on whether the controversy will positively or negatively impact her career.</p>

          <p>Dan Tana, the founder of the eponymous West Hollywood restaurant famous for its classic Italian-American food and celebrity clientele, has passed away at the age of 90 in Belgrade, Serbia. Originally a professional soccer player from the former Yugoslavia, Tana opened his restaurant in 1964, creating a late-night haven for Hollywood stars that became an institution. The restaurant, known for its red-checkered tablecloths and discreet service, has been a favorite of figures from Elizabeth Taylor to George Clooney. Tana sold the establishment in 2009, but it continues to operate under new ownership, preserving its historic charm.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>A long-standing principle known as the "85th percentile rule" is being reconsidered by some states and federal agencies for setting speed limits on U.S. roads. This rule suggests that the speed limit should be set at the speed at or below which 85% of drivers travel, effectively letting the fastest drivers determine the legal speed. Critics argue this creates a dangerous feedback loop where speed limits continually increase, especially in urban areas with pedestrians and cyclists. In response to rising traffic fatalities, officials are now encouraging a more context-sensitive approach that considers road usage and safety for all users.</p>

          <p>The Los Angeles Dodgers secured a 6-0 victory over the San Diego Padres, reclaiming sole possession of first place in the National League West. The win was significantly aided by a series of mistakes from the Padres in the early innings. Dodgers catcher Will Smith threw out three Padres runners attempting to steal bases, while the Padres' defense committed a costly two-run error. The Dodgers capitalized on the sloppiness, scoring five runs in the first two innings despite having only one hit, largely thanks to six walks issued by the Padres' starting pitcher.</p>

          <h2>A Couples Therapist Explains Five Common Psychological Triggers for Infidelity</h2>

          <p>An executive counselor and couples' therapist outlines five common psychological reasons why people, even those who consider themselves "good," risk their careers and families for an affair. The article suggests that infidelity can stem from a lifetime of repressing one's own needs, such as always trying to be "good" or a perfectionist, which are often responses to childhood trauma. Other triggers include having poor boundaries developed from being a parentified child, being in an emotionally withholding or abusive marriage, or experiencing a recent significant loss. These situations can create an emotional void or breaking point that makes an affair seem like a form of release.</p>

          <p>A small private airplane made a successful emergency landing on Interstate 805 in San Diego on Saturday afternoon. The pilot was forced to land on the highway due to apparent mechanical issues while en route from Montgomery-Gibbs Executive Airport. The California Highway Patrol responded to the scene near Carroll Canyon Road in Sorrento Valley. Fortunately, no injuries were reported from the incident, either to the plane's occupants or to motorists on the ground. The landing resulted in the temporary closure of southbound lanes as authorities investigated and worked to remove the aircraft.</p>

          <p>Hundreds of protesters marched peacefully in Washington D.C. on Saturday to demonstrate against President Trump's declaration of a "crime emergency" and the subsequent deployment of National Guard troops in the city. The demonstrators gathered at DuPont Circle before marching to the White House, chanting and holding signs opposing what they termed a "fascist takeover" and "military occupation." The protest followed a successful legal challenge by the D.C. Attorney General that blocked the administration's attempt to install a federally controlled "emergency police commissioner." Participants expressed concern over federal overreach and disputed the president's claims about rampant crime.</p>

          <p>A former software CEO, Mike Conner, has completed a nearly five-year, multi-million-pound renovation of Thorne Island, a derelict Napoleonic fort off the coast of Pembrokeshire, Wales. After purchasing the abandoned island for £555,000 in 2017, he undertook the immense challenge of making it habitable, which involved overcoming the lack of electricity and running water. The historic fort is now a fully modernized space with 40 beds, en-suite bathrooms, and a nightclub, and is back on the market for £3 million. The arduous renovation process required helicopters to bring in equipment and a team of workers living on-site for years.</p>

          <p>With food prices rising, parents in the UK are using meticulous planning and creative strategies to feed their children affordably during the six-week school summer holidays. Some parents rely on "yellow sticker" reduced-price items, which they freeze for later use, and turn aging fruit into frozen yogurt snacks to avoid waste. Others organize their food into daily portions to make it last and utilize local food pantries that provide surplus groceries for a small fee. These tactics have become essential as many families struggle with the loss of subsidized school meals and the increased costs of having children at home.</p>
