          <p>Delta Air Lines has restored its 2025 profit outlook, causing its stock to surge by 10% as its summer travel forecast surpassed expectations. CEO Ed Bastian stated that while booking patterns have shifted to be closer to travel dates, overall demand has stabilized. Despite reducing its full-year earnings forecast from earlier predictions, the airline's third-quarter guidance and strong performance in premium cabin sales have bolstered investor confidence. The company will continue upgrading its premium products and make surgical capacity cuts after the peak summer season to adapt to current travel trends. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>Chip manufacturer Nvidia briefly reached a market valuation of $4 trillion, a milestone driven by intense investor enthusiasm for artificial intelligence. The company's stock surge highlights its dominant position in the AI sector, which has attracted massive investments from other tech giants like Microsoft and Google. Despite challenges from new competitors and the impact of U.S. tariffs on chip sales to China, Nvidia has demonstrated remarkable resilience, reporting nearly $19 billion in quarterly earnings. The company's success has been a significant factor in the broader stock market's recovery from an earlier downturn. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>A 19-year-old Australian surfer, Darcy Deefholts, has been safely rescued after spending a night stranded on an uninhabited island seven miles off the coast. Deefholts went missing after going for a surf near Wooli, prompting a large-scale land and water search by police and marine rescue services. His father made an emotional plea on social media for help, contributing to the search efforts. The rescue was described as a "one in a million miracle" by his family, and Deefholts is currently receiving medical treatment after his ordeal on North Solitary Island.</p>

          <p>South African Olympic champion Caster Semenya has won a partial victory at the European Court of Human Rights (ECHR), which ruled her right to a fair hearing was violated by a Swiss court. The case stems from her long-running legal battle against World Athletics regulations that require athletes with differences of sexual development (DSD) to lower their testosterone levels to compete in certain female events. While the ECHR found procedural flaws in the Swiss legal process, it deemed her discrimination complaints inadmissible. The ruling does not immediately overturn the athletic regulations but allows her case to potentially return to the Swiss federal court.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>This opinion article examines how implementing ranked-choice voting (RCV) could reshape California politics, drawing comparisons to its use in New York City. Proponents argue RCV could reduce election costs by eliminating runoffs, increase diversity, and discourage negative campaigning. In California's nonpartisan, top-two primary system, RCV could potentially eliminate primaries altogether in many local races and give underrepresented parties a better chance in state contests. The author suggests that the system's introduction could lead to unpredictable strategic realignments, possibly fostering more centrist outcomes or, conversely, pushing candidates toward more extreme positions to capture second-choice votes.</p>

          <p>Six months after the devastating Eaton and Palisades wildfires, Los Angeles County is deep into a massive recovery effort, though the emotional and financial toll on victims remains immense. Officials report that the debris removal process is months ahead of schedule, with over 9,000 properties cleared by federal contractors, though concerns about soil contamination persist. Investigations into the cause of the fires are ongoing, with one theory suggesting the Palisades fire was a rekindling of a previously contained blaze. Meanwhile, the region faces the long and complex process of rebuilding, with hundreds of permits issued but thousands of families still navigating the path forward.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>This opinion article praises the expansion of Health Savings Accounts (HSAs) included in the recently signed federal spending bill, calling it a rare piece of good, bipartisan policy. The author argues that HSAs, which are triple tax-advantaged, promote individual responsibility and help reduce healthcare costs. The new legislation expands HSA eligibility to millions more Americans, including those on certain Affordable Care Act plans, and allows funds to be used for direct primary care memberships. While celebrating this as a popular and smart reform, the author suggests more work is needed, such as fully delinking HSAs from high-deductible plans.</p>

          <p>California Governor Gavin Newsom's recent tour of South Carolina is widely interpreted as an early move to build connections for a potential 2028 presidential run. While Newsom framed the visit as an effort to help Democrats in the Deep South, his presence in the crucial early primary state drew national attention and energized local party members. He touted his record of resisting the Trump administration and criticized national Democrats for neglecting rural communities. Despite facing criticism for California's high cost of living and social issues, Newsom's trip demonstrated his potential to mobilize the party's grassroots and act as a leading voice of opposition.</p>

The review praises the book for its dark, laugh-out-loud humor that tackles the grim realities of economic precarity and the racial wealth gap, which disproportionately affects Black graduates. While dealing with serious systemic issues, the novel is celebrated as a terrifically fun read with an imperfect but relatable protagonist.</p>

        </div>

          <p>Following the deadly flash floods in Texas, meteorological experts have clarified why a similar catastrophic event is highly unlikely along Florida's St. Johns River. The primary difference is topography; Texas Hill Country's steep terrain and thin soil contribute to rapid runoff, creating "Flash Flood Alley." In contrast, Florida is exceptionally flat, and the St. Johns River has a minimal elevation drop, making it one of the slowest-moving rivers in the world. While Florida faces significant flooding risks from slow-moving hurricanes and storm surges, the sudden, violent nature of the Texas flash flood is not a threat.</p>
