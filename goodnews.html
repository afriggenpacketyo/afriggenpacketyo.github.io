He admits to feeling terrified by the pressure of headlining the show but committed to using his 30 years of experience to portray the complex, dual-sided character. Director Ben Stiller praised Scott's technical skill and advocated for him to get the part, a decision that has been vindicated by the show's massive success and numerous accolades.</p>

          <p>Several European and NATO leaders will accompany President Volodymyr Zelenskyy to Washington for crucial talks with President Trump, demonstrating a united front of support. This move is seen as an effort to bolster Zelenskyy's position following a previous contentious meeting and his exclusion from the Trump-Putin summit. The show of solidarity aims to ensure European interests are represented in any U.S.-brokered peace negotiations with Russia, easing concerns that Ukraine might be pressured into an unfavorable deal.</p>

          <p>Manchester United striker Rasmus Hojlund has been left out of the squad for the upcoming Premier League match against Arsenal, fueling intense speculation about his future at the club. The decision follows the recent high-profile signing of another striker, Benjamin Sesko, which is expected to severely restrict Hojlund's playing opportunities. While the 22-year-old Danish player has previously expressed a desire to stay, AC Milan is reportedly among the clubs interested in signing him, though no agreement is yet in place.</p>

          <p>A simple wooden desk, hauled to the top of Hancock Hill in West Texas by university students in the 1970s, has become a beloved and unlikely landmark. For more than 45 years, hikers have made the pilgrimage to the desk to enjoy the expansive desert views and leave personal, often heartfelt, messages in a notebook stored in its drawer. These dozens of filled notebooks, containing a collective history of confessions and reflections, are now meticulously preserved in a nearby university archive, documenting the legacy of this unique meditative destination.</p>

          <h2>Disallowed Crystal Palace Goal Against Chelsea Explained by IFAB Rule</h2>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>A free-kick goal by Crystal Palace's Eberechi Eze during a Premier League match against Chelsea was correctly disallowed by VAR due to a specific rule regarding attacking players in a defensive wall. The International Football Association Board's Law 13, introduced in the 2019-20 season, states that an attacker must remain at least one meter away from a wall of three or more defenders when a free-kick is taken. A Palace player was found to be inside this one-meter zone, leading the referee to nullify the goal and award an indirect free-kick to Chelsea.</p>

The ambitious project has transformed the historic, off-grid property from a ruin into a unique, modern venue equipped with 40 beds, en-suite bathrooms, and its own nightclub.</p>

          <p>Los Angeles Sparks forward Cameron Brink attributes her positive mindset and successful return from a major ACL injury to the practice of creating vision boards. Introduced to the technique by a teammate during her lengthy 13-month rehab, Brink used collages of her goals—such as making the Olympics and being a WNBA All-Star—to stay focused and combat the mental strain of recovery. This visualization practice helped her manage pressure and make an immediate, meaningful impact for her team upon her return to the court this season.</p>

          <p>A 46-year-old man was dramatically rescued by a helicopter crew after being trapped for two days in a cave behind a powerful waterfall in California's Tulare County. The man, an experienced rappeller, was pushed off his lines by the "extreme hydraulics" of the Seven Teacups waterfalls on the Kern River. After an extensive two-day search involving aircraft and drones, rescuers located him alive and conscious and successfully hoisted him to safety. He was treated for dehydration and only minor injuries before being reunited with his family.</p>
