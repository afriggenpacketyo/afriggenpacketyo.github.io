          <p>As negotiations intensify regarding President Trump's tax agenda, policy experts highlight several key issues to watch. The House Ways and Means Committee released a preliminary text of its portion of the bill, which may undergo significant changes before the final vote. Republican lawmakers aim to pass Trump's package without Democratic support through a process known as "reconciliation," but the limited budget framework and competing priorities could complicate matters. Experts anticipate challenges due to the narrow Republican majority in the House, and the desire of some lawmakers for a more fiscally responsible package.</p>

          <p>Bill Gates has announced he will donate most of his wealth to meet urgent global needs by 2045, coinciding with criticism of Elon Musk's role in USAID cuts, which Gates predicts will increase childhood deaths in poor countries. Gates' fortune stems from co-founding Microsoft, and he has diversified his assets through Cascade Investment, with stakes in various businesses and farmland. The Gates Foundation, established with his ex-wife Melinda, has donated over $100 billion to fight poverty and disease and plans to double its giving by 2045, after which it will be dissolved, intending to reduce child mortality and combat diseases.</p>

          <p>Southampton secured a 0-0 draw against Manchester City, moving to 12 points for the season and avoiding Derby County's record Premier League low total of 11 points.

The Saints celebrated the draw with a message to Derby on social media, while Ramsdale emphasized the team's resilience in the face of expectations of zero points for the rest of the season. While the team is not happy with how the season has gone, they are definitely happy with the fact that they have managed to avoid that record.</p>

          <p>Many young Filipino voters are expressing a desire to end the concentration of political power among long-entrenched political dynasties in the upcoming midterm elections. The vote will also likely determine the political future of Duterte's daughter and incumbent Vice President Sara Duterte, who was impeached in February. Despite being in detention in The Hague, his name is on the ballot for mayor of Davao City. A recent series of reports revealed that at least 71 of the country's 82 provincial governments are led by members of political dynasties.</p>

          <p>A 4.1 magnitude earthquake jolted parts of the southern U.S. on Saturday morning, centered near Greenback, Tennessee. Residents in Atlanta and western North Carolina reported feeling the tremors, with the USGS receiving over 23,000 public reports in the first hour. While there were no immediate reports of significant damage or injuries, the event served as a reminder to be prepared for earthquakes. The Eastern Tennessee seismic zone is one of the most active in the Southeast, and earthquakes are felt over a much larger distance in the Eastern U.S. due to the region's geology.</p>

A study found at-home screening was as effective as in-office screening, and women overwhelmingly preferred it, potentially increasing cervical cancer screening rates.

While America focused on Mars, the Soviets explored Venus, achieving firsts in planetary exploration despite numerous challenges. The re-entry highlights the legacy of the space race and the increasing number of objects falling from the sky, though Kosmos-482's return is unique for its historical significance.</p>
