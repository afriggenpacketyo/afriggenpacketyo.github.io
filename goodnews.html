          <h2>Analysis of Scottie Scheffler's Golf Dominance Draws Comparisons to Tiger Woods</h2>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Following his victory at The Open, golfer Scottie Scheffler is being hailed as the most dominant force in the sport since Tiger Woods. This article examines the parallels in their careers, noting that both players took an identical number of days to win their first four majors. While Scheffler himself dismisses the comparisons as "silly," his peers and commentators point to his machine-like consistency and ruthless ability to win. The analysis also explores how improvements in his putting, including a switch to a claw grip, have been instrumental in his recent success.</p>

          <h2>Child Development Expert Recommends Teaching 'Self-Connection' as a Crucial Life Skill</h2>
          <div class="timestamp">2025-07-20 18:05:46 EDT</div>
        </div>
        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>According to a child development expert who has studied over 200 parent-child relationships, the most important skill to teach a child is self-connection—the ability to understand their own emotions and needs. This skill fosters emotional resilience, healthy boundaries, and authentic confidence, acting as a buffer against anxiety and self-doubt. The article suggests parents can cultivate this by validating their child's feelings rather than dismissing them, welcoming all emotions, and modeling their own emotional awareness. These small shifts help children build a strong inner voice and protect their long-term mental health.</p>

          <p>Tech entrepreneur Adam Miller's nonprofit, Better Angels, is attempting to revolutionize affordable housing by building units without public subsidies. The organization proposes to finance projects through a mix of private equity and conventional loans, aiming to prove that "capitalism can work" to solve the housing crisis. By avoiding the slow process of securing tax credits and government grants, Better Angels claims it can build faster and at a fraction of the typical cost. While its projects may not serve the most acutely low-income individuals, the goal is to create a new, profitable model to attract more developers to the affordable housing market.</p>

          <p>After a commanding four-shot victory at The Open, his fourth major title, Scottie Scheffler remains humble, insisting he is not "anything special." Despite praise from peers comparing his dominance to that of Tiger Woods, Scheffler stated such parallels are "silly," as he is only a quarter of the way to Woods's major count. He emphasized that while winning is a cool feeling, it is his family and faith that fulfill the deepest desires of his heart. The 29-year-old champion celebrated the victory with his wife and 14-month-old son, Bennett.</p>
