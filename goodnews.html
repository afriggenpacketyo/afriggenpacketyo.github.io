          <p>At the Chester Zoo in the United Kingdom, a same-sex pair of male Humboldt penguins, named Scampi and Flounder, are successfully raising a chick. Zoo experts entrusted the pair with an egg from another penguin couple to increase the chick's chances of survival, as part of a successful breeding season that produced ten new chicks. Humboldt penguins are listed as a vulnerable species, and the zoo's colony is a vital part of an international breeding program. The zoo reports that same-sex pairings are not uncommon among penguins and that both parents share feeding and parenting responsibilities.</p>

          <p>Hamas has delivered what it calls a "positive response" to the latest U.S.-backed proposal for a ceasefire and hostage release deal in Gaza. A senior Palestinian official indicated that while Hamas accepts the general framework, it has requested significant amendments. These include a U.S. guarantee that hostilities will not resume if permanent ceasefire talks fail and that Israeli troops withdraw to pre-offensive positions. The plan is believed to involve a staggered release of remaining Israeli hostages in exchange for Palestinian prisoners, along with an immediate increase in humanitarian aid to the region.</p>

          <p>Germany began its Women's Euro 2025 campaign with a 2-0 victory over Poland, thanks to goals from Jule Brand and Lea Schüller. However, the win was overshadowed by a potentially serious knee injury to captain Giulia Gwinn, who left the field in tears during the first half. Gwinn, who has a history of two prior ACL injuries, will undergo an MRI to determine the extent of the damage, leaving her participation in the rest of the tournament in doubt. The team's coach called the injury a 'bitter price' to pay for the victory.</p>

He also warns against sugary cereals and deep-fried foods, which can contribute to inflammation and train taste buds to crave unhealthy options.

          <p>In an extensive interview, documentary filmmaker Ken Burns describes the American Revolution as the most important event in world history since the birth of Christ because it created the new concept of a 'citizen.' He argues that the nation is held together by the ideas and words of the Declaration of Independence, which distilled a century of Enlightenment thinking. Burns emphasizes that the U.S. has always been divided, but understanding the nation's complex and often violent origins can provide perspective and inspiration for today's challenges. He advocates for embracing the founders' flaws to see them as real people and make their lessons more accessible.</p>

While the market is not fully recovered, the increase in tech IPOs in the first half of 2025, along with the upcoming Figma IPO, suggests that the 'liquidity drought' may be ending, encouraging more venture-backed companies to prepare for public offerings.

          <p>A provision within the newly signed Republican tax and spending bill creates a temporary federal income tax deduction for workers who earn tips. The White House has promoted this as a significant benefit for the working class, but critics argue its effects will be limited. The deduction, which expires in 2028, will not benefit the lowest-earning tipped workers who already have no federal income tax liability. Labor advocates and some economists suggest that a more effective way to help low-wage workers would be to raise the federal minimum wage rather than creating a narrow tax break.
