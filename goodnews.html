          <p>The UK government has proposed a wider ban on destructive bottom trawling in English waters, aiming to protect marine life and the seabed. The proposal would extend the prohibition from 18,000km2 to 30,000km2 of the UK's offshore protected areas. Environment Secretary Steve Reed emphasized the urgency of action to prevent irreversible destruction of the oceans. The plan, subject to a 12-week industry consultation, aligns with warnings from Sir David Attenborough about the damaging effects of bottom trawling.</p>
