He also expressed interest in following Michael Jordan's path by becoming part of an NBA ownership group, though he acknowledged the financial challenges of majority ownership. Curry is an investor in Unrivaled, the women's 3-on-3 basketball league, and has interest in buying a WNBA team.</p>

          <p>In 2013, Stephen Curry's decision to sign with Under Armour over Nike was a defining moment in his business career, influenced by Golden State Warriors teammate Kent Bazemore. Under Armour offered Curry a $4 million per year deal, while Nike declined to match the offer of $2.5 million. Today, Curry has a signature line of products with Under Armour and serves as president of the Curry Brand, receiving significant equity in the company. While Curry has prospered, Under Armour has faced challenges, impacting Curry's off-court prospects, though Curry says the move changed the way he thought about his off-court business.</p>

          <p>Despite being a two-time NBA MVP, four-time champion, and successful entrepreneur, Stephen Curry admits to experiencing impostor syndrome. Curry, son of former NBA star Dell Curry, says he didn't grow up expecting to play in the league due to his stature and underdog mentality. Embracing his underdog status, Curry has found success both on and off the court, leading Thirty Ink and giving back through his nonprofit, Eat. Learn. Play.

          <p>The current economic structure in the United States increasingly works against fertility, demanding more years in education and longer work hours during prime childbearing years. The average age of a new mother has risen to 27.5, and many women feel they cannot have children earlier due to career demands. Colleges and workplaces often lack support for parents, and mainstream feminism can sometimes ignore the barriers to early parenthood. Alternative approaches are needed that respect women's autonomy while ensuring people can make less constrained choices about when to have children.</p>

The UK Airspace Design Service (UKADS) will redesign routes over UK airspace, many of which were established 70 years ago. The initial focus will be on modernizing airspace in and around London, with changes expected to be implemented in the 2030s. The government says these changes will also reduce aviation's climate change impacts and enable new technologies such as flying taxis, though some worry about increased noise pollution.</p>

          <p>Maintaining a romantic relationship requires effort from both parties, but determining when that effort becomes excessive is challenging. While research suggests that couples who invest effort in their relationships are happier, that effort should not come at the expense of mental and physical health. Relationships require cooperation, communication, and a willingness to address conflicts, but it is essential to recognize when a partnership is no longer a good fit. Couples who are intentional about showing compassion, spending time together, and being kind to one another are more likely to have successful marriages.</p>
