          <p>The Dalai Lama has announced that the institution will continue after his death, ending speculation that he might be the final one to hold the title. He stated that his successor should be identified according to traditional Buddhist practices, signaling that China should not interfere in the process. This decision is politically significant for Tibetans seeking to preserve their identity and is expected to be opposed by Beijing, which insists it has the sole authority to approve the next spiritual leader.</p>

          <p>Shares of Chinese luxury jeweler Laopu Gold jumped 15% to a record high, defying expectations of a sell-off as a one-year lock-up period expired. The end of the restriction freed up 69 million shares, representing a 40% stake, for pre-listing investors to sell. Instead of a price drop, investors rushed to buy the stock, which has surged over 1,300% since its 2024 debut. Analysts attribute the strong performance to the company's powerful branding, pricing power, and potential for overseas growth. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>China's top leadership, led by President Xi Jinping, has directly addressed the intense price wars affecting numerous industries, vowing to regulate what it terms "disorderly low-price competition." This explicit language marks a shift from more vague terms previously used by officials to describe the issue. At a high-level economic meeting, Xi emphasized the need for lawful regulation to guide companies toward improving product quality and facilitating the exit of outdated production capacity. Beijing views this as essential for fostering innovation and preventing harm to the economy's overall health. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>In a surprising move on the first day of NBA free agency, the Milwaukee Bucks have reportedly agreed to a four-year, $107 million deal with center Myles Turner. To facilitate the acquisition from the Indiana Pacers, the Bucks are waiving nine-time All-Star Damian Lillard, whose remaining $112.6 million contract will be paid out over five years. The decisions are influenced by recent Achilles tendon injuries to both Lillard and Pacers star Tyrese Haliburton, reshaping the rosters of two top Eastern Conference teams. Lillard will now become an unrestricted free agent.</p>

          <p>Ukraine's intelligence directorate (GUR) has released footage showing its forces using a catapult system to launch UJ-26 "Bober" drones against Russian targets deep behind the front lines. This launch method allows the fixed-wing drones to be deployed without landing gear, potentially increasing their range and effectiveness. The GUR claims these relatively inexpensive drones, costing around $110,000 each, have successfully targeted multi-million dollar Russian assets, including Pantsir air defense systems and advanced radar installations in occupied Crimea.

          <p>The "Quad" nations‚Äîthe United States, Japan, India, and Australia‚Äîhave announced a new initiative to secure a stable supply of critical minerals essential for new technologies. The partnership aims to reduce global reliance on any single country, a clear move to counter China's dominance in the processing and refining of these materials. In a joint statement, the group expressed concerns about economic coercion and supply chain disruptions. The collaboration seeks to diversify supply chains and strengthen strategic stability in the Indo-Pacific region.</p>

          <p>A federal judge has ruled that the Trump administration cannot terminate Temporary Protected Status (TPS) for nearly 350,000 Haitian migrants this year. The ruling blocks a plan to revoke their legal status and work permits, which was scheduled to take effect in September. The judge stated that the Department of Homeland Security secretary lacks the authority to partially vacate a country's TPS designation before its official expiration date in February 2026. The White House has announced its intention to appeal the decision.</p>
