          <p>The terrorism case against Liam Óg Ó hAnnaidh, a rapper from the group Kneecap known as Mo Chara, has been dismissed by a London court. He was charged for allegedly displaying a flag supporting Hezbollah at a concert, but the charge was deemed unlawful due to a procedural error. The prosecution was not initiated within the statutory six-month time limit, as the necessary consent from the Director of Public Prosecutions was obtained a day after he was charged. Upon leaving the court, Ó hAnnaidh stated the case was an attempt to silence pro-Palestinian voices, a sentiment echoed by his supporters who celebrated the ruling.</p>

          <p>Costco delivered stronger-than-expected financial results for its fourth quarter, with both revenue and adjusted earnings per share surpassing analyst estimates. The wholesale retailer's total revenue grew by 8% year-over-year to $86.16 billion, driven by healthy sales and a 14% increase in membership fee income. While gross margins showed improvement, the company noted a slight dip in membership renewal rates, which it attributes to an increase in online sign-ups that tend to renew at a lower rate. Overall, the results reflect a solid performance in a challenging retail environment, showcasing the company's ability to manage inflation and maintain customer traffic. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>Paccar, the parent company of truck brands Peterbilt and Kenworth, saw its stock price surge after President Donald Trump announced a new 25% tariff on imported heavy trucks. The president stated the measure was intended to protect American manufacturers from an 'onslaught of outside interruptions.' According to a Bank of America analysis, Paccar's domestically produced trucks cost significantly more than competitors' trucks made in Mexico. The new tariff is expected to level the playing field, placing Paccar in a more advantageous market position and driving investor confidence in the company. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>Taiwan's Ministry of Economic Affairs has suspended planned export controls on semiconductor products to South Africa, backtracking on its first unilateral chip curbs against a foreign nation. The controls, which would have required prior approval for shipping 47 different products, were announced in response to a dispute over the name of Taipei's representative office in Pretoria. Following the announcement, the South African government agreed to suspend its demand for a name change pending further negotiations. This de-escalation suggests both sides are seeking a diplomatic resolution to the conflict.</p>

          <h2>A Guide to Understanding How Financial Advisors Are Compensated</h2>
          <div class="timestamp">2025-09-26 07:46:24 EDT</div>
        </div>
        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Understanding how a financial advisor is paid is crucial for investors, yet many are unaware of the fee structures involved. This article explains the primary compensation models, which fall into either commission-based or fee-based categories. Commissions are typically one-time payments for selling a specific product, which can create conflicts of interest. Fee-based models include charges based on assets under management (AUM), flat annual fees, or monthly subscriptions, each with its own pros and cons. Experts advise clients to ask direct questions about compensation to ensure transparency and protect their financial returns from hidden costs.</p>

          <h2>Trump States He Will Not Permit Israeli Annexation of the West Bank</h2>
          <div class="timestamp">2025-09-26 07:38:15 EDT</div>
        </div>
        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>In a significant policy declaration, U.S. President Donald Trump has stated that he will not allow Israel to annex the occupied West Bank. The comment comes as a rejection of calls from some far-right Israeli politicians to extend sovereignty over the territory, a move that would effectively end any possibility of a future Palestinian state. Trump's firm stance, 'Nope, I will not allow it. It’s not going to happen,' was made as Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu was preparing to address the United Nations. This statement introduces a clear boundary on potential Israeli actions in the region, signaling a desire to maintain the status quo on the contentious issue.</p>

          <h2>Wealthy Family Offices Favor Public Stocks for AI Investment, Goldman Sachs Poll Finds</h2>
          <div class="timestamp">2025-09-26 07:30:01 EDT</div>
        </div>
        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>A recent Goldman Sachs survey of 245 global family offices reveals a preference for investing in the artificial intelligence boom through public equities rather than direct investments in startups. According to the poll, 52% of these investment firms for the ultra-wealthy gain AI exposure through stocks or ETFs, while only a quarter invest directly in private AI companies. This preference is partly attributed to more confidence in the valuations of public companies compared to the sometimes-inflated valuations in private markets. The report also noted that many are investing in secondary beneficiaries of AI, such as energy providers needed to power data centers. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>Judy Blume's influential young adult novel, 'Forever...', celebrates its 50th anniversary this year, prompting reflection on its cultural impact. Published in 1975, the book was revolutionary for its frank and realistic depiction of teenage sexuality from a young woman's perspective, covering topics like first-time sex, birth control, and emotional complexity. For generations of young readers, it served as a crucial, if controversial, guide to navigating adolescence and desire. The article explores how the novel empowered young women to be protagonists in their own sexual narratives, a radical concept at the time that led to it becoming one of the most frequently challenged books in American libraries.</p>

          <p>A section of Buffalo Valley Road in Putnam County, Tennessee, was closed Friday morning following a single-vehicle crash involving a semi-truck on Interstate 40. The truck reportedly left the eastbound lanes of the interstate and rolled down an embankment. Emergency crews conducted a rope rescue to retrieve the occupants from the vehicle.

          <p>Following its second bankruptcy filing in seven years, the tween accessories retailer Claire's has been acquired by private holding company Ames Watson.

The revitalization strategy focuses on updating merchandise, improving pay and training for employees, and launching fresh marketing that plays on the brand's nostalgic appeal.
