          <p>Abercrombie & Fitch experienced a slowdown in sales growth for its namesake brand in Q2, with a 5% decline. However, the success of its teen-focused Hollister brand, which saw 19% growth, salvaged the quarter, leading to an overall 7% sales increase. The company exceeded Wall Street expectations and raised its full-year revenue outlook, despite facing higher tariff costs. CEO Fran Horowitz anticipates the Abercrombie brand will return to growth by year-end, supported by new categories and partnerships like the NFL. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>Ryanair CEO Michael O'Leary announced that the bonus for staff who identify passengers with oversized cabin bags will increase from €1.50 to €2.50 starting in November. O'Leary defended the policy, stating it aims to deter a small minority of passengers from non-compliance, emphasizing that the airline is not trying to "catch people out." He reiterated that passengers who adhere to the size limits (which will slightly increase in September due to new EU rules) will face no issues and contribute to faster boarding and fewer delays.</p>

        </div>
        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Claiming Social Security benefits at age 62, the earliest eligibility age, comes with significant financial risks despite its appeal. This article highlights three key downsides: a permanent reduction in monthly benefits (approximately 70% of the full amount), missing out on delayed retirement credits that increase benefits by 8% annually until age 70, and potentially reducing survivor benefits for a spouse. The article suggests alternatives like tapping retirement savings, considering annuities, exploring home equity options, or working part-time to delay claiming and maximize long-term financial security.

          <p>Nvidia is expected to report robust fiscal second-quarter earnings, with analysts projecting $1.01 adjusted earnings per share and $46.02 billion in revenue, representing 53% year-over-year growth. This continued surge is attributed to insatiable demand for its graphics processing units (GPUs) driven by the generative AI era, particularly its data center business, which accounts for 88% of sales. Key questions for analysts include sales performance of new Blackwell chips and the state of Nvidia's business in China, following recent export controls and calls for homegrown chips.

          <p>Pop superstar Taylor Swift and Kansas City Chiefs tight end Travis Kelce have announced their engagement, breaking Instagram records. Details reveal Kelce proposed approximately two weeks prior at his Missouri home, creating an "enchanted garden" scene with thousands of flowers, a likely nod to Swift's songs. The custom engagement ring features an old mine brilliant cut in a yellow gold bezel setting, designed by Kindred Lubeck. Their relationship famously began after Kelce's attempt to meet Swift at a game, which he discussed on his "New Heights" podcast, leading to Swift reaching out.</p>

          <p>An analysis of US container data reveals that retailers like Abercrombie & Fitch, Best Buy, and Five Below are employing distinct strategies to manage the impact of President Trump's tariffs. Abercrombie is diversifying its supply chain and leveraging supplier contracts to offset higher duties, particularly from Asian countries. Best Buy front-loaded freight in June but less than previous years, with a lower reliance on China. Discount retailer Five Below, despite high exposure to Chinese tariffs, benefits from flexible inventory and opportunistic purchasing. These varied approaches reflect each company's product categories and customer base. (not investment advice)</p>

Dubbed the "punk rocker" of its time, this ankylosaur is astonishing experts with its metre-long spikes fused directly onto its bones, a feature unseen in any other animal. This discovery challenges existing theories on ankylosaur evolution, suggesting these creatures may have initially developed elaborate armor for display during the Jurassic period, only later co-opting these structures for defense against large predators in the Cretaceous.</p>

While Google risks losing search traffic, some analysts believe unwinding these costly deals could free up capital to fuel its AI growth, potentially making it a top-performing stock. The judge previously ruled Google held a search monopoly, and the impact hinges on new deals and the ruling's scope. Despite challenges, Google's search dominance remains strong, with a high market share even in Europe where similar exclusivity was mandated. (not investment advice)</p>

To get assistance, borrowers can contact the Federal Student Aid Information Center early on weekdays or use their live chat. Alternatively, reaching out directly to their student loan servicer, or seeking help from non-profits and state ombudsmen, are recommended strategies for navigating repayment and forgiveness programs.</p>
