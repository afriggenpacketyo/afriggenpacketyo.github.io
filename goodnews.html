        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Asia-Pacific markets are anticipated to open mixed, tracking Wall Street's recent gains which were fueled by a significant tech rally. This rally stemmed from a massive deal between OpenAI and AMD, presenting a direct challenge to chipmaker giant Nvidia. Investors in the region are closely watching chip stocks, with Japan's Nikkei 225 index poised for a higher open, contrasting with Australia's ASX/S&P 200 experiencing early losses. U.S. equity futures showed little change after major benchmarks hit fresh records on Monday, buoyed by AMD shares skyrocketing almost 24% following the OpenAI deal. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>Pharmacies in England are encountering significant issues, including angry and abusive patients, due to tightened eligibility criteria for free Covid boosters. Many individuals who booked appointments through the NHS website are being turned away, as only those aged 75 and older or with weakened immune systems are now eligible. Community Pharmacy England reported that between a third and half of patients are ineligible, causing frustration and leading to calls for clearer communication from NHS England regarding the revised guidelines.

          <p>CNBC's Jim Cramer expressed bullish sentiment on Take-Two Interactive, predicting its stock could rise due to its newfound "scarcity value" in the video game industry. With major competitors like Activision and EA going private, Take-Two is now the sole publicly-traded American pure-play video game company. Cramer highlighted the company's strong recent performance, including beating Wall Street estimates and raising its full-year forecast, alongside the anticipation for "Grand Theft Auto VI." He suggested any stock dip from potential delays in the game's release could be a buying opportunity. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>The federal government will acquire a 10% ownership stake in Trilogy Metals, Inc., a Canadian-based company with significant mining claims in Alaska's Ambler Mining District. This $35.6 million investment, announced by Interior Secretary Doug Burgum and the White House, aims to secure critical mineral supplies. President Trump signed an executive order to boost Alaska's resource utilization, including building a 200-mile road. Burgum emphasized the "Department War's" investment would benefit Americans, despite Trilogy Metals reporting a net loss in the recent quarter.</p>

          <p>Los Angeles is set to implement higher parking meter prices and extend paid parking hours, including Sundays, across its 35,000 metered spaces. Meter rates will increase by 50 cents per hour, with changes expected by late October for prices ranging from $1 to $8.50. This move, approved unanimously by the City Council, aims to generate an estimated $14.4 million in revenue for the financially struggling city and encourage vehicle turnover to support businesses. The decision aligns with other Southern California cities that also charge for daily on-street parking.</p>

          <p>Harry Kane, Bayern Munich's prolific striker, has indicated a willingness to discuss a new contract with the German club, signaling a decrease in his interest for a Premier League return. Kane, who has scored 103 goals in 106 appearances and won his first career trophy with Bayern, stated he could "definitely see" staying longer. While not ruling out a future return to England, his current focus is entirely on Bayern. This development suggests a strong commitment to his current club and a shift in his career priorities after achieving his first major honor.</p>

          <p>Brian K. Williams, a former Deputy Mayor for Public Safety in Los Angeles, was sentenced to one year of probation and 50 hours of community service for making a false bomb threat. Williams admitted to fabricating a threat against City Hall, which he later attributed to severe stress and mental health issues following personal tragedies. Prosecutors and defense attorneys agreed on a probation sentence, acknowledging his lack of prior criminal history and years of public service. The incident, which diverted police resources, was deemed an aberration stemming from acute personal anxiety.</p>

          <p>The UK Conservative Party has announced plans to abolish the Sentencing Council and grant ministers direct authority to issue sentencing guidelines in England and Wales. Shadow Justice Secretary Robert Jenrick will argue the council is "not fit for purpose" and has created a "two-tier nightmare" in the courts. This proposal follows a dispute between the council and the Labour government over pre-sentence reports for minority groups. The Conservatives aim to ensure sentencing policy is set by parliamentarians, asserting that the public desires tougher sentences than current guidelines recommend.</p>

          <p>China's decision to relinquish its "developing country" status at the World Trade Organization is viewed as a strategic maneuver, not a capitulation. This move removes a key talking point used by the United States and European Union, which criticized China's dual status as an economic powerhouse claiming benefits intended for poorer nations. By doing so, China aligns itself more closely with the Global South, reframing its international position. This tactical retreat, in line with Mao Zedong's theory of protracted war, allows China to conserve resources and reshape the geopolitical landscape in its long-term favor.</p>

          <p>Investor Brad Gerstner cautioned that OpenAI's recent deals with AMD and Nvidia are announcements, not immediate deployments, emphasizing that "the best chips will win" in the long run. The Altimeter Capital founder highlighted that these partnerships underscore an intensifying competitive landscape and a persistent "compute scarcity" in the AI industry. Gerstner also noted the geopolitical dimension, referencing OpenAI's Chinese rival DeepSeek, which has raised national security concerns for its AI models reflecting Chinese Communist Party views. The industry faces massive demand for AI services, necessitating broad collaboration. (not investment advice)</p>

Schiffmann claims the provocative billboards, often vandalized with critical messages, were intentionally designed to generate "mindshare" and social commentary on AI. He likens the AI pendant to a therapist, best friend, and living journal, even suggesting it's akin to "talking to a god," despite documented flaws in AI companions. The article suggests Friend's marketing is more performance art than traditional business strategy.</p>

          <p>Metropolitan Police have dismantled an international criminal gang suspected of smuggling up to 40,000 stolen mobile phones from the UK to China over the past year. This operation, described as the largest ever against phone thefts in the UK, led to 18 arrests and the recovery of over 2,000 devices. The investigation began when a victim tracked a stolen iPhone to a warehouse near Heathrow. Police believe the gang was responsible for exporting a significant portion of phones stolen in London, targeting profitable Apple products that fetched up to £4,000 each in China.</p>
