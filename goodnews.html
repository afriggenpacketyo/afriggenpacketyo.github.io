          <p>The Transportation Security Administration has reportedly allowed the rule requiring passengers to remove shoes during standard security screening to expire at some U.S. airports. While not a formal nationwide policy change, travelers at several airports, including in Baltimore and Fort Lauderdale, are no longer required to take off their footwear. This change brings the standard screening process closer to the experience for TSA PreCheck members, who are already exempt. In a statement, the TSA acknowledged it is always exploring ways to enhance the passenger experience while maintaining security.</p>

          <p>The California Institute of Technology is severing ties with e-learning company Simplilearn following a class-action lawsuit that alleged the partners misrepresented a cybersecurity boot camp. The lawsuit claimed Caltech lent its prestigious name to a program that had minimal connection to the university or its faculty, misleading students. As part of the settlement, Simplilearn will refund $2.4 million in tuition and both parties agreed to more transparent practices. The decision marks a significant development in the scrutiny of partnerships between universities and third-party online course providers.</p>

          <p>President Trump announced on Monday that his administration plans to send more defensive weapons to Ukraine, stating the country must be able to defend itself against ongoing Russian attacks. This statement marks a shift from last week, when the White House confirmed it had paused some weapon shipments as part of a broader review of U.S. military stockpiles. The president made the remarks during a meeting with Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu, emphasizing that the shipments would be primarily defensive in nature as Ukraine is "getting hit very hard."</p>

          <p>The Department of Veterans Affairs has reversed its plan for a large-scale reduction-in-force that was scheduled for August. The VA stated that the mass layoffs are no longer necessary as it is on track to reduce its workforce by about 30,000 employees this fiscal year through attrition, retirements, and a federal hiring freeze. This natural reduction has eliminated the need for the initially considered cuts, which could have been as high as 15% of the department's staff. VA Secretary Doug Collins affirmed that while a department-wide RIF is off the table, efforts to improve the agency will continue.</p>

          <p>Los Angeles Dodgers pitcher Clayton Kershaw has been selected for his 11th career All-Star Game, this time as a special "Legend Pick" by Commissioner Rob Manfred. The 37-year-old, who was surprised by the announcement, expressed gratitude for the honor, acknowledging he likely wouldn't have been chosen based on his limited starts this season after returning from surgery. The selection recognizes his storied career, which includes becoming the 20th pitcher in MLB history to record 3,000 strikeouts earlier this year. Kershaw stated he is simply enjoying being part of a strong team this season.</p>

          <p>South Korea has canceled a planned $2.2 billion follow-on purchase of 36 AH-64E Apache Guardian attack helicopters. The decision was reportedly driven by a significant increase in the aircraft's cost and growing concerns about the vulnerability of traditional helicopters on the modern battlefield. A South Korean lawmaker noted that the proliferation of advanced air defenses and drones, as demonstrated in the war in Ukraine, has prompted a strategic shift. The funds will instead be redirected toward investing in more modern capabilities like drones and other smart systems reflective of future warfare.</p>

          <p>Police in Budapest have announced they will not prosecute participants of the city's recent Pride parade, even though the event was officially prohibited by the government. The decision comes after Budapest's mayor declared the march an official municipal event, creating legal ambiguity. Despite a government ban under laws aimed at "protecting children," the parade attracted a record crowd of over 200,000 people. This development is seen as a victory for LGBTQ+ rights activists in Hungary, who face an increasingly challenging political environment under Prime Minister Viktor Orban's right-wing government.</p>

          <p>Dr. Serhii Baksheiev, a Ukrainian obstetrician and gynecologist, is traveling through front-line and occupied territories to provide essential healthcare to women in a mobile clinic. With over 1,900 attacks on Ukraine's health facilities since the war began, many women have no access to doctors. Dr. Baksheiev's 'Feminine Shuttle' is fully equipped for examinations and minor surgeries, offering free care in areas where hospitals have been destroyed. This work is crucial, as public health data shows a significant drop in cancer detection rates, making his volunteer mission a vital service for a vulnerable population.</p>

          <p>The public inquiry into the UK's Post Office scandal is set to publish the first part of its final report, focusing on compensation and the human impact on the victims. This marks a significant milestone for the thousands of sub-postmasters who were wrongly prosecuted due to the faulty Horizon IT system. The findings from Sir Wyn Williams are expected to be damning regarding the treatment of victims. However, the second part of the report, which will assign blame for the miscarriage of justice, is not expected until 2026, meaning the full path to accountability remains long.</p>

At a time of uncertainty in Europe, the meeting aims to reaffirm the countries' shared history and values. King Charles is seen as playing a crucial diplomatic role in reinvigorating the partnership to face modern challenges like military threats and climate change.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>CNBC's Jim Cramer suggested that investors should not overreact to President Trump's latest announcement of new tariffs on 14 countries. He argued that the announced figures are likely not final but rather a starting point for negotiations with nations that need access to U.S. markets. Cramer noted the administration's history of postponing or reducing tariffs, and he believes the ultimate goal is not to build new domestic plants but to increase U.S. exports. He therefore cautioned against significant selling, viewing the policy as a negotiating tactic rather than a fixed economic barrier. (not investment advice)</p>
