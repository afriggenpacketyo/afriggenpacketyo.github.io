          <p>Mexico secured its place in the Gold Cup semifinals with a 2-0 victory over Saudi Arabia, continuing its title defense. Alexis Vega opened the scoring in the second half, capitalizing on a rebound after his initial shot was saved, a goal confirmed after a VAR review overturned an offside call. An own goal by Abdullah Madu later sealed the win for Mexico, which has now reached the semifinal stage for the tenth consecutive tournament. The team is set to face Honduras as it seeks to add to its record 12 regional titles.</p>

          <p>Los Angeles Dodgers' two-way star Shohei Ohtani demonstrated progress in his return to pitching, throwing two scoreless innings against the Kansas City Royals. During his outing, he recorded a 101.7 mph fastball, the fastest of his major league career, and allowed only one hit and a walk while striking out one. However, his performance on the mound was not matched at the plate, as he went hitless in four at-bats with three strikeouts.

This year's events are characterized by a more defiant tone, mixing jubilant celebration with political protest in response to recent rollbacks of LGBTQ+ friendly policies under the Trump administration. Organizers have noted a significant drop in corporate sponsorship, with companies like PepsiCo and Nissan reducing or pulling their support.

          <p>Japan's top tariff negotiator, Ryosei Akazawa, held multiple discussions with U.S. Commerce Secretary Howard Lutnick in Washington as both sides work towards a new trade agreement. Despite the talks being described as "fruitful," significant differences apparently remain, particularly concerning the Trump administration's hefty tariffs on Japanese automobiles and auto parts. Japan is prioritizing the mitigation of the 27.5% tariff on its cars, but the U.S. has shown no indication of reducing these sector-based tariffs. Akazawa has extended his stay to continue pursuing a deal. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>The UK government has announced new plans to partner with major supermarkets and food manufacturers to encourage healthier eating habits among the public. Under the voluntary initiative, retailers will decide on methods such as offering promotions on healthy food, adjusting loyalty point systems, or changing store layouts to tackle rising obesity rates. The policy, part of a broader 10-year NHS plan, will require businesses to report on healthy food sales to increase accountability. The move comes as data shows over one in five children are obese by the time they leave primary school.</p>

          <div class="timestamp">2025-06-28 21:23:14 EDT</div>
        </div>
        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Urban areas often experience significantly higher temperatures than the surrounding countryside due to a phenomenon known as the "urban heat island" effect. This occurs because cities are dominated by hard, dark surfaces like asphalt roads and buildings, which absorb and retain the sun's energy rather than reflecting it. This stored heat is slowly released, warming the air, especially at night. The effect is compounded by a lack of vegetation and water for natural cooling, as well as waste heat from vehicles and air conditioning, making city dwellers more vulnerable during heatwaves.</p>

          <p>A new pilot program in UK primary schools is teaching children as young as five about sun safety to help reduce future cases of skin cancer. The initiative, which is being trialled in Kent and planned for a nationwide rollout, educates pupils on reading UV indexes and applying sunscreen correctly. Experts from the Melanoma Fund, the charity behind the project, emphasize that sunburn in childhood significantly increases the risk of melanoma later in life. The lessons aim to instill lifelong preventative habits as melanoma diagnoses in the UK are projected to rise.</p>

Budapest's mayor, Gergely Karacsony, addressed the crowd, framing the large turnout as a peaceful and powerful message to a "puffed-up and hateful power."

After overcoming injuries and a challenging move to French club football, Rowe's decisive goal marks a significant milestone in his career. His story is one of perseverance, from a young player commuting hours for academy training to a matchwinner on the international stage.</p>
