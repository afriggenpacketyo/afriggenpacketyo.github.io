          <p>Tropical Storm Imelda is expected to strengthen into a hurricane by Tuesday, according to the National Hurricane Center. However, forecast maps indicate the storm's path will turn east-northeastward, moving it away from the southeastern United States. While a tropical storm watch for Florida has been canceled, Imelda is currently bringing heavy rain to the northwestern Bahamas. Swells from the storm are still expected to affect the U.S. East Coast, creating potentially life-threatening surf and rip current conditions this week.</p>

          <p>Financial therapist Aja Evans has cautioned against the popular TikTok trend of "manifesting" wealth, stating that belief alone is not a substitute for concrete action. The trend, which suggests that visualizing a goal can make it happen, is particularly popular among younger Americans but lacks a basis in financial reality. Evans advises that while a positive mindset is helpful, it must be paired with practical steps like creating a budget, applying for jobs, or developing a financial plan to achieve goals such as paying off debt or saving for a home.</p>

She recalls a time she moved forward with a crossover project against an advisor's warning, which resulted in the globally successful "Puyo Puyo Tetris." Rogers emphasizes that taking thoughtful risks is essential for innovation and growth, and that learning from potential failures is a critical part of the journey. She also champions mentorship and support for women in business through her venture accelerator.</p>

          <p>Dan Porter, CEO of the digital sports media company Overtime, states that the questions a candidate asks during an interview reveal a lot about their potential as an employee. He considers questions about basic benefits like a dental plan to be a red flag when speaking with a CEO, suggesting such topics are better addressed with HR after an offer is made. Instead, strong candidates ask insightful, specific questions about the business, its competitors, and company culture. Porter emphasizes that he prioritizes personality and practical intelligence over a lengthy resume when hiring.</p>

With international aid funding collapsing, the piece suggests a political solution is urgent, and that Chinese oversight could help guarantee the security, rights, and economic reintegration of the Rohingya people.</p>

          <p>The portrayal of fathers in television sitcoms has both reflected and shaped the evolving concept of American fatherhood, according to pop culture critic Phillip Maciak. From the stoic, suburban provider like Ward Cleaver in the 1950s to more actively co-parenting figures like Cliff Huxtable in the 1980s, TV dads map a cultural shift. The article notes that today's image of fatherhood is particularly contested, caught between a flexible, supportive ideal and a retro-patriarchal vision. This analysis comes as more young men express a desire for parenthood.</p>
