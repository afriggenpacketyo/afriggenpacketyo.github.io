          <p>Manchester Originals secured a significant 57-run victory over the Northern Superchargers in The Hundred cricket tournament, largely thanks to a hat-trick by bowler Sonny Baker. The 22-year-old, who was recently called up for England's national squad, took three key wickets to help dismiss the Superchargers for 114. The Originals' innings was anchored by Jos Buttler's unbeaten 64 and a late surge from Heinrich Klaasen, who scored 50 not out. This win moves the Manchester team into a stronger position in the tournament standings.</p>

He clarified that the internal shift towards prioritizing artificial intelligence was not intended to signal layoffs of full-time employees, a group he says has never been downsized. While acknowledging fluctuations in the contractor workforce, von Ahn emphasized that the goal is to leverage AI for innovation, not to replace human workers.

          <p>According to special U.S. envoy Steve Witkoff, Russian President Vladimir Putin agreed during a summit with President Trump to permit the U.S. and European allies to offer Ukraine security protections similar to NATO's Article 5. Witkoff described this as a "game-changing" concession, marking the first time Russia has reportedly accepted such a proposal, which could resolve a major obstacle in peace negotiations. This development could provide a workaround to Russia's long-standing opposition to formal NATO membership for Ukraine. European Commission President Ursula von der Leyen welcomed the move, stating the EU is ready to contribute.</p>

          <p>Dr. Alieu Kamara, the sole neurosurgeon for Sierra Leone's eight million people, has successfully performed the nation's first-ever spine surgery. The patient, Morie Abibu, was paralyzed from the neck down by a tumor pressing on his spinal cord. Before Dr. Kamara began his practice this year, such conditions were effectively a death sentence for those unable to travel abroad. The landmark operation was made possible through a global grassroots network, including the nonprofit Mission Brain, which arranged Dr. Kamara's training and supplied essential equipment, marking a significant step forward for the country's healthcare system.</p>

          <p>Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy has firmly stated that Ukraine will not give up any territory as a precondition for peace talks, emphasizing that the country's constitution forbids it. This stance comes amid reports that Russia proposed a ceasefire in exchange for Ukraine's withdrawal from the eastern Donetsk region. Speaking alongside EU Commission President Ursula von der Leyen, Zelenskyy also sought clarity on future security guarantees from allies. In response, European leaders stressed their unity in supporting Ukraine and affirmed that the country has the sovereign right to determine its own conditions for peace.</p>

          <p>Icelandic singer-songwriter Laufey has garnered a significant following by creating a unique musical style that combines modern pop sensibilities with jazz and classical influences. The 26-year-old cellist and vocalist, who recently won a Grammy, attributes her sound to her childhood exposure to Golden Age musicals and her parents' diverse musical tastes. Initially feeling like an outsider, she found a large, young audience on social media during the pandemic that embraced her nostalgic and romantic aesthetic. With a new album releasing and a stadium tour planned, she continues to bridge generational music gaps.</p>

          <p>Adam Scott discusses his journey from being a recognizable character actor to the lead in the critically acclaimed series "Severance," a role that earned him an Emmy nomination. He admits to being terrified by the prospect of headlining a major show but felt he had to use everything he had learned over his 30-year career to succeed. The series, in which his character's work and personal memories are surgically divided, has resonated with audiences and critics alike. Director Ben Stiller praised Scott's technical skill in portraying the two distinct personalities, a key factor in the show's success.</p>

          <p>In a significant display of solidarity, several European leaders and the head of NATO will join Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy for his upcoming meeting with President Trump at the White House. Leaders from the European Commission, France, and Germany announced they would travel with Zelenskyy, an apparent effort to present a united front and support the Ukrainian president. The move follows a contentious previous meeting and Zelenskyy's exclusion from Trump's recent summit with Vladimir Putin. U.S. officials state the European leaders were invited as part of the next phase of diplomatic talks.</p>

        </div>
        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>A free-kick goal by Crystal Palace's Eberechi Eze against Chelsea was correctly disallowed by VAR due to a specific rule infringement. The decision was made because a Palace player was standing less than one meter away from Chelsea's defensive wall when the kick was taken. According to Law 13 of the game, introduced in the 2019-20 season, attacking players must maintain at least a one-meter distance from a defensive wall composed of three or more players. The rule was implemented to prevent management problems and time-wasting caused by attackers positioning themselves within the wall.</p>

          <p>Viking Therapeutics (VKTX) is identified as a stock that could see significant gains, particularly if its oral weight-loss drug candidate performs well in upcoming phase 2 trials. The company is competing in a market dominated by giants like Eli Lilly and Novo Nordisk but has an opportunity following a less-than-stellar trial result for Lilly's own oral candidate. Viking's primary drug, VK2735, has already shown strong data in its injectable form and is also being developed as a treatment for MASH, a liver disease with a large unmet need. The stock is considered a higher-risk but potentially high-reward investment. (not investment advice)</p>
