          <p>Flamenco, originating from the Roma people of southern Spain, has found a vibrant home in New Mexico, particularly in Albuquerque, which hosts a world-famous flamenco festival and is home to the only American university offering graduate and undergraduate dance degrees with a flamenco emphasis. New Mexico's flamenco scene is unique because it is homegrown, tracing its Hispanic identity back over 400 years, with local artists incorporating their own history and experiences into the art form. The National Institute of Flamenco plays a crucial role in outreach, teaching flamenco in public schools across the state, fostering a deep connection to the art form among young New Mexicans. Flamenco is not just a dance but a means of expression, allowing individuals to release emotions and connect with their cultural heritage.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>As graduation season approaches, Chinese universities are implementing rules to monitor the proportion of AI-generated content in theses, with some using the "AI rate" as a factor in thesis approval to prevent academic misconduct. However, an official publication from China's Ministry of Science and Technology has criticized the use of AI content detectors, labeling it as a form of "technological superstition" due to the potential for false results. The publication highlighted instances where content written by students was incorrectly flagged as AI-generated, even citing an example of a century-old essay being evaluated as significantly AI-generated. This raises concerns about the reliability and fairness of using such tools in academic evaluations.</p>

          <h2>Judge Approves $2.8B Settlement Allowing US Colleges to Pay Athletes</h2>
          <div class="timestamp">2025-06-06 22:59:38 EDT</div>
        </div>
        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>A federal judge approved a landmark $2.8 billion settlement that will allow US colleges to pay athletes directly, marking a significant shift away from the traditional amateur model of college sports. The settlement, stemming from the House v. NCAA case, allows schools to share up to $20.5 million annually with athletes and compensates former players who were previously barred from earning revenue. The agreement is expected to professionalize college athletics, impacting recruitment, program funding, and the NCAA's oversight role, as power shifts towards the major conferences. While some athletes, particularly football and basketball stars, stand to benefit financially, concerns remain about the future of walk-on athletes, Olympic sports, and the potential for further legal challenges.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>A federal judge has approved the House v. NCAA settlement, ushering in a new era for college sports where athletes can be directly paid by their institutions. Starting this fall, top-division NCAA schools can compensate athletes, capped initially at $20.5 million per school, while $2.75 billion will be paid to former athletes who were previously prohibited from earning money. The settlement arose from lawsuits challenging the NCAA's amateurism tradition, which restricted compensation beyond scholarships despite the massive revenues generated by college athletics. This new framework allows schools to decide which athletes to pay, primarily in revenue-generating sports like football and basketball, but it also introduces roster limits and a third-party clearinghouse to review licensing agreements.</p>

The program has facilitated the donation of approximately 11 tons of rice and 8,600 liters of beverages, with popular items including rice and ready-made foods like curry. The donations are particularly significant given soaring rice prices and the challenges faced by single-mother households and children in need.</p>
