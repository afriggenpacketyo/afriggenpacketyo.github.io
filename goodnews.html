          <h2>AI Forecasting Still Trails Human Accuracy Despite Rapid Advancements</h2>

          <p>While AI models are increasingly being used for forecasting, they still lag behind top human forecasters, according to a recent article. Tournaments run by Metaculus show that human superforecasters consistently beat AI-driven bots, although the gap is narrowing. The most successful AI model in a recent quarter was surprisingly simple, using news articles and OpenAI's model to make predictions. However, AI faces challenges in quantitative thinking, logical reasoning, and web research skills, which limits its forecasting accuracy. The article suggests that AI forecasting is improving rapidly and may soon surpass human capabilities due to its ability to learn from mistakes and weigh information objectively.</p>

          <p>Indian markets have shown resilience and remained largely unaffected by recent strikes against Pakistan, reflecting investor confidence in India's growth prospects. Analysts suggest that structural reforms, strong domestic demand, and solid macroeconomic fundamentals are contributing factors. The progress on India's trade talks with major partners, including a free trade agreement with the UK, has also boosted investor sentiment. Despite the geopolitical tensions, experts anticipate a swift de-escalation and limited market fallout, drawing parallels to investor reactions following previous conflicts.</p>

          <p>In his first in-depth interview since leaving the White House, former US President Joe Biden spoke to the BBC about his legacy, foreign policy, and his views on President Donald Trump's administration. Biden admitted that his decision to withdraw from the 2024 race was difficult but ultimately the right one, while also criticizing Trump's approach to the Ukraine war as "modern-day appeasement." He expressed concerns about the future of the US-Europe alliance and Trump's disregard for diplomatic norms, while offering a tepid response to Trump's first 100 days in office.</p>

          <p>Novo Nordisk shares jumped 5% after the company predicted improved sales for its Wegovy weight loss drug in the second half of the year, anticipating a decline in the availability of copycat compounded drugs.
