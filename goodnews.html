        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Brazilian police thwarted a planned bomb attack at Lady Gaga's free concert on Copacabana beach in Rio de Janeiro, where over two million people gathered. The suspects, identifying as Lady Gaga fans, aimed to gain notoriety on social media by spreading hate speech against children, adolescents, and the LGBTQ+ community. The alleged mastermind was arrested for illegal firearm possession, and a teenager was detained for storing child pornography. Authorities seized electronic devices and materials across multiple states, revealing online groups encouraging violence among teenagers through coded language and extremist symbolism. The concert, intended to revitalize Rio's economy, had a massive security operation with 5,000 officers, metal detectors, drones, and facial recognition cameras.</p>

        </div>
        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Texas Gov. Greg Abbott signed a $1 billion school choice bill into law, enabling taxpayer money to assist qualifying students with private school tuition. The bill provides $10,000 per year for most students in accredited private schools, up to $30,000 for students with disabilities, and $2,000 for home-schooled students. Supporters, including President Trump, celebrated the move as a victory for parental freedom, while Democrats criticized it for potentially harming public schools by siphoning funds to benefit wealthier families already in private education. Critics argue that the legislation is not about choice but rather welfare for the wealthy, diverting resources from an already underfunded public school system.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>An NFL analyst suggests that Shedeur Sanders' draft slide, despite initial projections as a top pick, was due to how he and his camp handled the draft process. The analyst highlighted Sanders' decision not to participate in the NFL Scouting Combine or the East-West Shrine Game, which he had accepted an invite to, as a mistake. The analyst believed that Sanders was overrated as a player, and the NFL will humble anyone regardless of their perceived status. Sanders was selected by the Cleveland Browns in the fifth round of the 2025 NFL Draft and will compete for a starting job.</p>

          <p>Warren Buffett, the 94-year-old chairman and CEO of Berkshire Hathaway, announced his plans to step down, marking the end of an era for the value investing icon. Buffett transformed a failing textile manufacturer into a $1.1 trillion conglomerate through his disciplined approach of buying wonderful businesses at fair prices. His success has inspired generations of financiers and cemented his status as an avatar of American capitalism, with Berkshire's annual meeting drawing tens of thousands of admirers. While a successor, Gregory Abel, has been named, some worry that Berkshire may not retain its unique status without Buffett's leadership.</p>

          <p>President Trump stated he will not fire Federal Reserve Chair Jerome Powell before his term ends in May 2026, despite calling on him to lower interest rates. Trump expressed his belief that Powell should lower interest rates but claimed Powell is not a fan of his. He also suggested that the people on the Federal Reserve board should encourage Powell to lower interest rates, despite it already being late to do so. Trump clarified that he does not have plans to remove Powell before his term is up because he gets to replace him in a short period of time.</p>
