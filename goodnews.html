          <p>CoreWeave, an AI infrastructure provider, announced strong revenue growth in its first earnings report since its IPO, exceeding analyst expectations with a 420% increase compared to the previous year. The company anticipates continued growth, projecting revenue between $4.9 billion and $5.1 billion for 2025, driven by significant deals such as the $11.9 billion commitment from OpenAI. Despite facing competition from major cloud providers like Amazon, CoreWeave's growth is bolstered by its reliance on Nvidia GPUs and strategic partnerships with companies like Google and Microsoft. The company's future expansion hinges on securing sufficient power for its data centers, with plans to add 300 megawatts of contracted power during the quarter.</p>

          <p>Utah State Treasurer Marlo Oaks argues that state financial officers have an obligation to combat environmental, social, and governance (ESG) and diversity, equity, and inclusion (DEI) initiatives, emphasizing the importance of meritocracy and fiduciary responsibility in investments. Oaks contends that ESG introduces motives that violate fiduciary standards, potentially harming beneficiaries like firefighters, teachers, and police officers who depend on state pensions. He also links DEI to the social aspect of ESG, arguing that it can lead to discriminatory hiring practices that ultimately harm companies and their financial output. Oaks was among state financial officers who cautioned against prioritizing political agendas like DEI over financial returns.</p>

          <p>Uber is launching a new "Route Share" feature, offering commuters a bus-like service with shared rides along busy routes at half the cost of traditional fares. Route Share operates during weekday commuting hours, picking up passengers at predetermined points every 20 minutes, allowing them to ride with up to two other people. Uber is also introducing "Price Lock," a subscription service that lets customers choose a fixed price for a specific route, reducing cost fluctuations due to traffic or demand. These new features aim to cater to riders in highly populated areas and provide more affordable options for regular commuters who rely on Uber daily.</p>

          <p>A Trump-backed bill advanced by House Republicans aims to eliminate federal income tax on money earned from tips, potentially creating an above-the-line deduction for those in traditionally tipped occupations. The deduction would phase out for individuals making over $160,000 a year and expires after 2028. While the bill has passed the committee stage, it is expected to undergo changes as it moves through the House and Senate. This proposal aims to provide financial relief to tipped workers by allowing them to deduct the total amount of their tips from their taxable income. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>Home equity lines of credit (HELOCs) are currently a cheaper borrowing option than personal loans due to lower average interest rates. The average HELOC rate is 7.99%, while the average personal loan rate is 12.47%, making personal loans significantly more expensive. HELOCs are secured by the borrower's home, contributing to the lower rates, and the variable interest rates on HELOCs are expected to decline further with anticipated rate cuts. Borrowers can save hundreds of dollars per month by choosing a HELOC over a personal loan, but it is essential to manage payments carefully to ensure long-term affordability.

He pointed to limited cost-cutting efforts as evidence that the fiscal situation is unlikely to change soon.

The executive order calls for the Department of Health and Human Services to draw up regulations to impose these price restrictions if drugmakers do not voluntarily reduce prices in the U.S. Democrats had considered a similar approach in 2019, but concerns from moderate senators led to a different formula for capping prices.
