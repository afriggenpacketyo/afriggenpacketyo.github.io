          <p>Global music superstar Bad Bunny launched a three-month concert residency in his native Puerto Rico with a performance celebrating the island's heritage and folklore. The show in San Juan featured a wide range of musical styles and included new tracks that address social injustices like gentrification in the U.S. territory. After achieving worldwide fame, the artist has returned to his roots, focusing on creating music that reflects Puerto Rican pride, resistance, and joy. The concert was seen as an emotional homecoming and a powerful statement of cultural identity.</p>

He is tied with American Chris Gotterup at 11 under par, holding a two-shot advantage heading into the final day of the tournament. McIlroy, who has endured a self-described "lull" since his Masters victory, expressed confidence that he is returning to his top form at the Renaissance Club.

          <p>Julian Cash and Lloyd Glasspool have become the first all-British pair to win the men's doubles title at Wimbledon in 89 years. They secured their historic victory with a 6-2 7-6 (7-3) win over Rinky Hijikata and David Pel on Centre Court. This marks the first time since 1936 that two Britons have been crowned men's doubles champions at any Grand Slam. The pair, who teamed up less than a year ago, expressed their disbelief and joy at achieving one of their primary goals for the season at their home tournament.</p>

          <p>Iga Swiatek has won her first Wimbledon championship, defeating American Amanda Anisimova in a remarkably one-sided final. The Polish star secured her sixth Grand Slam title with a 6-0 6-0 victory in just 57 minutes, marking the most decisive women's final at Wimbledon since 1911. Swiatek, previously known for her dominance on clay and hard courts, called the victory on grass "surreal." For Anisimova, who recently returned to tennis after a break for her mental health, the final was a difficult experience but capped an inspiring tournament run.</p>

          <p>Despite President Trump's renewed campaign of tariff threats against major trading partners, the U.S. stock market has remained near record highs. Analysts suggest that investors have become more accustomed to the president's negotiating style and are less prone to panic compared to previous announcements. The market's stability is also attributed to underlying economic strength driven by deregulation and the rapid advancement of artificial intelligence. This analysis suggests investors are focusing more on the pro-growth implications of current policies, such as increased M&A activity, rather than reacting to turbulent political rhetoric.

          <p>Two fathers in England have initiated a campaign to ban smartphones in schools, threatening legal action against the government. They argue that the current guidance, which lets headteachers decide on phone policy, is unlawful and fails to protect children from harmful content and cyberbullying. The campaigners have sent a formal letter to the Education Secretary, signaling their intent to seek a judicial review. They believe a complete ban on smartphones, allowing only basic "brick phones" for communication, is the only way to ensure a safe school environment for children.</p>
