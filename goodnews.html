          <p>Uber CEO Dara Khosrowshahi addressed employee concerns regarding the company's decision to increase in-office requirements and alter sabbatical eligibility. At an all-hands meeting, Khosrowshahi stated that the changes were a risk the company decided to take for the sake of collaboration, innovation, and company culture, and that Uber needs to be on its A game as a Gen-AI powered company. He apologized to employees who were negatively impacted, but emphasized the need for employees to focus on learning and their impact on the company rather than benefits. Khosrowshahi denied that the changes were aimed at cost cutting or driving attrition. </p>

          <p>Disney reported better-than-expected fiscal second-quarter earnings, driven by a surprise increase in Disney+ subscribers and overall revenue growth across its business segments. The company's direct-to-consumer business saw an 8% revenue increase, fueled by higher prices and subscriber numbers. Disney now anticipates full-year adjusted EPS of $5.75, a 16% increase compared to fiscal 2024, and expects modest growth in Disney+ subscribers in the current quarter.

          <h2>Chinese Scientists Unlock Genetic Secret for Drought-Tolerant Rice</h2>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Chinese scientists have identified a gene in upland rice roots linked to drought resistance, potentially transforming irrigated rice into drought-tolerant varieties. By removing the HMGB1 gene, irrigated rice developed longer, thicker roots, similar to upland rice, enabling it to thrive in water-scarce environments. This discovery could significantly improve food security by allowing rice cultivation in regions facing water scarcity, and the researchers published their findings in the journal Molecular Plant. This advancement addresses a critical need for drought-resistant crops amid increasing climate challenges.</p>

          <p>Despite negative economic news, including a contraction in first-quarter GDP, weekly mortgage demand surged by 11%, according to the Mortgage Bankers Association. Mortgage interest rates dropped slightly for the second straight week, but applications for home purchases rose significantly, particularly for conventional loans. The increase in demand for conventional loans, typically sought by move-up buyers, was a surprising move given lingering economic uncertainty. Applications to refinance a home loan also increased, driven by VA loans, and the Federal Reserve's upcoming meeting could influence future mortgage rate movements.</p>

          <p>China has agreed to meet with American officials to discuss trade, signaling a willingness to de-escalate tensions amid economic pressures from both sides. While maintaining a firm stance against coercion, China's decision reflects concerns over slowing economic activity and disruptions to trade. The move is viewed as a softening of China‚Äôs previous refusal to negotiate under duress, with officials emphasizing de-escalation over immediate deals. Both countries seem interested in reducing tariffs, but neither wants to make the initial concession, and the Chinese side will likely treat the talks as a fact-finding mission.</p>

The election is also seen as a referendum on Pope Francis' papacy, with diverse priorities among cardinals, including some who prefer a more traditional leader. Several potential contenders have emerged, but the outcome remains uncertain, and the new pope's characteristics will be hinted at when he appears on the balcony.</p>

          <p>The UK government is defending its newly-agreed trade deal with India against claims that it could disadvantage British workers. A key part of the deal extends a National Insurance (NI) exemption from one to three years for people on short-term visas. The government argues this won't impact British workers, citing existing agreements preventing double taxation, but opposition parties fear it could make Indian workers cheaper to employ. The deal aims to boost trade by ¬£25.5bn a year by 2040, and includes lowered tariffs on goods like whisky, cars, clothing, and footwear.</p>

While the world may not currently demand human superforecasting, AI superforecasting may have a big impact if it can forecast better than the best humans today.</p>
