          <p>This analysis examines the policy proposals of New York City mayoral nominee Zohran Mamdani, arguing they are less radical than critics suggest. The article details plans like a rent freeze, city-owned grocery stores, and fare-free buses, noting that similar initiatives have been implemented before in NYC and other cities with some success. Rather than being revolutionary, Mamdani's agenda is framed as an effort to make government more effective and responsive to citizens' needs, aiming to tangibly improve quality of life.</p>

          <p>New research using continuous glucose monitors has identified a pattern in many healthy individuals where blood sugar plummets a few hours after eating, a phenomenon termed a "dip." These dips can trigger hunger, fatigue, and mood changes, potentially leading to overeating and making weight management more difficult. To prevent these crashes, nutrition experts recommend "clothing" carbohydrates by pairing them with protein, fiber, and healthy fats, spreading carb intake throughout the day, and eating the protein and fiber portions of a meal first.</p>

Dark surfaces like asphalt and concrete absorb and retain heat, while tall buildings trap warm air and block cooling winds, intensifying heatwaves for city dwellers. Solutions to mitigate this effect include adding more green spaces, installing "cool roofs" that reflect sunlight, and using permeable pavements that enhance water evaporation, all of which can help lower urban temperatures.</p>

          <p>A new study has shed light on the ancient origins of Uralic-speaking peoples by combining genetic, linguistic, and archeological data. Researchers traced a 'genetic dye' to show how these populations migrated from Siberia across Eurasia between 4,000 and 11,000 years ago, spreading as far as the Baltic Sea and East Asia. The findings support the theory that the Ural Mountains region is the ancestral homeland for Uralic languages and show how the ~25 million modern speakers can trace this Siberian ancestry in their DNA.</p>
