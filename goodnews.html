          <p>Amazon reported second-quarter earnings and revenue that surpassed analyst expectations, driven by strong performance in its e-commerce and advertising segments.

The article, from an investment perspective, maintains a positive long-term outlook, citing the strength of high-margin businesses like AWS and advertising and viewing the stock drop as a buying opportunity.

Caballero is a significant acquisition for the Yankees, as he is currently tied for the MLB lead in stolen bases with 34. The move was part of a very active trade deadline for the Yankees.</p>

          <p>In an effort to increase socioeconomic diversity, the UK government will limit its main civil service internship program to students from lower-income backgrounds. The policy change, driven by minister Pat McFadden, aims to make the civil service more reflective of the country it serves. Eligibility will be determined by parental occupation when the student was 14. Successful interns will also be given priority for the Fast Stream graduate program, creating a clearer pathway into civil service careers for underrepresented groups.</p>

          <p>The Los Angeles Dodgers opted for a conservative approach at the MLB trade deadline, making only minor additions to their roster. The team acquired veteran relief pitcher Brock Stewart and outfielder Alex Call, addressing key needs without giving up significant prospect capital. This quiet deadline contrasts with the major moves made by National League rivals like the San Diego Padres and New York Mets. The Dodgers' front office expressed confidence in their current roster, betting on internal improvement and returning players to defend their World Series title.</p>

          <p>Cole's French Dip, a historic Los Angeles restaurant, has postponed its planned closure for 45 days following a massive outpouring of community support. Since announcing it would shut down, the restaurant has seen hours-long lines of customers wanting one last meal. Owner Cedd Moses struck a deal with the landlord to extend service, though he noted the surge in business is likely temporary. Moses is now actively seeking a new buyer who will respect the legacy of Cole's, which claims to be the inventor of the French dip sandwich.</p>

          <p>With the Federal Reserve extending its pause on interest rate cuts, savers with maturing certificates of deposit (CDs) face a decision. This article explains that while rates are on hold, they remain elevated, making it a potentially ideal time to renew a CD or shop for a new one with a high yield. Savers can still find rates over 4% and can lock them in before any future rate cuts occur. It is crucial for account holders to act before their CD's grace period ends to avoid an automatic rollover into a potentially lower-rate account. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>Design software company Figma made a stunning debut on the stock market, with its shares soaring 250% on the first day of trading. The successful IPO has created a massive paper windfall for its early venture capital backers, including Index Ventures, Greylock, Kleiner Perkins, and Sequoia, who collectively hold stock worth around $24 billion. The blockbuster offering is a positive sign for the tech IPO market, which has been sluggish for several years.
