          <p>The Nasdaq stock exchange is planning to implement stricter rules for small Chinese companies seeking to list in the U.S., including a requirement to raise at least $25 million from their public offering. This proposal aims to address concerns over a recent surge in microcap Chinese IPOs that have exhibited volatile "pump and dump" trading patterns, posing risks to investors. The move is seen as a way to enhance market integrity and protect investors from potential manipulation. If approved by the SEC, the new rule would make it significantly more difficult for smaller Chinese firms to go public on the exchange. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>Tiah-Mai Ayton, a 19-year-old boxer from Bristol, has set an ambitious goal to become the youngest undisputed champion in the four-belt era of boxing. With an extensive background in multiple combat sports and only three losses in over 300 fights, Ayton is preparing for her second professional bout. She also aspires to be an undisputed champion in four different weight classes, a feat no boxer has yet achieved. Despite her high-stakes ambitions in the ring, the young fighter, who was signed by Matchroom Boxing, says her personal dream is to buy a farm and live a quiet life.</p>

          <p>The UK's defence secretary has stated that allied nations are prepared to support Ukraine both before any peace negotiations and in securing a final peace agreement. Speaking ahead of a meeting in Paris, he emphasized plans to help ensure the safety of Ukraine's skies, seas, and land once a deal is reached. The statement comes as Russian President Vladimir Putin remains defiant about the ongoing invasion. The UK also highlighted its use of £1 billion in seized Russian assets to provide military aid to Ukraine, reinforcing its commitment to the country's defense.</p>

          <p>French President Emmanuel Macron is hosting a meeting of the "coalition of the willing" to finalize a plan for providing security guarantees to Ukraine after the war. The European-led initiative, which has gained momentum, reportedly includes proposals for deploying European troops to deter future Russian aggression. However, European leaders have stressed that any such plan requires the backing of the United States, which has so far ruled out deploying its own soldiers. The meeting aims to clarify the collective commitments allies can make to ensure Ukraine's long-term security.</p>

          <p>President Trump has reaffirmed his commitment to brokering a peace deal between Russia and Ukraine, stating that while the parties are "not ready yet," he believes "something is going to happen." He acknowledged the difficulty of the negotiations but expressed confidence in his ability to bring the leaders together and facilitate an agreement. His diplomatic approach focuses on direct, real-time negotiations between key leaders, a strategy he claims has been successful in resolving other global conflicts. The comments were made as Russia continues its military attacks on Ukrainian cities.</p>

          <p>Most Asia-Pacific markets registered gains, tracking a positive performance from the U.S. tech sector that lifted the S&P 500 and Nasdaq. Japan's Nikkei 225 saw a significant rise, led by strong performance in technology stocks like SoftBank Group. In contrast, Hong Kong's Hang Seng and mainland China's CSI 300 indexes experienced declines in volatile trading. The market movements occurred as investors continue to monitor global bond markets, where long-term borrowing costs remain under pressure, and await further signals on the global economic health.

          <p>"Martha's Rule," a patient safety initiative allowing families to request an urgent second medical opinion, is being rolled out to all acute hospitals across England. The program was established after a campaign by the parents of Martha Mills, a 13-year-old who died following care failures. A pilot in 143 hospitals has already led to nearly 5,000 calls and 241 interventions described as potentially life-saving. Martha's mother welcomed the expansion, emphasizing that the data proves the need for a more collaborative relationship between doctors and patients to improve care and prevent avoidable harm.</p>

          <p>The Powerball jackpot has surged to an estimated $1.7 billion for the upcoming Saturday drawing after no ticket matched all the winning numbers on Wednesday. This prize would rank as the third-largest in U.S. lottery history, with a cash value of approximately $770.3 million before taxes. The current streak of 41 consecutive drawings without a jackpot winner ties a game record. The continued growth of the jackpot is driving increased ticket sales as hopeful participants vie for the historic prize.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>A survey by the Chicago Council on Global Affairs and The Carter Centre indicates that Chinese public opinion on their nation's global role is more nuanced than often portrayed. While optimistic about China's future, a plurality of respondents (48%) expressed interest in a "shared leadership role" with other nations rather than seeking to replace the U.S. as the sole superpower. This suggests an acceptance of peaceful coexistence, providing potential avenues for reducing US-China tensions. However, the survey's authors caution that the findings may be influenced by self-censorship among respondents.</p>

          <p>A federal judge has overturned the Trump administration's decision to revoke approximately $2 billion in research grants from Harvard University, ruling that the action violated the institution's First Amendment rights. The administration had frozen the funding in April, citing concerns over antisemitism and "radical left" ideologies on campus. While the judge acknowledged that Harvard should have done more to combat antisemitism, she concluded the government's true aim was a targeted, ideologically motivated attack. The White House has announced its intention to appeal the ruling, which represents a significant legal victory for the university.</p>
