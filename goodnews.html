          <p>Nvidia CEO Jensen Huang has sold approximately $36.4 million worth of the company's stock, part of a pre-arranged plan to sell up to six million shares. This transaction follows a similar sale in June and comes as Nvidia's market capitalization surpassed $4 trillion, briefly making it the world's most valuable company. Huang's personal net worth has surged to around $143 billion, placing him in close competition with Warren Buffett for a top spot on global wealth indexes. The sale is a scheduled part of his financial planning, and he still retains a massive holding of over 858 million shares in the AI chipmaking giant. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>Jewel Thais-Williams, the founder of the iconic Los Angeles nightclub Jewel’s Catch One, has died at 86. Her club, opened in 1973, became a vital safe space for the Black and LGBTQ+ communities at a time of widespread discrimination. Beyond nightlife, Thais-Williams was a dedicated activist and healer, particularly during the AIDS crisis, providing food, shelter, and support to those abandoned by their families. She later opened the Village Health Foundation, offering holistic medicine to her community. Remembered as a "warrior" by figures like Rep. Maxine Waters, her legacy is defined by her relentless work to build community and help those in need.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>James Gunn's new "Superman" movie is facing criticism from some circles for being "superwoke," largely due to the director's comments acknowledging the character's immigrant origins. However, the article argues this backlash is overblown, pointing out that Superman has always been an immigrant story about an outsider assimilating and using his powers for good. The film itself reportedly emphasizes that Clark Kent's heroism stems from his all-American upbringing in Kansas, not just his alien heritage. The piece concludes that while the character's story is inherently political, it has rarely been radical, and the current controversy overlooks the long-established themes of the superhero.</p>

          <p>The Japanese government has approved significant upgrades to its disaster defense plan in response to an ongoing and unusually intense earthquake swarm in the Tokara Islands. While officials state this swarm is not a direct precursor, they acknowledge the high probability of a catastrophic Nankai Trough earthquake within the next 30 years. The revised national plan aims to reduce projected fatalities by 80% through infrastructure improvements like higher sea walls and refuge towers. However, experts emphasize that public education on rapid evacuation is even more critical, as the first waves from a Nankai Trough tsunami could arrive in as little as five minutes.</p>
