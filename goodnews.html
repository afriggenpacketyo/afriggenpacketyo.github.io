          <p>Gizmo, the second eaglet of Big Bear eagles Jackie and Shadow, successfully took its first flight from the nest, following in the footsteps of its sister Sunny. After some initial hesitation, Gizmo soared into the air and landed on a nearby tree, marking a significant milestone in its development. Both eaglets, born in March, have been preparing for this moment by practicing wing flapping and branch hopping, and they are expected to remain in the area for one to three months, returning to the nest periodically. Sunny has already been observed visiting the nest for food and rest since her first flight.</p>

          <p>Coco Gauff secured her first French Open singles title by defeating Aryna Sabalenka in a three-set final.

The match featured numerous breaks of serve due to windy conditions, but Gauff maintained her composure to secure the win.

          <p>Charlotte Edwards and Nat Sciver-Brunt began their tenure as head coach and captain of the England women's cricket team with a clean sweep over a depleted West Indies side. While the series win provides a positive start, caution is warranted as England has historically dominated home bilateral series but struggled on the big stage. The team faces tougher tests ahead, including a series against India and the 50-over World Cup in India and Sri Lanka. The article questions whether this series win indicates a genuine change in the team's ability to perform under pressure.</p>
