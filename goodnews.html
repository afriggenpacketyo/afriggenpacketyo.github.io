          <p>A study by Chinese scientists has challenged Darwinian evolution by demonstrating that acquired traits can be inherited without DNA changes. The research, published in Cell, showed that rice plants adapted to cold stress passed on this tolerance to subsequent generations through epigenetic changes. This finding supports Jean-Baptiste Lamarck's theory that organisms can pass on learned survival traits, reigniting the debate between Lamarckism and Darwinism. The study identifies DNA methylation as the mechanism driving cold adaptation in rice, suggesting that epigenetics plays a role in evolution.</p>

          <p>Japan has approved a $6.3 billion spending package to shield its economy from the impact of U.S. tariffs imposed by President Trump. The funds will support small and medium-sized businesses and subsidize household energy costs, addressing concerns about an economic slowdown and rising consumer prices. The automotive sector, a key part of Japan's economy, has already been affected by tariffs on finished automobiles and car parts. The Japanese government is seeking an exemption from these auto tariffs in negotiations with the U.S., though progress has been slow. (not investment advice)</p>

          <h2>Tripadvisor Finds Increase in Fake Reviews in 2024</h2>
          <div class="timestamp">2025-05-27 01:26:15 EDT</div>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Tripadvisor's "Transparency Report 2025" reveals that approximately 8% of the 31.1 million reviews submitted in 2024 were fake. The increase is attributed to more aggressive policies against incentivized reviews and improvements in Tripadvisor's detection systems. The company uses a three-pronged process involving auto-detection, human review, and community feedback to identify and remove fake reviews. Most fake reviews fall into the categories of boosting and member fraud, with paid reviews being a smaller but more pernicious category.</p>
