          <p>Shares of RH, formerly Restoration Hardware, experienced a significant jump in extended trading following the company's announcement that it is taking steps to mitigate the impact of tariffs and maintaining its sales forecast. The luxury furniture retailer anticipates full-year revenue growth of 10% to 13%. To counter higher costs from tariffs, RH is shifting more production out of China, expecting receipts from the country to drop significantly, and plans to open stores internationally, including in Paris. The CEO noted that RH has pressed ahead with plans to open stores in other countries, including one of the most exclusive retail addresses: Paris' Champs √âlys√©es (not investment advice).</p>

        </div>
        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Hay fever sufferers are experiencing particularly severe symptoms this year due to high pollen levels, warm weather conditions, and pollution. Experts recommend a "cocktail approach" of antihistamine tablets or drops, steroid nasal sprays, and eye drops to manage symptoms. Additionally, avoiding triggers, maintaining good hygiene, and regularly cleaning the home can help reduce the impact of hay fever. Long-term, climate change may exacerbate hay fever seasons by lengthening them and increasing pollen concentration.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>The IPO market is experiencing a rebound, with several successful public debuts in June, including Chime, Voyager Technologies, and Circle. This resurgence is encouraging more companies to consider going public, which could boost revenue for investment banking divisions within firms like Goldman Sachs and Wells Fargo. However, geopolitical tensions and unpredictable trade policies could still disrupt the IPO market's momentum. The increase in investment banking diversifies Wells Fargo's revenue streams so the bank is not as reliant on interest-based income (not investment advice).</p>

The stock offering follows President Trump's executive order supporting the development of eVTOL vehicles.

Senator Josh Hawley called the inclusion a "huge step forward" and a victory for those affected by nuclear exposure.
