          <div class="timestamp">2025-08-21 20:20:24 EDT</div>
        </div>
        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Japan's core inflation rate, which excludes fresh food, cooled to 3.1% in July, slightly above economists' expectations of 3% but down from 3.3% in June. This moderation is partly due to the easing of rice prices, which had previously surged. The 'core-core' inflation metric, closely watched by the Bank of Japan as it also excludes energy, held steady at 3.4%. These figures come after the central bank recently raised its inflation forecasts, indicating persistent price pressures within the economy. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>A Texas farmer, Chad Raines, has successfully transitioned from struggling with cotton farming to a profitable venture in solar grazing. By renting out his flock of sheep to manage vegetation at large-scale solar farms, he has created a stable and lucrative business model. This innovative approach allowed him to turn a potential significant financial loss into a nearly $300,000 profit last year. The trend highlights a sustainable synergy between agriculture and renewable energy, offering a lifeline to small and mid-sized farms facing economic hardship.</p>

          <p>The UK government has released new voluntary guidelines for baby food manufacturers, urging them to reduce sugar and salt levels and cease marketing snack products for infants under one year old. The guidance also aims to restrict health claims that lack scientific evidence, which critics say mislead parents. This action follows a BBC investigation that found many popular baby food pouches were high in sugar and lacked key nutrients. Companies have been given 18 months to comply, after which the government may consider alternative measures.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Bill Simon, the former CEO of Walmart U.S., expressed confusion over the company's stock dropping 4.5% despite what he called 'about as good of a quarter as any retailer could have.' Walmart raised its full-year sales and earnings forecast, demonstrating strength by absorbing tariff impacts and growing its topline and margins. Simon suggested investors may have overreacted to a slight earnings miss caused by one-time expenses rather than systemic issues. He believes the retailer's ability to attract and retain shoppers through low prices remains a powerful advantage. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>China is amending its 1998 pricing law to address 'involution,' a term for destructive internal competition characterized by aggressive price wars. The revision, currently open for public feedback, aims to prevent companies from selling products below cost and to foster more sustainable market equilibrium. Industries like solar panel manufacturing have been severely affected by oversupply and loss-making sales due to this intense price competition. The government's move signals a broader effort to stabilize key economic sectors by regulating pricing practices. (not investment advice)</p>
