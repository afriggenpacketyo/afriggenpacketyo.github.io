          <h2>Study Links Increased Screen Time to Socioemotional Problems in Children</h2>
          <div class="timestamp">2025-06-10 15:30:40 EDT</div>
        </div>
        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>A large international study of nearly 300,000 children reveals a two-way link between screen time and emotional well-being. Increased use of devices like TVs, tablets, and gaming consoles is associated with a higher risk of aggression, anxiety, and low self-esteem. Conversely, children with existing social or emotional challenges tend to spend more time on screens. The study emphasizes that while moderate screen time, especially for educational purposes, is not harmful, excessive use can interfere with sleep, physical activity, and social interaction, highlighting the importance of setting limits for children. The findings suggest parents should encourage alternative emotional outlets for their children.</p>

          <p>Photos published in the San Francisco Chronicle depict National Guardsmen deployed to Los Angeles sleeping on floors, raising concerns about their care and housing. California Governor Gavin Newsom posted the photos on social media, criticizing President Trump for treating the troops disrespectfully. A U.S. Northern Command spokesperson responded, stating that the soldiers were resting as they were not currently on mission and that it was too dangerous for them to travel to better accommodations. Los Angeles Mayor Karen Bass emphasized that the unrest is limited to a few blocks in the downtown area, and the soldiers have ready access to food and water.</p>

        </div>
        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>The Ukrainian Air Force (UAF) has reportedly achieved its first air-to-air kill using a Lockheed Martin F-16, shooting down a Russian Sukhoi Su-35S fighter-bomber. The engagement allegedly occurred near Korenevo in the Kursk region of Russia, with support from a Saab 340 airborne early warning and control plane. The F-16, originally from the Netherlands, arrived in Ukraine in August 2024 as part of efforts to modernize the country's aging Soviet-era fleet. This success validates the theory that F-16s can alter the balance of power in the air, making it more difficult for Russia to strike with impunity.</p>

Meanwhile, Wells Fargo is seeing "green shoots" in its investment banking business as its asset cap has been removed, allowing for more flexibility in allocating its balance sheet to capital markets.

          <p>The movie Ballerina, a spin-off "From the World of John Wick," follows Eve Macarro (Ana de Armas) on a quest for vengeance after her father is killed. The film expands the John Wick universe rather than deepening its protagonist. One sequence sees Eve dueling an enemy while each wields flamethrowers; in another, she has to dispatch oncoming aggressors using belts of grenades without blowing herself up. Ballerina ultimately succeeds as a piece of junky fun because it attempts to expand the Wick canon rather than deepen its titular protagonist.</p>

Abrego Garcia's lawyers argue that the Maryland court case is not over, as the government must be held accountable for its previous violations of court orders. The case involves allegations that Abrego Garcia was wrongly deported despite a court order barring his deportation due to fear of persecution.</p>
