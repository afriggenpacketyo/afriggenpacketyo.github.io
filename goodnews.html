          <h2>EU Considers Restricting China's Access to Medical Device Market</h2>
          <div class="timestamp">2025-06-02 08:39:42 EDT</div>
        </div>
        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>European Union member states are expected to vote on restricting Chinese medical device manufacturers' access to the bloc's procurement markets. This action comes in response to China's refusal to open its own tenders to EU firms, marking the first use of the bloc's international procurement instrument (IPI). The European Commission investigation revealed that China unfairly limits access for EU medical device producers to its government contracts, specifically through "Buy China" policies. The EU probe noted that devices were among the 10 designated under the Made in China 2025 program, with targets for domestically produced products to account for half of all those used in county hospitals by 2020, 70 per cent by 2025 and 90 per cent by 2030. </p>

          <p>Japan's revenue from the departure tax, collected from travelers, hit a record high in fiscal year 2024, according to the Finance Ministry.

The government imposes a 1,000 yen International Tourist Tax on each traveler leaving the country. Prime Minister Shigeru Ishiba has indicated a willingness to increase the departure tax amid growing calls to raise funds to promote tourism further and address overcrowding at tourist sites. </p>

          <p>Researchers are investigating whether microbes found in household sludge could offer solutions to environmental challenges, such as carbon dioxide reduction. Scientists at The Two Frontiers Project are partnering with homeowners to collect samples from showerheads, dishwashers, and hot water heaters. They aim to identify extremophiles, microorganisms that thrive in unusual environments, for their potential to capture carbon or clean up hazardous waste. While reducing emissions remains the primary focus, the researchers believe these microbial discoveries could contribute to mitigating climate change. </p>

          <p>Tulsa Mayor Monroe Nichols has proposed a $100 million private trust to provide scholarships and housing assistance to descendants of the 1921 Tulsa race massacre. The plan, framed as a "road to repair" rather than reparations, aims to revitalize the Greenwood district, which was destroyed by a white mob. The private charitable trust would be created with a goal to secure $105m in assets, with most of the funding either secured or committed by 1 June 2026. Nichols said the proposal wouldn‚Äôt require city council approval, although the council would need to authorize the transfer of any city property to the trust, something he said was highly likely. </p>
