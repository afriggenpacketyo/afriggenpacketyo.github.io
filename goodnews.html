        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>The Bank of England (BoE) is anticipated to hold interest rates steady at 4.25% due to rising geopolitical tensions, persistent inflation, and mixed domestic economic data. While the BoE has previously reduced rates four times since August 2024, divisions within the Monetary Policy Committee (MPC) have emerged, influencing expectations of future rate cuts. Despite a recent UK economic contraction and slowing wage growth, inflation remains above the BoE's 2% target, complicating the central bank's policy decisions. Rising oil prices and a strengthening pound further contribute to the complex economic landscape, leading economists to predict a cautious approach with potentially only one more rate cut this year.

          <p>The Federal Reserve is expected to maintain its current interest rate policy, defying calls from President Trump for rate cuts aimed at stimulating the U.S. economy. The Fed's decision reflects a cautious approach as it assesses the impact of tariffs on inflation and employment, guided by its dual mandate. Despite Trump's criticism and pressure to lower rates, Fed Chair Jerome Powell has emphasized the central bank's independence and warned about the potential for tariffs to cause stagflation. Recent data shows easing inflation and steady job growth, but uncertainty persists due to ongoing trade tensions and potential price hikes from tariffs. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>Chocolate prices in the UK have surged at the fastest rate on record in May, contributing to a broader increase in food costs, according to official figures. The main rate of inflation remained at 3.4%, but food prices have risen for three consecutive months, reaching the highest level since February of the previous year. Economists speculate that businesses may be passing on recent increases in employer National Insurance payments to consumers. Chocolate prices have been particularly affected by poor harvests in cocoa-producing regions, with stocks falling to all-time lows. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>Companies are increasingly using "tariff engineering" to navigate higher duties imposed by the U.S. government, involving strategic changes to product materials or dimensions to qualify for lower tariff classifications. This practice, which predates the Trump administration, allows manufacturers to reduce their duty liability by fitting products into different harmonized system codes. Examples include bundling steel and aluminum elements into products to qualify for lower duties or adding minor components to alter product classifications.
