          <p>The U.S. Army successfully conducted its first-ever live-fire test of the new Precision Strike Missile (PrSM) in Australia, demonstrating enhanced long-range capabilities in the Indo-Pacific region. The missile, which has a range of over 300 miles and can hit moving targets, was launched from an Australian-owned HIMARS vehicle. Army Secretary Dan Driscoll stated the test is a key step in deterring regional conflict by providing agile, mobile strike power. This advancement is part of a broader U.S. strategy to bolster its military presence and cooperation with allies amid rising regional tensions.</p>

          <p>Despite rising U.S.-China tensions, Chinese students are still seeking higher education in the United States but are becoming more discerning in their choices. Applicants are now placing greater emphasis on well-known schools, highly-ranked programs, and generous financial aid packages. One student noted that he chose a U.S. university for its academic freedom, despite his family's concerns about instability and his own fears of potential deportation over minor infractions. This trend indicates that while the appeal of an American education remains, students are more carefully weighing the perceived risks and rewards.</p>

          <p>Disgraced former U.S. Representative George Santos has begun serving his seven-year federal prison sentence for wire fraud, identity theft, and other crimes. He reported to the Federal Correctional Institution in Fairton, New Jersey, after pleading guilty to charges that he misused campaign funds for personal luxury expenses and lied to the Federal Election Commission. Santos, who was expelled from Congress in 2023, gained notoriety after an investigation revealed he had fabricated large parts of his resume and personal history. In a final social media post, he wrote, "legends never truly exit."</p>

          <p>Kelsey Pittman, a 33-year-old woman from North Carolina who had been missing for months, has been located alive and safe in Colorado. Her family had reported her missing in November, and concern grew after her car was found abandoned near Death Valley National Park in February. The discovery prompted a large-scale search involving multiple law enforcement agencies, drones, and volunteer crews in the harsh desert terrain of Inyo County, California. The Inyo County Sheriff's Office announced the positive outcome but did not release further details to respect the family's privacy.</p>

          <p>According to the Fire and Rescue Services Association (FRSA), more than 10,000 former retained firefighters across the UK may be missing out on significant pension payments they are now entitled to. Recent legal rulings have made on-call firefighters who served between April 2000 and April 2006 eligible for pensions covering their entire careers. While they must pay back contributions, the final payouts can be worth tens of thousands of pounds. The union is urging anyone who might qualify to contact their former employers to initiate a claim and receive the benefits they earned.</p>

          <p>A Southern California man has been arrested and charged with wire fraud for allegedly conning women he met on dating apps like Tinder and Hinge out of more than $2 million. Federal prosecutors claim Christopher Earl Lloyd, 39, posed as a successful investor between 2021 and 2024 to convince his victims to give him money for fake investment opportunities. He allegedly used false contracts to appear legitimate and spent the victims' money on personal expenses, including a Lexus. If convicted, Lloyd faces a maximum of 20 years in prison for each of the 13 wire fraud counts.</p>

          <p>The U.S. Court of Appeals for the 9th Circuit has ruled that President Trump's executive order aimed at curtailing birthright citizenship is unconstitutional. The court found the order invalid because it contradicts the plain language of the Fourteenth Amendment, which grants citizenship to "all persons born in the United States." The policy sought to deny automatic citizenship to children of undocumented immigrants or those on temporary visas. While the order is already on hold due to lower court rulings, this decision marks a significant appellate-level judgment on the merits of the case.</p>
