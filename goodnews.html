          <div class="timestamp">2025-07-11 14:54:59 EDT</div>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>The U.S. government recorded a rare budget surplus of $27 billion in June, a significant shift from the previous month's deficit. This unexpected surplus was largely fueled by a substantial increase in customs duties, which surged over 300% compared to the previous year following new tariffs. Despite this monthly gain, the fiscal year-to-date deficit remains high at $1.34 trillion, with net interest on the national debt continuing to be a major expense. The figures highlight the immediate fiscal impact of the administration's trade policies. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>Chemical manufacturer DuPont has agreed to a $27 million settlement in a class-action lawsuit concerning the PFOA contamination of the water supply in Hoosick Falls, New York. This agreement resolves DuPont's role as the final defendant in a case that has now secured over $90 million for residents from multiple companies, including 3M and Honeywell. The lawsuit alleged that a local facility using Teflon materials contaminated drinking water with "forever chemicals" linked to serious illnesses. The settlement also includes $6 million for an ongoing medical monitoring program for affected residents.</p>

          <p>Amid concerns about Social Security's long-term solvency and potential benefit reductions, seniors are exploring ways to secure additional income. A recent article highlights three potential strategies: reverse mortgages, annuities, and personal loans. A reverse mortgage allows homeowners aged 62 and older to receive payments from their home equity, while an annuity provides guaranteed lifetime payments in exchange for a lump-sum investment. Although less ideal due to interest costs, a personal loan can also serve as a crucial financial backstop for immediate needs. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>Ovidio Guzman Lopez, a son of the infamous drug lord Joaquin "El Chapo" Guzman, has pleaded guilty to drug trafficking and criminal enterprise charges in a U.S. federal court. Prosecutors allege that he and his brother led the "Los Chapitos" faction of the Sinaloa cartel, overseeing a massive and violent fentanyl trafficking operation. As part of his plea agreement, Guzman Lopez must provide "substantial assistance" to the government in exchange for a potential sentence of less than life in prison. He was extradited to the U.S. in 2023 after his arrest in Mexico.</p>

          <p>The current season of "Love Island USA" is a ratings phenomenon but has been criticized by viewers for a notable lack of genuine romance. This article suggests the show serves as an insightful portrait of Gen Z dating culture, characterized by emotional guardedness and a fear of appearing overeager. Many contestants, who came of age during the pandemic, have limited real-world relationship experience, leading to "situationships" rather than deep connections. The season's fan favorites are ironically the islanders who defy this trend by openly expressing their strong emotions, resonating with viewers who may also struggle with romantic vulnerability.</p>

          <p>The new "Superman" movie, the first theatrical release under the new DC Studios leadership of James Gunn and Peter Safran, has started strong at the box office. The film earned $22.5 million in Thursday night previews, marking one of the best preview performances ever for a DC film. It is now projected to gross between $130 million and $140 million during its opening weekend. This robust start is seen as a crucial test for the studio's 10-year plan to reinvigorate its superhero franchises, and strong critical reviews suggest it may succeed.</p>

          <p>The widely adopted fitness goal of walking 10,000 steps per day originated not from scientific research but from a 1960s Japanese marketing campaign for a pedometer. While the number was initially arbitrary, subsequent research has shown it is a reasonably effective benchmark for health. Studies indicate that health benefits, such as reduced cardiovascular risk, can begin at lower step counts, around 2,500 to 3,000 per day, and may plateau near 7,500 steps. Experts agree that while 10,000 is a good target, the most important thing is to be more active than you currently are.</p>

          <p>For individuals with low incomes struggling under the weight of debt, several relief options can provide a path to financial stability. An article details four key strategies: credit counseling, credit card debt forgiveness, hardship programs, and bankruptcy. Credit counseling can help create a manageable payment plan, while debt forgiveness involves negotiating a lower lump-sum settlement with creditors. Hardship programs offered by lenders can provide temporary relief, and for overwhelming debt, Chapter 7 or Chapter 13 bankruptcy can offer legal protection and a chance for a fresh start.
