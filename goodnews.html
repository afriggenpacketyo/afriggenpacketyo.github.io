        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Democrat Zohran Mamdani has challenged President Trump to a debate in New York City after independent candidate Andrew Cuomo called for a series of debates in the mayoral race. Mamdani's challenge came after Cuomo challenged Mamdani to five debates across the boroughs. Mamdani proposed debating Trump directly, questioning his policies on SNAP benefits and tax cuts. Trump criticized Mamdani's politics and expressed a desire for a one-on-one race, while Cuomo insisted Mamdani fears a race against him. The mayoral race is a hot topic, with Adams and Sliwa dismissing calls to drop out and businessman John Catsimatidis predicting changes before the end of September. The optimism score reflects the uncertainty and political maneuvering in the race.</p>

          <div class="timestamp">2025-09-04 23:16:16 EDT</div>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>President Trump finalized a trade deal with Japan, implementing 15% tariffs on most Japanese goods, including autos. Tokyo agreed to invest $550 billion in U.S.-selected projects and increase purchases of American agricultural products, commercial aircraft, and defense equipment. The deal includes Japan purchasing 100 Boeing planes, increasing U.S. rice imports by 75%, and buying $8 billion in agricultural products. The U.S. will apply a baseline 15% tariff on nearly all Japanese imports, with sector-specific levies for automobiles, aerospace products, pharmaceuticals, and natural resources. The finalizing of the deal comes as Japan's Prime Minister Shigeru Ishiba faces political pressure, with reports suggesting key LDP members may resign. The optimism score reflects the economic implications and political uncertainty.</p>

          <p>President Trump warned of "fairly substantial" tariffs on semiconductor imports from companies not shifting production to the U.S., while signaling exemptions for firms like Apple that expand domestic investments. Trump discussed the tariffs during a White House dinner with tech leaders, including Apple CEO Tim Cook and Meta's Mark Zuckerberg. He had previously mentioned a 100% tariff on semiconductor imports, with exemptions for companies moving manufacturing to the U.S. Apple had pledged to spend an additional $100 billion on domestic manufacturing, adding to a $500 billion announcement in February. The U.S. has been working to onshore its semiconductor supply chain, with companies like TSMC and Samsung committing billions to building plants in the U.S. The optimism score considers the potential economic impacts and incentives for domestic investment.</p>

          <p>Justice Amy Coney Barrett defended her stern words for Justice Ketanji Brown Jackson in a recent opinion, stating they were appropriate. Speaking at the Lincoln Center in Manhattan, Barrett said she felt she "set the calibration right" in the majority opinion on universal injunctions. She explained that Justice Jackson had made an argument in strong terms that warranted a response, emphasizing that she has the "deepest respect for Jackson" and was not attacking her personally. Barrett stressed that she attacks ideas, not people, attributing the quote to the late Justice Antonin Scalia. The optimism score is neutral, reflecting the judicial discourse and emphasis on respectful disagreement.</p>

          <p>A recent study by Lightcast found a surge in demand for AI skills in the labor market, with employers willing to pay higher salaries for jobs requiring them. Job postings that mentioned at least one AI skill advertised salaries 28% higher on average than those that listed none, representing roughly $18,000 more per year. The study identified over 300 AI skills, ranging from AI ethics and generative AI to machine learning. Demand for AI skills was higher in non-tech sectors than in IT and computer science, with marketing and public relations coming in second place. The optimism score reflects the potential for economic growth and career opportunities driven by AI.</p>

          <p>Defending champion Aryna Sabalenka fought back from a set down to beat Jessica Pegula and reach her third straight US Open final. In a repeat of last year's showpiece, Pegula initially took the lead, but Sabalenka staged a steely comeback to win 4-6, 6-3, 6-4. Sabalenka, who has yet to win a major title in 2025, has now reached six successive finals at the hard-court Grand Slams. She will face either Naomi Osaka or Amanda Anisimova in Saturday's showpiece. The optimism score is high, reflecting Sabalenka's resilience and her chance to defend her title.</p>

          <p>A US lawyer named Mark S Zuckerberg is suing Facebook for repeatedly suspending his account, falsely accusing him of "impersonating a celebrity." Zuckerberg says his account has been disabled five times over the past eight years, costing him thousands of dollars in lost business. His lawsuit argues that Meta is in breach of contract because he paid $11,000 for advertising that was improperly taken down. Facebook has reinstated the lawyer's account and is taking steps to prevent the mistake from recurring. The optimism score is moderate, reflecting the resolution of the issue and the lawyer's persistence.</p>

          <p>Palo Alto Networks CEO Nikesh Arora suggested that enterprises may not be comfortable with browsers run by agentic artificial intelligence. Arora stated that unless controls are built into agentic browsers, oriented around credentials and enterprise security, they won't be allowed in enterprises in 24 months. He noted that companies would be wary of the AI agents' autonomy. Arora mentioned his company's plans to buy CyberArk, an Israeli identity security provider, to address credential theft.

          <p>A US federal appeals court upheld an injunction barring the US State Department from enforcing a policy directive from President Trump aimed to prevent transgender and nonbinary Americans from obtaining passports that accurately reflect their gender identities. The court said the government failed to meaningfully engage with the conclusion that Trump's policy reflected "unconstitutional animus toward transgender Americans." The American Civil Liberties Union sued, arguing that the policy unlawfully prevented transgender, nonbinary and intersex people from obtaining passports consistent with their gender identities. The optimism score is high, reflecting the court's decision to protect the rights of transgender individuals.</p>
