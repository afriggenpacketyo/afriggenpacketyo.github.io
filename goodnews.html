          <p>The New York Knicks mounted a stunning comeback from a 20-point deficit to defeat the Boston Celtics 108-105 in overtime in Game 1 of their Eastern Conference semi-finals series. Jalen Brunson and OG Anunoby each scored 29 points for the Knicks, while Mikal Bridges sealed the win with a steal in the final second. The Celtics struggled with their three-point shooting, missing a playoff-record 45 attempts, and Kristaps Porzingis played limited minutes due to illness, contributing to the Knicks' victory in a hard-fought contest.</p>

          <p>Columbia student activist Mohsen Mahdawi, a green card holder, spoke out in his first network interview since being detained during a citizenship interview. CBS News reports that Mahdawi, who helped lead Columbia's protests against the Israel-Hamas war, was detained under a rarely used law allowing the government to revoke visas for people deemed to pose "adverse foreign policy consequences." Mahdawi stated that he is not afraid and will continue to advocate for justice and peace. He sued for his release, arguing the move violated his First Amendment rights, and a judge ordered his release, though the case remains open.</p>

          <p>Texas Governor Greg Abbott has signed a $1 billion school choice bill into law, allowing taxpayer money to be used to help qualifying students pay for private school tuition, according to CBS News. The bill provides $10,000 per year for most students attending accredited private schools, up to $30,000 per year for students with disabilities, and $2,000 a year for home-schooled students. Democrats argue that the legislation hurts public schools by diverting funds to private institutions, primarily benefiting wealthier families already enrolled in private education.</p>

          <p>Elon Musk's SpaceX rocket facility in South Texas is on its way to becoming an official city named Starbase, according to CBS News. A vote to formally organize Starbase as a city was approved by a small group of voters, mostly Musk's employees at SpaceX. The creation of an official company town has drawn criticism from those who worry it will expand Musk's control over the area, potentially impacting public access to a popular beach and state park for launches. The new city is expected to manage roads, utilities, schooling, and medical care for its residents.</p>
