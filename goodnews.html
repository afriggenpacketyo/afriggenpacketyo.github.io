          <p>Elon Musk stated on the X platform that he regrets some of his recent social media posts about President Donald Trump, which he felt "went too far." This public dispute with his former ally had fueled market concerns over Tesla and SpaceX. The conflict stemmed from Musk's opposition to Trump's "One Big Beautiful Bill Act," which Musk claimed would undermine the Department of Government Efficiency (DOGE) and increase the U.S. budget deficit. Musk had deleted some posts, including one accusing Trump of being mentioned in Jeffrey Epstein's "files," which the White House disputed. The optimism score reflects the resolution of a potentially damaging public feud. </p>

          <p>China is advocating for civil aviation, specifically the certification of its domestically produced C919 aircraft, to be a key discussion point at the upcoming summit with European Union leaders in July.
