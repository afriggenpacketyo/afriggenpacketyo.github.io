          <div class="timestamp">2025-05-20 08:07:27 EDT</div>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Contemporary Amperex Technology Ltd. (CATL), the world's largest electric car battery maker, restricted onshore U.S. investors from participating in its Hong Kong share sale due to escalating tensions between the United States and China. This move marks a significant shift from a decade prior when Chinese companies like Alibaba actively sought U.S. investment. The decision reflects growing concerns over national security and financial decoupling, with potential implications for other Chinese technology companies. CATL, which supplies batteries to major automakers like GM and Tesla, aims to use the raised funds for European expansion, even as it faces political scrutiny in the U.S. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>Home Depot CFO Richard McPhail stated that the company does not plan to raise prices due to tariffs, citing its scale, supplier partnerships, and productivity improvements. This strategy contrasts with Walmart's plan to increase prices to offset tariff costs. Home Depot has diversified its import sources to reduce reliance on China, aiming to have no single country outside the U.S. represent more than 10% of its purchases by next year. While the company missed first-quarter earnings expectations, it beat sales estimates and maintained its full-year sales forecast, contingent on current tariff agreements.</p>

          <p>Christopher Thuss, a fisherman, discovered the J.C. Ames, a tugboat built in 1881, in Lake Michigan near Manitowoc, Wisconsin. The Wisconsin Historical Society confirmed the discovery, noting the ship was intentionally sunk in 1923 after becoming obsolete. Maritime archaeologist Tamara Thomsen highlighted the significance of such discoveries in resurfacing lost history and noted the ship was once one of the largest and most powerful tugs on the lakes. The ship was dismantled and burned before being abandoned, a common practice at the time, and the discovery was made possible due to favorable weather conditions.</p>

          <h2>UK Ministers Consider Reversing Winter Fuel Payment Cuts Amid Political Pressure</h2>
          <div class="timestamp">2025-05-20 07:49:17 EDT</div>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Senior government officials in the UK are discussing the possibility of reversing cuts to winter fuel payments for millions of pensioners. Chancellor Rachel Reeves restricted eligibility for the pension top-up last year, impacting over nine million pensioners. Discussions include changing the income threshold for eligibility or restoring payments to all pensioners. The policy change, one of Labour's first decisions upon entering office, is under review due to concerns about its political impact, especially after recent local election losses.</p>

          <p>New York Mets manager Carlos Mendoza plans to speak with Juan Soto about his effort level after the slugger didn't run hard out of the batter's box on two plays in consecutive games. In a recent game against the Red Sox, Soto watched a potential home run bounce off the Green Monster for a single, and he was also slow out of the box on a groundout against the Yankees. Despite Soto's claim that he has been hustling, Mendoza emphasized the importance of running hard in all situations and will address the issue with the star outfielder.</p>

          <p>Scientists have discovered a 500-million-year-old fossil of a three-eyed predator, named Mosura fentoni, in Canada's Burgess Shale. The species, resembling the fictional Mothra, was small, had spiny claws, and a unique segmented abdomen. Mosura belonged to an extinct group of arthropods called radiodonts and is considered "unlike any living animal." The discovery sheds light on the early evolution of arthropods and their adaptation to various habitats.</p>

          <p>Chinese scientists have traced the ancestor of animals and plants to a hydrogen-metabolizing cell that existed before the Great Oxidation Event, a pivotal period in Earth's history. The study suggests that the last common ancestor of eukaryotes lived around 2.72 billion years ago under oxygen-deficient conditions. This finding supports the hydrogen hypothesis for the origin of eukaryotes, challenging previous findings. Understanding the origins of eukaryogenesis could provide insights into the evolution of life and the potential for complex life elsewhere in the universe.</p>
