          <p>Rumeysa Ozturk, a Turkish doctoral candidate at Tufts University, has returned to Massachusetts after being detained by Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE) for six weeks. A federal judge ordered her release after determining that her due process and First Amendment rights were potentially violated, as the Trump administration appeared to base her detainment on an op-ed she co-authored criticizing Israel's war with Hamas. Ozturk, who experienced worsening asthma attacks during her detention, expressed gratitude for the support she received and urged people not to forget other women in immigration detention centers. Massachusetts lawmakers and Tufts University officials celebrated her release and looked forward to welcoming her back to campus.</p>

          <p>Starbucks and Luckin Coffee are experiencing renewed growth in China by expanding into lower-tier cities, where they are attracting new customers despite intense price competition. Starbucks' China operations saw flat same-store sales, but a 4% increase in transactions offset a decline in average spending. The company has added 665 stores in China over the past year, covering more than 1,000 county-level markets. This shift towards smaller cities reflects a broader trend of coffee shop growth in second and "new first-tier cities" across China, indicating a strategic adaptation to changing consumer preferences and market dynamics.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>As global trade tensions rise, Chinese consumers are increasingly choosing domestic brands as a way to express national pride and support local innovation. This shift is driven by a desire to strengthen China's internal economy and celebrate its cultural identity on the global stage. Younger generations, in particular, view domestic brands as markers of creative ambition and resilience. This trend underscores a broader transition towards a consumption-driven economy that is less reliant on exports and more focused on fostering domestic growth and cultural confidence.</p>

          <p>New Orleans Saints quarterback Derek Carr is retiring from the NFL due to a labral tear in his right shoulder and "significant degenerative changes" to his rotator cuff.

          <p>An atmospheric river event is forecast to bring widespread rainfall to the Southeastern United States, potentially resulting in 4 to 6 inches of rain and isolated spots seeing up to 12 inches. The National Weather Service has warned of possible flooding, particularly in Florida, Tennessee, Georgia, South Carolina, and North Carolina. While atmospheric rivers typically originate from the Gulf of Mexico or the Caribbean and land in the Western U.S., this event is being diverted eastward due to a "cutoff low," potentially alleviating drought conditions in certain areas while also posing a flooding risk.</p>

          <p>U.S. and Chinese officials met in Switzerland for prolonged negotiations over tariffs, with President Trump claiming "great progress" and a "total reset." The talks, aimed at de-escalating trade tensions, involved Treasury Secretary Scott Bessent and Chinese Vice Premier He Lifeng. Trump suggested lowering tariffs on China to 80%, while Chinese officials have called for the U.S. to drop its "unilateral" tariffs first. The outcome of these talks could significantly impact the global economy.</p>
