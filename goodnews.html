          <p>Chinese scientists have traced the origins of the "ghost ancestors" of modern Tibetans to Yunnan province through ancient DNA analysis. The study, published in Science, verifies the hypothesis that an archaeological site in central Yunnan is one of the origins of Tibetan Plateau populations. Scientists analyzed ancient DNA to understand the origins of the 20% of the Tibetan genetic composition that is not linked to northern Chinese populations. The study fills a critical gap in the genetic data of prehistoric populations in East and Southeast Asia.</p>

          <p>Top Wall Street analysts are recommending dividend stocks, such as Home Depot and Diamondback Energy, for investors seeking consistent returns amid market volatility. Home Depot reported mixed results for Q1 2025 but reaffirmed its full-year guidance and declared a dividend of $2.30 per share. Diamondback Energy reduced its full-year activity to maximize free cash flow generation but returned $864 million to shareholders through stock repurchases and dividends. These analysts' recommendations are based on in-depth analysis of the companies' financials and ability to pay dividends. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>Germany is experiencing severe storms in several states, while national police chief Dieter Romann has given a positive assessment of tightened border controls. Romann dismissed concerns about overburdened personnel, stating that the Federal Police should be able to manage with the current number of officers. Border controls have been reinforced with nearly 1,200 colleagues since September 2024. Romann also rejected the assumption that personnel would be withdrawn from other operational areas for border controls.</p>

          <p>Theoharis and Sandweiss-Back argue that amidst Trump's proposed legislative cuts, it's time to fight for a new social contract that uplifts those at the bottom of society. Drawing insights from past poor people's movements, they emphasize the need for greater discipline, sacrifice, perseverance, and patience. They highlight the welfare rights movement of the 1960s and 1970s, particularly the National Welfare Rights Organization (NWRO), as an example of effective grassroots organizing. The authors propose four strategic principles for harnessing the transformational power of poor and dispossessed people.</p>

Universities, often torn by internal strife, now find common ground in resisting federal intervention. Success in repelling this intervention requires sustaining unity, which means accepting that one need not hold every cause in common to make common cause. Broad campus constituencies want their universities to withstand federal pressure and see federal government intervention as an improper intrusion.</p>

Buckley was the architect of the modern conservative movement, author of 50 books, and a pioneer in media with his TV program Firing Line. He also discovered talented young writers for National Review. Buckley's conservatism was rooted in his upbringing, Catholicism, and intellectual influences like Albert Jay Nock and Jos√© Ortega y Gasset.
