          <h2>Suffolk County, NY, Enacts Law to Penalize Convicted Animal Abusers Who Own Pets</h2>
          <div class="timestamp">2025-05-12 03:07:29 EDT</div>
        </div>
        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Suffolk County, New York, has strengthened its animal cruelty laws by making it a crime for convicted animal abusers to own pets. The new law establishes a Class A misdemeanor, punishable by up to a year in jail or a $1,000 fine, for those on the county's convicted animal abuser registry who are found to own pets. This expands upon a 2010 law that created the registry, requiring convicted abusers to register their information. The legislation aims to close a loophole by providing penalties for violating the existing prohibition on pet ownership for convicted abusers, ensuring consequences for those who disregard the law and further protecting animals in the county. The expanded law comes after dozens of dead cats were found in a Long Island home, highlighting the need for stronger animal protection measures.</p>

          <p>Rory McIlroy is considered a strong favorite to win the US PGA Championship at Quail Hollow, a course where he has enjoyed considerable success. McIlroy has won multiple times at Quail Hollow, including victories in 2021 and 2024, and feels comfortable with the course's layout and conditions. The course setup for the PGA Championship is expected to be more challenging than usual, with longer rough and softened slopes on the greens. McIlroy's confidence is high, and he has positive memories at the venue, making him a top contender for the major championship, with weather forecasts predicting a soft golf course to put an even greater premium on length off the tee.</p>

          <p>A student-led movement in Serbia is challenging the increasingly autocratic rule of President Aleksandar Vucic, marking a significant shift in the country's political landscape. Sparked by a train station collapse in Novi Sad that killed 16 people due to suspected corruption, the protests have grown into the largest and most extensive movement in Serbia to date. The movement is characterized by solidarity and inclusion, demonstrated when Muslim students from Novi Pazar relieved Orthodox Christian protesters blocking the national broadcaster over Easter. Despite government attempts to undermine the protests, including offering loans to young people and inducing the prime minister to resign, the movement continues to gain momentum, calling for early elections.</p>

          <p>The Kurdistan Workers‚Äô Party (PKK), a Kurdish militant group, has announced its decision to disband and disarm as part of a new peace initiative with Turkey, marking a potential end to a four-decade-long armed conflict. The announcement, made by the Firat News Agency, follows calls from imprisoned PKK leader Abdullah Ocalan to convene a congress and formally decide to disband. The PKK had led an armed insurgency since 1984, resulting in tens of thousands of lives lost. The group stated that its struggle had achieved its historical mission of bringing the Kurdish issue to a point of resolution through democratic politics.</p>

          <p>Shipping companies will need to adapt to evolving trade barriers resulting from ongoing trade disputes between global powers, according to the head of the International Chamber of Shipping. The industry, known for its resilience, will adjust to market changes due to the mobility of ships. The US Trade Representative announced new fees targeting Chinese vessels, aiming to re-establish the US shipbuilding industry and enhance national security. These fees, set to take effect in mid-October, include charges per net tonne for vessels owned or operated by companies in mainland China, Hong Kong, or Macau, as well as fees for Chinese-built vessels entering US ports.</p>

          <p>Sugar overconsumption can trigger addiction-like behaviors by altering neuronal pathways in the brain, impacting dopamine signaling and stress-related pathways. While it's debated whether sugar is truly addictive, its overconsumption is linked to serious health issues like diabetes, obesity, and cardiovascular diseases, and even neurological disorders. Emotional stress and challenging early life experiences can contribute to sugar cravings and potential addiction, making it essential to understand these patterns. Strategies to quit sugar addiction include behavioral interventions like cognitive-behavioral therapy and nutritional strategies like gradually reducing added sugars and increasing protein and fiber intake. Governments should also increase the availability of healthy food and decrease the excessive publicity of ultra-processed foods.</p>

          <p>Kenbishi, Japan's oldest sake brand, remains steadfast in its commitment to traditional brewing methods despite the sake industry facing declining domestic consumption. Brewing takes place during the winter season, with 60 brewers staying onsite for six months, consuming around 1,500 bottles of sake, as tradition is everything. Kenbishi uses traditional wooden equipment, like the "dakidaru," to maintain essential temperatures, arguing that only wood can ensure the unchanging taste of its sake. While many seek to capitalize on growing interest in sake overseas, Kenbishi sees the UNESCO heritage listing of traditional sake-brewing techniques as an opportunity for people in Japan to rediscover sake.</p>

China has become a significant purchaser of resources from Latin America, while Chinese products have filled markets in the region, and investments have funded infrastructure projects. However, Latin American countries are also wary of becoming dumping grounds for cheap Chinese goods, leading to increased tariffs on certain products.</p>

However, analysts emphasize that the US is under political pressure to show wins, while China views negotiations as a strategic process to manage bilateral competition and economic resilience.

          <p>Financial markets and businesses are awaiting further details following trade talks between the United States and China, with differing initial framings of the outcome creating uncertainty. While the U.S. Trade Representative described the talks as resulting in a "deal," the Chinese vice premier for economic policy expressed optimism but stopped short of declaring a done deal. Treasury Secretary Scott Bessent noted "substantial progress," but a joint statement from both countries is expected to clarify the details. Despite the apparent progress, concerns remain about whether tariffs will be significantly reduced, and Chinese factories are already feeling the impact of the trade slowdown.</p>

          <p>Wildlife experts are exploring the possibility of reintroducing elk to the East Midlands and the UK for the first time in approximately 3,000 years. The Nottinghamshire and Derbyshire Wildlife Trusts have secured funding to begin feasibility studies into their return, as elk are considered "keystone" species that can create and maintain habitats for diverse other species. The funding will support a disease risk assessment to determine whether reintroduced elk would pose any risks to existing livestock. A major challenge is gaining public acceptance of the idea that elk "should be here.</p>

Ramsay was elected as co-leader with Carla Denyer in 2021, but Denyer announced on Thursday that she would not be standing when the posts are re-elected later this year. Nominations for the leadership open on 2 June, with party members voting throughout August before the results are announced on 2 September.</p>

          <p>Hamas has announced it will release Israeli-American hostage Edan Alexander, who is believed to be the last living captive with US nationality in Gaza, as part of efforts to reach a ceasefire agreement. The decision comes ahead of President Donald Trump's visit to the Middle East on Tuesday. Hamas said it was also intended to facilitate a deal for the entry of humanitarian aid. Gaza has been under an Israeli blockade for 70 days. Earlier a senior Hamas official told the BBC that the Palestinian armed group was holding direct negotiations with a US administration official in Qatar.</p>
