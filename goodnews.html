          <p>Following his meeting with Russian President Vladimir Putin, former President Donald Trump shared several key takeaways in an exclusive interview. He stated that while significant progress was made, "there’s no deal until there’s a deal," declining to specify the main sticking points. Trump suggested that the next steps are up to Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy and European nations, and advised Zelenskyy to "make a deal." He also rated the meeting a "10" for rapport and reiterated his belief that the war would not have occurred under his presidency.</p>

          <p>Following a federal court hearing, the Justice Department has agreed to scale back the Trump administration's takeover of the Washington, D.C. police force. D.C. Police Chief Pamela Smith will remain in command, and a directive from Attorney General Pam Bondi that named a DEA administrator as emergency police chief will be rewritten. The resolution came after D.C. filed a lawsuit arguing the move was an illegal overreach of federal power under the Home Rule Act. U.S. District Judge Ana Reyes expressed skepticism about the administration's legal authority to assume full operational control of the local police department.</p>

          <p>The city of San José has announced the completion of California's first accessory dwelling unit (ADU) condominium, which can be legally sold as a separate property from the main house. This development comes a year after the city enacted laws to allow such sales, aiming to create a new form of affordable homeownership. Officials hope this model of for-sale ADUs could serve as a new generation of starter homes, helping to address the state's severe housing crisis. ADUs have become a significant part of California's housing growth, accounting for about one-fifth of new housing in 2024.</p>

Gabriel, the former renowned conductor of the U.S. Air Force Band, was unable to travel due to his health but fulfilled his commitment by conducting the Illinois-based band remotely. The unique contract was drawn up in the early 2000s by the band's current conductor, Bruce Moss, as a testament to Gabriel's vitality. Gabriel stated that keeping one's word is a bond, successfully leading the band one last time.</p>

          <p>A new report indicates that the exposed shoreline of the shrinking Salton Sea is responsible for less than 1% of the small particle air pollution in California's Coachella and Imperial valleys. For years, dust control projects have focused on the lakebed to combat high rates of asthma and respiratory illness in the region. Researchers now suggest that since pollution sources are so diverse—including agriculture, diesel exhaust, and unpaved roads—efforts should pivot towards protecting people indoors. This could involve distributing air filters and weatherizing homes, a shift from source control to exposure control to more effectively improve public health.</p>

          <h2>New Indian Studies Suggest Mangoes May Not Adversely Affect Blood Sugar in Diabetics</h2>

          <p>Two new clinical trials from India are challenging the conventional wisdom that people with diabetes must avoid mangoes, suggesting the fruit may actually improve metabolic health when consumed in moderation. One pilot study found that three popular Indian mango varieties produced a lower glycemic response than white bread. A separate eight-week trial showed that adults with type 2 diabetes who replaced breakfast bread with 250g of mango experienced improvements in fasting glucose, insulin resistance, and other key health markers. Researchers emphasize that the findings are not a license for unlimited consumption but indicate that mangoes can be part of a controlled, healthy diet.</p>

          <p>A new mural in Redondo Beach, California, features an iconic image of the late Kobe Bryant, but with a notable alteration: his Lakers jersey has been replaced with a Dodgers jersey to celebrate the baseball team's 2024 World Series win. The artwork, part of a larger mural by artist Gustavo Zermeño Jr., shows Bryant in his famous celebratory pose but wearing a white No. 24 jersey with "Dodgers" in blue script. The artist explained the change was intended to fit the mural's theme while still honoring Bryant's "Mamba mentality." The creative choice has generated mixed reactions and online discussion, which the artist sees as a positive way to spark conversation.</p>

          <p>At a commemoration for the 80th anniversary of VJ Day, 104-year-old WWII veteran Captain Yavar Abbas delivered an emotional, off-script tribute to King Charles III, who is currently undergoing cancer treatment. Capt. Abbas, who served as a combat cameraman in the British Indian Army, saluted the "brave King," causing both the King and Queen Camilla to become visibly emotional. Born in 1920, Abbas shared his extraordinary journey, from detesting British imperialism to enlisting to fight fascism and filming key battles in the Burma campaign. He now views war as a crime, stating that humanity seems to have learned nothing from past conflicts.</p>

          <p>The fashion brand Topshop is planning a major comeback, with its managing director confirming the return of standalone stores to the UK High Street. The relaunch is being kicked off with the brand's first catwalk show in seven years, signaling a renewed ambition after its collapse in 2020. After its owner, Arcadia, went into administration, Topshop was bought by online retailer Asos. Industry experts note that while millennial nostalgia for the brand is strong, its success will depend on attracting a new generation of shoppers and recapturing the "cool" factor that once made it a fashion powerhouse.</p>

          <p>The global bubble tea market, driven by Chinese chains like Mixue Group, is expanding rapidly and attracting significant investor interest, with several companies recently listing in Hong Kong. The industry's growth is fueled by a franchise-heavy model that allows for quick expansion, with Mixue now operating more stores than McDonald's or Starbucks. However, the sector faces challenges including market saturation, intense price wars, and the difficulty of maintaining quality control across thousands of franchised outlets. The long-term success of these brands will depend on their ability to balance rapid scale with profitability and prove they are a lasting consumer trend. (not investment advice)</p>

After a prolonged downturn caused by inflation and rising interest rates, Wall Street is seeing a "very healthy list" of companies preparing to go public in the latter half of the year. This revival is supported by a strong performance in the Nasdaq and a more favorable regulatory outlook. However, some analysts caution that the exuberant first-day pops could be a sign of an overheating market reminiscent of the dot-com era. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>Slate Automotive, an electric vehicle startup backed by Jeff Bezos, is promoting a minimalist, customizable pickup truck with a target price well below the U.S. average. The company's strategy is to produce a simple, two-seat base model and allow owners to add features and accessories, including a kit to convert it into an SUV. The company's main selling point is its low price, which it claims will remain compelling even after federal EV tax credits expire. However, analysts question whether the barebones truck can compete with other vehicles in the sub-$30,000 price range, such as the Ford Maverick. (not investment advice)</p>
