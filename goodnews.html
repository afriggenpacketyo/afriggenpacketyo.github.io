          <h2>New Bill Could Impose Additional Jail Time for Criminals Who Skip Sentencing</h2>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>A new bill is being introduced to Parliament in England and Wales that would allow judges to impose an additional two years in prison for criminals who refuse to attend their sentencing hearings. The bill aims to prevent offenders from avoiding the consequences of their actions and provides a moment of recognition and reparation for victims' families. The families of Sabina Nessa, Zara Aleena, and Jan Mustafa, whose killers did not attend sentencing, have campaigned for the change in the law. Justice Minister Alex Davies-Jones thanked the families for their tireless efforts to ensure criminals face their victims.</p>

          <p>The fire-ravaged Tahitian Terrace mobile home park in Pacific Palisades is now eligible for a federally funded debris removal program, offering hope to residents facing uncertainty about rebuilding their community. The mobile home park, largely destroyed in the January 7 Palisades fire, will be included in Phase 2 of the cleanup, conducted by the U.S. Army Corps of Engineers. FEMA has determined that the property presents unique public health risks due to asbestos and the steep, fire-damaged hillside overlooking Pacific Coast Highway, while citing the park owners' limited financial capacity as a factor.</p>

          <p>China's central bank and financial regulators announced a series of measures to stimulate economic growth amid ongoing trade tensions. The plans include cutting key interest rates, lowering the reserve requirement ratio for banks, and establishing a relending tool for consumption and elderly care. These actions signal a more urgent approach to bolstering the economy, with the central bank indicating it has sufficient policy firepower to use when appropriate. The announcement comes as Chinese Vice Premier He Lifeng prepares to hold trade talks with U.S. Treasury Secretary Scott Bessent in Switzerland.</p>

Cities are stepping up efforts to attract tourists through various means, including social media and virtual reality experiences. The rise in tourism suggests that consumer sentiment remains resilient, with travel being a priority for many Chinese consumers. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>President Trump plans to announce that the U.S. will refer to the Persian Gulf as the Arabian Gulf, aligning with the preference of Arab nations. The move, expected during Trump's trip to Saudi Arabia, has become an emotive issue for Iranians who embrace their country's long history as the Persian Empire. While Trump can change the name for official U.S. purposes, he cannot dictate what the rest of the world calls it. The decision comes after Trump said the U.S. would refer to the Gulf of Mexico as the Gulf of America.</p>

          <p>Canadian Prime Minister Mark Carney visited the White House to meet with President Trump, engaging in light sparring about Canada's sovereignty. The meeting came amid ongoing trade tensions and discussions about tariffs on foreign-made movies. Trump, who had previously referred to Canada as a "state," adopted a friendlier tone during the meeting, emphasizing the importance of the relationship between the two countries. Carney, however, made it clear that Canada was not for sale, rejecting any notion of becoming the 51st state.</p>

The units are placed in high-traffic areas with limited restroom facilities, and the city will evaluate their usage and cost-effectiveness. These 'smart' restrooms also provide data about their usage and cleanliness, which can be used for maintenance and planning.</p>

          <p>President Trump adopted a surprisingly friendly tone during a meeting with the new Canadian Prime Minister, Mark Carney, despite months of disparaging remarks about Canada. Trump praised Canada and its people, a stark contrast to his previous rhetoric about absorbing Canada into the United States. Carney, while maintaining a composed demeanor, firmly asserted Canada's independence. The meeting, which should have been routine, was laden with awkwardness and recrimination due to Trump's earlier actions.</p>

          <p>A French technology is being implemented in China to enable the production of aluminum from the country's low-grade ore, reducing reliance on imported bauxite. The technology, developed by Yves Ocello of IB2, neutralizes silica and sulfur in low-grade bauxite, making it suitable for refining using the Bayer method. This advancement aligns with Beijing's plan for a greener aluminum industry and could significantly impact China's aluminum production and supply chain.</p>
