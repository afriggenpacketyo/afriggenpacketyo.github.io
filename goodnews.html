          <p>World champion Luke Littler secured his spot in the World Grand Prix semi-finals in Leicester after a thrilling quarter-final victory against Gerwyn Price. The 18-year-old sensation mounted a remarkable comeback, fighting back from two sets down to clinch the win with a sensational 152 checkout in the decisive final leg. Price, the 2020 World Grand Prix champion, had notably missed three match darts at doubles in the fourth set, creating the opportunity for Littler's dramatic and memorable finish. This impressive performance sets up a semi-final clash for Littler against Wales' Jonny Clayton on Saturday, further cementing his status in the darts world.</p>

          <p>The Trump administration has announced a significant agreement with AstraZeneca aimed at lowering drug prices in the U.S., building on a previous pact with Pfizer. Under this deal, AstraZeneca commits to selling primary care medications directly to Medicaid patients at "most-favored nation" pricing, which means matching the lowest prices found in other developed countries, accessible through the forthcoming TrumpRx.gov website. In exchange, AstraZeneca will receive an exemption from pharmaceutical sector tariffs and has pledged a substantial $50 billion investment in U.S. manufacturing by 2030. This initiative reflects President Trump's broader strategy to pressure drugmakers into reducing costs and increasing domestic production, often utilizing the threat of higher tariffs.

          <p>As China begins drafting its 15th five-year plan, a significant shift in its approach to foreign investment is emerging, moving from a focus on quantity to a clear emphasis on quality. Local authorities are now explicitly seeking to attract projects in strategic sectors such as pharmaceuticals, healthcare, and artificial intelligence, with the goal of strengthening and completing their domestic supply chains. This evolving mentality signals a more selective and targeted approach to drawing in overseas capital, reflecting a mature stage of economic development. The forthcoming plan is expected to outline high-level policy priorities, which will directly influence the landscape and opportunities for foreign investors navigating China's economic trajectory over the coming half-decade.

          <p>Philadelphia sports fans endured a historically disheartening day, marked by the simultaneous losses of three major professional teams. The Phillies suffered a season-ending playoff defeat to the Dodgers, sealed by a shocking throwing error in extra innings, while the Eagles were decisively dominated by NFC East rival New York Giants, and the Flyers lost their NHL season opener to the Florida Panthers. This collective triple blow remarkably mirrors a similar day in October 1983, when the Phillies lost the World Series and both the Eagles and Flyers also suffered defeats. The article playfully underscores the unique resilience and long-suffering nature required of Philly fans, suggesting they deserve a bit of empathy for their repeated sports misfortunes.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>A federal judge has issued a significant ruling, preventing the Trump administration from imposing specific conditions on grants allocated for combating domestic violence, notably prohibiting requirements that bar groups from promoting diversity, equity, and inclusion or offering abortion resources. This preliminary injunction, granted to 17 statewide anti-domestic and sexual violence coalitions, effectively blocks the enforcement of these conditions while the underlying lawsuit progresses. The judge's decision extends its scope beyond the immediate plaintiffs, applying to all organizations seeking funds from the U.S. Department of Housing and Urban Development and the U.S. Department of Health and Human Services. Advocates have widely praised the ruling, emphasizing that organizations serving survivors should not be compelled to abandon their core values or compromise essential services.</p>

          <p>Germany delivered a convincing 4-0 victory over Luxembourg in a World Cup qualifier, a performance deemed essential for head coach Julian Nagelsmann's team to regain momentum. The win, significantly aided by Luxembourg playing with ten men for an hour after an early red card, substantially helps Germany in their pursuit of reclaiming the top spot in their qualifying group. Despite lingering concerns about the team's inconsistent form and the development of young players, Nagelsmann commended the noticeable improvement in hunger and intensity displayed by his squad. This decisive result offers a welcome, albeit temporary, respite from the recent wave of criticism and underlying tension surrounding German football.</p>
