          <p>French scientists have identified a new blood type, "Gwada negative," in a woman from Guadeloupe. The discovery was made 15 years after an unusual antibody was found in a patient undergoing routine surgery tests. The patient is believed to be the only known carrier of this blood type, inherited from both parents. Researchers hope to find others with the same blood group to improve care for patients with rare blood types.</p>

          <p>This week's market performance was relatively flat despite significant geopolitical events, including the intensifying Israel-Iran conflict, and Federal Reserve updates. Investors closely monitored safe-haven assets like gold and the dollar, as well as risk assets such as oil. The Fed kept interest rates unchanged, acknowledging both support for rate cuts due to consumer and housing market weakness, and the need for higher rates due to rising inflation expectations. The market is focused on individual company fundamentals and industry trends rather than higher-level dynamics. (not investment advice)</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Experts say US sunscreens are not as effective as those available in other countries, particularly in protecting against UVA rays. Regulatory differences, with the FDA classifying sunscreen as a drug, have limited the approval of new UV-filtering ingredients. Some experts point out that the FDA has not approved a new UV-filter for sunscreen in more than 20 years. A bipartisan bill in Congress aims to modernize sunscreen regulations and allow non-animal testing alternatives for regulatory approval, but dermatologists still emphasize the importance of wearing sunscreen and recommend mineral sunscreens with an SPF of 30 or higher.</p>

The photos highlight the women's strength in the face of stigma and the challenges they face in accessing clean water and healthcare.

          <p>A federal appeals court has blocked a Louisiana law requiring the Ten Commandments to be posted in public school classrooms, deeming it unconstitutional. The court's ruling, stemming from a lawsuit filed by parents of Louisiana school children, is considered a win for civil liberties groups. Republican Gov. Jeff Landry supports an appeal, but experts expect the case to make its way to the U.S. Supreme Court. The court found that the law had no secular purpose but served a plainly religious purpose.</p>
