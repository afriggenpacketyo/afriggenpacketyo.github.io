          <p>Jeff Cobb made his WWE debut at the Backlash event, interfering in the United States Championship fatal four-way match to help Jacob Fatu retain his title. Cobb attacked LA Knight, allowing Fatu to regain composure and win the match. Cobb's appearance had been long rumored, and he is expected to reinforce The Bloodline faction, which has recently suffered injuries to Tama Tonga and Tonga Loa. Cobb, a 42-year-old veteran, has wrestled in Lucha Underground, Pro Wrestling Guerrilla, New Japan Pro-Wrestling, All Elite Wrestling, and Ring of Honor, and is slated to join the SmackDown roster.</p>

          <p>Indian and Pakistani military leaders met to extend a cease-fire that halted the most expansive fighting in decades between the two nuclear-armed states, following U.S. mediation. Civilian airports reopened and stocks jumped in both nations, signaling confidence in the agreement, though the situation along the border remained uncertain with displaced populations and reports of drone sightings. President Trump claimed his threat of halting trade influenced the cease-fire, while India emphasized the bilateral nature of the agreement. The halt in fighting comes after a terrorist attack in Kashmir led to intense cross-border shelling and drone warfare, with both sides claiming inflicted damage on the other‚Äôs military bases.</p>

          <p>Most flights destined for Newark Liberty International Airport were delayed due to a shortfall in air traffic control staffing, according to the Federal Aviation Administration. The delays, lasting over an hour and 40 minutes, are the latest in a series of setbacks for Newark, including recent radar and radio communications malfunctions. Transportation Secretary Sean Duffy plans to slow flights at the airport to address the delays and promised to install new fiber-optic cables, blaming the Biden administration for a botched move of the air traffic control facility to Philadelphia.

          <p>Treasury Secretary Scott Bessent stated that the recent trade agreement with China signifies progress in the U.S. reducing its reliance on Chinese products for strategic necessities. While not advocating for a complete decoupling, Bessent emphasized the importance of resilient supply chains, particularly for steel, critical medicines, and semiconductors. The agreement entails a 90-day pause, suspending reciprocal duties, though a 10% tariff and a 20% charge on fentanyl-related products remain. Bessent expressed optimism regarding China's commitment to assisting the U.S. in curbing the flow of fentanyl precursor drugs, with further talks anticipated in the coming weeks.</p>

          <p>New images from the James Webb Space Telescope reveal Jupiter's auroras are hundreds of times brighter than Earth's, displaying striking dancing lights from high-energy particles colliding with atmospheric gas. The photos, taken on Christmas in 2023, were analyzed by an international team led by Jonathan Nichols, who noted the auroras' rapid changes in brightness. Comparing Webb's images to those from the Hubble Space Telescope has raised new questions about the universe, as certain bright spots seen by Webb do not appear in Hubble's images.
