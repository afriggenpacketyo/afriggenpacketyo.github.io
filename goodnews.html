          <p>A rare clue at a Minneapolis crime scene, bloody bare footprints, led to a decades-long search for answers in the 1993 murder of Jeanie Childs. Investigators initially focused on Arthur Gray, Childs' roommate, but his alibi and footprint analysis cleared him. In 2015, DNA testing revealed an unknown profile repeating itself on multiple items at the crime scene. Investigative genetic genealogy linked the DNA to two brothers, one of whom was Jerry Westrom, a businessman and hockey dad. Westrom was eventually arrested and tried, with the bloody footprints playing a key role in his conviction.</p>

          <p>President Trump criticized Walmart after the retail giant warned that tariffs would force it to raise prices for consumers. Trump insisted that Walmart should absorb the costs of the tariffs, arguing that the company made billions of dollars and could afford to do so. Walmart responded that it would do its best to keep prices low but could not absorb all the pressure from the tariffs. Economists noted that it was inevitable that tariffs would drive up prices, as businesses could not absorb all the costs. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>The UK government is considering plans to have convicted criminals perform unpaid work such as filling potholes and cleaning bins. Justice Secretary Shabana Mahmood believes current unpaid work is too lenient and wants probation teams to work with councils to assign jobs to offenders. Private companies could also employ those on community sentences, with the money earned going to a fund for victim's groups. This initiative aims to provide more meaningful punishment and address the prison crisis.</p>

A judge recently reduced their sentence to include the possibility of parole, and their fate now rests with California's Parole Board and Governor Gavin Newsom, who must weigh public opinion and political considerations.
