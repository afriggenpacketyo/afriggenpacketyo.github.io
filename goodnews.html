        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Walmart's CFO, John David Rainey, has cautioned that consumers will likely see higher prices later this month due to tariffs, despite the recent agreement to lower duties on imports from China. Rainey stated that the magnitude of the tariff increases is too large for retailers and suppliers to absorb. Walmart reported its first profitable quarter for its e-commerce business, but the company declined to provide earnings per share guidance for the fiscal second quarter due to fluctuating tariff policy. This announcement comes as Walmart fell slightly short of quarterly sales estimates, signaling the broad impact of tariffs on the retail industry.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Nutritionist Robin DeCicco recommends increasing fiber intake for disease prevention, weight loss, cholesterol reduction, and improved digestion. Eating 25 to 29 grams of fiber per day can be achieved by adding berries and flaxseed to breakfast yogurt, extra lettuce and tomatoes to lunch sandwiches, and high-fiber vegetables to dinner. Ground flaxseed can be incorporated into soups, sauces, and meats, offering benefits such as anti-aging and reduced inflammation. Gradual increase in fiber and adequate water intake are advised for optimal results.</p>

          <p>Oil prices experienced a sharp decline following President Trump's comments in Doha, Qatar, suggesting the U.S. was nearing a nuclear deal with Iran. This prospect raised expectations of increased Iranian crude oil exports, potentially adding as much as 1 million barrels per day to the market. While this news initially put downward pressure on prices, analysts suggest the impact could be mitigated by OPEC+ potentially adjusting its production plans. The possibility of a U.S.-Iran nuclear deal is expected to have significant implications for the global oil market.</p>
