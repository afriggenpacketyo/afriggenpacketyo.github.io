          <p>Morgan Stanley has downgraded cybersecurity firm CrowdStrike's stock from "overweight" to "equal weight," suggesting it's "time to take a breather" after a 50% rise since April. Analysts cited the stock's high valuation as a key concern, believing its strong growth potential is already fully priced in. However, CNBC's Jim Cramer disagreed with the assessment, viewing the subsequent dip as a buying opportunity and expressing confidence in the company's second-half performance. The downgrade comes nearly a year after a major IT glitch, from which the company has largely recovered. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>On a challenging Bastille Day stage in the Tour de France, British rider Simon Yates claimed victory in stage 10. The day's biggest story, however, was Ben Healy, who finished third and secured the coveted yellow jersey. This makes Healy the first Irish cyclist to lead the general classification in 38 years, since Stephen Roche's victory in 1987. Healy now holds a 29-second lead over defending champion Tadej Pogacar, setting up an exciting continuation of the race after the upcoming rest day.</p>

          <p>Thirty-five years after the Americans with Disabilities Act (ADA), prospective parents with disabilities continue to face significant barriers and discrimination in the adoption process. The article highlights the story of Kelly and Larry Peterson, a couple with spina bifida who were initially rejected by an agency due to their condition. They eventually adopted a girl who also has spina bifida, believing their shared experience makes them uniquely qualified to care for her. The story underscores how, despite legal protections, equal access to services like adoption is not always guaranteed for disabled individuals.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>With interest rates remaining high, this article explores whether a long-term or short-term certificate of deposit (CD) is more profitable for savers. It calculates that while short-term CDs currently offer slightly higher annual percentage yields (APYs), long-term CDs ultimately generate substantially more interest due to the extended compounding period. For example, a $5,000 five-year CD could earn over $1,100 in interest, far outpacing the $220 from a one-year CD. The choice depends on an individual's financial goals, balancing the higher total return of long-term CDs against the flexibility of short-term options. (not investment advice)</p>
