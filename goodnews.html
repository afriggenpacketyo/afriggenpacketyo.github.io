        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>The U.S. government has officially rescinded its export restrictions on crucial chip-design software to China, a development confirmed by leading semiconductor software firms Synopsys and Cadence. This decision reverses earlier mandates from May that required companies to obtain licenses for exporting goods vital to semiconductor production. The affected companies, including Germany's Siemens EDA, collectively hold a significant share of the global electronic design automation market. This policy adjustment is seen as a component of a broader trade truce, aiming to restore access for Chinese clients and potentially de-escalate ongoing economic tensions between the two nations, impacting global tech supply chains.</p>

          <p>A skydiving aircraft carrying 15 people crashed at Cross Keys Airport in Williamstown, New Jersey, after the pilot reported engine trouble post-takeoff. The incident led to injuries for 14 individuals, with three critically hurt, but no fatalities were reported, a fact emergency officials deemed "amazing." Responders, who had recently conducted a mass casualty training exercise at the airport, swiftly managed the scene. The small Cessna 208B was only in the air for four minutes before attempting an unsuccessful landing. The Federal Aviation Administration and National Transportation Safety Board are investigating, noting the plane's involvement in a previous incident in 2023.</p>

          <p>Armenia is actively pursuing deeper relations with China, with its top diplomat, Ararat Mirzoyan, indicating mutual readiness to elevate bilateral ties to a strategic level. This diplomatic push comes as Armenia diversifies its foreign policy, moving beyond its traditional reliance on Russia. The shift follows the 2020 Nagorno-Karabakh war and subsequent events in 2023, which saw significant Armenian displacement and a perceived lack of Russian intervention. Armenia announced its withdrawal from the Moscow-led Collective Security Treaty Organisation last year, signaling a broader reorientation of its international alliances.</p>

          <p>Hong Kong's equity capital markets are experiencing a robust resurgence, with new listing volumes jumping eightfold in the first half of the year to $14 billion, making it a leading global listing destination. This surge is fueled by a combination of factors, including supportive Beijing policies encouraging mainland companies to list offshore, a slower pace of A-share listings, and ample market liquidity. Additionally, fears of delisting from U.S. exchanges due to heightened U.S.-China tensions are prompting many Chinese firms to seek secondary listings in Hong Kong. This trend reflects a strategic shift for Chinese companies seeking global expansion and alternative fundraising avenues. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>A federal judge in Washington, D.C., has issued an order blocking the Trump administration's policy that restricts migrants at the southern border from seeking asylum. U.S. District Judge Randolph Moss ruled that President Donald Trump exceeded his legal authority by attempting to "adopt an alternative immigration system." The executive order, issued in January, had declared an "invasion of America" and suspended asylum access. The decision, though stayed for 14 days for appeal, reaffirms that the President cannot unilaterally override laws passed by Congress regarding immigration rights.</p>

          <p>A Pew Research Center study indicates that nearly 48% of Latino voters supported Donald Trump in the 2024 presidential election, a notable increase from 2020, challenging traditional political assumptions. Experts like Mike Madrid and Paola Ramos suggest this shift is driven by a perception that both major parties have failed the Latino community. Madrid points to backlash against permissive immigration policies among naturalized citizens, while Ramos highlights a "deep disillusionment" with Democratic promises. Both emphasize an underlying economic populism, suggesting Latino voters prioritize economic concerns and are responsive to clear, populist messages regardless of party.</p>
