          <p>England and Crystal Palace defender Marc Guehi provides an in-depth look into his football career and personal life in a new BBC interview series, highlighting his journey from humble beginnings to significant success. The 25-year-old, a mainstay for Crystal Palace since 2021, recently led his team to their first major trophy and a Community Shield victory, attracting interest from top clubs like Liverpool. Guehi credits his family's sacrifices and a formative loan spell at Swansea for shaping his character, and candidly discusses his passion for music, reading, and even a surprising aspiration to become a WWE wrestler, offering a comprehensive view of the person behind the player.</p>

          <p>A U.S. District Judge in San Francisco has issued a preliminary injunction, effectively blocking the Trump administration from denying federal funding to over 30 cities and counties, including major hubs like Boston, Chicago, and Los Angeles. These jurisdictions maintain "sanctuary" policies that limit their cooperation with federal immigration efforts, a stance the Trump administration has aggressively challenged. The judge deemed the administration's executive orders, which threatened to withhold billions in federal money, an unconstitutional "coercive threat." This ruling marks a significant legal victory for these localities, reinforcing their ability to set their own immigration cooperation policies against federal pressure.</p>

          <p>The Los Angeles Dodgers have lost their recent momentum, dropping into a first-place tie with the San Diego Padres after a narrow 2-1 defeat at Petco Park. Despite a stellar seven-inning outing from pitcher Blake Snell, who allowed only two runs, the Dodgers' offense managed a mere three hits, failing to provide crucial run support. Manager Dave Roberts acknowledged the team's disappointment, stressing the immediate need to secure a win in the upcoming game. This result follows a week of squandered opportunities, including a split series against the last-place Colorado Rockies, indicating a persistent offensive struggle that the team must address to regain their division lead.</p>

Musk believes this is feasible because software firms do not produce physical hardware. While details remain scarce, a trademark for "Macrohard" has been filed, listing a broad range of AI-focused software and services. This initiative further solidifies Musk's push into AI and robotics, aligning with his vision of Tesla as an "AI robotics company" and expanding his diverse portfolio of ventures.</p>

          <h2>Malaysia Bans Raw Rare Earth Exports, Aiming for Downstream Investment Amid US Demand</h2>

          <p>Malaysia has enacted a ban on the export of unprocessed rare earth metals, a strategic decision aimed at fostering domestic investment in downstream processing industries. This move could significantly benefit the United States, which is actively seeking non-Chinese sources for these critical minerals, essential for a wide range of electronic hardware. Analysts believe Malaysia is well-positioned for success, leveraging its existing processing infrastructure to integrate into global supply chains. The ban underscores Malaysia's commitment to prioritizing its own economic development, signaling its "geoeconomic agency" in the competitive global market for rare earth materials, and potentially reshaping international trade dynamics.</p>

          <h2>Hong Kong Overtakes US as Preferred IPO Destination for Chinese Start-ups Amid Shifting Capital Flows</h2>

          <p>Hong Kong has emerged as the leading venue for initial public offerings (IPOs) by mainland Chinese companies, surpassing the United States for the first eight months of 2025. Chinese firms raised a combined US$16.5 billion in Hong Kong, significantly more than the US$740.9 million raised in the US during the same period. This shift is driven by Hong Kong's more active capital market and the average 19.4% jump in new shares on their trading debuts, compared to 3.6% in the US. Growing US-China rivalry and lingering delisting risks for Chinese stocks in the US also contribute to this preference, making Hong Kong a more attractive and stable listing option.

          <p>A Tesla Cybertruck owner in California experienced a concerning issue when his vehicle's light bar began detaching while he was hand-washing it, following a road trip in 114-degree desert heat. The owner, Duncan, shared his disappointment on the Cybertruck Owners Club forum, observing that Tesla "relies too much on glue" for the vehicle's assembly. Other forum members echoed concerns about the adhesive-based construction, questioning the Cybertruck's durability and ability to withstand high temperatures. This incident raises important questions about the quality of EV manufacturing and the necessity of robust materials for vehicle safety and longevity, impacting consumer confidence in the rapidly evolving electric vehicle market.</p>

          <p>Excel Parking, a controversial car park operator, has been ordered to pay £10,240 to a charity after losing its second court appeal against Hannah Robinson. The firm had relentlessly pursued Robinson for thousands in charges due to its "five-minute payment rule," which was widely criticized and later banned. A district judge initially dismissed Excel's claim, deeming its conduct "unreasonable," and ordered the payment to the Access to Justice Foundation because Robinson had free legal representation. Despite this defeat, Excel maintains its terms were lawful and continues to pursue other drivers for similar pre-ban infringements, highlighting ongoing consumer rights battles.</p>

          <h2>Political Divide Emerges Between Young Men and Women in Britain, Polling Suggests</h2>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>A notable political divide is emerging between young men and women in Britain, with polling suggesting young women are increasingly left-wing while young men lean more towards the right. A 2025 survey found 20% of young women identified as left-wing compared to 13% of young men, with women showing stronger support for Labour and the Green Party, and men for Reform UK. Researchers attribute this gap to factors like higher education rates among women, fostering socially liberal views, and the influence of social media. Experts suggest young men may be drawn to parties supporting traditional masculinity, while women seek progressive futures.</p>
