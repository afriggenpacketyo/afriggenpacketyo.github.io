          <p>A federal judge's impending ruling on Google's lucrative default search contracts, valued at over $26 billion annually, could significantly reshape the tech landscape. While Google risks losing search traffic and predictability, analysts suggest this could free up funds and drive its AI development, potentially making it a top-performing stock. The Department of Justice is also pushing for restrictions on AI distribution deals and data-sharing mandates, aiming to foster competition in the evolving search and AI sectors. This article highlights the complex interplay between antitrust regulations and technological innovation. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>Kohl's shares climbed over 20% after the retailer exceeded Wall Street's second-quarter earnings and revenue expectations, despite a sales decline. The department store narrowed its full-year sales guidance and revised its earnings per share outlook upward. Interim CEO Michael Bender acknowledged slower sales due to economic pressures on lower- and middle-income customers but highlighted efforts to reintroduce popular sections and overhaul discount strategies. The company aims for long-term growth amidst recent leadership turmoil and declining annual revenue. (not investment advice)</p>

The plan maintains voluntary military service but mandates a questionnaire for all 18-year-old men, with medical examinations becoming obligatory from July 2027. This initiative aims to address chronic under-recruitment, offering increased salaries, free accommodation, healthcare, and travel to attract volunteers, though some conservatives remain skeptical of its effectiveness without conscription.</p>

          <p>Abercrombie & Fitch experienced a slowdown in overall sales growth during its fiscal second quarter, with its namesake brand's sales falling 5%. However, the company's teen-focused Hollister brand saw a significant 19% sales increase, its best-ever for a second quarter, largely salvaging the company's performance. Abercrombie raised its full-year revenue outlook but provided a weaker profit outlook, partly due to increased tariff costs, which nearly doubled to $90 million. The company is pursuing new categories and partnerships, including becoming the NFL's official fashion partner, to drive future growth. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>A CBS News analysis indicates that violent crime in Washington, D.C. has decreased by almost half in the nearly three weeks since President Trump deployed federal troops and law enforcement. Burglaries and car thefts also saw significant drops. The analysis found that federal agents were primarily deployed in higher-crime areas, contradicting some reports. While local crime data already showed a downward trend before the deployment, the White House claims over 1,000 arrests and 115 firearms seized, though some local leaders express concern over the federal presence.</p>
