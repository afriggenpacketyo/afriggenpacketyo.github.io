          <p>Shares of Contemporary Amperex Technology (CATL), the world's largest battery manufacturer, jumped nearly 17% during its Hong Kong trading debut, marking the largest global listing in 2025. The IPO raised HK$35.7 billion ($4.6 billion), with funds allocated to building a factory in Hungary to supply batteries to European automotive clients like Stellantis, BMW, and Volkswagen. CATL's global expansion occurs amidst increasing competition and trade tensions, including U.S. tariffs on Chinese EVs and the company's placement on a U.S. military watchlist, which CATL denies. The company's 2024 annual revenue saw a 9.7% drop due to intense competition in China, though net profit increased by 15%.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Shares of CATL, the world‚Äôs largest EV battery maker, surged in their Hong Kong debut, but U.S. onshore investors were largely blocked from participating due to escalating tensions between the United States and China. The company was labeled a Chinese military company by the Pentagon, and U.S. lawmakers had called on Wall Street banks to withdraw from the Hong Kong listing. CATL altered its share sale to a Reg S offering, preventing sales to U.S. onshore investors and exempting it from certain regulatory filings in the United States. This move is seen as a sign of increasing financial decoupling between the two countries, potentially limiting U.S. investors' access to profitable opportunities.</p>

          <p>Sesame Street is heading to Netflix after facing an uncertain future due to the Trump administration's decision to pull funding for PBS. Netflix will offer a new season of the show and 90 hours of previous episodes to its subscribers. This move follows the termination of a federal initiative that funded children's shows, including Sesame Street. The deal ensures that PBS will also have access to Sesame Street episodes on the same day they are released on Netflix, maintaining its availability on free-to-air television.</p>

          <p>Japanese Prime Minister Shigeru Ishiba reprimanded the farm minister, Taku Eto, for stating he never buys rice because supporters donate so much that he can practically sell it, sparking public anger amidst soaring rice prices. Eto's remarks were deemed "extremely unfortunate" by the Prime Minister, who expects him to address the issue of rising rice costs. Eto later clarified that his wife does buy rice when donated supplies run out. Factors contributing to the rice shortfall include poor harvests due to hot weather and panic-buying prompted by a "megaquake" warning.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>China experienced a net capital inflow of US$17.3 billion into its bond and equities markets in April, despite ongoing trade tensions with the United States. This influx contrasts with market concerns over rising Treasury yields and Moody's downgrade of the US sovereign credit rating. Analysts suggest this shift reflects changing global investment dynamics, with investors moving away from US dollar assets due to President Trump's trade war. The Bank of America noted that a weaker US dollar and China's economic recovery are driving investment towards emerging markets.</p>

          <p>China's central bank cut its key lending rates by 10 basis points, marking the first reduction since October, as Beijing intensifies efforts to stimulate its economy. The 1-year loan prime rate (LPR) was reduced to 3.0% from 3.1%, and the 5-year LPR to 3.5% from 3.6%. This decision follows moves by state-backed commercial lenders to reduce their deposit rates, paving the way for lower lending rates. Analysts predict further policy easing by the PBOC, with forecasts of additional lending rate cuts by year-end.</p>

Key details regarding costs, defense cooperation, youth travel, and professional qualifications are still being negotiated.
