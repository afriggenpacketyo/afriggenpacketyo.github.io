          <p>In the relative safety of western Ukraine's Carpathian mountains, a special summer camp offers psychological support to children whose parents are missing due to the war. Run by the charity Gen.Ukrainian, the camp helps children cope with the ambiguous loss and trauma of having a parent who may be a prisoner of war, presumed dead, or trapped in occupied territory. Through group therapy, art, and recreation, the program aims to help these children process their frozen state of grief and find community with others who share their unique and painful experience.</p>

          <p>The LA Galaxy suffered a decisive 4-0 defeat at home against the Seattle Sounders upon their return to regular MLS season play. The loss came after a successful initial run in the Leagues Cup, where the Galaxy will continue to compete. The scoring began with an own goal by Galaxy's Julián Aude, followed by two goals from Seattle's Danny Musovski and a final goal by Snydell Brunell. The match, which also honored the Galaxy's 2005 championship team, leaves the Los Angeles club with a nearly insurmountable path to making the MLS playoffs.</p>

          <p>Elon Musk's company, Tesla, has formally applied for a license to supply electricity directly to households in Great Britain, signaling a major move into the UK energy market. If approved by the regulator Ofgem, Tesla could begin competing with established energy firms as early as next year. The company, known for its electric vehicles, also has a significant solar energy and battery storage division, which could provide a competitive edge by allowing homeowners with Tesla products to sell surplus energy back to the grid, a model already active in Texas.</p>

          <p>The UK government is planning a significant overhaul of road safety laws in England and Wales, including mandatory eye tests every three years for drivers over 70. The proposed strategy also aims to lower the drink-driving limit to match Scotland's stricter standard and introduce penalty points for passengers not wearing seatbelts. These changes follow a coroner's report that called the UK's driver licensing system the "laxest in Europe" after an inquest into deaths caused by drivers with failing eyesight. The government aims to reduce road fatalities and injuries with the new measures.</p>

          <p>Three-time Emmy nominee Carrie Coon reflected on her complex roles as the ambitious Bertha Russell in HBO's 'The Gilded Age' and the emotionally fraught Laurie in 'The White Lotus.' Coon embraced her character's turn towards villainy in 'The Gilded Age,' noting the dramatic tension built into her character's relentless social climbing and its impact on her family. She also discussed a pivotal monologue from 'The White Lotus,' crediting its power to the real-life bond she formed with her co-stars Michelle Monaghan and Leslie Bibb during a challenging international shoot, which she feels was the sneaky heart of the season.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>While mature black holes are known for their silence, newly formed black holes are theorized to produce a unique form of 'music' as they settle into a stable shape. This phenomenon occurs when the distortion of space-time caused by a stellar collapse or merger vibrates, ringing out with gravitational waves. Because black holes are sculpted by gravity into mathematically perfect shapes defined only by their mass and spin, these vibrations are pure and predictable. Scientists anticipate that future advancements in gravitational wave detection will soon allow them to experience this cosmic symphony.</p>

          <h2>China's New Childcare Subsidies May Disproportionately Benefit Poorer Regions</h2>
          <div class="timestamp">2025-08-10 22:00:08 EDT</div>
        </div>
        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>China has introduced a nationwide childcare subsidy program, offering families 3,600 yuan (about $501) annually for each child under three years old to address its declining birth rate. This subsidy is expected to have a more significant impact in less affluent regions, where the payment represents a much larger portion of the average resident's income. For example, the handout equates to over 13.5% of an average income in the poor province of Gansu, compared to just 4.1% in wealthy Shanghai, potentially boosting consumption and birth rates more effectively in rural areas.

          <p>English golfer Justin Rose captured his first PGA Tour title in over two years, winning the St. Jude Championship in a dramatic three-hole playoff against American JJ Spaun. Rose, who had lost a playoff at this year's Masters, held his nerve to secure the victory with a birdie on the third extra hole. The win was a disappointment for fellow Englishman Tommy Fleetwood, who entered the final round with a one-stroke lead but bogeyed the 17th hole to finish one shot out of the playoff, extending his wait for a maiden PGA Tour victory.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>The UK government has announced new measures to make it easier for NHS employers in England to hire newly qualified nurses and midwives, addressing a surplus of graduates. With up to three times more graduates than vacancies in some areas, the plan aims to cut red tape, allowing trusts to recruit based on anticipated needs rather than waiting for formal vacancies. While nursing and midwifery colleges welcomed the move as a potential relief for students, employer representatives raised concerns about how the new measures would be funded amid already strained trust budgets.</p>
