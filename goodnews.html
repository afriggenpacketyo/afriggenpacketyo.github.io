          <p>Boston Red Sox third baseman Alex Bregman had a memorable return to Houston, the city where he won two World Series titles with the Astros. In his first at-bat as a visiting player, Bregman hit a two-run home run, becoming the first MLB player in over 60 years to homer on the road against a former team with which he won at least two championships. While he was met with cheers initially and honored with a video tribute, fans booed him in subsequent at-bats. Bregman took the mixed reception in stride, calling the experience a cool moment he will never forget.</p>

The company stated that several investors have agreed to back the potential deal. This move comes after a U.S. Department of Justice antitrust ruling suggested Google should divest Chrome to remedy its illegal monopoly in the search market. Perplexity, known for its AI-powered search engine, is positioning itself aggressively in the competitive AI landscape, viewing Chrome as a critical gateway to the internet for rival search engines.

          <p>The UK's Driver and Vehicle Standards Agency (DVSA) will add questions about cardiopulmonary resuscitation (CPR) to the car and motorcycle theory test starting in early 2026. The goal is to better equip the 2.4 million learner drivers who take the test each year with life-saving skills, as drivers are often the first to arrive at the scene of a cardiac arrest. Learning materials have already been updated to include information on how to perform CPR and use a public defibrillator. Evidence suggests immediate CPR can increase survival rates to as high as 70%.</p>

          <p>French President Emmanuel Macron has formally acknowledged that France used "repressive violence" against Cameroon during its fight for independence in the 1950s. In a letter to his Cameroonian counterpart, Macron accepted France's responsibility for actions that continued even after the nation's independence in 1960. This admission follows a 2022 report commissioned by France, which detailed mass displacements, internment camps, and support for brutal militias that resulted in tens of thousands of deaths. The move is part of a broader effort by Macron's government to confront France's colonial history in Africa.</p>

The order follows a lawsuit filed on behalf of detainees who described the facility as dirty, overcrowded, and lacking basic hygiene products like soap and mattresses. Detainees reported being held in rooms with open toilets and an overwhelming stench. The judge ordered ICE to limit capacity to provide more space per person, clean cells three times daily, and ensure detainees have access to confidential legal calls.</p>

          <p>Mexico has extradited 26 inmates, described by U.S. officials as "key operatives" of powerful drug cartels, to face charges in American courts. The transfer includes members of the notorious Jalisco New Generation (CJNG) and Sinaloa cartels, who are wanted for violent offenses and organized crime. This action represents the second major extradition of its kind this year and comes amid continued pressure from the White House for Mexico to intensify its crackdown on drug trafficking. Mexican officials confirmed the transfer was contingent on the individuals not facing the death penalty in the U.S.</p>

          <h2>UK Police Given New Guidance on Releasing Suspects' Ethnicities and Nationalities</h2>

          <p>Police forces in the UK will be encouraged to disclose the ethnicity and nationality of suspects in high-profile and sensitive cases under new guidance from the National Police Chiefs' Council. The change aims to increase transparency and combat misinformation, particularly in cases with significant public interest or where speculation poses a risk to public safety. This follows several cases, including one involving an alleged sexual assault, where a lack of official information was blamed for fueling rumors and social unrest. The decision to release such details will ultimately remain with individual police forces.</p>

          <p>Approximately 100 people, mostly women, gathered for a "Dance against Vance" protest in the Cotswolds village of Charlbury to express their disapproval of U.S. Vice President JD Vance's holiday stay nearby.

          <h2>UK Parliamentarians Propose Free Bus Travel for Under-22s in England</h2>

          <p>A report by a committee of UK Members of Parliament has recommended piloting a free bus pass program for individuals under 22 in England to improve access to work and education. The report highlights that declining bus services and fares rising faster than inflation have created barriers to opportunity, particularly in smaller towns and rural areas. Citing the success of a similar program in Scotland, MPs argue that free travel would help young people who rely on public transport overcome financial hurdles. The proposal aims to address social exclusion and boost local economies.</p>

          <p>CNBC's Jim Cramer advised investors to remain invested in the stock market despite the turbulent geopolitical and domestic political environment. He argued that investors who sell in response to events like presidential decisions or tariff threats often miss out on subsequent market rallies, as issues are typically resolved after stocks have already recovered. Citing the market's record highs following a favorable inflation report, Cramer suggested that major companies have proven adept at navigating a mercurial president and changing supply chains, continuing to deliver strong profits and returns for shareholders who stay the course.
