        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>President Trump announced a "planned partnership" between U.S. Steel and Japan-based Nippon Steel, stating that U.S. Steel will remain in Pittsburgh, creating 70,000 jobs and adding $14 billion to the U.S. economy. Nippon Steel's bid to buy U.S. Steel was previously blocked by former President Biden, but is now subject to another national security review. U.S. Steel and Nippon Steel both applauded the announcement, highlighting the benefits of the partnership for American workers and the steel industry. The agreement follows Trump's imposition of 25% tariffs on foreign steel imports, with details about ownership and terms of the deal remaining unclear. </p>

          <p>President Trump signed four executive orders aimed at accelerating the construction of nuclear power plants, including small, advanced reactors. The orders direct the Nuclear Regulatory Commission to streamline its rules and expedite approvals, while also urging consideration of lowering radiation exposure limits. The administration set a goal of quadrupling the nation's nuclear power capacity by 2050, and will explore siting reactors on federal lands and military bases. Critics fear that the executive actions could cause the agency to take shortcuts on safety, while supporters believe that the actions are incredibly exciting. </p>

          <p>A U.S. judge overturned Donald Trump‚Äôs executive order targeting Jenner & Block, a law firm employing an attorney who investigated him. The order had suspended security clearances and restricted the firm's access to government buildings and contracts. Judge John D.

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>According to a border official, the Trump Treasury Department's new sanctions represent a "full-frontal assault" on the Cartel del Noreste (CDN), a deadly cartel operating along the southern border. The Treasury Department sanctioned two high-ranking CDN members, blocking their U.S. properties and interests. The administration labeled CDN a "foreign terrorist organization," and officials claim the sanctions aim to cut off the cartel's ability to obtain drugs, money, and guns. Despite reduced illegal crossings, cartels like CDN continue to pose a threat to American citizens living on the border. </p>

          <p>Billy Joel has canceled his upcoming concerts due to a brain disorder called normal pressure hydrocephalus (N.P.H.), which affects hearing, vision, and balance. The condition, estimated to affect hundreds of thousands of older Americans, involves excess cerebrospinal fluid accumulating in the brain. Symptoms include difficulty walking, bladder control issues, and memory problems, and treatment typically involves surgery to insert a shunt. Early diagnosis and treatment can often reverse the symptoms, and physical therapy may also be beneficial. </p>
