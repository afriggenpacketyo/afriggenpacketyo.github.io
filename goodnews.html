          <h2>Chinese Envoy Dismisses US Farmland Ownership as Security Threat</h2>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>China's top diplomat in Washington, Xie Feng, emphatically rejected allegations that Chinese ownership of US farmland constitutes a national security threat, labeling such claims as "completely unfounded." Addressing a soybean industry event, Xie highlighted that Chinese investors possess less than 0.03% of total US farmland, questioning how such a small percentage could jeopardize American food security. He further contended that restricting Chinese citizens and businesses from acquiring farmland is a politically driven attempt to manipulate the narrative around China-US agricultural cooperation for specific agendas. This diplomatic exchange underscores the ongoing economic scrutiny and differing interpretations of national interests between the two global powers, emphasizing the minimal scale of Chinese investment in American agriculture.</p>

          <p>Pierce Brosnan, portraying Ron in the upcoming Netflix film adaptation of Richard Osman's immensely popular 'Thursday Murder Club' series, expressed a "huge responsibility" to meet the high expectations of the book's millions of fans. The actor, who initially thought of Ray Winstone for his role, highlighted the supportive environment with co-stars Dame Helen Mirren, Celia Imrie, and Sir Ben Kingsley, fostering a positive on-set experience. Despite receiving mixed critical reviews, which ranged from "nefariously lazy" to a "franchise is born," the cast remains eager for potential sequels. This article delves into the production challenges, the star-studded ensemble's dynamic, and the film's unique blend of mystery and emotional depth, reflecting the original book's appeal.</p>

          <p>Asus Cloud, a subsidiary of the Taiwanese laptop manufacturer Asus, is spearheading the construction of a new supercomputer in collaboration with Taiwan AI Cloud and the National Centre for High-Performance Computing. Located in Tainan, the project's initial phase is slated for a December launch with an 80 petaflop capacity, ultimately aiming for a total of 250 petaflops, significantly boosting Taiwan's computing power. This strategic infrastructure development is designed to increase the island's overall computing capacity by at least 50%, with the ambitious goal of establishing Taiwan as a "top three computing power in Asia." This endeavor is a crucial component of the Taiwanese government's broader plan to achieve 1,200 petaflops by 2029, fostering technological innovation and AI development.</p>

          <p>The UK government is set to implement a major overhaul of its asylum appeals system, with the primary goal of accelerating case processing and reducing the substantial financial burden of housing asylum seekers in hotels. Home Secretary Yvette Cooper announced plans for a new, independent body staffed by adjudicators to address the current backlog of 51,000 cases, which typically face an average wait time of over a year. This initiative responds to mounting political pressure and recent High Court decisions against the use of asylum hotels, prompting other local authorities to explore similar legal challenges. The article highlights the government's commitment to ending hotel use in this parliament, aiming to streamline the system and mitigate public discontent over immigration policies.</p>

          <p>Beijing has implemented significantly tighter security protocols across its public transport and postal services in anticipation of a rare military parade on September 3, commemorating China's victory in World War II. The event, which is expected to host numerous state leaders, including Russian President Vladimir Putin, will feature a procession along the prominent Changan Avenue, near Tiananmen Square. Extensive security checkpoints, complete with barricades and X-ray screening machines, have been erected at key public venues such as the Wangfujing Department Store, where body searches are now mandatory for entry. These stringent measures underscore the political significance of the 80th-anniversary celebration and the government's unwavering focus on maintaining order and safety for this major international gathering.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Three previously unknown oil paintings, controversially attributed to avant-garde artist Kazimir Malevich and potentially valued at over £100 million, are currently exhibited in Bucharest, sparking widespread skepticism regarding their authenticity. The owner, Yaniv Cohen, asserts the works were discovered under his wife's grandmother's mattress, having been inherited from her accountant father in Soviet Ukraine. However, prominent art scholar Konstantin Akinsha points to the complete absence of documentation or exhibition during Malevich's lifetime, casting significant doubt on their provenance. Furthermore, a Kyiv art historian who authenticated the pieces has a record of validating disputed works, while technical analyses only confirm pigment dating to Malevich's era without definitively proving his authorship, intensifying the debate within the art world.</p>

          <h2>Researchers Reconstruct Faces of 2,500-Year-Old Skulls from Ancient Indian Civilization</h2>
          <div class="timestamp">2025-08-23 18:42:59 EDT</div>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Researchers at Madurai Kamaraj University in India are digitally reconstructing the faces of 2,500-year-old skulls excavated from Kondagai, an ancient burial site near Keeladi. This project aims to understand the ancestry and migration routes of early inhabitants of a newly recognized urban civilization in southern India, dating back to 580BC. The facial reconstructions, conducted with UK's Face Lab, primarily reveal features of Ancient Ancestral South Indians with traces of Middle-East Eurasian and Austro-Asiatic ancestries, challenging narratives that confine Indian urbanization solely to the north. The initiative seeks to create a gene library from degraded skeletons, offering profound insights into the region's diverse historical population.</p>
