          <p>South Korea's President Lee Jae Myung has stated he would accept an interim deal where North Korea freezes its nuclear weapons program as a "feasible, realistic alternative" to the long-term goal of complete denuclearization. In an interview, Lee emphasized that this "emergency measure" would halt the North's production of 15-20 new nuclear weapons annually. He expressed hope that former U.S. President Trump, who he believes has mutual trust with Kim Jong Un, could resume negotiations that broke down in 2019, potentially enhancing regional and global security.</p>

          <p>A security camera at a West Virginia high school captured the shocking moment the school's principal, James Marsh, discovered a black bear trapped inside a dumpster he was unlocking. The video shows the principal quickly retreating as the bear emerges and runs off in the opposite direction, with no one being harmed in the incident. Wildlife advocates note that such encounters are becoming more common as human development encroaches on natural habitats. They emphasize the importance of securing food and trash to prevent attracting animals and creating potentially dangerous situations for both wildlife and people.</p>

City officials, including Mayor Karen Bass, have affirmed that antisemitism is unacceptable and have been collaborating with Jewish leaders to address safety concerns.

          <p>Manchester City manager Pep Guardiola adopted an unusually defensive 5-5-0 formation in the second half against Arsenal, a tactical gamble that nearly secured a victory before a late equalizer. After taking an early lead through Erling Haaland, City ceded possession and focused on deep defending, a strategy that frustrated Arsenal for most of the match. However, Gabriel Martinelli's goal in the 93rd minute salvaged a 1-1 draw for Arsenal. The result is seen as a blow to both teams' title hopes, leaving league-leading Liverpool as the primary beneficiary of the weekend.</p>

          <p>Protests have erupted across all 26 states of Brazil against legislative measures that could grant a pardon to former President Jair Bolsonaro and his allies convicted for their roles in a 2023 coup attempt. The demonstrations, supported by prominent artists and cultural figures, were sparked by the lower house fast-tracking a bill that could provide amnesty for the uprising. Bolsonaro was recently sentenced to over 27 years in prison for attempting to overturn the 2022 election results. Protesters are voicing their outrage over what they see as an attempt to shield politicians from accountability.</p>

          <p>President Donald Trump has indicated that media executive Rupert Murdoch and his son Lachlan are likely to be involved in the investment group forming a deal to manage TikTok's U.S. operations. In a recent interview, Trump also named Oracle's Larry Ellison and Dell's Michael Dell as participants in the arrangement designed to address national security concerns over the app's Chinese ownership. The deal's structure would reportedly place six Americans on a seven-member board and give the U.S. control over the app's algorithm and data privacy, though negotiations with China are still ongoing.</p>

          <p>McLaren driver Lando Norris managed to gain only six points on his championship-leading teammate Oscar Piastri at the Azerbaijan Grand Prix, a race seen as a missed opportunity by some. Piastri had an uncharacteristically poor weekend, crashing in a difficult qualifying session and again early in the race. However, Norris could only manage a seventh-place finish, a result he attributed to a compromised qualifying run where he was the first on a dampening track. Team principal Andrea Stella defended Norris's race performance but acknowledged a misjudgment in qualifying contributed to his starting position.</p>

          <p>England secured a 2-0 series win over Ireland in their first-ever T20 series, clinching the final match by six wickets in Malahide. After being set a target of 155, England's chase was anchored by a crucial half-century from Jordan Cox, who scored 55 runs. England's bowlers, led by Adil Rashid's three wickets, had earlier restricted the Irish batting lineup effectively on a slower pitch. The victory caps a successful series for the English side under the captaincy of Jacob Bethell, sealing the win with 17 balls to spare.</p>

          <p>London's Mayor Sadiq Khan has initiated a one-day trial banning traffic from a half-mile stretch of Oxford Street, one of the world's busiest shopping districts. The event, called "This is Oxford Street," is a precursor to a larger plan to permanently pedestrianize the area between Oxford Circus and Marble Arch to increase footfall and improve the shopping experience. While many pedestrians welcomed the car-free environment, the proposal has raised concerns from some local councillors and residents about traffic being diverted to smaller side streets and potential accessibility issues for people with mobility challenges.</p>

          <p>Stunning video footage captures the raw power of two Amur tigers, a brother and sister, as they are released back into the wild in Russia after a period of rehabilitation. The footage shows the massive cats snarling, biting, and swatting at their cage doors with incredible fury just before being set free. Amur tigers, also known as Siberian tigers, are the largest tiger subspecies and are critically endangered, with only 500 to 600 estimated to be left in the wild. Conservation groups highlight that their future remains uncertain due to threats from poaching and habitat loss.</p>

The victory provided redemption for Hocker, who had been controversially disqualified from the 1500m semi-finals earlier in the competition. He stated after the race that he felt he had been "robbed" in the earlier event and was determined to end the championships on his own terms.</p>

          <p>Europe's Ryder Cup captain, Luke Donald, has suggested that the famously tough New York crowd at Bethpage Black might turn against the home team if they underperform, especially since U.S. players are being paid for the first time. Each American player will receive a $500,000 payment, a controversial move in an event where Europeans continue to play for free. Donald believes that if the expensive-to-watch U.S. team struggles, the fans' high expectations combined with the player payments could create a uniquely pressurized environment. He affirmed his team remains motivated by purpose rather than monetary reward.</p>
