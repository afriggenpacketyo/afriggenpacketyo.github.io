          <p>President Trump stated that India is prepared to eliminate tariffs on US goods as part of ongoing trade negotiations, though Delhi has yet to confirm these remarks. Trump mentioned this potential deal at an event in Doha, Qatar, while also suggesting Apple should increase production in the United States instead of expanding in India. This announcement comes after the US imposed tariffs on Indian goods in April, prompting India to expedite trade deal discussions during a tariff pause set to end in July. The US remains a major trading partner for India, with bilateral trade valued at $190 billion. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>Nottingham Forest defender Ola Aina suggests that Taiwo Awoniyi's injury could have been avoided if the assistant referee had raised the offside flag sooner during their recent match against Leicester City. Awoniyi collided with a post while attempting to reach a cross from Anthony Elanga, who was in an offside position. The assistant referee delayed raising the flag due to a protocol introduced in 2020, which allows play to continue until the sequence is completed. Awoniyi is currently recovering from surgery after being placed in an induced coma.</p>

          <p>Taiwanese authorities are investigating several local artists suspected of evading compulsory military service, with coordinated police raids detaining 11 celebrities. The investigation is part of a broader inquiry into allegations that a criminal syndicate is helping male residents avoid conscription. Those implicated include singers and members of popular bands.

          <p>The UK economy expanded by 0.7% in the first three months of the year, surpassing analyst forecasts of 0.6%, driven primarily by the services sector. The Office for National Statistics noted significant growth in production as well. While Chancellor Rachel Reeves highlighted the UK's economic strength, analysts caution that this growth rate may not be sustainable due to upcoming US tariffs and increased UK employer taxes. Despite some skepticism about long-term prospects, businesses like Nc'nean Whisky Distillery are absorbing tariffs to maintain stable prices in the US market.</p>

          <p>The Japanese government is considering increasing the release of its rice stockpile to approximately 600,000 tons to address near-record high rice prices. This measure involves releasing an additional 300,000 tons over three months through July, supplementing the 321,000 tons already auctioned between March and April. The move comes in response to rising rice prices and a suspected hoarding by wholesalers and farmers. However, concerns are growing that depleting the stockpile could leave Japan vulnerable in the event of another poor harvest or natural disaster.</p>

          <p>Denmark's economy, boosted by pharmaceutical exports, is expected to moderate, but potential U.S. tariffs are not a major factor due to the country's reliance on merchanting and processing systems. The IMF projects a slowdown in Denmark's output growth, citing anticipated weakness in export growth, including pharmaceuticals. However, the country is shielded from U.S. tariffs as most Danish drug products are neither produced nor cross its borders. Danish drugmakers rely on intellectual property, contracting manufacturers in other countries to produce and ship products.</p>

          <p>Mookie Betts delivered a clutch two-run double after the Athletics intentionally walked Shohei Ohtani, leading the Dodgers to a 9-3 victory. Betts, who has often followed intentional walks to Ohtani with impactful hits, expressed his frustration with the strategy, shouting towards the Athletics' dugout after his hit. The Dodgers' win also featured home runs from Ohtani, Andy Pages, and Hyeseong Kim, contributing to a strong offensive performance. Yoshinobu Yamamoto earned the win despite a less-than-stellar outing, while the Dodgers' bullpen shut down the A's.</p>
