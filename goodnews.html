          <p>International students contribute significantly to U.S. colleges and universities, with a record 1.1 million enrolled in 2024. Harvard relies on nearly 7,000 international students, representing more than 25% of its total enrollment. These students contribute billions to the U.S. economy and bring diverse perspectives to campuses. India and China are the leading countries of origin for international students, and the U.S. government is urged to adopt policies that attract and retain talent from overseas.</p>
