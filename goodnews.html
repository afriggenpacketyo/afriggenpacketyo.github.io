          <p>Democrats are seeking to capitalize on parents' anxieties regarding rising baby gear prices and the spread of vaccine misinformation, linking these issues to President Trump and Health Secretary Robert F. Kennedy Jr. The article explores how the Trump administration's policies are impacting families, with rising costs of strollers and car seats due to tariffs, cuts to safe infant sleep campaigns, and measles outbreaks fueled by vaccine skepticism. While Republicans have successfully tapped into parental concerns in the past, Democrats see an opportunity to connect with voters by addressing their fears and offering solutions grounded in science and public health. The effectiveness of this strategy remains to be seen, as some voters express skepticism towards vaccines regardless of political affiliation.</p>

Despite the positive rhetoric, the US has maintained that tariffs will not be lowered unilaterally, and China will need to make its own concessions. The meeting, the first since the imposition of steep tariffs, was described as a 'total reset' by Trump, though challenges and complexities persist.</p>
