          <p>Jack Draper expressed disappointment after his defeat to Alexander Bublik in the French Open's last 16, calling it a "missed opportunity." The 23-year-old Briton, despite a strong start to the year, struggled against Bublik's inspired performance. Draper acknowledged the steep learning curve he's experiencing, highlighting the need to capitalize on future opportunities to advance further in major tournaments. Despite the loss, Draper remains optimistic about his progress and future prospects in tennis. The tournament continues without Draper, as Bublik advances to the next round. </p>

          <p>An in-depth look at Ukraine's "Spider Web" attack, where over 100 drones struck air bases deep inside Russia, targeting nuclear-capable long-range bombers. The drones were smuggled into Russia inside wooden cabins on lorries, launched remotely by drivers seemingly unaware of their cargo. Ukrainian President Zelensky stated that the operation took over a year and a half to prepare and involved 117 drones, each with its own pilot. Russia confirmed the attacks in multiple regions but downplayed the extent of the damage. </p>

        </div>
        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>This article argues that opening a $10,000 long-term certificate of deposit (CD) in June could be a wise financial decision due to potential rate cuts in July, protection against market volatility, and the opportunity to earn substantial interest. With the Federal Reserve potentially issuing rate cuts soon, locking in a CD now can secure current rates. Long-term CDs offer fixed interest rates, protecting against market instability and ensuring predictable returns. Depending on the CD term and rate, savers can earn hundreds or thousands of dollars in interest. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>New research suggests that the Milky Way's collision with the Andromeda galaxy, previously predicted to occur in four billion years, is now less likely within that timeframe. Simulations based on data from NASA's Hubble and the European Space Agency's Gaia space telescopes show only a 2% probability of a collision in the next five billion years. While close encounters may occur, a full merger is projected to take place in eight to ten billion years, or the galaxies may bypass each other without incident. The inclusion of the Large Magellanic Cloud in the simulations significantly reduced the chance of a merger. </p>
