          <p>Physicists are studying the acoustics of spaceflight, particularly the sonic booms produced by SpaceX rockets, to understand their impact on communities. As rocket launches become more frequent, the noise they generate is increasingly disruptive, shaking windows and disturbing residents. Researchers like Kent Gee at Brigham Young University are investigating the unique three-part sonic boom created by Falcon 9 boosters as they return to Earth, aiming to identify ways to mitigate these disturbances. SpaceX is also testing Starship, the largest rocket ever, which will likely be the loudest, so gathering data now is crucial to addressing potential noise problems before they become widespread.</p>

Now, as EVs gain traction, the Trump administration's efforts to undercut their growth and favor oil raise concerns about history repeating itself. The article explores the parallels between the past and present challenges facing electric cars, from political opposition to gender stereotypes, while also highlighting the potential for technological advancements to give EVs a decisive edge.</p>
