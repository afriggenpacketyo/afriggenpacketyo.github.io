          <p>Canadian Prime Minister Mark Carney met with President Trump at the White House, marking their first encounter since Carney assumed office in March, against a backdrop of strained U.S.-Canada relations due to tariffs and comments about Canada becoming the 51st state. Carney has pledged to stand firm against the U.S. president and fundamentally reimagine Canada's economy in light of Trump's tariff regime. Trump has imposed a 25% import tariff on Canadian goods, citing concerns about fentanyl and migrants entering the U.S., leading to retaliatory tariffs from Canada. Carney has stated that Canada will only engage in trade and security talks with the Trump administration on their own terms, and he dismissed any discussions about Canadian statehood.</p>

          <p>Palantir's stock experienced a 13% drop despite the data analytics and AI software company reporting ongoing revenue growth acceleration. Analysts raised concerns about the modest full-year revenue guidance raise, sequential margin decline, and year-over-year decline in international commercial revenue, with one analyst noting that the company's high software multiple makes it vulnerable as revenue growth slows. Palantir exceeded revenue expectations and raised its revenue guidance for the year, posting adjusted earnings of 13 cents per share on $884 million in revenues, a 39% increase from the previous year. CEO Alex Karp remains optimistic, highlighting the company's 20 years of investment and a cultural shift in the U.S. as drivers of growth.</p>

Merz, from the center-right Christian Democratic Union, is expected to lead a coalition government with the center-left Social Democratic Party, outlining plans for policies including migration, tax rule changes, and social security measures.

          <p>Sen. Thom Tillis, a key Republican senator, has announced his opposition to President Trump's nomination of Ed Martin to be the U.S. Attorney for the District of Columbia, potentially jeopardizing Martin's confirmation chances. Tillis cited Martin's support for criminal defendants in the January 6, 2021, U.S. Capitol riot cases, which were prosecuted by the D.C. Attorney's Office. With Tillis's opposition, Martin's nomination is unlikely to be reported out of the Senate Judiciary Committee, where Republicans and Democrats are evenly split. Martin is currently serving as interim U.S. Attorney for D.C., but his term will expire on May 20.</p>

The BBC acknowledged that it should have included the views of Buckingham Palace and the Home Office, which described the Government‚Äôs protective security system as ‚Äúrigorous and proportionate.‚Äù Prince Harry has alleged that he can only come to the UK safely if he is invited, and the King could help resolve the situation.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>A late payment can significantly impact your credit score, affecting loan rates, apartment rentals, and job opportunities. To mitigate this, you can request a goodwill adjustment from the creditor, dispute inaccuracies with credit bureaus, or negotiate a "pay for delete" agreement. If these methods fail, the late payment will remain on your credit report for up to seven years, though its impact lessens over time. Consistent on-time payments after the late mark can help your credit recover faster. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>California Governor Gavin Newsom has proposed a $7.5 billion tax credit program and offered to work with President Trump to boost U.S. film production, after Trump threatened tariffs on films made abroad. Newsom stated that California is "eager to partner with the Trump administration to further strengthen domestic production and Make America Film Again." The initiative was triggered after Trump posted on his Truth Social platform that the U.S. film industry was "dying" and unveiled plans for tariffs on overseas-made productions. Jon Voight, Trump's "special ambassador" to Hollywood, also discussed a federal policy with tax incentives to encourage studios to conduct more production work in the U.S.</p>
