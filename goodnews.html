          <p>Tesla CEO Elon Musk has confirmed a major $16.5 billion contract with Samsung Electronics for the supply of advanced semiconductors. The deal, which runs until 2033, is centered on producing Tesla's next-generation AI chips at Samsung's new facility in Texas. Musk emphasized the strategic importance of this partnership, suggesting he will personally oversee efforts to maximize manufacturing efficiency and that the deal's value could ultimately exceed the initial figure. This agreement highlights the critical role of custom silicon in advancing Tesla's artificial intelligence and autonomous driving capabilities.</p>

          <p>Despite the England women's national football team's historic Euro 2025 victory, Downing Street has indicated there are no plans for a celebratory bank holiday. While a homecoming parade is scheduled for Tuesday in London, the government appears to be following the precedent set after the team's 2022 win. The decision is likely influenced by the significant economic cost of an extra public holiday, estimated to be over £1 billion. Prime Minister Keir Starmer, who had previously supported the idea, will host a special reception for the team.</p>

          <p>England's dramatic penalty shootout victory in the European Championship final against Spain has dominated the front pages of British newspapers. Headlines hailed the Lionesses as the "Queens of Europe" and celebrated the "Revenge of the Lionesses" after their World Cup final defeat to Spain two years prior. Publications like The Sun praised goalkeeper Hannah Hampton as "The Hann of God," while others featured celebratory images of the team and the Royal Family. This article provides a meta-summary of the media's jubilant and creative response to the national team's historic achievement.</p>

          <p>The new trade framework between the U.S. and the European Union is being framed as a significant win for President Donald Trump, though it is not a total defeat for the EU. The deal sets a 15% U.S. tariff on many European goods, which is a major climbdown for the EU but better than the threatened 30%. This article analyzes the difficult bargaining position Brussels faced, citing Europe's sluggish economic growth and its security reliance on the U.S. as key factors. The agreement removes some economic uncertainty, which the EU ultimately decided was worth the price. (not investment advice)</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Authorities in the Chinese tech hub of Shenzhen have implemented a new policy mandating leniency for researchers and companies whose government-funded innovation projects fail. The rules state that if mistakes are made without misconduct or abuse of power, and reasonable corrective actions are taken, individuals should not be punished or have their future funding applications affected. This move is designed to encourage innovators to "boldly explore uncharted territories" without fear of reprisal for failures caused by technical difficulties or unforeseen market changes, fostering a more risk-tolerant research environment.</p>

          <p>The LAPD's Pacoima station and nearby homes were temporarily evacuated Saturday after a couple brought in military ordnance they had found while cleaning a deceased relative's home. The couple arrived at the station with a plastic box containing what they believed were explosives. The department's bomb squad was called in and used a robot to assess the devices before deeming them safe to transport. The ordnances were then moved to a secure facility for collection by the U.S. military, averting a potentially dangerous situation at the police station.</p>

          <p>Five Eastern Caribbean nations—Antigua and Barbuda, Dominica, Grenada, St Kitts and Nevis, and St Lucia—are experiencing a surge in demand for their "citizenship by investment" programs. These programs offer a passport, and the visa-free travel it allows, to individuals who purchase real estate starting from around $200,000. Real estate agents report that a majority of current buyers are from the U.S., with political volatility cited as a key driver. While the programs are a vital source of revenue for the islands, they face scrutiny from the EU and U.S. over security concerns.</p>
