After a tight first set tie-break, Alcaraz dominated the second set, securing the title with a volley. Alcaraz expressed happiness at winning his first Rome title and praised Sinner's return to form after his ban, while Sinner acknowledged the difficulty of his return but considered the final a good test.</p>

          <p>Phillies closer Jos√© Alvarado has been suspended for 80 games after testing positive for external testosterone under MLB's drug-testing program. Alvarado claimed the positive test was due to a weight loss drug taken during the offseason, and the team believes he did not knowingly violate the rules. The suspension means Alvarado is ineligible for the postseason and will lose half his $9 million salary. The Phillies will need to find alternative closing options, with Jordan Romano and Orion Kerkering as potential replacements.</p>

          <p>France has refuted claims by Telegram founder Pavel Durov regarding interference in Romania's presidential election, labeling them as "completely unfounded allegations." Durov hinted that a Western European country, implied to be France, requested the platform to "silence conservative voices." The French Foreign Ministry emphasized its support for Romanian democracy and suggested the accusations are a diversionary tactic from real threats of interference, particularly from Russia. The ministry also highlighted France's historical support for Romania's EU accession and military assistance.</p>

          <p>A control tower breakdown at Paris Orly airport caused the cancellation of approximately 130 flights, impacting thousands of passengers. The DGAC civil aviation authority attributed the disruption to a failure of the air traffic control systems at the Orly tower, leading to a significant reduction in flight capacity. An aviation source cited a radar breakdown as the cause of the airport chaos, affecting flights across France, other European destinations, and North Africa. The airport spokesman said about half the 130 cancelled flights were departures and half incoming flights.</p>

          <p>Tressie McMillan Cottom explores the changing dynamics of country music, noting the rise of Black, Hispanic, Indigenous, and queer artists and the genre's ongoing identity crisis. She argues that the increasing popularity of country music has prompted many artists from other genres to test the waters, and those artists need to decide whether they will embody the exclusionary whiteness of Nashville or the reparative multiracialism that has emerged in recent years. The article highlights how aesthetic authenticity and the historical racial coding of country music influence which artists are embraced by the industry.</p>
