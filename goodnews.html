          <p>South Korea's presentation of a model for a novel naval drone carrier indicates its aim to become a leader in drone-based maritime warfare.  The 15,000-tonne HCX-23 Plus, a multi-deck ship lacking a traditional command island, represents a significant shift in naval design. Experts see this as a potential game-changer for grey-zone and near-sea operations, despite inherent risks. The innovative design could mark a substantial advance in unmanned maritime power projection.</p>
