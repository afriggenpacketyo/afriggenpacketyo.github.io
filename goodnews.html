          <p>Shares of Chinese electric-vehicle maker Xpeng experienced a significant surge in Hong Kong, driven by positive earnings reports and promising revenue forecasts for the second quarter. Analysts predict Xpeng will achieve profitability by the fourth quarter of this year, fueled by strong sales momentum and a pipeline of new models. The company's first-quarter revenue more than doubled, with vehicle deliveries quadrupling compared to the previous year, resulting in a narrowed net loss and improved gross margin. UOB Kay Hian maintains a buy rating on the stock, projecting substantial upside from its current price. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>The European Union is providing Radio Free Europe/Radio Liberty with millions of dollars in emergency funding after the Trump administration withheld funds already designated by Congress. The network, which provides non-ideological news coverage to countries with restricted press freedom, was at risk of closure due to the funding cuts. The EU's support aims to safeguard the network's independent journalism, particularly its reporting on Russia and Hungary. This crisis has raised the possibility of a more stable, collaborative funding model involving both European and American contributions.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>The Japanese government has implemented a new gasoline subsidy aimed at reducing prices by 10 yen per liter to alleviate cost-of-living pressures on consumers. The subsidy provides a fixed sum to wholesalers, regardless of current prices, with the goal of lowering the wholesale gasoline price by 10 yen by mid-June. The program, allocated around 1 trillion yen, could last until the end of March 2026. The reintroduction of the subsidies comes ahead of the House of Councillors election this summer.</p>

          <p>Sixteen European consumer groups are calling on the EU to take action against seven low-cost airlines, including Ryanair and easyJet, over their baggage fees. The groups accuse the airlines of misleading passengers and creating confusion at check-ins by charging extra for hand baggage that does not meet their guidelines. The European Consumer Organisation argues that these practices breach EU consumer law and is seeking an investigation and sanctions. The groups advocate for a standard luggage allowance to be included within the ticket purchase.</p>
