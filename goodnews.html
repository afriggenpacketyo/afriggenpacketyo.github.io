          <p>Exxon Mobil reported first-quarter earnings that surpassed Wall Street estimates, driven by production growth in the Permian Basin and Guyana, along with cost-cutting measures. However, profits declined 6% compared to the previous year due to falling crude oil prices, influenced by concerns that President Trump's tariffs will negatively impact global demand. The company's global production business saw a 19% increase in earnings, while U.S. production profits soared by over 70%. This article provides a detailed breakdown of Exxon's financial performance and its strategies for navigating a volatile market.</p>

          <p>A suspected glitch on the Deliveroo app led to Co-op products being priced as low as zero, allowing some shoppers to purchase items for free. While it is not always clear whether a retailer has to honor purchases of products advertising lower prices in error, many customers were able to take advantage of the situation. Some individuals are donating their heavily discounted goods to local food banks, providing much-needed support to their communities. The article also notes that the Co-op was recently affected by a cyber attack, though there is no suggestion that the two incidents are related.</p>

          <p>Nigel Farage's Reform U.K. party secured a narrow victory in a parliamentary by-election in Runcorn and Helsby, northwest England, defeating the Labour Party by just six votes, marking a significant moment for the right-wing populist movement in Britain. Sarah Pochin, Reform‚Äôs candidate, won the seat previously held by Labour, who had a large margin in the last election, but was forced to resign. This win could signal a shift towards a more polarized, multiparty system, posing challenges for both Prime Minister Keir Starmer and the Conservatives, who are already vulnerable after last summer's defeat. This article provides crucial context on the potential implications of this electoral upset.</p>
