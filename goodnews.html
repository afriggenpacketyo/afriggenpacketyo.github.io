          <p>Keegan Bradley secured victory at the Travelers Championship with a dramatic birdie on the final hole, edging out Tommy Fleetwood and Russell Henley. Fleetwood, who held a three-shot lead entering Sunday, faltered, opening the door for Bradley, who made a 64-foot putt on the 15th and then stuck his approach shot close on the 18th. Bradley's win, his eighth on the PGA Tour, has significant implications for the upcoming Ryder Cup, where he aims to be a playing captain. Fleetwood, despite his consistent performance, continues to seek his first PGA Tour win.</p>

          <p>Kyoto saw a record 10.88 million foreign visitors in 2024, with overall visitors reaching the second-highest on record, despite growing concerns about overtourism. A survey indicated high satisfaction levels among both foreign and Japanese tourists, with over 90% expressing satisfaction with their sightseeing experience. Foreign visitors favored temples, shrines, and historic sites, while Japanese visitors were more bothered by the crowds. To combat overtourism, Kyoto plans to implement a lodging tax increase in 2026, with revenues allocated to strengthen measures addressing tourism-related issues.</p>

          <p>China's "panda diplomacy" is receiving renewed attention as Japan approaches a period with no giant pandas for the first time in over half a century. With Sino-U.S. relations strained, Beijing may use panda loans to stabilize ties with Tokyo, potentially announcing a new loan during a high-level visit. Historically, pandas have symbolized friendship and brought economic benefits, but experts question if the gesture will carry the same diplomatic weight. Japan currently houses six pandas, but their loan periods are expiring, prompting speculation about future panda diplomacy efforts.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>After studying over 200 parent-child relationships, it was discovered that parents who have an easier time getting their child to listen rarely use threats, bribes or harsh consequences. Instead, they employ language that fosters cooperation by honoring a child's autonomy while maintaining boundaries. The article highlights five phrases to avoid, such as "Because I said so" and "Stop crying," and suggests alternative responses that promote respect, emotional safety, and problem-solving. Shifting from control and criticism to empathy and leadership reduces power struggles and raises emotionally resilient children.</p>

          <p>Prescriptions for Mounjaro, a weight loss injection, are now available at GP surgeries in England for individuals meeting strict criteria, including a high BMI and specific health conditions. This staggered approach aims to prioritize those most in need while managing GP workload and NHS resources. Mounjaro, initially licensed for type 2 diabetes, helps with weight loss by making individuals feel fuller, leading to reduced eating. Patients will also receive support with exercise and diet, but availability may vary by location, and some GP practices are cautioning patients who do not meet the criteria against booking appointments.</p>

          <p>China has become a leader in the electric vehicle (EV) market through long-term planning, government subsidies, and the development of a comprehensive EV ecosystem. Almost half of all cars sold in China last year were electric, driven by affordability and environmental concerns. The Chinese government invested an estimated $231 billion from 2009 to 2023 to develop the EV industry, supporting both consumers and manufacturers. This has led to the growth of companies like BYD and CATL, and the establishment of the world's largest public charging network.</p>

          <p>An NHS Lothian psychiatrist hopes to establish a ketamine clinic by the end of the year as an alternative treatment for severe depression, offering a potential option for patients unresponsive to traditional therapies. This follows the opening of a private clinic in Lanarkshire that provides ketamine-assisted therapy for treatment-resistant depression. While ketamine is not licensed for routine depression treatment, it can be used 'off-label' by doctors, and some patients report positive experiences with the therapy. The Royal College of Psychiatrists is expected to release updated information on ketamine later this year.</p>
