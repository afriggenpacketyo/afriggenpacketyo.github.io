        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>President Trump stated on Friday that he believes a ceasefire agreement between Israel and Hamas could be reached within the next week. This comes after weeks of administration-led efforts to broker a pause in the fighting, which has so far proven difficult to achieve. A previous 60-day proposal, which included a significant hostage and prisoner exchange, was rejected by Hamas as "totally unacceptable." The ongoing war, which began after Hamas's attack on October 7, 2023, has resulted in a high number of casualties on both sides and a severe humanitarian crisis in Gaza.</p>

          <p>The S&P 500 index closed at a new record of 6,173, fueled by investor optimism over easing global trade tensions and expectations of interest rate cuts by the Federal Reserve. This marks a significant recovery of roughly 24% since the market downturn in April, which was triggered by the Trump administration's tariff announcements. While positive trade headlines and resilient corporate profit forecasts are driving the rally, some analysts warn of complacency regarding ongoing trade and tariff risks. The market's gains came as new data showed core inflation rose to 2.7% in May. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>A federal judge has struck down a Trump administration executive order that aimed to penalize the law firm Susman Godfrey, which represented Dominion Voting Systems in its defamation suit against Fox News. U.S. District Judge Loren AliKhan ruled the order was an unconstitutional violation of the First and Fifth Amendments, describing it as a "shocking abuse of power" that threatens the independence of the legal profession. This decision is the latest in a series of legal defeats for the administration's attempts to use executive orders to punish law firms perceived as political adversaries.</p>

          <p>Financial advisor Ric Edelman, who once recommended a small 1% allocation, now suggests that investors could consider placing 10% to 40% of their portfolios in cryptocurrencies. He cites the evolution of crypto into a mainstream asset class and the resolution of earlier questions about government bans and institutional adoption as reasons for his changed perspective. Edelman also argues that the traditional 60/40 stock-bond portfolio is obsolete due to increased human longevity, making higher-return assets like crypto more necessary. He points to crypto's lack of correlation with traditional assets as a benefit for portfolio diversification. (not investment advice)</p>

According to the Economic Policy Institute, these increases will provide an average annual wage boost ranging from $420 in Oregon to $925 in Alaska.

While many of its products are already free from these additives, some items like sugar-free jams and Hostess snack cakes still contain them.

The decision is a significant victory for Hollywood studios, unions, and workers who have seen productions lured away by more generous incentives in other states and countries. The expansion, championed by Governor Gavin Newsom, aims to bring productions back to California and revitalize the local industry. A related bill is also advancing that would broaden eligibility for the credits and increase the incentive for filming in and outside the Los Angeles area.</p>

Gallo, who is an intersex and Latine artist, portrays the titular character, a sex worker in New Jersey trying to escape a life of crime while reconciling with their past. The film, which evolved from Gallo's USC thesis project, is the first feature to center an intersex narrative in this way and aims to shed light on an often invisible identity.

The rally is attributed to its recent inclusion in the benchmark index, positive regulatory developments like the Senate's passage of the GENIUS Act for stablecoins, and new product launches.
