          <p>Verizon has named Dan Schulman, the former chief executive of PayPal, as its new CEO, succeeding Hans Vestberg who has led the company since 2018. Following the announcement, Verizon's shares experienced a slight increase in value. To ensure a seamless leadership change, Vestberg will remain on the board of directors and serve as a special advisor through October 2026. The company also announced that Mark Bertolini will take on the role of chairman of the board, further reshaping its corporate governance structure as it moves forward with strategic acquisitions.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>The Trump administration has resumed processing student loan forgiveness for borrowers enrolled in the Income-Based Repayment (IBR) plan, ending a temporary pause that began in July. This decision comes after the program was halted while the Department of Education assessed the impact of court decisions blocking the Biden-era SAVE plan. Consumer advocates have confirmed that eligible borrowers, who have been making payments for over two decades, are now receiving notices of their debt cancellation. However, significant backlogs remain for other forgiveness programs, such as Public Service Loan Forgiveness, indicating broader systemic challenges.</p>

          <p>The Conservative party in the UK has announced a proposal to offer a £5,000 tax rebate to young people in their first job, intended to help them save for a home deposit. The plan, dubbed the First Job Bonus, would redirect the first £5,000 of an individual's National Insurance contributions into a savings account. To fund this and other pledges, such as abolishing business rates for many high street shops, the party outlined £47 billion in annual savings derived from cuts to welfare, the civil service, and foreign aid.

          <p>The first of three supermoons in the current year will be visible on Monday night, appearing slightly larger and brighter than a typical full moon. This astronomical event occurs when the moon's elliptical orbit brings it closer to Earth, making it look up to 14% bigger and 30% brighter than at its furthest point. According to NASA, this particular supermoon will pass within approximately 224,600 miles of Earth. The phenomenon can be observed worldwide without special equipment, provided the skies are clear, offering a subtle yet impressive celestial display.</p>

          <p>In a landmark deal for the AI industry, OpenAI has agreed to a partnership that could see it acquire up to a 10% stake in chipmaker Advanced Micro Devices (AMD). The agreement involves OpenAI deploying 6 gigawatts of AMD's Instinct GPUs over several years, a move that sent AMD's stock soaring over 35%. This strategic tie-up positions AMD as a crucial supplier for OpenAI's ambitious infrastructure projects and reduces the AI leader's reliance on a single hardware vendor. The deal highlights the increasingly interconnected economy of the AI sector. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>Turkey has become the unofficial world capital for hair transplants, attracting around one million people for the procedure in 2022 and generating approximately $2 billion in revenue. Patients are drawn by significantly lower costs compared to the U.S. and Europe, with clinics offering all-inclusive travel packages. This booming medical tourism industry has transformed Istanbul's landscape, with advertisements visible throughout the city. However, the rapid growth has also sparked concerns about unlicensed "black market clinics" and the potential for botched procedures, prompting calls for stricter government oversight.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>This article explores the societal benefits of paying grandparents for providing childcare, drawing a comparison with the common practice in Singapore. It argues that such an arrangement could help alleviate the childcare crisis in the United States by offering affordable, reliable care while formally recognizing the essential labor grandparents provide. The author suggests that compensating family members deepens intergenerational bonds and creates a more communal family unit. While acknowledging cultural and logistical hurdles, the article posits that this model is a viable solution for many American families.</p>

The success is attributed to a swift, science-driven government effort that included rapid testing, isolation wards, and the deployment of experimental vaccines and treatments. The physician contrasts this coordinated response with her experiences during the COVID-19 pandemic in the U.S. Her story highlights the harrowing personal toll on healthcare workers while celebrating a public health victory achieved through decisive action and international collaboration.</p>

Their collective work identified a crucial subtype of T-cells, known as regulatory T-cells (T-regs), and the Foxp3 gene that controls their development. These discoveries have revolutionized immunology by explaining how the body prevents autoimmune diseases and have opened a new field of research aimed at developing treatments for these conditions and cancer.</p>

          <p>As he concludes his celebrated career, Los Angeles Dodgers pitcher Clayton Kershaw has transitioned from a starting role to the bullpen for the postseason. This move mirrors the career end of another Hall of Famer, Greg Maddux, who also finished his career as a reliever with the Dodgers in 2008. Despite still being highly effective, Kershaw is part of a deep Dodgers rotation with five other available starters boasting better ERAs this season. The team's management and Kershaw himself have framed the decision as a pragmatic choice to do whatever it takes to win.</p>
