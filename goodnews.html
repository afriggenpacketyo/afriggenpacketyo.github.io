        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>The article discusses the increasing disparity between the rich and the average person, arguing that wealth accumulation has far outpaced income equality measures. It proposes the concept of an 'extreme wealth line,' similar to the poverty line, to define the point at which wealth becomes harmful to society. The article suggests that excessive wealth can grant undue political influence, cause environmental damage, and undermine economic competition. The author calls for a democratic process to determine this line and implement policies to curb extreme wealth accumulation, such as higher taxes or mandated charitable donations.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Germany has tightened its border controls, particularly at the Austro-German border, to combat illegal immigration. Interior Minister Alexander Dobrindt announced that asylum-seekers will now be turned back at the border, with exceptions only for vulnerable individuals. This move represents a shift from former Chancellor Angela Merkel's open asylum policy and aims to address concerns over people smuggling and illegal migration. The increased border controls have led to a rise in thwarted illegal entry attempts, but the policy has faced criticism from neighboring countries like Poland, who prefer to combat illegal immigration at the EU's external borders.</p>

The theft was reported to the police, who are investigating the incident, though the exact date of the disappearance is unclear. Residents speculate it could be vandalism or a theft for scrap metal, with little belief it was politically motivated. The statue, originally made of wood and later replaced with bronze after arson, had been commissioned by an American artist as an interrogation of President Trump's stance on immigration.</p>

          <p>A new genetic study has traced the migration of the first people to colonize the Americas from modern-day Russia, dating back 20,000 to 30,000 years ago. The study, published in Science, analyzed the genomes of 1,537 individuals from 139 ethnic groups in northern Eurasia and the Americas. It suggests that the languages and traditions of Indigenous groups living in the Americas today can be traced back to these early settlers. The findings also highlight the importance of ancestral knowledge for understanding present-day South American communities and their cultural heritage.</p>
