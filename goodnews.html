          <p>Firefighters are making significant progress in containing the Madre fire in California, the state's largest wildfire so far this year, which has burned over 80,000 acres. Favorable weather and an increase in personnel have helped crews reach 30% containment, a substantial improvement from the previous day. The fire, which started near New Cayuma, has forced evacuations and threatens structures as well as the Carrizo Plain National Monument, home to several endangered species. Officials are hopeful for continued progress before a potential heat wave arrives midweek.</p>

          <p>Los Angeles Dodgers pitchers Clayton Kershaw and Yoshinobu Yamamoto have been selected for the National League All-Star Game roster. This marks Kershaw's 11th All-Star selection, earning a spot as a special "Legend Pick" by the commissioner in recognition of his historic career. Yamamoto, who leads the team in several key pitching categories, will be making his first appearance. They will join three other Dodgers—Freddie Freeman, Will Smith, and Shohei Ohtani—who were previously chosen as starters for the midsummer classic.</p>

          <p>A planned change to UK law will extend the right to statutory bereavement leave to parents who experience a miscarriage at any stage of pregnancy. Currently, paid leave is only available to those who suffer a pregnancy loss after 24 weeks. The government is set to amend the Employment Rights Bill to ensure all grieving parents have a legal right to time off work. Deputy Prime Minister Angela Rayner stated the change is crucial to give people the time they need to grieve without work-related pressures.</p>

          <p>The UK government has announced a new initiative to offer early years teachers a tax-free payment of £4,500 to work in nurseries located in disadvantaged areas. This incentive is part of a broader £1.5 billion "Best Start in Life" strategy aimed at boosting educational standards and narrowing the achievement gap among preschool children. The plan seeks to attract and retain highly qualified staff in 20 designated areas with the most acute needs, addressing the current shortage of specialist teachers in the early years sector.</p>
