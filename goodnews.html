          <h2>China's Second-Quarter GDP Growth Exceeds Expectations at 5.2% Amid Economic Headwinds</h2>
          <div class="timestamp">2025-07-14 22:10:57 EDT</div>

          <p>China's economy expanded by 5.2% in the second quarter, slightly surpassing economists' forecasts despite facing challenges like trade tensions and a property downturn. While this growth decelerated from the previous quarter, industrial output showed strong performance. However, slowing retail sales and cautious investment figures point to underlying economic fragility, prompting calls for further government stimulus to support growth. The data reflects a mixed economic picture, with resilient exports to new markets offsetting a decline in U.S.-bound shipments. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>Nvidia has confirmed it will resume selling its H20 graphics processing units (GPUs) in China, a move that complies with current U.S. export restrictions. The company stated it has applied for the necessary licenses and expects to begin deliveries soon after receiving assurances from the U.S. government. CEO Jensen Huang, during a visit to Beijing, also announced a new, fully compliant RTX PRO GPU designed for the Chinese market. This development signals a strategic adjustment by the tech giant to navigate the complex landscape of the U.S.-China tech war.</p>

          <p>A U.S. appeals court has issued a temporary stay, preventing the Trump administration from terminating the Temporary Protected Status (TPS) for thousands of Afghans residing in the United States. The order came in response to an emergency motion filed by an immigration advocacy group challenging the administration's decision to end the protections. The stay will remain in effect until at least July 21, pausing a policy that would have removed legal status for many Afghans who arrived after the Taliban's takeover in 2021. The Department of Homeland Security has until Wednesday to respond to the court's order.</p>

          <p>The Los Angeles County Sheriff's Department successfully recovered a lost assault rifle and five fully loaded magazines after the weapon apparently fell from a patrol car. The department issued a public appeal for help, detailing the route the deputies had taken. A resident in the Lennox area found the hard-shelled case, initially thinking it might contain a musical instrument, and promptly turned it in to a local sheriff's station. Officials expressed deep gratitude for the community member's honesty and integrity, emphasizing the crucial role residents play in maintaining public safety.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Scientists at Dalian University of Technology in China have developed a new manufacturing technique that could significantly improve the performance of homegrown aircraft engines, a critical area for the nation's military modernization. The breakthrough involves a method for rapidly cooling forged turbine discs, which are core engine components made from superalloys. These discs must endure extreme temperatures and stress, and their quality has long been a bottleneck in China's jet engine development. This advancement could be crucial for powering the country's next-generation fighter jets, enhancing their power, efficiency, and lifespan.</p>

          <p>The U.S. Department of Justice has formally recommended that the Supreme Court deny the appeal from Ghislaine Maxwell, who is serving a 20-year sentence for her role in Jeffrey Epstein's sex trafficking ring. Maxwell's lawyers argued that a co-conspirator clause in Epstein's 2007 non-prosecution agreement should have barred her prosecution. However, the DOJ's filing contends this agreement was limited to the district of Florida and did not grant nationwide immunity to potential co-conspirators. Lower courts have already rejected this argument, and the government's response maintains that Maxwell was, at most, an incidental beneficiary of the deal.</p>

          <p>Bob Becker, an 80-year-old runner from Fort Lauderdale, Florida, has made history by becoming the oldest person to finish the Badwater 135, widely considered "the world's toughest foot race." The grueling 135-mile course runs through California's Death Valley in extreme heat. For Becker, the achievement was a redemption after he narrowly missed the 48-hour cutoff time in 2022. This year, with the help of a dedicated crew and coaches, he completed the race with three hours to spare. His determination and success serve as an inspiring example of endurance and resilience at any age.</p>

          <p>Paraguay's President Santiago Peña has forcefully declared his country's commitment to its 68-year diplomatic relationship with Taiwan, vowing to defend the alliance "with all its strength." Speaking at a business forum, Peña framed the partnership not merely as an economic one, but as a strategic alliance based on shared democratic values and Paraguay's sovereign foreign policy. This strong statement comes after a recent incident where a Beijing-based envoy was accused of privately lobbying opposition lawmakers to switch allegiance to China. Paraguay remains one of the few countries globally to maintain formal diplomatic relations with Taipei instead of Beijing.</p>

The space, created by the San Francisco-based company Photomatica, features four restored analog photo booths from as early as the 1950s, alongside one digital machine. While retrofitted to accept modern payments, the old machines use original chemical-based film processing, offering an authentic, tangible experience. The museum aims to provide a unique form of entertainment, blending historical technology with the modern selfie culture in a stylized, retro-themed environment.</p>

          <p>Shares of major fintech companies, including Block and PayPal, rallied on Monday, recovering from a sell-off late last week. The initial decline was triggered by reports that JPMorgan Chase planned to charge data aggregators for access to customer financial information. However, market analysts have since downplayed the risk, with firms like Evercore ISI stating the potential fees would not be a "business model-breaking" cost increase for large fintech platforms. This reassessment, along with broader market momentum, helped restore investor confidence in the sector, suggesting the immediate impact of the proposed fees would be negligible.

Cramer believes that a more M&A-friendly Federal Trade Commission under the Trump administration is encouraging companies to pursue such deals.
