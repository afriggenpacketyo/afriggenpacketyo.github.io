          <p>Abercrombie & Fitch experienced slowed sales growth in its fiscal second quarter, with the namesake Abercrombie brand declining by 5%. However, the company's overall performance was bolstered by a significant 19% surge in sales at its teen-focused Hollister brand, marking its best-ever second-quarter growth. The retailer narrowly exceeded Wall Street expectations for revenue and earnings, subsequently raising its full-year revenue outlook despite facing higher tariff costs, now estimated at $90 million. CEO Fran Horowitz expressed confidence in the company's trajectory, highlighting efforts to boost Abercrombie's growth through new categories and partnerships, including a multi-year deal with the NFL.

          <p>A federal judge's impending ruling could jeopardize Google's lucrative default search contracts, including a $20 billion annual deal with Apple, which constitutes nearly a quarter of Alphabet's operating income. While Google risks losing search traffic, analysts suggest that being freed from these costly agreements could paradoxically fuel its AI growth, allowing it to redirect funds and focus on platforms like Gemini. Despite concerns about Apple's potential financial hit, some economists believe Google's search dominance is robust enough to withstand the change, especially given its strong performance in Europe where similar regulations had little impact on market share. The Department of Justice is also pushing for restrictions on exclusive AI distribution deals. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>England fast bowler Mark Wood is targeting a return to play for Durham next month, aiming to recover from a knee injury in time for the Ashes series in Australia this winter. Wood, a crucial component for England's pace attack due to his high pace, has been sidelined since February after surgery and was cautiously omitted from upcoming white-ball matches to prioritize his Ashes readiness. He expressed his determination to play county matches rather than just net practice to prepare, stating he would "go insane" otherwise. The Ashes series begins in Perth on November 21, and Wood's recovery is vital for England's hopes of generating high pace against Australia, as he is one of their quickest options.</p>

          <p>Shares of Canada Goose surged nearly 15% following reports that its controlling shareholder, Bain Capital, has received bids to take the winter-clothing maker private. Goldman Sachs is advising Bain Capital on offloading its holding, with verbal offers from firms like Boyu Capital and Advent International valuing the company at approximately $1.35 billion, based on its 12-month average earnings. While Bain Capital is awaiting further offers, the premarket share price rise pushed Canada Goose's valuation to $1.29 billion. This potential deal represents significant returns for Bain Capital, which took control in 2013, despite the company's current valuation being well below its 2018 peak of $7.7 billion.

The decision followed widespread criticism from social media users, who called the new branding "generic" and "soulless," and an intervention from President Donald Trump, who publicly urged the company to revert. The company acknowledged customer feedback, stating it would listen to their voices and love for the brand, and that the new branding would not change its core values. This article highlights the swift reversal, demonstrating the power of public opinion and presidential influence on corporate branding decisions.</p>

          <p>Transportation Secretary Sean Duffy announced that the Department of Transportation (DOT) will reclaim management of Washington D.C.'s Union Station, a move aimed at enhancing safety and beauty while increasing Amtrak's profitability. Although DOT has owned the transit hub since the 1980s, its control had been limited by various leases and agreements. The station has been a focal point of the Trump administration's anti-crime crackdown, citing issues of crime and homelessness, and has seen a significant National Guard presence and visits from high-ranking officials. The DOT plans to reinvest income from the station, such as parking revenue, into capital improvements like security, lighting, and elevators, expecting renewed control by September.</p>

          <p>National Democrats are celebrating a significant special election victory in the Iowa State Senate, where Democrat Catelin Drey won in a district President Donald Trump previously carried by 11 points. This win effectively ends the Republican supermajority in the chamber, meaning GOP initiatives will now require Democratic support for confirming the governor's appointees. Iowa Democratic Party Chair Rita Hart highlighted this as the fourth special election win for Democrats in Iowa this year, signaling a readiness for a new direction in the state and suggesting increased voter engagement. The Democratic National Committee emphasized extensive volunteer mobilization, viewing the outcome as a warning sign for Republicans ahead of next year's elections where control of Congress is at stake.</p>

The department store narrowed its full-year sales guidance to reflect the higher end of its previous range and revised its earnings per share outlook upwards. Interim CEO Michael Bender attributed slower sales to economic pressures on lower- and middle-income customers but highlighted efforts to fix past mistakes, such as reintroducing petite sections and jewelry, and overhauling discount strategies. The company also reduced inventory and improved customer traction, with sales trends improving throughout the quarter, culminating in July's comparable sales aligning with the prior year.

          <p>The Chinese animated fantasy film "Ne Zha II" has become a global box office phenomenon, earning over $2 billion worldwide and surpassing all Star Wars sequels. This makes it the highest-grossing film of 2025, the highest-grossing animated film, and the highest-grossing non-English-language film in history. Despite a less spectacular U.S. English-dubbed release, an earlier subtitled version performed well, indicating an audience for the original. The article attributes the film's success to its epic scale, chaotic action-adventure, eye-popping visuals, and its universal coming-of-age themes adapted from Chinese folklore. The movie's giddily blended animation style, combining painterly backgrounds with Pixar-like character designs and diverse influences, contributes to its spectacular appeal.</p>

The Fed's decisions will hinge on inflation, the labor market, and overall economic momentum. Borrowers are encouraged to monitor market conditions, improve credit scores, and maintain lower loan-to-value ratios to secure better rates, as well as shop around for lenders, since rates can differ by a full percentage point.

Islanders largely support its sale and redevelopment, provided there's active community involvement and adherence to land access rights.

Despite parts of the engine appearing to explode and flaps catching fire during descent, SpaceX CEO Elon Musk celebrated the "Great work by the SpaceX team!!" This success is crucial for NASA's Artemis program, which plans to use a modified Starship to send humans to the Moon in 2027, though most observers believe that date is likely to slip.

          <p>The US rotating detonation engine (RDE) program, a collaboration between RTX Technology Research Centre and Pratt & Whitney, has progressed to practical validation, with plans to integrate the engine into weapon systems. The RDE, a concept first proposed in the 1950s, uses detonation for a highly efficient conversion of chemical energy into mechanical energy, creating a sustained high-pressure shock wave that cycles within the combustion chamber. This technology is considered "game-changing" due to its potential for more compact, lightweight, and efficient engines, requiring far fewer mechanical components than traditional air-breathing engines. The article highlights the US joining a global race, including China, to develop this advanced propulsion system, moving into the practical validation phase after a decade of designing and testing.</p>
