          <p>Tens of thousands of energy customers in the UK are set to receive payouts, potentially up to ¬£1,000 each, and may have debts written off due to a scandal involving the forced installation of prepayment meters. Energy companies will disburse over ¬£70 million in compensation and financial support after a review by Ofgem, the energy regulator. The review found that suppliers switched vulnerable customers to prepayment methods without their agreement after they fell behind on bills, with some firms forcing entry into homes. The compensation applies to customers of eight suppliers, with enforcement investigations continuing for British Gas, Utilita, and Ovo.</p>

          <p>Deborra-Lee Furness has officially filed for divorce from Hugh Jackman in New York, two years after the couple announced their amicable separation. The divorce proceedings are underway, requiring only a judge's signature to finalize the split. The couple, who married in 1996 and share two adopted children, Oscar and Ava, emphasized their family's priority and requested privacy during this transition. Jackman has since been linked to his ‚ÄúMusic Man‚Äù co-star Sutton Foster, while Furness and Jackman's last public appearance together was at the Wimbledon men‚Äôs final in July 2023.</p>

          <p>Three major wildfires continue to burn north of Duluth in northeastern Minnesota, with additional fires raging in neighboring Canadian provinces. Firefighters have made significant progress, allowing for the lifting of all Minnesota evacuation orders on Memorial Day.

Interactive maps provide regularly updated information on the extent of the fires, and donations are being collected to support affected community members in Lake and St. Louis Counties.</p>

          <p>A federal judge has struck down an executive order by President Trump that sought to impose sanctions on the law firm WilmerHale, marking the third time this month a judge has deemed such orders unconstitutional. The judge, Richard Leon, emphasized the importance of an independent judiciary and bar, arguing that the order was unfaithful to the Founding Fathers' vision. The ruling follows similar decisions regarding Jenner & Block and Perkins Coie, all targeted for either past legal work or associations with prosecutors who investigated Trump. The orders were part of a broader effort to reshape civil society by targeting perceived adversaries.</p>

          <p>Stablecoin issuer Circle's IPO is notable not only as one of the first significant cryptocurrency companies to go public in the U.S., but also for its structure. In its updated prospectus, Circle revealed that existing shareholders would sell 14.4 million shares, while the company would sell 9.6 million, with existing stakeholders selling more than the company itself. This unusual move, reminiscent of Facebook's 2012 IPO, likely reflects venture capital firms' need for liquidity after a period of meager returns. While Circle is profitable and has substantial cash reserves, private investors are eager for exits to distribute funds back to their investors.</p>
