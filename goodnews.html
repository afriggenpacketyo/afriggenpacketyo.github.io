          <p>A BBC cyber correspondent engaged with hackers claiming responsibility for recent cyber attacks on M&S and Co-op, who shared evidence of stolen customer and employee data. The hackers, believed to be associated with the DragonForce cyber crime service, expressed frustration over Co-op's refusal to meet their ransom demands. This interaction led Co-op to acknowledge the significant data breach, which they had initially downplayed. DragonForce, a ransomware-as-a-service provider, has been actively targeting organizations since 2023, offering various cyber criminal services in exchange for a cut of ransoms.</p>

          <p>The Food and Drug Administration has approved the Novavax COVID-19 vaccine, Nuvaxovid, but only for adults over 65 and individuals over 12 with specific medical conditions that increase their risk from COVID-19. This decision sharply limits access to the vaccine for healthy individuals under 65 and requires Novavax to conduct further studies on potential heart-related side effects. Experts have expressed disappointment, citing the ongoing need for accessible vaccines and raising concerns that these restrictions reflect skepticism toward vaccines within the FDA. The approval also bucks norms that have been in place since the vaccines were first approved.</p>

          <p>A rare dust storm swept across northwest Indiana and north-central Illinois, creating near-zero visibility conditions and prompting the National Weather Service to issue dust storm warnings for Chicago for the first time. The storm, fueled by dry soil conditions and strong winds from thunderstorms, caused a dramatic scene as it moved into downtown Chicago. Such storms are more common in the Southwest and southern Great Plains, and the event has raised concerns about soil moisture levels in the area. The dust storm has been classified as a haboob, generated by thunderstorm winds.</p>

His images, showcasing birds, mammals, and insects, aim to celebrate everyday stories and reveal the beauty of nature close to home. Inspired by his own experiences, he hopes to encourage people to transform manicured spaces into wildlife-friendly havens. The collection of photographs is in a new book that serves as a rallying cry to transform over-manicured spaces into more wildlife friendly havens.</p>

          <p>Taiwan's last operating nuclear power reactor was shut down late Saturday, capping four decades of operation in line with the government's policy to phase out atomic energy. The No. 2 reactor at the Maanshan power plant in southern Pingtung County ended operations as the self-ruled island moves to phase out nuclear power following Japan's 2011 Fukushima disaster. Whether that goal can be achieved remains uncertain.</p>
