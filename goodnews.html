Sinner's consistent performance throughout the season, including titles at the Australian Open and Wimbledon, underscores a burgeoning rivalry with Alcaraz, with the world number one ranking also at stake in Sunday's championship match.

          <p>China is actively engaging in party-to-party diplomacy, with President Xi Jinping recently hosting leaders from the four remaining communist countries. This approach, spearheaded by the Communist Party's International Department, serves as a crucial diplomatic channel for Beijing, distinct from promoting a Soviet-style international movement. The department, which has established connections with over 600 parties globally, has expanded its role, notably in diplomatic engagement with regions like the Middle East. The article underscores the strategic importance of these party-level interactions in China's foreign policy, aiming to strengthen international ties and influence.</p>

          <p>Following his US Open semi-final defeat to Carlos Alcaraz, 38-year-old Novak Djokovic expressed his desire to continue playing a full Grand Slam season next year, despite acknowledging the toll of the aging process. He admitted facing significant challenges in best-of-five matches against younger rivals like Alcaraz and Jannik Sinner, who have dominated recent majors. The article highlights Djokovic's unwavering commitment to Grand Slams as the "pillars of our sport" and his ongoing fight for more trophies, even as his physical powers show signs of waning against the sport's rising stars. He remains the world's third-best player, but questions linger about his ability to sustain top-level performance.</p>

          <p>A US District Judge has ruled against the Trump administration's efforts to revoke Temporary Protected Status (TPS) for hundreds of thousands of Venezuelan and Haitian migrants, deeming the action unlawful. This decision allows approximately 1.1 million individuals from these nations to maintain their legal right to live and work in the US, citing dangerous conditions in their home countries. The Department of Homeland Security plans to appeal, arguing the TPS program has been "abused, exploited, and politicised as a de facto amnesty program."
