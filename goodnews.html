          <p>Pakistan has taken on the one-month rotating presidency of the United Nations Security Council, a position it will hold for the eighth time in its history. This role comes amid a period of significant global geopolitical tension. Pakistan's UN Ambassador stated the country would work cooperatively to address threats to international peace and security. The presidency is expected to see Pakistan raise the issue of its recent conflict with India over Kashmir, while India is reportedly preparing a strategy to counter Islamabad's agenda during its term.</p>

          <p>The Chinese yuan has reached its strongest level against the US dollar since last November and is projected to continue its appreciation through 2025. In June, the onshore yuan gained 0.41 percent against the dollar, contributing to a 1.86 percent rise in the first half of the year. Analysts at Goldman Sachs attribute this trend to a less bearish outlook on China's economy and growing investor concerns about the sustainability of US government debt. The bank forecasts the yuan will strengthen past the 7-per-dollar mark within six months. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>At a recent tech conference, experts emphasized the need for emerging economies to develop "sovereign AI," which refers to a nation's capacity to control its own AI technologies and data. Panelists noted that many prominent AI models are English-centric and do not reflect other languages or cultures, creating a need for localized systems. They argued that the use of open-source AI models and accessible cloud computing can democratize the technology. This would allow regions like Southeast Asia to build AI ecosystems that cater to their specific needs and foster strategic autonomy.</p>

          <p>A private survey has indicated that China's factory activity unexpectedly grew in June, contrasting with official data that showed a contraction. The Caixin/S&P Global manufacturing PMI registered 50.4, surpassing expectations and rebounding from the previous month's decline. This growth was largely driven by an expansion in production, as improved trade conditions and promotional efforts boosted new orders. However, the report also highlighted weaknesses, including a decline in new export orders and cautious hiring, suggesting potential headwinds for the second half of the year.

          <p>Governor Gavin Newsom has signed into law two significant housing bills designed to accelerate construction by easing environmental review standards. The legislation, which faced opposition from some labor and environmental groups, exempts most urban housing projects from the lengthy California Environmental Quality Act (CEQA) process. Newsom forced the bills through the legislature by linking their passage to the state budget, a move he described as necessary to overcome historical opposition. Experts believe these reforms could be the most substantial changes to CEQA in its 55-year history, potentially unblocking numerous housing projects.</p>

          <p>A top US military commander has discussed reassigning some of the California National Guard troops currently deployed in Los Angeles to help with the state's wildfire response. The proposal would move 200 of the 4,000 Guard members from their controversial deployment dealing with protests to prepare for what is expected to be an early and active fire season. California officials had previously warned that the federal deployment, which was ordered by former President Trump over the governor's objections, could interfere with the state's ability to fight wildfires by tying up crucial resources.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>A team of Chinese scientists has discovered that a naturally occurring compound called betaine, which is produced in the kidneys during long-term exercise, can help slow down the aging process. Their research, published in the journal Cell, reveals that betaine works by inhibiting an enzyme that causes inflammation and the aging of organs. This finding helps to explain the molecular mechanism behind the anti-aging benefits of physical activity. It also suggests potential future anti-aging strategies that could simulate the positive effects of exercise on a cellular level.</p>
