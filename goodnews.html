Her position was bolstered after her main rival, Belgium's Olympic champion Nafi Thiam, unexpectedly withdrew from the competition after the penultimate session. Johnson-Thompson, who is aiming for her third world title, will enter the final day's javelin and 800m events trailing the American leader Anna Hall. The withdrawal of Thiam significantly alters the competitive landscape for the final events.</p>

          <p>Artificial intelligence is emerging as a potential solution to rising employee burnout, yet it may also be contributing to the problem. Companies are adopting AI tools to automate repetitive tasks and reduce cognitive load, with some studies showing a decrease in emotional exhaustion in workplaces that use them. However, other research indicates that frequent AI users are more likely to suffer high burnout, as the technology can lead to increased workloads and the pressure of constant connectivity. Experts suggest that while AI can be a helpful assistant, its implementation requires careful management to prevent it from simply creating more work.</p>

          <h2>Liberal Democrats Propose Establishing Police Counters in Supermarkets and Libraries</h2>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>The UK's Liberal Democrat party has proposed a new policy to open police counters in public venues like supermarkets, shopping centers, and libraries across England and Wales. The party argues this move would increase police visibility, boost public confidence, and make it easier for citizens to report crimes. They suggest the plan could be funded by abolishing the roles of Police and Crime Commissioners, which they claim would free up significant funds. This "police desk promise" aims to reverse the trend of declining front counter services at traditional police stations.</p>

Their son expressed he was "ecstatic" following their release, which was brokered with the help of Qatar. The couple, who had lived and run a charity in Afghanistan for nearly two decades, were detained for allegedly breaking Afghan laws, though the specific reasons were never disclosed. Despite their ordeal, the couple has expressed a desire to return to Afghanistan to continue their work.</p>

Despite England's statistical dominance, France has consistently been their toughest opponent, often pushing them to narrow margins in recent encounters. French coaches and players acknowledge England's formidable record but emphasize that the high stakes of a World Cup semi-final nullify past results. The match is set to be a clash between England's structured power and France's unpredictable style of play.</p>

          <p>Early voting has commenced in the Virginia gubernatorial election, a key political contest between Republican Lt. Gov. Winsome Earle-Sears and former Democratic Rep. Abigail Spanberger. The race is being closely watched as a potential referendum on the Trump administration's policies, particularly federal job cuts that have significantly impacted the state. Spanberger is positioning herself as an opponent of these policies, focusing on affordability, while Earle-Sears is aligning with the economic record of the state's popular outgoing Republican governor. The election is one of the first major political tests since last year's presidential contest.</p>

          <p>U.S. Northern Command is collaborating with private companies to test and demonstrate various counter-drone systems at Eglin Air Force Base in Florida. The initiative aims to find effective ways to protect sensitive military installations from the growing threat of unauthorized drone incursions. Technologies being tested include acoustic detection systems and interceptor drones that can capture hostile drones with nets. With thousands of drones in U.S. airspace and hundreds of incursions reported over military sites, the Pentagon is working to establish rapid response teams to counter this evolving security challenge.</p>
