          <p>A growing number of single individuals, particularly among Gen Z, are utilizing artificial intelligence to navigate the complexities of online dating. According to a study by Match.com and The Kinsey Institute, one in four singles now use AI tools to help craft compelling messages, refine their profiles, and analyze conversations. Apps like Rizz and Keepler offer AI-driven advice, acting as a virtual 'wingman' to boost confidence and improve communication. While some users find these tools helpful for breaking the ice, experts caution against over-reliance, stressing that AI should supplement, not substitute, genuine human connection.</p>

          <p>A man from the United Kingdom, James Wellesley, has been indicted in the U.S. for allegedly operating a sophisticated $99 million wine fraud scheme. Prosecutors claim Wellesley and a co-conspirator used their company, Bordeaux Cellars, to solicit funds from investors by promising loans to wealthy wine collectors, supposedly secured by valuable wine collections. However, these collectors and the wine collateral were nonexistent, and the invested money was allegedly used for personal expenses and to make fraudulent interest payments to other investors. Wellesley was extradited from the U.K. and faces charges of wire fraud and money laundering conspiracy.</p>

          <p>American sprinter Noah Lyles achieved a significant victory at the Diamond League meet in Monaco, defeating Olympic 200m champion Letsile Tebogo of Botswana. Lyles, who had been recovering from COVID-19 during last year's Olympic final where Tebogo won gold, made an impressive return to the 200m event after a long absence. He clocked a time of 19.88 seconds to edge out Tebogo, who finished in 19.97 seconds. The win demonstrates that Lyles remains a top contender in the sport as he re-establishes his presence on the international athletics stage.</p>

          <p>The price of Bitcoin has reached a new record high, briefly surpassing $118,000, driven by a significant surge in institutional investment. Bitcoin-focused exchange-traded funds (ETFs) experienced their largest single day of inflows for the year, totaling $1.18 billion, signaling strong investor confidence. The rally was also fueled by a wave of short liquidations and broader market optimism. This price action reflects growing expectations that corporate treasuries will increase their Bitcoin holdings and that a more favorable regulatory environment for cryptocurrencies is on the horizon.

          <p>A New Hampshire judge has denied TikTok's motion to dismiss a lawsuit filed by the state, which alleges the company uses manipulative and addictive design features to exploit young users. The state's attorney general argues that TikTok is intentionally designed to maximize engagement among children and teens, putting them at risk. The court ruled that the state's claims about the app's dangerous features were specific enough to move forward, distinguishing them from protected user-generated content. This case is part of a broader trend of legal actions targeting the design and safety policies of major tech platforms.</p>

          <p>A federal judge has issued a temporary restraining order preventing the Los Angeles Police Department from using rubber bullets and other less-lethal munitions against journalists covering protests. The ruling comes after a lawsuit filed by press rights organizations, which argued that LAPD officers were deliberately targeting and injuring reporters during recent demonstrations against federal immigration policies. The judge's order bars police from using such weapons on journalists who are not posing an imminent threat and forbids officers from interfering with their right to gather information. The decision is being hailed as a significant victory for press freedom.</p>

          <p>A massive Antonov An-124 cargo plane was spotted flying over Kyiv, surprising residents in a city where airspace has been closed to non-combat aircraft since Russia's 2022 invasion. The aircraft, registered to Antonov Airlines, had likely been stranded in Ukraine for years and was being evacuated from the Svyatoshino airfield in Kyiv. It successfully flew over Poland and landed in Leipzig, Germany, where Antonov moved many of its operations. The successful flight out of a warzone is seen as a notable achievement for Ukraine and a point of contention for Russian military commentators.</p>
