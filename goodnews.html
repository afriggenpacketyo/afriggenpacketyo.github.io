          <p>Treasury Secretary Scott Bessent has cautioned Congressional leaders that the U.S. government might default as early as August if Congress fails to raise or suspend the debt limit by mid-July. In a letter to House Speaker Mike Johnson, Bessent stressed the urgency of addressing the debt ceiling before Congress's scheduled recess to prevent financial system havoc and protect America's global standing. The debt ceiling, which was last addressed in 2023, currently stands at over $36 trillion. Failure to act could have serious adverse consequences for financial markets, businesses, and the federal government.</p>

          <p>Financial planning expert Ric Edelman asserts that the traditional 60-40 portfolio (60% stocks, 40% bonds) is no longer viable for long-term retirement income planning. Edelman attributes this to increasing lifespans and potential breakthroughs in health and science, requiring investors to allocate more funds to the stock market to ensure sufficient retirement income. He suggests that a 70% to 80% allocation to equities is reasonable for many investors seeking to avoid outliving their savings. The number of Americans aged 65 and older is projected to reach 95 million by 2060, underscoring the need for financial strategies that account for extended longevity.</p>

Industry figures generally oppose tariffs, and some studio executives are looking at Voight's ideas as a more realistic alternative.

          <p>Epic Games has submitted Fortnite to Apple's App Store, following a court ruling that favored the game maker in a contempt case. Fortnite was removed from iPhones in 2020 after Epic Games updated its software to avoid Apple's commissions. The ruling stated that Apple was not allowed to charge a commission on link-outs or dictate if the links look like buttons, paving the way for Fortnite's return. Apple could still reject Fortnite's submission, and is appealing last month's contempt ruling.</p>

          <p>In a stock market marked by uncertainty, defensive industrial stocks are stepping up as megacap winners fall out of favor. Industrial gas supplier Linde has shown immense pricing power because its products are crucial regardless of the macro environment. Our other industrial names have defensive properties as well, less so than Linde, which might explain why their stocks are not doing as well. Investors have been concerned about the impact of Trump's tariffs on DuPont's China market, but also about the ramifications of a deteriorating economy on its financials, particularly given the cyclical nature of its consumer electronics and autos businesses.</p>
