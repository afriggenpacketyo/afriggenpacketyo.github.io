          <p>Australian Prime Minister Anthony Albanese is promoting a new foreign policy doctrine centered on national sovereignty, drawing inspiration from wartime leader John Curtin. This "Australia first" approach aims to navigate the growing tensions between the United States and China by prioritizing Australia's own strategic interests. While maintaining key alliances like AUKUS and the US partnership, which have broad public support, the government seeks to act independently and shape its own future. The policy shift was articulated in a recent speech, signaling a recalibration of relationships with both allies and rivals.</p>

Once able to communicate, Viraj quickly advanced from basic math to calculus, achieving a near-perfect score on his ACT. He believes his story is not unique and hopes his success will highlight the potential of the entire non-speaking autistic community, emphasizing the importance of providing the right tools and support.</p>

          <p>One year after the attempted assassination of President Trump in Butler, Pennsylvania, the U.S. Secret Service has enhanced its security protocols. The agency is now deploying military-grade drones for aerial reconnaissance and has established mobile command posts to ensure direct radio communication with local law enforcement. These changes address critical failures identified during the 2024 incident, where a drone was missed and communication gaps existed between agencies. The upgrades, demonstrated at the Secret Service's training center, are part of an ongoing effort to prevent a repeat of the attack, which also resulted in the suspension of six personnel.</p>

          <p>A TUI flight from Cancun, Mexico, to London was forced to make an emergency landing in Bangor, Maine, after a fight broke out between two passengers. The altercation led to the diversion, and all 267 passengers had to spend the night in Maine as the flight crew timed out. U.S. Customs and Border Protection removed the two individuals involved from the aircraft; they did not face criminal charges but were processed for expedited removal to their home countries. The 787 Dreamliner, with a relief crew, continued its journey and landed safely at London's Gatwick Airport the following day.</p>

          <p>A New Hampshire judge has denied TikTok's motion to dismiss a lawsuit filed by the state, allowing the case to move forward. The lawsuit alleges that the social media platform uses intentionally addictive and manipulative design features to exploit children and teenagers for commercial gain. The state's attorney general hailed the decision as a crucial step toward holding TikTok accountable for practices that put young users at risk. This case is part of a broader trend of legal challenges by states against tech companies, focusing on platform design and safety policies rather than user-generated content.</p>

          <p>The United States has resumed sending military supplies to Ukraine after a temporary pause, according to Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky. The renewed aid follows a surge in Russian aerial attacks, which prompted President Trump to announce a deal for NATO to purchase and provide U.S. Patriot air defense systems to Ukraine. These systems are critical for intercepting Russian missiles and drones, which caused record civilian casualties in June. U.S. officials have also urged European allies to provide their existing Patriot batteries to expedite delivery, signaling renewed urgency from Washington to bolster Ukraine's defensive capabilities.</p>

This push is part of a broader race with China to achieve dominance in next-generation air warfare.
