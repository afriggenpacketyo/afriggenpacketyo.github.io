        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>In an opinion piece, former EPA administrator Gina McCarthy criticizes the current U.S. administration's focus on fossil fuels, arguing it cedes clean-energy leadership to other nations and ignores escalating climate risks. McCarthy contends that despite federal inaction, significant progress is being driven at the sub-national level by states, cities, and corporations committed to clean energy. She points to record-breaking solar and wind capacity in states like California and Texas as evidence that the transition to renewable energy is continuing, driven by economic and environmental necessity.</p>

          <h2>New Proposal Suggests Storing Carbon as a Hoarded Commodity, Similar to Gold Reserves</h2>

        </div>
        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>A new book proposes a novel approach to climate change by creating a system of cooperative carbon banks that would treat sequestered carbon like a sacred, hoarded commodity, similar to the gold in Fort Knox. The concept involves converting organic waste into a stable carbon form called biochar, which communities would deposit in local banks in exchange for a digital currency. This grassroots system aims to create both financial and social incentives for carbon sequestration, operating independently of government mandates or large corporations to build a post-carbon economy from the ground up.</p>

          <p>Chelsea FC has approved moves for two of its players to Borussia Dortmund, with Carney Chukwuemeka set for a permanent transfer and Aaron Anselmino joining on a season-long loan. The sale of Chukwuemeka will push Chelsea's income from player sales this summer beyond £270 million, helping the club balance its finances and comply with UEFA's football earning rules. While Anselmino's loan is intended to provide him with more playing time for development, the transactions are crucial for Chelsea to register new signings for the upcoming Champions League season.</p>

          <p>Parts of the UK are expected to experience temperatures as high as 30C on the late August Bank Holiday Monday, potentially setting a record in Wales for the period. This warm spell is attributed to tropical air pushed towards the UK by the remnants of Hurricane Erin. However, the same weather system is forecast to bring unsettled conditions, including strong winds and heavy rain, to most of the country starting Tuesday. The brief heatwave comes amid travel disruptions from rail strikes and engineering work, complicating holiday plans for many.</p>
