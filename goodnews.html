          <p>This article discusses borrowing options for homeowners with 100% home equity, highlighting home equity loans and HELOCs as attractive alternatives to personal loans and credit cards due to tax-deductible interest. While 100% equity doesn't allow borrowing the home's full value, it positions homeowners for better rates and terms. The choice between a HELOC and a home equity loan depends on individual preferences and the interest rate environment, with HELOCs currently offering lower rates and potential future affordability if interest rates decline. The article advises careful consideration of long-term affordability before borrowing, emphasizing the home as collateral.</p>

While James Earl Jones' estate granted permission to use AI and archival recordings for future 'Star Wars' projects, SAG-AFTRA emphasizes the need to protect the right to bargain terms and conditions around uses of voice that replace the work of its members.

          <p>A proposal to eliminate federal income taxes on tips, a popular campaign pledge by President Trump, is facing scrutiny for its potential impact on low-income workers. While the tax cut is expected to benefit tipped workers, some analysts argue that it may not provide additional relief for those who already have zero taxable income due to the standard deduction. Concerns have also been raised about the potential for the policy to create wage pressure in the service industry and whether it would reduce the incentive for employers to raise wages.

          <p>The 30-year Treasury yield briefly topped 5% after Moody's downgraded the U.S.'s credit rating, reaching levels not seen since November 2023. The downgrade, from Aaa to Aa1, was attributed to the increasing burden of financing the government's budget deficit and the high cost of rolling over existing debt. Investors initially reacted negatively, but then shook off the downgrade and began buying bonds, driving yields lower. In April, similar increases in Treasury yields led to concerns about financial panic and rising rates for consumers. (not investment advice)</p>
