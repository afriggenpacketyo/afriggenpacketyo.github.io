Mason Edwards pitched effectively, while Caden Hunter secured his first Division I save. USC now stands one win away from their first super regionals appearance since 2005, showcasing the team's resilience under coach Andy Stankiewicz.

Authorities urged the public to avoid the area and stay at least 600 feet away, while beekeepers worked to re-hive the bees. The road was closed for about 24 hours to allow the bees to find their queen and return to their hives. Officials initially reported a much higher number of escaped bees but later corrected the tally with assistance from a beekeeper.
