          <p>A SkyWest flight pilot performed an "aggressive maneuver" to avoid a collision with a B-52 military aircraft while approaching Minot, North Dakota. The pilot informed passengers that the military plane appeared on a converging course unexpectedly, as the airport tower lacks radar and relies on visual confirmation. He apologized for the sudden turn, noting it was the safest course of action and an unusual event. The Air Force acknowledged a B-52 was conducting a flyover for the state fair and, along with the FAA, is investigating the incident.</p>

          <p>A new study reveals that global emergency stockpiles of vaccines for diseases like cholera, Ebola, and meningitis have averted an estimated 6 million cases and 300,000 deaths over the past two decades. These reserves, funded by organizations like Gavi, allow for rapid deployment of vaccines during outbreaks, which is critical since manufacturing can take months. The research highlights the immense public health and economic benefits of this system, calculating over $32 billion in economic gains. However, these findings come amid concerns over declining global health funding, which could threaten the future of these life-saving stockpiles.</p>

          <p>Billionaire Peter Thiel has reportedly made a significant investment in an Ethereum mining company, signaling renewed confidence in the cryptocurrency.

          <p>Analysts from China International Capital Corporation (CICC) are urging China to address "neijuan," or involution, a cycle of inefficient and excessive competition. They recommend creating an "incremental cake" by boosting domestic demand and expanding the market, which would provide a better macroeconomic environment for businesses. The report suggests that enterprises must also focus on research and development to offer differentiated products, fostering a more positive, demand-driven cycle. These recommendations emphasize that top-down government policies are crucial, as actions by companies alone are insufficient to solve the problem. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>High-net-worth individuals are increasingly turning to gold as a safe-haven asset, driven by geopolitical tensions and a depreciating US dollar. Wealth managers report a noticeable uptick in clients, particularly in the US, seeking to diversify their portfolios with gold, with some family offices allocating up to 10%. Investment methods range from buying fractions of unallocated gold bars held in bank vaults to purchasing physical bullions stored in highly secure locations, including former Swiss military bunkers. This trend reflects a broader market movement, as gold prices have surged roughly 25% this year. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>A 1906 shipwreck off the Belgian coast is being used as a novel habitat to reintroduce rare native flat oysters to the North Sea. The Belreefs project deposited 200,000 oyster larvae into the ship's hull, aiming to create a biodiversity sanctuary where fishing is banned. Scientists explain that oyster reefs are crucial for marine ecosystems, as they purify water and provide breeding grounds for other species. The initiative seeks to restore oyster populations that were decimated by overfishing and disease, turning a piece of cultural heritage into a tool for ecological restoration.</p>

          <p>Ryanair is contemplating raising the bonus it pays to airport staff for identifying and charging passengers with oversized luggage. Currently, employees receive about €1.50 for each oversized bag they intercept, a practice intended to enforce the airline's baggage rules and reduce boarding delays. CEO Michael O'Leary stated that while over 99% of passengers comply, the incentive helps manage the "scourge" of excess baggage. The discussion comes as the airline reports a significant jump in quarterly profits, partly due to a strong Easter season and higher average fares.</p>
