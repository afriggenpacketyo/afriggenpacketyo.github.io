        </div>
        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>According to psychologist Mark Travers, the most frequent cause of arguments among couples is not money or chores, but rather the tone of voice used during conversations. Research indicates that nonverbal cues, especially tone, carry more emotional weight than the actual words spoken, often turning simple questions into perceived accusations. The article suggests that partners can de-escalate potential fights by becoming more self-aware. This can be achieved by pausing to rephrase a harsh statement or by calmly asking a partner to speak in a different way, thereby interrupting a negative cycle.</p>

          <p>The women's football transfer fee record has been broken five times in 2025, signaling significant financial growth and increased marketability for the sport. This rapid escalation in player valuations, particularly in English and American leagues, highlights a positive trend of investment and professionalization. However, experts warn that these soaring fees could widen the competitive and financial gap between the wealthiest clubs and other leagues around the world, such as Germany's Bundesliga. This trend may concentrate top talent in just a few leagues, potentially hindering the sport's global development.</p>

        </div>
        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>New research indicates that the extensive HPV vaccination program in the United States has been so effective that herd immunity against the virus causing cervical cancer is now a realistic possibility. The study, published in JAMA Pediatrics, found that high vaccination rates among both boys and girls have led to a dramatic decline in HPV infections, even among unvaccinated women. This suggests strong community-wide protection against the virus. Experts emphasize that maintaining these high vaccination rates will be crucial to sustaining this progress and potentially eliminating the disease as a public health problem.</p>

          <p>A series of small earthquakes occurred near Big Bear in San Bernardino County, with the largest registering a magnitude of 3.5. The U.S. Geological Survey reported that the seismic activity began late Saturday and continued into Sunday morning, centered in the San Bernardino Mountains. The shaking was described as weak and was not expected to cause any damage, with vibrations comparable to a large truck passing by. The area's last major seismic event was in 1992, when a magnitude 6.3 earthquake caused substantial damage in the region.</p>

          <p>George Russell secured his second victory of the season at the Singapore Grand Prix, a race marked by internal friction at the McLaren team. The main drama unfolded at the start when McLaren driver Lando Norris made contact with his teammate and title rival, Oscar Piastri, while passing him at the first corner. Piastri expressed his frustration over the team radio, claiming the move was unfair, which revived scrutiny over the team's management of its competing drivers. Despite the tension, McLaren successfully clinched the constructors' championship at the event.</p>

The achievement is a remarkable turnaround for the club and for coach Bradley Carnell, who took over in January after the team failed to make the playoffs last season.

          <p>The voracious energy demand from artificial intelligence and data centers is fueling a resurgence in nuclear power, with some calling it a "nuclear renaissance." Tech giants like Microsoft and Google are investing in restarting decommissioned nuclear plants and developing next-generation small modular reactors (SMRs) to secure stable, carbon-free electricity. This shift is driven by the realization that renewable sources alone may not meet the massive, constant power needs of AI computing. The trend is creating new economic opportunities in communities with existing nuclear infrastructure, such as Covert Township, Michigan.</p>

          <p>Psychologist Jean Twenge identifies a crucial, non-negotiable rule for parents in the digital age: prohibit all electronic devices from children's bedrooms overnight. She argues this is imperative for protecting sleep, which is essential for a child's physical health, mental well-being, and cognitive development. Research shows that late-night device use is a primary cause of insufficient sleep among adolescents, a risk factor for numerous negative outcomes, including depression. Twenge advises parents to be firm and transparent about implementing this rule, even if it is met with initial resistance from their children.</p>
