          <h2>China's Private Firms Gain Legal Recourse with New Law</h2>
          <div class="timestamp">2025-05-02 22:00:18 EDT</div>

          <p>China has passed the Private Economy Promotion Law, designed to bolster the private economy, set to come into force on May 20. Observers and entrepreneurs are closely following the implementation of the law to determine whether the measure has teeth. Of particular interest is how the law will impact the ability of firms to take local-level governments to court, and how it will protect the private sector from fines that have long been considered arbitrary and profit-driven. The law forbids the use of administrative measures to intervene in economic disputes, as well as unscrupulous, profit-driven fine collections and asset seizures.</p>

          <p>A federal judge has ruled that President Trump's executive order targeting the law firm Perkins Coie is unconstitutional, calling it an attack on the American legal system. The order, which imposed punitive measures on the firm for representing clients Trump disliked, was permanently blocked by Judge Beryl Howell. She framed the targeting of Perkins Coie as an assault on the independence of the legal profession and the judicial system. The ruling affirms core constitutional freedoms, including free speech and the right to counsel.</p>

          <p>The Trump administration has clarified that it is not renaming Veterans Day, despite President Trump's earlier announcement that November 11 would be designated "Victory Day for World War I." White House Press Secretary Karoline Leavitt stated that it will be an additional proclamation, not a replacement. Trump also intends to designate May 8 as "Victory Day for World War II." Establishing a federal holiday or observance requires congressional approval.</p>

          <h2>Increased Autism Diagnoses: Exploring the Reasons Behind the Rise</h2>

        </div>
        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>There has been a significant rise in autism diagnoses, prompting questions about whether there are genuinely more autistic people or if the diagnostic criteria have broadened. Studies show a substantial increase in diagnoses, particularly among women and adults. This rise is attributed to evolving definitions of autism, better understanding of how it presents in different populations, and increased awareness. While some worry about potential distortions of public perception, others emphasize the importance of recognizing and supporting previously undiagnosed individuals.</p>

          <p>Health and Human Services Secretary Robert F. Kennedy Jr. is advocating for placebo-controlled trials for new vaccines, a move described as a significant departure from past practices. This policy change would require vaccines to undergo studies where half of the participants receive a placebo. Experts have raised ethical concerns about such trials when effective vaccines already exist. It remains unclear what HHS considers a "new" vaccine and how this policy would impact future vaccine development and rollout.</p>

          <p>Reform UK experienced significant gains in the recent English local elections, securing control of multiple councils and winning a key by-election.

The results highlight the rise of Reform UK and the challenges facing the established parties. The immediate practical questions arising out of these results are how Labour and the Conservatives respond and how Reform adjusts to the realities of power.</p>
