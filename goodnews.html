          <p>Grant Napear, the former Sacramento Kings broadcaster fired in 2020 for an "All Lives Matter" tweet, has secured a new weekday radio show in Sacramento. In a recent interview, Napear stated that many prominent figures in sports media privately expressed outrage and support but were too afraid of public backlash to defend him openly. He described the difficult experience of being ostracized and the five-year wait to return to the industry he loves. The article frames his new opportunity as a significant personal and professional rectification after the contentious dismissal.</p>

          <p>A new report from Realtor.com indicates a regional divergence in U.S. housing market trends, with home prices falling in some Southern and Western metropolitan areas while continuing to rise in the Northeast and Midwest. Cities like Austin and Miami have seen significant price drops, attributed to increased housing inventory from a pandemic-era construction boom and homes staying on the market longer. Conversely, markets such as New York and Milwaukee are experiencing price hikes due to tight inventory and regulations that make new construction more difficult. This supply-and-demand dynamic is creating vastly different conditions for homebuyers and sellers across the country. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>The Trent Rockets started their season in The Hundred cricket tournament with a decisive six-wicket win against the Birmingham Phoenix. The Rockets' victory was anchored by an exceptional bowling performance, with fast bowler Lockie Ferguson taking three wickets for just 20 runs, restricting Phoenix to a modest score of 122-6. Despite an early dismissal of star batsman Joe Root, the Rockets' chase was never in doubt, led by Tom Banton's 43 runs. The team reached the target with 22 balls remaining, showcasing a well-rounded strength that positions them as strong contenders in the tournament.</p>

          <p>Shares of MP Materials, a U.S.-based rare earth miner, rose over 4% after the company reported a smaller-than-expected loss for the second quarter, driven by record production of neodymium-praseodymium (NdPr) oxide. This key material is essential for permanent magnets used in electric vehicles and electronics, and the production increase signals progress toward profitability. The positive results follow a major investment from the Department of Defense, which purchased $400 million in stock and guaranteed a price floor for NdPr. The company is now focused on scaling up its magnet production facility in Texas. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>The U.S. government, under both the Biden and Trump administrations, is providing significant federal funding to bolster domestic mining and refining capabilities to counter reliance on foreign sources, particularly China. A key project is a new nickel processing plant in Beulah, North Dakota, supported by a $114 million grant, which will process ore for electric vehicle batteries and has already secured a contract with Tesla. This bipartisan effort, including funds from the Defense Production Act, aims to secure a domestic supply chain for critical minerals deemed strategic assets for both clean energy technology and national security.

          <p>British tennis player Emma Raducanu is working intensively with her new coach, Francisco Roig, as she aims to climb the WTA rankings and prepare for the upcoming U.S. Open. Having recently rebuilt her ranking to No. 30, Raducanu is focusing on refining her technique to better compete against the world's top players. While she has performed well against mid-ranked opponents, she has struggled against more powerful shotmakers. The partnership with Roig, a former coach to Rafael Nadal, marks a hopeful new phase aimed at elevating her game to a higher, more competitive level.</p>

          <p>This article explores the idea that simple physical movement can be a powerful tool for overcoming creative blocks and improving focus, particularly for those with sedentary jobs. Drawing on insights from author Kelly Corrigan, it recommends strategies like three-minute dance breaks to change one's mood and taking phone calls while walking to incorporate more activity. The piece also emphasizes working with the body's natural energy rhythms rather than against them, such as scheduling less demanding tasks during low-energy periods. These small adjustments are presented as integral parts of a healthy and effective creative process.</p>

          <p>Manchester United has officially reopened its Carrington training ground following a £50 million, year-long refurbishment initiated by new co-owner Sir Jim Ratcliffe. The upgraded facility, once described by Ratcliffe as a "gloomy rabbit warren," now features light, open-plan spaces to encourage interaction, a state-of-the-art gym, and advanced medical and recovery areas, including smart urinals for hydration analysis. The renovation also added player-requested amenities like a barber's area and a Formula 1 simulator. The overhaul aims to provide a world-class environment necessary for the club to compete at the highest level, addressing long-standing criticisms about its outdated infrastructure.</p>

          <p>Italian football club AC Milan is reportedly keen on signing Manchester United striker Rasmus Hojlund, just as United finalizes a deal for a new forward, Benjamin Sesko. Despite Hojlund recently stating his intent to stay at Old Trafford, increased competition may make a move possible. It is understood that Milan is proposing an initial loan deal for the Danish forward with an option to buy next summer, a structure influenced by both clubs' financial constraints due to their absence from European competition this season. The situation is expected to become clearer in the coming week.</p>

          <p>Tech giants Meta and Alphabet reported stronger-than-expected quarterly sales, largely driven by the success of their AI-powered advertising systems. Meta's CEO Mark Zuckerberg credited AI with improving efficiency and contributing to a 22% year-over-year revenue increase, with a notable recovery in ad spending from Asia-based retailers. In contrast, smaller platforms like Snap and Pinterest delivered lukewarm results, struggling with internal platform issues and advertiser uncertainty. The results underscore a growing gap where large, AI-investing companies are capturing a greater share of the digital ad market, while smaller competitors face significant pressure.

          <p>This article profiles new Los Angeles Dodgers outfielder Alex Call, detailing how he transformed himself from a strikeout-prone minor leaguer into one of MLB's toughest at-bats. After a dismal 2019 season, Call dedicated himself to improving his plate discipline, using the 2020 pandemic shutdown to work on his swing and train with a virtual reality hitting system. This commitment paid off, drastically cutting his strikeout rate and helping him reach the major leagues. Now known as a "straight grinder," his ability to work counts and get on base is the key skill the Dodgers acquired at the trade deadline.</p>

          <p>Tesla has been granted a permit to operate a ride-hailing business across Texas, a significant step in its ambition to compete with Uber and Lyft. The permit allows Tesla Robotaxi LLC to run a "transportation network company" anywhere in the state, including with fully autonomous vehicles without a human safety driver. The company has been running a limited, invitation-only pilot program in Austin with human-supervised vehicles, which has drawn some federal scrutiny after vehicles were observed disobeying traffic rules. This permit marks a key regulatory victory for Tesla as it lags behind competitors like Waymo in the autonomous vehicle market.</p>
