        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Following a fourth consecutive loss that dropped their record to 1-5, the Baltimore Ravens are expecting quarterback Lamar Jackson to return for their Week 8 game. Jackson has missed the last two games with a hamstring injury, during which the team's offense has struggled, scoring a combined total of just 13 points. Head coach John Harbaugh expressed confidence in Jackson's return, stating it would provide a significant boost for the struggling team. The two-time MVP's presence is seen as crucial for any chance of salvaging the season and making a push for the playoffs.</p>

          <p>The Los Angeles Dodgers have altered their pitching strategy for the National League Championship Series, pushing Shohei Ohtani's next start to later in the series. Instead of Ohtani pitching Game 2, Yoshinobu Yamamoto will take the mound, allowing him to potentially pitch again on regular rest in a potential Game 6. This move limits Ohtani to one start in the series but could allow him to focus on improving his hitting after a poor performance in the previous round. Manager Dave Roberts stated the decision was based on optimizing pitcher usage throughout the potential seven-game series.</p>

These individuals were among the 251 people abducted during the Hamas attacks on October 7. The article provides brief biographies and personal stories for each of the 20 hostages, including musicians, students, and soldiers, detailing the circumstances of their capture and the efforts of their families over the past two years. Their release is part of the first phase of the agreement, which will also see Israel free approximately 2,000 Palestinian prisoners.</p>

          <p>The National Weather Service has forecast a "winter-like" storm to hit Southern California from late Monday through Wednesday, bringing a high chance of significant rainfall. The heaviest precipitation is expected Monday night and Tuesday, with totals potentially reaching 1.5 inches in most areas and up to 3.5 inches in mountains. This has prompted a flood watch for recent burn areas due to the risk of mudslides. The early-season storm arrives as La Niña conditions are officially present, a climate pattern that typically results in drier-than-average winters for the region.</p>

          <p>Actress Arianne Zucker has reached a settlement in her lawsuit against the producers of the soap opera “Days of Our Lives.” Zucker, who played Nicole Walker on the show for over two decades, had filed the suit in 2024, alleging she was subjected to sexual harassment and discrimination by former executive producer Albert Alarr. The lawsuit also claimed retaliation by the production company after she raised concerns. While no details of the settlement were disclosed, the filing marks a conclusion to the legal dispute that brought public attention to the on-set conduct.</p>

          <p>As he traveled to a peace summit in Egypt, U.S. President Donald Trump declared that the war in Gaza "is over." His statement comes as a ceasefire between Israel and Hamas holds, with the final living hostages expected to be released on Monday in exchange for around 2,000 Palestinian prisoners. The summit in Sharm el-Sheikh will mark the agreement, with international leaders in attendance. Meanwhile, Germany has pledged millions for Gaza's reconstruction, and aid convoys are beginning to enter the devastated territory to address the humanitarian crisis after two years of conflict.</p>

          <p>Ahmed al-Sharaa, Syria's new president, faces the monumental task of unifying and rebuilding a nation shattered by 14 years of civil war. Formerly a leader of an al Qaeda affiliate and designated a terrorist by the U.S., al-Sharaa led the forces that overthrew the Assad regime. He is now seeking international aid and the lifting of economic sanctions to fund reconstruction, estimated to cost up to $900 billion. In his first U.S. television interview, he outlined his vision for a new Syria, addressing challenges like sectarian violence and tense relations with Israel, while promising an eventual transition to a democratic government.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>As adults navigate changing life stages like careers and families, maintaining friendships often becomes a challenge, with research showing people lose about half their friends every seven years. Psychologists and relationship experts advise being more intentional and creative, such as inviting friends along for errands or mundane tasks to create connection. They stress the importance of in-person interaction over messaging and encourage reaching out to rekindle old bonds, overcoming the "liking gap" where people underestimate how positively they are perceived. Prioritizing these platonic relationships is crucial for combating loneliness.</p>

        </div>
        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Psychologists from the University of Sussex are using thermal cameras to study stress, discovering that a drop in a person's nose temperature is a reliable indicator of their stress level. During an experiment involving an impromptu speech and mental arithmetic, a reporter's nose temperature dropped as blood flow was redirected to the eyes and ears, a physiological fight-or-flight response. The researchers believe this non-invasive technique could be a "game changer" for stress research, potentially helping to identify individuals at risk for anxiety or depression by measuring how quickly they recover.</p>

          <p>U.S. stock futures surged after President Donald Trump made comments aimed at calming market fears following his recent threat to impose 100% tariffs on Chinese imports. In a social media post, Trump stated "Don't worry about China, it will all be fine!" which investors interpreted as a sign that the tariff threat may be a negotiating tactic rather than a firm policy. This has led to a revival of the "TACO" (Trump Always Chickens Out) trade, where markets bet that maximalist threats will be walked back. The shift in tone suggests a potential de-escalation, prompting a rebound. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>Talks for a potential merger between Paramount and Warner Bros. Discovery are ongoing, even after WBD's board rejected an initial offer of about $20 per share. Paramount, backed by billionaire Larry Ellison and his son David, is reportedly preparing a second bid for the rival media giant. A successful acquisition would dramatically reshape the entertainment industry, potentially consolidating assets like CNN and CBS News, and combining major Hollywood studios. The move is seen as an effort by Paramount to gain scale and content to better compete with streaming giants like Netflix and Amazon.</p>

          <p>A recent meeting between Indian Prime Minister Narendra Modi and Chinese President Xi Jinping signals a potential reset in the relationship between the two Asian powers. Amid growing friction with the U.S. under President Trump, India appears to be pursuing "strategic autonomy" by engaging with China as a partner rather than a rival. The leaders agreed that their differences should not escalate into disputes and committed to resolving their border issues. This diplomatic warming, which includes the resumption of direct flights, could be a move by India to build a coalition of eastern powers in an increasingly polarized global landscape.</p>
