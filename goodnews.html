        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Tesla's stock value saw a significant increase after CEO Elon Musk disclosed his first open-market purchase of the company's shares since 2020. Musk acquired approximately 2.57 million shares for about $1 billion, a move widely interpreted by traders as a strong signal of his confidence in the electric vehicle manufacturer. This purchase, his largest ever by value, comes as the company faces challenges from slumping sales and increased competition. Analysts remain divided on the stock's future, though some see the move as Musk reinforcing his commitment to Tesla's long-term transformation into an AI and robotics-focused company.

          <p>The horror movie genre has seen a banner year in 2025, surpassing $1 billion at the domestic box office for the first time since 2017 with hits like "The Conjuring: Last Rites" and "Sinners." This success is notable not just for its financial performance but also for the high critical praise many of these films have received, positioning some as potential Oscar contenders. The article explores the trend of creators with comedy backgrounds, such as Jordan Peele and Zach Cregger, finding success in horror. It suggests that the two genres share a structural DNA in their use of timing, tension, and release, making the transition a natural one for many filmmakers.</p>

          <p>The UK and US are set to sign the Atlantic Partnership for Advanced Nuclear Energy, an agreement aimed at accelerating the development of nuclear power in both nations. The deal, to be finalized during President Trump's state visit, intends to halve the regulatory approval time for new reactors and unlock billions in private investment. A key component involves a deal for US firm X-Energy and the UK's Centrica to build up to 12 advanced modular reactors in Hartlepool. While proponents tout the creation of thousands of jobs and enhanced energy security, critics like Greenpeace raise concerns over spiraling costs and construction delays compared to renewable alternatives.</p>

        </div>
        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>An increasing number of consumers are using rent reporting services to have their monthly payments included in their credit files, according to a new TransUnion survey. In 2025, 13% of renters reported their payment activity, which can significantly benefit those with limited or no credit history, often adding up to 60 points to a credit score. The practice is most popular among younger generations, with 18% of Gen Z renters participating. Financial experts advise consumers to carefully consider the costs, ensure the service reports to all three major credit bureaus, and understand the implications of potentially missing payments before enrolling in such a program.

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Xavier Becerra, a Democratic candidate for governor of California, is launching a campaign on TikTok exclusively in Spanish to target the platform's large Hispanic user base. This strategy aims to counter a recent rightward shift among some Latino voters and engage them on a platform where they are demographically overrepresented. The move comes as the Trump administration phases out many multilingual government services. Becerra's campaign plans to post a mix of policy explainers, direct-to-camera messages, and collaborations with influencers to create a two-way conversation with a key demographic in a state where political outreach is increasingly digital and multilingual.</p>

          <h2>China Plans to Nearly Double Energy Storage Capacity by 2027</h2>

          <p>China has announced an action plan to significantly expand its energy storage capabilities, aiming to almost double its current capacity to over 180 gigawatts by 2027. The plan, backed by an estimated investment of $35 billion, focuses primarily on lithium-ion battery systems to support the country's rapidly growing renewable energy sector. It also encourages the development of alternative technologies like hydrogen and compressed-air storage. This initiative is crucial for stabilizing the power grid as China integrates more intermittent energy sources like solar and wind, reinforcing its position as the global leader in energy storage technology.

          <p>A new program in Flint, Michigan, called Rx Kids, is providing unconditional cash transfers to every pregnant resident, offering $1,500 during pregnancy and $500 monthly for the infant's first year. Recent studies on the initiative, the first of its kind in the U.S., show significant positive outcomes, including lower rates of maternal postpartum depression and improved infant health, which has saved millions in neonatal intensive care costs. The program was born out of community advocacy following the city's water crisis and aims to combat child poverty directly. Its universal, non-stigmatizing approach has garnered bipartisan support and is expanding to other communities.</p>

          <p>New Zealand has launched an ambitious conservation project, Predator Free 2050, aiming to eradicate invasive predator species like possums, rats, and stoats to save its native bird populations. A significant part of this nationwide effort relies on citizen volunteers, including students and homeowners, who set up traps in local parks and their own backyards. These invasive mammals, introduced by human settlers, have driven many native bird species, such as the flightless kiwi, to extinction or endangerment. The program is seen as both a biological and social challenge, requiring widespread community participation to succeed in restoring the country's unique ecosystems.</p>

          <p>The Crown Prosecution Service has dropped charges against Christopher Cash, a former parliamentary researcher, and Christopher Berry, who were accused of spying for China under the Official Secrets Act. The prosecutor informed the court that the evidence gathered did not meet the legal threshold for a trial to proceed, leading to not guilty verdicts being entered. Cash described the two years since his arrest as a "nightmare" and expressed relief that "justice has been served." The case had previously drawn a sharp rebuke from Beijing, which labeled the allegations as "malicious slander" and a "self-staged political farce."</p>

          <p>Colombia's Constitutional Court has ruled that Meta acted arbitrarily and violated the freedom of expression of porn star Esperanza Gomez by closing her Instagram account. The court found that Meta applied its policies on nudity inconsistently, as other accounts with similar content remained active, and failed to provide a clear justification for the closure. In a significant decision, the court ordered Meta to review and adjust Instagram's terms of use to ensure users have clear mechanisms for challenging content moderation decisions. Gomez had argued that the account closure, which affected her five million followers, hindered her ability to work.</p>

The Warner Family Foundation will provide scholarships for young artists, while a second organization, River & Ember, will focus on strengthening bonds between parents and children. In a social media post on their wedding anniversary, she publicly identified herself for the first time since her husband's drowning death in July.

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Senator Elizabeth Warren and Representative Steve Cohen have reintroduced legislation to ban employers from using credit checks in the hiring process. The bill aims to amend the Fair Credit Reporting Act to prevent companies from requiring or procuring credit reports from job applicants, a practice they argue is discriminatory and makes no sense. Proponents of the bill note that using financial history to vet candidates disproportionately harms minorities and women, and that poor credit is often linked to circumstances like medical debt or unemployment, not job performance. Approximately half of U.S. employers currently use credit reports in their hiring decisions. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>Theatrical re-releases of classic movies like "Jaws," "Star Wars," and "Back to a Future" are performing strongly at the box office, often out-earning new films on their opening weekends. This trend is driven by audience nostalgia and a desire for a communal viewing experience away from streaming services at home. For theater owners, these anniversary screenings help fill schedules that have been thinner since the pandemic and attract consistent crowds, particularly mid-week. Studios see it as a low-risk way to generate revenue from existing assets and build hype for upcoming franchise installments, indicating a growing market for cinematic retro experiences.</p>
