          <h2>UK Government Pledges to Halve Sewage Pollution in Waterways by 2030</h2>
          <div class="timestamp">2025-07-20 06:16:12 EDT</div>
        </div>
        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>The UK government has announced plans for a "water revolution," aiming to cut sewage discharges in England and Wales by half by 2030. Environment Secretary Steve Reed described the water sector as "broken" and vowed tougher regulations, including potential prison sentences for non-compliant water company bosses, though he ruled out nationalization. The pledge follows public outrage over pollution levels and represents the first time a clear numerical target has been set for reducing spills. Critics, however, note the pledge is political and not legally binding, while the opposition questions how the required £104 billion investment will be funded without overburdening consumers.</p>

          <p>China's defense ministry has announced that China and Vietnam will conduct their first-ever joint army training exercise this month in China's Guangxi region. The drill, themed around joint border patrol, aims to deepen practical cooperation between the two militaries. This move comes as the two nations mark the 75th anniversary of diplomatic relations and strengthen their ties in other areas. Economically, China is Vietnam's largest trading partner, and the closer military cooperation follows a visit by Chinese President Xi Jinping, who called for unity against "unilateral bullying" amid the U.S. trade war.</p>

          <h2>Italian Bear That Fatally Attacked Jogger is Relocated to German Sanctuary</h2>
          <div class="timestamp">2025-07-20 06:01:00 EDT</div>
        </div>
        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>A brown bear known as JJ4, which killed a 26-year-old jogger in northern Italy last year, has been moved to a wildlife sanctuary in Germany's Black Forest. The relocation follows extensive legal battles and protests from animal rights groups, which successfully overturned an initial order to euthanize the bear. The incident had sparked a significant debate in Italy over human-wildlife conflict, particularly concerning the EU-funded "Life Ursus" bear reintroduction project. JJ4 will now live in a secure, specially designed enclosure at the German park, where her mother has been housed since 2010.</p>

          <h2>Fossil Find in China Suggests Some Pterosaurs Were Herbivores</h2>

          <p>The discovery of a pterosaur fossil in northeastern China is challenging long-held beliefs about the diet of these ancient flying reptiles. The fossil, a species named Sinopterus atavismus, contained microscopic plant mineral deposits called phytoliths in its stomach. This finding provides the first direct evidence of stomach contents for this type of pterosaur and strongly suggests it was a herbivore. The fossil also contained small quartz crystals, likely gastroliths, which are stones swallowed by many modern animals to help grind tough plant matter, further supporting the theory of a plant-based diet for this creature.</p>

          <p>Using the James Webb Space Telescope, astronomers have for the first time captured the earliest known evidence of rocky planet formation around a very young, sun-like star named HOPS-315. Located about 1,370 light-years away, the infant star's surrounding gas disk showed signs of silicate minerals and silicon monoxide gas condensing. These are the fundamental building blocks believed to have formed Earth and other rocky planets in our own solar system. This groundbreaking observation provides a direct glimpse into the initial stages of planet creation, suggesting that the process that formed Earth may be common throughout the universe.</p>

          <p>South Africa is making a concerted effort to increase its exports to China to counter a growing trade deficit and brace for a potential 30% US tariff hike. A high-level South African delegation visited Beijing to promote investment and seek opportunities to diversify exports beyond raw materials to value-added goods like pharmaceuticals and automotive products. Deputy President Paul Mashatile highlighted the need to address market access barriers in China to create a more balanced trade relationship. This strategic pivot underscores the economic pressures nations face amid escalating global trade tensions, particularly between the U.S. and China.</p>
