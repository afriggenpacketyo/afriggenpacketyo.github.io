        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>As protests continue in Los Angeles, officials have clarified the rules of force for the deployed National Guard and Marines, stating their primary task is to protect federal buildings and personnel. Troops are carrying weapons, but the weapons are not loaded with ammunition, and they will not engage crowds unless necessary or patrol city streets, and they will not use rubber bullets or pepper spray. Police Chief Jim McDonnell expressed concerns about logistical challenges and emphasized the need for clear communication between agencies. The rules could change if President Trump invokes the Insurrection Act, but the current focus is on de-escalation and coordination.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>A cross-party group of MPs has released a report criticizing the UK's statutory parental leave system, calling it one of the worst in the developed world and highlighting its fundamental flaws and outdated gender stereotypes. The report recommends increasing paternity pay to 90% or more and extending paternity leave to six weeks, emphasizing the need for significant investment to improve support for working families. Many families find shared parental leave unnecessarily complex and burdensome, with low usage rates and lack of awareness among fathers. The report is released on the eve of the world's first dad strike, with fathers picketing for an overhaul of parental leave policies.</p>

          <p>Washington D.C. is preparing for a large military parade honoring the Army's 250th birthday and President Trump's 79th birthday, with extensive security measures including 18 miles of fencing and 175 magnetometers. Officials anticipate a large turnout and are also preparing for potential counter-protests and possible spillover from immigration-related clashes in Los Angeles. The parade has been designated a National Special Security Event, requiring enhanced coordination among various law enforcement agencies. While the Army birthday celebration was planned months in advance, Trump's involvement transformed the event into a massive military parade.</p>

        </div>
        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>New government guidance in England suggests that teachers can use artificial intelligence (AI) to automate routine tasks like marking and writing letters to parents. The Department for Education (DfE) emphasizes that AI should be used for low-stakes marking, such as quizzes and homework, and that teachers must always check the results. AI can also be used to generate routine letters to parents, such as those regarding head lice outbreaks. While AI offers opportunities to save time and focus on face-to-face teaching, risks such as data breaches and marking errors must be carefully managed.</p>

          <p>Senior officials from the U.S. and China met in London to discuss trade, with expectations that Beijing will lift export controls on rare earth minerals. The meeting followed a phone conversation between Presidents Trump and Xi, and the U.S. is seeking the removal of export controls on critical minerals used in high-tech products. China has criticized the U.S. for imposing discriminatory measures, and recently approved export licenses for rare earth-related items. Amid the trade tensions, Chinese exports to the U.S. have fallen, while imports have also decreased.</p>

          <p>Chinese electric cars are becoming more popular and affordable, but concerns are growing about potential security risks and the impact on established manufacturers. Companies like BYD are expanding aggressively in Europe, leading to increased competition and prompting action from the US and EU. While consumers may benefit from more affordable EVs, experts warn about potential security risks from hacking and spyware, and the challenges faced by European manufacturers in maintaining their dominance. The UK has not yet taken action against Chinese EV imports, and there is debate about the extent of the security threat.</p>
