          <p>Canada has pledged to significantly increase its defense spending to meet NATO's 2% of GDP target years ahead of schedule, now aiming for March of next year. Prime Minister Mark Carney announced this military buildup, including investments in submarines, aircraft, and ships, to counter threats from hostile governments and ensure Arctic security. He also criticized Washington's approach to trade, stating that the country was "too reliant" on the United States for defense. The plan includes a C$9.3 billion increase in funding and the creation of a new defense procurement agency to expedite equipment acquisition.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>A federal judge in New York dismissed Justin Baldoni's $400 million countersuit against Blake Lively, Ryan Reynolds, and others, ending a heated legal feud between the "It Ends With Us" co-stars. The lawsuit stemmed from Lively's accusations of sexual harassment against Baldoni, which he denied, claiming Lively pushed a false narrative against him. Lively's lawyers hailed the dismissal as a complete vindication and look forward to seeking attorneys' fees and damages against Baldoni. The judge's decision follows DailyMail reporter James Vituscka's admission of a mistake in the use of the phrase "sexually assaulted" in text messages related to the case.</p>

        </div>
        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>The increasing demand for clean energy technologies is driving a surge in the need for critical minerals like lithium, cobalt, and copper, essential for solar panels, batteries, and electric motors. These minerals are unevenly distributed globally, leading to potential supply chain vulnerabilities and environmental concerns. The Trump administration is focused on increasing domestic production of these minerals, while China, a major producer, has imposed export limits, disrupting the market. Scientists are also exploring alternative materials and more efficient mining methods to mitigate these constraints and ensure a sustainable clean energy future.</p>

          <p>Warner Bros. Discovery (WBD) is splitting into two companies, raising concerns about the future of TNT Sports and its live sports rights. One company will focus on streaming and studios, while the other, Global Networks, will house TNT Sports and legacy cable networks. CEO David Zaslav indicated that the Global Networks team will decide how to monetize TNT Sports' streaming and digital rights, potentially licensing them to the Streaming and Studios business or other media companies. A merger with Comcast's spinout, Versant, is another possibility, as Versant seeks to expand its sports rights portfolio.</p>
