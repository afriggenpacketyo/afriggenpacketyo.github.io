          <p>President Trump is set to announce a historic peace agreement between Azerbaijan and Armenia at the White House, with both nations' leaders expected to attend. The deal aims to resolve decades of tension that most recently flared into conflict in 2023 over a disputed region. As part of the pact, Armenia will grant the U.S. development rights to a new transit corridor, enhancing access to the West without crossing through Russia or Iran. U.S. officials have been working for months to broker this agreement, seeing it as a crucial step for regional stability and energy transit.</p>

Despite the company's stock falling, the data paves the way for a new, needle-free alternative in the booming weight loss drug market. While the weight loss is less than that of leading injectables like Wegovy, doctors noted the pill could be transformative for patients hesitant about injections. The company plans to submit the drug for regulatory approval by the end of the year.</p>

          <p>The probability of Federal Reserve Governor Christopher Waller becoming the next Fed chair has surpassed 50% on the prediction market Kalshi, making him the new front-runner. His odds surged following reports that President Trump's advisors favor his data-driven approach to monetary policy. Waller, a Trump nominee from 2020, recently dissented from the Fed's decision to hold rates, arguing the stance was overly cautious. He has overtaken previous favorites Kevin Warsh and Kevin Hassett, both of whom have also been praised by Trump for their advocacy of lower interest rates. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>UK Foreign Secretary David Lammy will host U.S. Vice President JD Vance at Chevening House, his official country residence in Kent, during Vance's private family holiday. The two officials, who have reportedly bonded over shared backgrounds and faith, will hold a bilateral meeting to discuss the U.S.-UK relationship. This informal diplomatic engagement follows a recent trend of regular meetings between the two since Lammy took office. The visit occurs a few weeks after President Trump's private trip to Scotland and ahead of his planned full state visit in September.</p>

          <p>President Trump is set to sign an executive order directing the Department of Labor to review guidance on including alternative assets like private equity, real estate, and cryptocurrencies in 401(k) retirement plans. This move is seen as a significant victory for the alternative asset industry, which has been pushing for access to the trillions of dollars held in defined contribution plans. While these assets offer potential for higher returns, they also carry greater risks due to higher fees, less transparency, and longer lockup periods, which have traditionally kept them out of such retirement vehicles.

          <p>With the Trump administration signaling greater acceptance of cryptocurrency, including a new executive order to broaden its availability in 401(k)s, investors are re-evaluating digital assets. Crypto ETFs, which have seen record inflows of $13 billion this year, offer a convenient way to gain exposure without directly holding the currencies. While some advisors now recommend significant portfolio allocations to digital assets, others remain wary of the risks.

This commitment, which includes a $2.5 billion expansion for glass supplier Corning, helped shift focus from Apple's perceived lag in artificial intelligence strategy, boosting its stock price. The investment could also create a competitive advantage over rivals like Samsung, which may now face higher tariff rates if they don't increase their own U.S. investments.

Exchange-traded funds (ETFs), particularly those focused on non-physical assets like cryptocurrencies or domestically-focused sectors like nuclear energy, are highlighted as tools to manage risk.

          <p>This opinion article argues that the decline of politeness, exacerbated by anonymous online interactions and AI communication, is detrimental to personal happiness. Citing research, the author explains that being polite, even to nonhuman entities like AI bots, can increase one's own happiness and reduce anger. Conversely, witnessing or engaging in rudeness and sarcasm can lower well-being. The author suggests making courtesy a conscious habit, renouncing snark, and responding to rudeness with dignity as practical steps to improve one's own mood and counteract a broader cultural trend of incivility.</p>

          <p>Startup Neurable is integrating brain-computer interface (BCI) technology into everyday devices like headphones to monitor and improve cognitive functions. Using non-invasive EEG sensors, their technology can track brainwave data to measure focus, and the company is now exploring applications for tracking brain health, potentially detecting early signs of conditions like Alzheimer's or depression. Unlike most health trackers that measure downstream effects like heart rate, Neurable's approach taps directly into brain activity. The company has already partnered with Master & Dynamic to release a pair of BCI-equipped headphones to the consumer market.</p>

          <p>The Bank of England has lowered its key interest rate from 4.25% to 4%, marking the fifth cut since last August and bringing borrowing costs to their lowest level in more than two years. The decision was narrowly passed, signaling that future cuts may be finely balanced amid concerns over rising inflation, which is now forecast to peak at 4%. The rate reduction will provide relief for some mortgage holders but could mean lower returns for savers. The move comes as the UK economy shows signs of slowing growth and a softening jobs market.
