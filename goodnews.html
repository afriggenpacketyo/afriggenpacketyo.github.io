          <p>Chinese scientists have achieved a significant breakthrough by capturing the intricate "kiss-shrink-run" process of neuronal communication, which is fundamental to brain function and signal transmission. Utilizing the world's first camera capable of nanometer resolution and millisecond-scale imaging speed, their pioneering findings have successfully resolved a key scientific debate that has plagued neuroscientists for half a century. This remarkable achievement, primarily led by biologists from the University of Science and Technology of China and the Shenzhen Institutes of Advanced Technology, was prominently published in the academic journal Science. This article provides unprecedented insight into how the brain's billions of neurons efficiently transmit vital signals via tiny synaptic vesicles, advancing our understanding of neurological processes and potentially paving the way for new research.</p>

          <p>UK Housing Secretary Steve Reed has declared his job "on the line" to meet the Labour government's ambitious pledge of building 1.5 million new homes in England by 2029. Despite Reed's strong insistence, leading experts, including Prof. Paul Cheshire and Neil Jefferson of the Home Builders Federation, express significant doubt, citing flatlining construction rates of around 200,000 homes annually against a target of 300,000. Systemic issues such as cumbersome planning processes, environmental regulations, and skill shortages are impacting the industry. Reed plans reforms, including mandating local plans within 30 months and boosting planning authority funding, to overcome these challenges and achieve the goal, which he says will make the "celebration all the sweeter" when hit.</p>

          <h2>Early Peanut Introduction Prevents Allergies in 60,000 Children, New Study Confirms</h2>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>A new study published in Pediatrics reveals that the practice of early and frequent introduction of peanut products to young babies has prevented approximately 60,000 children from developing life-threatening peanut allergies. This real-world impact validates landmark research from 2015 that overturned previous medical advice to delay allergen introduction. The guidance, now updated to recommend introducing peanuts and other major allergens between four and six months without prior screening, has led to a significant decline in peanut allergy diagnoses in children aged 0-3. This public health effort offers promising evidence that early allergen introduction is effective and increasingly adopted.</p>

          <p>Chinese scientists have identified a unique version of a protein involved in DNA repair within naked mole-rats, which is directly linked to their remarkable longevity and disease resistance. This significant discovery, published in the peer-reviewed journal Science, provides a molecular basis for the rodents' exceptional lifespan, which can extend to around 37 years—an extraordinary duration for a mammal of their size. The findings suggest that understanding how this specific protein activates DNA repair during evolution in naked mole-rats could inspire novel therapeutic anti-aging strategies aimed at improving human health and potentially extending lifespan.</p>

          <h2>UK Military Granted New Powers to Shoot Down Drones Threatening Bases</h2>

          <p>The British military will be granted new powers allowing troops or Ministry of Defence police to shoot down drones posing a threat to military bases, a significant shift from existing protocols that primarily focus on diversion or GPS signal disruption. This "kinetic option," to be unveiled by Defence Secretary John Healey, aims to enable faster, more decisive action in response to increasing drone incursions, such as those reported at four UK airbases used by US forces last year. While initially for military sites, these powers could potentially be extended to civilian locations like airports, addressing growing concerns over airspace security across Europe.</p>

          <p>Christian McCaffrey delivered an explosive performance, accumulating 201 yards from scrimmage and two rushing touchdowns, as the San Francisco 49ers defeated the Atlanta Falcons 20-10. Despite a defense affected by injuries, the 49ers effectively stifled the Falcons' offense, holding running back Bijan Robinson to just 40 rushing yards. This crucial win, moving the 49ers to a 5-2 record, showcased McCaffrey's pivotal role in their offensive strategy and the defense's resilience in performing under pressure. The Falcons' offense struggled to find firepower, resulting in a frustrating night.</p>

Demonstrators expressed outrage over crackdowns on undocumented migrants, deployment of National Guard troops, attacks on media, and prosecutions of political opponents. Despite Republican criticism labeling them "Hate America" rallies, organizers emphasized a "fierce love for our country" and a fight for its values. Trump dismissed the protests as a "joke," while some states activated National Guard troops, emphasizing the right to free speech but warning against violence and property destruction.</p>

          <p>Centrist Senator Rodrigo Paz has won Bolivia's presidential run-off election with over 54% of the vote, marking an end to two decades of leftist rule. His victory comes as Bolivia faces its worst economic crisis in decades, characterized by a severe U.S. dollar shortage, currency devaluation, and high inflation. Paz, the son of a former president, campaigned on promises to open Bolivia to the world, fix the exchange rate, restructure state-owned businesses, and attract foreign investment. Both candidates had also made overtures to the U.S., signaling a potential shift in Bolivia's international alliances away from China and Russia. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>Thirteen individuals were arrested in West Hollywood's Rainbow District during a late-night operation by the Los Angeles County Sheriff's Department. Initial social media warnings of a possible ICE raid, fueled by the presence of unmarked vehicles and recent immigration enforcement actions, caused widespread public concern. However, sheriff officials later confirmed that U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement agents were not involved in the arrests. The operation specifically targeted multiple reports of pickpocketing, drug sales, and other criminal activity occurring in the area, potentially at local establishments or by unpermitted street vendors.</p>

          <p>Steven Qiu, founder and chief scientist of RoboSense, a leading LiDAR maker, argues that a multi-sensor system is inherently safer and superior for self-driving vehicles compared to Elon Musk's vision-only approach. Qiu contends that vision-only systems struggle with critical "corner cases," such as detecting white cars on white roads or black cars in tunnels, which prevents achieving higher levels of driving automation. While Musk dismisses LiDAR as "expensive and unnecessary," Qiu highlights its significantly reduced cost and improved performance. Other auto executives, like Ford's Jim Farley, also deem LiDAR "mission critical" for robust autonomy.</p>
