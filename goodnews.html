          <p>The exhibition "Auschwitz. Not long ago. Not far away" is set to open at Cincinnati Museum Center on October 18, featuring 500 objects and 400 photos. This exhibit aims to prompt reflection on the attitudes and actions that led to the Holocaust, posing questions about the world's awareness and response then, and its responsibility today regarding dehumanizing ideologies. Cincinnati was chosen as a venue due to its history of welcoming concentration camp survivors and its existing Holocaust & Humanity Center. The article emphasizes the exhibit's role in localizing a global history and inspiring visitors to become "upstanders" against wrongdoing, ensuring lessons from the past resonate in the present.</p>

          <h2>UK Launches Digital ID Card for Military Veterans</h2>
          <div class="timestamp">2025-10-17 00:09:12 EDT</div>
        </div>
        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Former members of the UK military will soon be able to apply for a digital version of their identity cards, a move expected to benefit approximately 1.8 million veterans. This digital ID, downloadable to smartphones, will facilitate easier access to public services such as healthcare, housing support, careers advice, and discounted entry to various venues. Ministers view this rollout as a "case study" for a planned mandatory UK-wide digital identity scheme by 2029, addressing concerns around privacy and security. The digital card will be stored in the government's One Login smartphone app, with digital driving licenses set to follow at a later date, streamlining access to essential services.</p>

          <p>Max Scherzer delivered a vintage pitching performance, and Andrés Giménez powered the offense with a home run and four RBIs, leading the Toronto Blue Jays to an 8-2 victory over the Seattle Mariners. This crucial win evens the American League Championship Series at two games apiece, setting the stage for a tense continuation. The 41-year-old Scherzer, making his 500th career start, allowed just two runs over five and two-thirds innings, showcasing his enduring skill and determination. Vladimir Guerrero Jr. also contributed with his fifth postseason homer, highlighting the team's potent offense as they now head into a pivotal Game 5.</p>

          <p>Discussions about sweat and other bodily functions are becoming increasingly normalized, moving away from historical taboos, as exemplified by comedian Alan Carr's open remarks on "The Celebrity Traitors." This article explores a broader cultural shift where public figures, from Hollywood actors to singers, openly share their experiences with perspiration and other bodily realities. The rise of "sweat suits," activewear brands like Sweaty Betty, and even "sweaty makeup" aesthetics reflect this change, along with the growing popularity of saunas for networking and wellness. While some see it as body positivity, critics argue it's also a commercial strategy by hygiene brands capitalizing on a cultural trend.</p>

          <p>A federal appeals court has denied the Trump administration's request to lift an order blocking the deployment of National Guard troops in Illinois, finding a "likely violation" of the Tenth Amendment. The court determined the administration was "unlikely to succeed" in proving a "rebellion" against the U.S. government or an inability to enforce laws with regular forces. This article highlights the court's rejection of the administration's claim that Guard troops are needed for crime prevention in Chicago or to protect immigration facilities, stating there was insufficient evidence of widespread unrest or impediment to federal operations. The ruling maintains the status quo, limiting the president's authority in this instance and reinforcing states' rights.</p>

          <p>California experienced a significant transformation following the season's first major storm, with dazzling satellite photos showcasing snow-capped mountain peaks and replenished reservoirs. The deluge of moisture has brought most of the state's largest reservoirs to or above historical levels for this time of year, providing much-needed water. This article highlights how the landscape quickly turned greener, and parched brown peaks in the Sierra Nevada range, extending into Nevada and Utah, became brilliantly white.
