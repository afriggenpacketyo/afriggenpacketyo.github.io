The 20-point plan, presented by President Trump, calls for a swift ceasefire, the release of all hostages and numerous Palestinian prisoners, and an increased flow of humanitarian aid. The proposal also outlines the establishment of an interim Palestinian administration overseen by an international board. The plan has received public support from the Palestinian Authority and a joint statement of encouragement from several key Muslim-majority nations.</p>

          <p>CNBC is now accepting nominations for its 2026 Changemakers list, an annual feature recognizing women who are transforming business and philanthropy. The initiative aims to highlight female leaders at a time when progress in gender diversity is showing signs of stalling, with recent data indicating a decline in female representation on S&P 500 boards for the first time in years. The article stresses the importance of showcasing women who are innovating and succeeding, particularly as newly public companies demonstrate a notable lack of diversity in their leadership ranks. The unranked list will be announced in February 2026.</p>

          <p>Deandre Ayton and Marcus Smart, two major offseason acquisitions for the Los Angeles Lakers, are looking for redemption after recent career setbacks. Ayton, a former No. 1 pick whose contract was bought out in Portland, described the move as the "biggest opportunity" of his career and is motivated by feeling disrespected. Similarly, Smart, a former Defensive Player of the Year, is eager to re-establish his reputation for elite, tough-nosed defense after two injury-plagued seasons. Both players are expected to provide crucial defensive and physical presences as the team builds around stars LeBron James and Luka Doncic.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>An interview with Forbes senior writer Emily Baker-White explores why TikTok has become the world's most powerful information platform and the complexities of its ownership. The app's frictionless algorithm, which learns user preferences passively, cedes significant control over information diets to its parent company, ByteDance. This has fueled U.S. national security concerns and led to a deal, approved by President Trump, to create a new entity, TikTok US, run by American investors. The arrangement is intended to insulate the app from potential Chinese government influence, though the specifics of control over its valuable algorithm remain a key issue.</p>

          <p>In a personal essay, a writer reflects on moving past a superficial "cultural" Jewish identity to discover the intellectual and spiritual depth of the tradition. The author describes having once defined their Judaism through social justice platitudes and ethnic humor, a perspective shaped by centuries of anti-Judaism and assimilationist pressures. Through studying Jewish texts like the Torah and Talmud, they found a rich history of debate, questioning, and diverse conceptions of God. This deeper understanding provides a more resilient foundation for Jewish identity, offering a powerful counter-narrative to rising anti-Semitism beyond just reacting to hatred.</p>

          <p>President Trump has announced that a deal for the U.S. operations of TikTok has been finalized, creating a new entity to avert a national ban on the app. The arrangement involves a group of American investors, including Oracle, Larry Ellison, Rupert Murdoch, and Michael Dell, who will control the algorithm and hold a majority on the new company's board. While Chinese parent company ByteDance will retain a minority stake of less than 20%, the new U.S. version of the app will use a retrained algorithm based on American user data. The deal required approval from both Washington and Beijing.</p>

          <p>Qatar has affirmed its readiness to continue mediating an end to the Gaza war after Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu expressed regret for a deadly September 9 air strike in Doha. In a call with President Trump, Netanyahu conveyed his regret for unintentionally killing a Qatari security officer and violating Qatar's sovereignty during the strike, which targeted Hamas leaders. He also assured that such an attack would not be repeated, a move that appears to have de-escalated tensions between the two key U.S. allies. Qatar has played a central role alongside the U.S. and Egypt in mediating the conflict.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>The recent wave of countries like Britain, Canada, and Australia recognizing a Palestinian state is more than symbolic; it directly challenges the Israeli settler movement's strategy of creating "facts on the ground" to prevent a two-state solution. While recognition does not change the immediate reality in Gaza or the West Bank, it asserts the international community's political will to envision a border, regardless of settlement locations. This sets up a future clash where Israel's unilateral actions to foreclose Palestinian sovereignty are met with a global refusal to accept that outcome, potentially leading to boycotts and other diplomatic pressures.</p>

          <p>In an essay, Princeton's president pushes back against the popular narrative that current college students are fragile and intolerant of opposing views. He argues that high-profile disruptions are rare exceptions and that most students are eager for constructive debate, while polls often misrepresent the campus climate by confusing discomfort with censorship. The author contends that the perception of a "cancel culture" crisis is inflated by media incentives and advocacy groups, and that the real challenge is self-censorship driven by broader societal polarization, a problem students themselves recognize and want to help solve.</p>
