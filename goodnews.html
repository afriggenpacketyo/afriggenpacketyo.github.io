          <p>Hamas and other Palestinian factions are reportedly leaning toward accepting a comprehensive 20-point peace plan proposed by the United States to end the war in Gaza. The proposal includes a swift ceasefire, the release of all remaining hostages in exchange for Palestinian prisoners, and the establishment of an interim technocratic administration to govern the territory. The plan has garnered significant international support, with the Palestinian Authority and leaders of several key Muslim-majority nations publicly welcoming the initiative as a path toward peace.</p>

          <p>This personal essay reflects on the author's journey from identifying as a "cultural Jew" to discovering a deeper, more resilient Jewish identity through the study of tradition, texts, and history. The author argues that many modern, secular Jewish identities have been unconsciously shaped by centuries of anti-Semitism and assimilationist pressures. By reclaiming the richness of Jewish thought and law, the author suggests, Jews can build a stronger foundation to not only withstand hatred but also to live more meaningful lives.</p>

          <p>Qatar's prime minister has affirmed the country's readiness to continue its mediation efforts to end the war in Gaza following a diplomatic intervention by the United States. The development came after Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu expressed deep regret for an air strike in Doha that unintentionally killed a Qatari security officer and violated the nation's sovereignty. In a trilateral call, Netanyahu assured that such an attack would not happen again, a step aimed at mending relations and facilitating ongoing peace talks.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Recent decisions by Britain, Canada, Australia, and other nations to officially recognize a Palestinian state are more than just symbolic gestures, according to this analysis. While these declarations do not immediately change the situation on the ground, they represent a fundamental rejection of the Israeli settler right's objective to permanently foreclose the possibility of Palestinian sovereignty. This growing international political will sets the stage for future diplomatic clashes and could lead to more concrete actions, such as boycotts of Israeli settlements.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>In this essay, Princeton University's president argues that the popular narrative of today's college students as fragile "snowflakes" intolerant of free speech is a pervasive myth. He contends that this perception is fueled by a few rare but highly publicized disruptions, while his experience shows most students are eager for robust and constructive debate. The author suggests that the real free-speech problem on campus is self-censorship driven by peer pressure, a challenge that reflects broader societal polarization rather than a unique issue with the younger generation.</p>

Huffington advocates for adopting small, incremental "micro steps" to build healthier habits rather than making drastic resolutions, aiming to change the work culture from one that glorifies overwork to one that values recharging.</p>

          <p>In an interview about his new book, "The Future of Truth," legendary filmmaker Werner Herzog reflects on his career as an artistic quest for what he calls "ecstatic truth." He discusses the challenges of discerning fact from fiction in a "post-truth" landscape saturated with misinformation and curated narratives. Herzog shares his idiosyncratic views on topics ranging from the role of myth in society to the potential of artificial intelligence, asserting that while truth is elusive, the human yearning for it remains a powerful force.</p>
