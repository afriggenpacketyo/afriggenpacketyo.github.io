          <p>The city of San José has announced the completion of California's first accessory dwelling unit (ADU) condominium, which can be sold separately from the main property it accompanies. This development is a significant milestone following a city law passed a year ago to enable such sales, aiming to create more accessible forms of homeownership. Officials hope this project will serve as a model for other cities in the state, potentially offering a new type of starter home and helping to address California's housing crisis. ADUs now account for about one-fifth of statewide housing growth.</p>

          <p>A new report indicates that dust from the exposed shoreline of the Salton Sea is responsible for less than 1% of the small particle air pollution in the Coachella and Imperial valleys. This finding challenges the long-held assumption that the shrinking sea is the primary cause of the region's poor air quality and high asthma rates. Researchers suggest that the focus of mitigation efforts should pivot from shoreline dust control to protecting residents where they are most exposed, such as by improving indoor air filtration in homes and schools.</p>

          <p>Two new clinical trials in India are challenging the conventional wisdom that people with diabetes should avoid mangoes. The research found that consuming mangoes in controlled portions, as a replacement for other carbohydrates like bread, may actually improve blood sugar levels and other metabolic health markers. One study showed mangoes produced a lower glycemic response than white bread, while another found improvements in fasting glucose and insulin resistance over eight weeks. Researchers emphasize that moderation and clinical supervision remain crucial for incorporating the fruit into a diabetic diet.</p>

Currently a Category 1 storm, it is moving over the Atlantic Ocean on a path that is forecast to curve northward, passing near the northern Leeward Islands, the Virgin Islands, and Puerto Rico. While the storm is not projected to make a direct impact on the United States mainland, forecasters are urging those in the Caribbean to monitor its progress due to the potential for heavy rain and dangerous surf conditions.</p>

The artwork portrays Bryant in his famous celebratory pose but replaces his Lakers jersey with a white and blue Dodgers jersey, as part of a larger mural celebrating the Dodgers' 2024 World Series win. The artist and the restaurant owner who commissioned the piece aimed to honor Bryant's Mamba mentality while keeping with the mural's theme.
