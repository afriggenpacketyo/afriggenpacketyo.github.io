          <p>A CBS News analysis reveals that lawyers are increasingly strategically filing lawsuits in specific federal jurisdictions, often with single judges appointed by presidents of opposing parties, to secure favorable rulings with nationwide impact. Conservatives frequently target small Texas courts for challenges against the Biden administration, while liberals favor courts in states like Massachusetts for cases against the Trump administration. This practice, known as venue shopping, raises concerns about impartiality and erodes public confidence in the judicial system, according to legal experts. The Supreme Court is now considering whether to limit the scope of nationwide injunctions, which could significantly impact the implementation of presidential policies. </p>

          <p>Walmart CEO Doug McMillon cautioned that even with reduced tariffs on Chinese imports, the company may need to raise prices on certain items. While the Trump administration lowered tariff rates from 145% to 30% for 90 days, McMillon stated that these tariffs still create cost pressures, particularly in categories like electronics and toys. Walmart will strive to control costs and maintain low food prices, but potential financial impacts could jeopardize earnings growth if tariff levels rise again.

          <p>President Trump's announcement to lift all sanctions on Syria took senior Treasury Department officials by surprise, creating confusion about which measures would be rolled back and how quickly. The announcement followed months of lobbying by Syria's transitional government, which blamed sanctions for its inability to pay salaries and rebuild infrastructure. While some work was underway at Treasury for incremental sanctions relief, the sudden announcement has prompted discussions to determine the scope and speed of the rollback. Secretary of State Marco Rubio indicated relief may come through waivers, allowing foreign partners to provide aid without facing penalties. </p>

Ending nationwide injunctions would require challenges to government policies to be brought separately in each federal district, potentially creating inconsistent laws across the country.

          <p>For the second time, a federal judge dismissed a $25-million lawsuit by former Sheriff Alex Villanueva against Los Angeles County, alleging defamation and violation of rights. The lawsuit claimed Villanueva lost employment opportunities due to a "do not rehire" label in his personnel file. The judge ruled that there was insufficient evidence to prove Villanueva had been harmed or that the designation caused him to lose out on a desired position. Villanueva's attorney stated they will move forward with state matters related to defamation and emotional distress. </p>
