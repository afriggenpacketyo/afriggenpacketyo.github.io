          <p>A brush fire near residential areas in Burbank, Los Angeles County, triggered temporary evacuation orders, but the Burbank Fire Department successfully halted the fire's progress. Fire crews remained on-site to manage the situation and ensure the area was safe, while police urged people to avoid hiking trails and recreation areas in the Burbank hills. All hiking trails remained closed for the evening as a precaution, but the quick response of the fire department prevented significant damage to homes and property.</p>

U.S. Commerce Secretary Howard Lutnick and Chinese representative Li Chenggang confirmed the agreement, which aims to implement the Geneva consensus and address trade disputes between the two nations. The agreement follows a phone call between Trump and Xi, seeking to stabilize relations after accusations of Geneva trade agreement violations. Jianwei Xu, senior economist at Natixis, noted that the agreement signals a mutual commitment to de-escalation, but its long-term impact remains uncertain. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>Senior U.S. and Chinese negotiators have reached a framework to move forward on trade talks after disputes threatened to derail them.

          <p>Tesla CEO Elon Musk announced that his company's robotaxi service is "tentatively" scheduled to launch in Austin, Texas, on June 22. Musk stated that the company is being "super paranoid about safety," so the date could shift. Tesla has been testing driverless vehicles on Austin roads without a human safety supervisor behind the wheel, and Musk plans a small rollout with a new, "unsupervised" version of Tesla's FSD technology. The service will initially be "geofenced" and remotely monitored by employees, and is expected to include Model Y cars, not the CyberCab. Despite enthusiasm from Tesla fans, protests are planned over safety concerns and Musk's political activities.</p>
