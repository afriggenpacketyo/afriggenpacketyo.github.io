          <p>Legal challenges to President Trump's tariffs could reach the Supreme Court, potentially testing the limits of executive power. The lawsuits argue that Trump's use of emergency power to unilaterally impose tariffs violates the major questions and nondelegation doctrines. These doctrines, favored by conservative justices, require clear congressional authorization for actions with significant economic impact. The suits claim that the International Emergency Economic Powers Act (IEEPA) does not explicitly grant the president authority to impose tariffs, raising questions about the legality of the levies.</p>

          <p>Following radar outages at some of the country's busiest airports, the nation's aviation infrastructure is again under scrutiny. The word radar is a near acronym that stands for RAdio Detection And Ranging and was coined by the U.S. Navy in either 1940 or 1941. Radar works by emitting pulses of radio waves that bounce off of an object, and by timing how long it takes for the signal to go out and come back, one can calculate how far away something is. The application dates back to the late 19th century, and the British military unleashed the true potential of radar technology under pressure from the Germans in the 1930s.</p>
