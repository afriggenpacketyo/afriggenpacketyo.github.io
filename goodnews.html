          <p>Shares of Circle, a cryptocurrency firm, have experienced a significant rally after the Senate passed the GENIUS Act, a bill designed to establish a regulatory framework for stablecoins. The stock jumped nearly 13% following the bill's approval, adding to a 33% increase from the previous day. Stablecoins, cryptocurrencies pegged to assets like the U.S. dollar, are gaining traction due to their potential for faster and cheaper payments. Major companies like Amazon and Walmart are reportedly exploring the use of stablecoins, and the passing of the GENIUS Act is expected to boost investor confidence in the crypto market. The House of Representatives is also working on similar legislation.</p>

          <p>The UK Parliament has passed a bill allowing terminally ill adults in England and Wales the right to end their lives, by a vote of 314 to 291. The bill, now headed to the House of Lords, sparked emotional debate with MPs sharing personal stories. Proponents argue it offers a safe, effective reform while opponents fear it endangers vulnerable individuals. The bill includes amendments addressing concerns about mental health and palliative care, but disabled activists argue it is ableist and devalues their lives, while others shared stories of loved ones who suffered immensely without such options. The bill will go to the House of Lords for further review. The bill will now be reviewed by the House of Lords, and its future impact remains to be seen.</p>
