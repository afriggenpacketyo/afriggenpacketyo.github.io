          <p>This article reports that House Speaker Mike Johnson has reached a tentative agreement with blue state Republicans to increase the cap on state and local tax (SALT) deductions to $40,000 for households making less than $500,000 per year. The proposed increase from $30,000 is part of President Trump's "big, beautiful bill." The deal aims to address concerns from Republicans in high-cost-of-living areas, but faces potential opposition from GOP hardliners who believe it incentivizes high-tax policies in blue states.</p>
