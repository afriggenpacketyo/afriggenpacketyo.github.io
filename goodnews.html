          <h2>Judge Temporarily Blocks Trump's Ban on Foreign Harvard Students</h2>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>A U.S. judge issued a temporary restraining order against the Trump administration's ban on Harvard University accepting international students. Judge Allison Burroughs, based in Massachusetts, stated that Harvard would face "immediate and irreparable injury" if the ban were enforced. This order follows a lawsuit by Harvard accusing President Trump of a "government vendetta" aimed at stifling free speech. Trump has argued the ban is necessary for national security and has criticized Harvard for not adequately addressing antisemitism on campus. The university had also amended its lawsuit, claiming the ban was retaliation for exercising its First Amendment rights.</p>

        </div>
        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>The trend of consuming food products with fewer ingredients is growing, driven by concerns about ultra-processed foods (UPF). While some consumers seek simpler ingredient lists, nutritionists caution against sacrificing essential nutrients. Experts emphasize that not all UPFs are unhealthy, and processing can ensure food safety and extend shelf life. Food brands are responding to consumer demand by creating less processed products and utilizing new processing technologies.</p>
