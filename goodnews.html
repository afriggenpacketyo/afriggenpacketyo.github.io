          <div class="timestamp">2025-07-29 00:38:46 EDT</div>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>India has overtaken China as the primary exporter of smartphones to the United States, with its share of U.S. imports jumping from 13% to 44% in the second quarter. This significant shift is largely driven by Apple accelerating its manufacturing move to India amid ongoing U.S.-China trade tensions and tariffs. While total iPhone shipments have declined, major manufacturers like Apple, Samsung, and Motorola are increasingly using Indian facilities for final assembly to serve the U.S. market. This change highlights a broader realignment of global technology supply chains away from China. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>U.S. President Donald Trump clarified that he is not actively pursuing a summit with Chinese President Xi Jinping but confirmed he might visit China if an official invitation, which he says has been extended, is followed through. This statement comes amid discussions between aides from both nations about a potential face-to-face meeting later this year, possibly around the APEC summit in South Korea. Such a meeting would be the first between the two leaders during Trump's second term, occurring at a time of high trade and security tensions. The outcome of ongoing trade talks could influence whether a leaders' summit materializes.</p>

          <h2>China's Foreign Minister Urges New South Korean Counterpart to Maintain Independent Policy</h2>
          <div class="timestamp">2025-07-29 00:00:08 EDT</div>
        </div>
        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Chinese Foreign Minister Wang Yi, in his first call with South Korea's new foreign policy chief, encouraged Seoul to pursue an independent foreign policy and resist "decoupling." Wang emphasized the need for a stable and predictable relationship, urging deeper pragmatic cooperation between the two nations. The call signals Beijing's effort to reset ties with South Korea's new administration under President Lee Jae-myung, who is considered more open to engagement with China than his predecessor. Both sides affirmed their commitment to advancing their strategic partnership, particularly ahead of the upcoming APEC summit in Gyeongju.</p>

          <h2>China Implements Nationwide Subsidy to Counter Falling Birth Rates</h2>
          <div class="timestamp">2025-07-28 23:38:34 EDT</div>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>In an effort to address its demographic crisis, the Chinese government has introduced its first nationwide subsidy to encourage more births. The policy will provide parents with 3,600 yuan (about $500) annually for each child under the age of three, a program expected to assist around 20 million families. This move follows various local initiatives and comes as China's population fell for a third consecutive year in 2024, despite the abolition of the one-child policy nearly a decade ago. High child-rearing costs are a major factor in the declining birth rate, and Beijing is also urging free preschool education.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Nvidia has reportedly placed new orders for 300,000 H20 chipsets with manufacturer TSMC, reversing a previous stance to rely on existing inventory due to robust demand from China. The H20 chip was specifically designed for the Chinese market to comply with U.S. export restrictions, and the Trump administration recently allowed sales to resume. This move comes after Nvidia CEO Jensen Huang indicated that new production would depend on the level of orders received. The company is still awaiting final U.S. government approval for the necessary export licenses to ship the chips. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>Dodgers pitcher Yoshinobu Yamamoto demonstrated his ace potential in a dominant performance against the Cincinnati Reds, leading his team to a 5-2 victory. The right-hander pitched seven superb innings, allowing only one run on four hits while striking out nine batters. After a brief shaky period mid-season, Yamamoto appears to have returned to his early-season form, improving his record to 9-7 with a 2.48 ERA. His performance was supported by key offensive contributions, including a go-ahead two-run double from Shohei Ohtani, as the Dodgers look to build momentum with their star-studded starting rotation.</p>

          <p>Taiwanese President Lai Ching-te will reportedly not make a planned stopover in the United States on his way to South America, a decision that could ease tensions with Beijing. The move is seen as potentially clearing a path for a future meeting between Chinese President Xi Jinping and U.S. President Donald Trump. While the Taiwanese Presidential Office cited domestic issues like typhoon recovery as the reason for the change, the cancellation avoids a diplomatic flashpoint with China, which views such transits as a challenge to its sovereignty. This development represents a significant diplomatic adjustment amid complex U.S.-China-Taiwan relations.</p>

          <p>UK Prime Minister Keir Starmer has recalled his cabinet for an emergency meeting to discuss a European-led peace plan for Gaza. The plan, developed with France and Germany, was presented to U.S. President Donald Trump during a meeting in Scotland and aims to provide immediate humanitarian relief and a pathway to a two-state solution. This diplomatic push comes amid increasing international pressure to address the dire situation in Gaza and follows the breakdown of U.S.-led peace talks. The move also coincides with growing calls from within Starmer's own party for the UK to immediately recognize Palestinian statehood.</p>

          <p>UK Prime Minister Keir Starmer's recent meeting with U.S. President Donald Trump in Scotland provided invaluable, direct access to the American leader, but also highlighted significant political risks. The free-wheeling, unpredictable nature of the discussions forced Starmer to carefully interject on key issues like Gaza and immigration. For Downing Street, the face time is crucial for burnishing a key relationship and aligning on global issues, such as the humanitarian crisis in Gaza. However, the optics of engaging with Trump's unconventional diplomatic style presents a delicate balancing act for the Prime Minister on the world stage.</p>
