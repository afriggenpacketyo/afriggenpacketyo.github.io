          <p>Japan's professional women's football league, the WE League, concluded its fourth season with a new attendance record, drawing over 337,000 spectators. This success was driven by innovative promotional strategies, including a collaborative doubleheader with the men's J-League that attracted over 26,000 fans to a single match. The league, now working in tandem with the J-League under a shared chairperson, also saw individual clubs like Sanfrecce Hiroshima Regina achieve massive turnouts through player-led campaigns. The league plans to build on this momentum by providing all clubs with data and marketing tools to further grow its audience.</p>

          <p>Japan successfully launched its 50th and final H2A rocket, concluding a 24-year era for the country's space program. The rocket, developed by Mitsubishi Heavy Industries and JAXA, successfully placed a government climate-monitoring satellite into orbit from Tanegashima Island. With a high success rate of approximately 98%, the H2A has been a cornerstone of Japan's space exploration, despite an early failure in 2003. The program is now succeeded by the more cost-effective H3 rocket, which is designed to compete in the commercial satellite launch market dominated by companies like SpaceX.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>A team of astronomers has discovered mysterious, ancient radio waves that traveled for 10 billion years to reach Earth from the distant galaxy cluster SpARCS1049. The signals originate from a "mini-halo," a vast cloud of high-energy particles and magnetic fields, which has never been observed at such a great distance before. This discovery, made using the LOFAR radio telescope, challenges existing timelines for the universe's development. Researchers believe the energetic particles forming the halo were likely produced by either supermassive black holes or cosmic particle collisions, suggesting these powerful cosmic processes were shaping galaxies much earlier than previously thought.</p>

The woman was in waist-deep water when the incident occurred and did not see what bit her. After she was treated for non-life-threatening injuries, swimming was temporarily suspended. Experts who analyzed photos of the wounds believe the bite was most likely from a young sand tiger shark.

          <p>A new study of the ancient city of √áatalh√∂y√ºk in Turkey suggests it may have been a matriarchal society ruled by females over 9,000 years ago. After analyzing DNA from over 130 skeletons buried under the city's houses, researchers found that genetic connections within households were primarily traced through the female line. This indicates that men likely relocated to their wives' households after marriage, a practice known as matrilocality. The findings, which also show preferential treatment for females in burials, challenge the Western bias that assumes ancient societies were universally patrilineal and point to a system where women held social power.</p>
