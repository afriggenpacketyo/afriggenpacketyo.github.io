          <p>Former U.S. President Joe Biden is moving forward with plans to establish his presidential library in his home state of Delaware, appointing a 13-member board to lead the fundraising and site selection efforts. The board includes prominent figures such as former Secretary of State Antony Blinken and longtime adviser Steve Ricchetti. The project faces the significant challenge of raising substantial funds in a fragmented political climate, particularly with the Trump administration's open hostility towards Biden and his allies. Presidential libraries are privately funded, with recent projects like Barack Obama's setting fundraising goals well over a billion dollars.</p>

          <p>A landmark agreement will see 12 organic dairy and cattle operations cease operations within California's Point Reyes National Seashore, opening over 16,000 acres for a major conservation effort. The deal, financed and mediated by The Nature Conservancy, aims to restore the landscape which has been impacted by decades of ranching. The restoration plan controversially includes using new herds of cattle for targeted grazing to manage invasive plant species and help native ecosystems recover. While the transition is seen as a significant win for conservationists, it has created tension within the local community, which is losing a key part of its agricultural heritage.</p>

          <p>Hundreds of LGBTQ+ Catholics and their families participated in an official Holy Year pilgrimage to Rome, marking a significant moment of increased acceptance within the Catholic Church. An Italian bishop celebrated a Mass for the pilgrims, emphasizing that the Jubilee is a time to restore dignity to all, especially those who have been marginalized. Many participants credited the late Pope Francis for fostering a more welcoming tone, citing his famous "Who am I to judge?" remark and his meetings with LGBTQ+ advocates. This event contrasts sharply with the atmosphere 25 years ago, when similar groups felt unwelcome, highlighting a tangible shift in the church's approach.</p>

          <p>American tennis player Taylor Townsend has had a transformative run at the US Open, reaching the fourth round in singles and the final in women's doubles, capturing the hearts of fans. Her journey has been one of resilience, having faced body-shaming and a lack of support from the USTA early in her career despite being the world's top junior player. Now 29 and a mother, Townsend has become a symbol of perseverance, launching her own clothing line and speaking openly about the financial struggles of players outside the top ranks. Her recent success and graceful handling of on-court controversies have earned her widespread respect within the tennis community.</p>

          <h2>Schools Nationwide Adopt Lockable Pouches to Enforce Cellphone Bans</h2>

          <p>School districts across the United States are implementing the use of Yondr pouches, a lockable magnetic case, to enforce new statewide bans on cellphones in classrooms. In compliance with mandates in states like New York, students are required to place their phones in the pouches upon entering school, which can only be unlocked at designated stations. While some educators report a positive change with students being more engaged and social, the system has received mixed reactions from students, some of whom are finding ways to circumvent the ban. The cost of the pouches, roughly $25-30 per student, has also sparked debate about school budget priorities.</p>

          <p>Zach Yadegari, an 18-year-old entrepreneur, has launched Cal AI, a successful mobile app that uses artificial intelligence to estimate the calorie count of food from a photo. The app, which he co-founded from his parents' home, now generates approximately $1.4 million in gross profit per month and employs 30 people. Yadegari, who began coding at age seven and previously sold a gaming website for $100,000, developed the app to solve the tedious problem of manual calorie tracking. Now a freshman at the University of Miami's business school, he anticipates leaving college early to focus on his venture full-time.</p>

          <p>Despite President Donald Trump's repeated claims that cities like Chicago are the "most dangerous in the world," an analysis of crime data reveals a different picture. The four U.S. cities with the highest murder rates in 2024 are all located in Republican-led states: Jackson, Mississippi; Birmingham, Alabama; St. Louis, Missouri; and Memphis, Tennessee. The article points out that violent crime rates have been falling significantly across the nation, particularly in large cities. Trump's focus on Democratic-run cities appears to be a political strategy, as aggregate data shows that large cities in blue states have lower murder rates than those in red states.</p>

          <p>China's ongoing anti-corruption campaign within its financial sector is unlikely to provide an immediate boost to market confidence due to existing economic uncertainties, according to a policy analyst. However, the long-term effects could be positive, potentially leading to cleaner governance and making the country more attractive to foreign investors. The investigation of high-profile figures in banking and the stock market aligns with the demands of international institutions for transparent government practices. The sustained effort is seen as a crucial step toward stabilizing the financial system, even if short-term anxieties persist among investors. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>Archaeologists have unearthed the remains of 14 soldiers from the 1780 Battle of Camden in South Carolina, launching an effort to identify them using forensic genealogy. The discovery, described as the "ultimate cold case," includes Continental soldiers, a British Highlander, and a Native American fighter found in shallow, hastily dug battlefield graves. Forensic specialists are building genetic profiles from the 240-year-old bones and have already found tens of thousands of living genetic matches for two of the soldiers. The project aims to restore the names and identities of these forgotten soldiers, honoring their sacrifice by connecting them to their living descendants.</p>

Key recommendations include refranchising the bottling network and divesting underperforming brands like Quaker to free up capital. Elliott argues these changes could unlock significant shareholder value and reset the company's investment story, which has been hampered by underperformance. (not investment advice)</p>

The project, originally intended to be a book with an essay by Langston Hughes, was abandoned after Model fell under suspicion for leftist politics during the McCarthy era. Her images capture not only the ecstatic moments of audiences but also the deep wariness and pain of the musicians, including Duke Ellington and Miles Davis, who faced systemic racism despite their international acclaim.
