          <p>With the increasing frequency of rocket launches by companies like SpaceX and Blue Origin, physicists are studying the acoustic impact of spaceflight. The noise from launches and returning boosters is causing disturbances, and current noise regulations may not be sufficient. Researchers are focusing on understanding the complex sound wave patterns and how to mitigate the disruptions before they become pervasive. The article highlights the unique three-part sonic boom generated by Falcon 9 boosters and the potential impact of larger rockets like Starship.</p>
