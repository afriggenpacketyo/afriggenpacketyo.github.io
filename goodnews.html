          <p>In response to a query from NPR, readers submitted various personal strategies for resisting the urge to make unnecessary purchases. Common tips include creating a "cooling-off" period by leaving items in an online cart, turning shopping into an imaginary game without actual buying, and visiting libraries or thrift stores for a low-cost thrill. Other suggestions involve mindful consumption, such as envisioning an item's practical use, and finding deeper fulfillment in non-material experiences, as detailed in the article.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>The NFL has officially banned the use of smelling salts by players, following FDA warnings and citing significant safety concerns. The primary risk is that the ammonia inhalants can mask the symptoms of a concussion, a frequent injury in the sport, potentially leading to worsened harm if a player returns to the field. While some athletes, like George Kittle, used them as part of a pre-play ritual, there is no scientific evidence they enhance performance, and repeated use could have adverse health effects.</p>

          <p>Former UK Prime Minister Gordon Brown is urging Chancellor Rachel Reeves to increase taxes on the gambling industry in the upcoming autumn Budget. Brown argues that the "undertaxed" sector could provide the necessary revenue to fund the removal of welfare restrictions like the two-child benefit cap, addressing what he calls a "social crisis" of child poverty. The proposal suggests raising taxes on online casinos and gaming machines to generate over £3 billion. The gambling industry has pushed back, calling the plan "economically reckless."

          <h2>Experts Outline Strategies for Fireproofing Forests in an Era of Climate Change</h2>
          <div class="timestamp">2025-08-07 03:55:00 EDT</div>
        </div>
        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>As wildfires intensify globally due to climate change, experts are highlighting strategies to make forests more resilient. The best natural defense is a healthy, diverse forest, such as native deciduous forests, which are cooler and less flammable than conifer monocultures. Short-term mitigation tactics include reducing "fuel loads" by clearing dry undergrowth through grazing or prescribed burns, a practice used by Indigenous peoples. Additionally, creating wide, vegetation-free firebreaks can slow or halt a fire's spread, while planting "green firebreaks" can offer protection.</p>

          <p>SoftBank Group reported a second straight quarter of profit, exceeding analyst expectations with a net income of 421.8 billion yen. The positive result was primarily driven by a $4.8 billion gain in the value of its Vision Fund tech investment arm. The fund's performance was bolstered by valuation increases in publicly traded companies like Grab and private firms in its portfolio, signaling that its major bets in sectors like AI may be yielding returns. However, the group's overall profit was weighed down by investment losses on sales of its shares in T-Mobile and Alibaba. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>German police in Bavaria have arrested three men suspected of belonging to the "Reichsbürger," a far-right terrorist organization that rejects the legitimacy of the modern German state. The arrests followed raids on multiple properties where the group allegedly held weapons training and planning meetings. Authorities believe the suspects were preparing for a violent overthrow of the government, which included a potential armed assault on the German Bundestag. This operation is part of a larger ongoing crackdown on the extremist network, whose leaders were arrested in late 2022.</p>

        </div>
        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>This opinion piece argues that the modern leadership style is overly focused on control, which is ill-suited for solving complex global issues like climate change and political polarization. The author suggests that this obsession with control stems from a natural human aversion to uncertainty, which can be exploited by authoritarian figures. Instead of top-down, rigid frameworks, the piece advocates for a shift towards letting go, embracing uncertainty, and fostering collaboration and pluralistic thinking. This approach, it argues, is essential for renewing democracy and navigating the world's overlapping crises.</p>

          <p>The CEO of Deoleo, the world's largest olive oil producer, has expressed cautious optimism for the industry, signaling a recovery from a recent historic crisis. A substantial olive harvest, particularly in Spain, has led to a 50% drop in raw material prices, which is stimulating consumer demand and allowing for lower prices on store shelves. This follows a turbulent period of poor yields and soaring prices fueled by extreme weather and inflation. The company anticipates a more balanced market for the remainder of 2025.

          <p>China's trade data for July showed surprisingly strong growth, with exports rising 7.2% and imports jumping 4.1% year-over-year, the biggest import increase in a year. This performance beat economists' forecasts and suggests some resilience in the face of a looming U.S. tariff deadline. The growth was supported by increased shipments to alternative markets like Southeast Asia, which offset a continued decline in exports to the United States. Key export categories showing strength included rare earths, automobiles, and semiconductors. (not investment advice)</p>

He also speculates that modern shoe technology may not provide the same benefit in jumping events due to the extreme forces involved. The record remains unchallenged.</p>

The EA acknowledged it is "highly likely" that UK tyres are being diverted to makeshift pyrolysis plants, which cause serious health and environmental damage. Starting October 1, exporters must provide better evidence that the tyres are being managed in an environmentally sound manner. Critics, however, feel the measures do not go far enough.</p>
