          <p>Sinclair Broadcast Group has announced the return of "Jimmy Kimmel Live!" to its ABC stations, ending a preemption of the late-night program. The decision to pull the show was made in response to comments from host Jimmy Kimmel regarding the shooting death of a conservative activist. In a statement, Sinclair explained its goal was to ensure programming remains accurate and engaging for the widest possible audience. The show resumed its normal broadcast schedule following the announcement, resolving the brief but notable programming dispute.</p>

          <p>As influenza season approaches, health officials recommend September and October as the ideal months for most people to receive their flu vaccine. According to the CDC, this timing allows the body approximately two weeks to develop protective antibodies before the virus typically peaks. While vaccination should ideally be completed by the end of October, certain groups, like young children needing two doses or pregnant individuals in their third trimester, may have different scheduling needs. The guidance aims to maximize the vaccine's effectiveness throughout the flu season.</p>

          <div class="timestamp">2025-09-26 14:23:04 EDT</div>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>The UK Labour Party has restored the party whip to former shadow chancellor John McDonnell and MP Apsana Begum, ending their year-long suspension. They were among a group of left-wing MPs who defied party leadership by voting with the SNP to scrap the two-child benefit cap shortly after Labour's 2024 election victory. This move follows the readmission of four other suspended MPs earlier this year and signals a potential softening of the party's stance on the controversial welfare policy. The issue is expected to be a prominent topic at the upcoming Labour Party conference.</p>

The initiative aims to celebrate the courage involved in living authentically and to raise awareness about LGBTQ+ rights. NPR plans to feature some of the submitted stories, photos, or voice memos in its "Up First" newsletter. This project highlights the personal significance of coming out, which is framed as a process of inviting others into one's life rather than seeking permission.</p>

          <h2>Guide Explains Consequences and Timeline of Late Credit Card Payments</h2>
          <div class="timestamp">2025-09-26 14:17:25 EDT</div>
        </div>
        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Amid rising credit card delinquencies, understanding the timeline for late payments is crucial for consumers to mitigate financial damage. While a payment is technically late the day after its due date, most issuers offer an unofficial grace period of a few days before charging a fee. The first major consequence occurs at 30 days past due, when the delinquency is typically reported to credit bureaus, damaging credit scores. Consequences escalate further at 60 and 90 days, potentially leading to penalty interest rates and more aggressive collection efforts, underscoring the importance of proactive communication with lenders.</p>

          <p>The Federal Aviation Administration has announced that Boeing can resume issuing its own airworthiness certificates for some of its 737 MAX and 787 Dreamliner aircraft. This authority was revoked in 2019 and 2022, respectively, following fatal crashes and production defects that placed the company under intense regulatory scrutiny. The FAA stated the decision reflects confidence in Boeing's improved production quality and will allow federal inspectors to focus on other areas of surveillance. The move is a significant step for Boeing as it works to recover from years of safety crises and stabilize its manufacturing processes.</p>

          <p>Despite an electrifying start from the American team, highlighted by Bryson DeChambeau nearly driving the first green, Europe mounted a decisive comeback to dominate the opening foursome session of the Ryder Cup. The European squad won three of the four morning matches, quickly silencing the boisterous home crowd at Bethpage Black. The American duo of Xander Schauffele and Patrick Cantlay secured the only point for the U.S., preventing a complete European sweep. The early results put Team Europe in a strong position, leaving the American side with a significant deficit to overcome.</p>

          <h2>Recent Federal Reserve Rate Cut Leads to Lower Monthly Payments for Home Equity Loans</h2>
          <div class="timestamp">2025-09-26 13:43:16 EDT</div>
        </div>
        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Following a recent interest rate cut by the Federal Reserve, the monthly costs for home equity loans have decreased, making them a more affordable borrowing option for homeowners. For example, a $150,000 loan with a 10-year term now has an average monthly payment of about $1,847, which is slightly lower than costs seen earlier in the year. While the savings are modest on a monthly basis, they can accumulate to over a thousand dollars over the life of the loan. This article breaks down the potential costs and savings, offering context for those considering tapping into their home's equity. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>Costco reported strong quarterly earnings and revenue that surpassed analyst predictions, though its stock saw a slight dip due to some mixed results. The company's same-store sales growth of 5.7% was solid but fell just short of the 5.9% estimate, marking the second consecutive quarter of underperformance in this metric. Additionally, a minor decline in membership renewal rates and a gross margin miss tempered investor enthusiasm. Despite these issues, analysts highlighted positive signs such as strong membership fee growth and consistent profitability, maintaining a generally optimistic outlook on the retailer's long-term performance.

          <p>The Dutch government has announced it will return a significant collection of over 28,000 fossils, including the renowned "Java Man" bones, to Indonesia. These fossils, discovered by Dutch anthropologist Eugene Dubois in the 1890s when Indonesia was a Dutch colony, are among the first known remains of Homo erectus. The decision follows a recommendation from a committee that concluded the items were likely removed against the will of the local population. This repatriation is part of a broader effort by the Netherlands to reckon with its colonial past and return culturally significant artifacts to their countries of origin.</p>

The boy, Marcus Rueblos, in turn, decided to give the ball to Raleigh in exchange for a signed bat, stating the ball meant more to the player.

          <p>This article examines the intense and "tribal" atmosphere of the Ryder Cup, arguing that its location at New York's Bethpage Black course amplifies the event's already chaotic nature. The piece describes the tournament as a departure from golf's usual quiet solemnity, characterized by loud, patriotic crowds that can emotionally affect players. European golfers, in particular, are bracing for a hostile environment, with some using virtual reality to prepare for the expected noise and heckling. The commentary suggests the New York setting will likely produce memorable and potentially confrontational moments between players and the boisterous fans.</p>

          <p>Federal Reserve Vice Chair for Supervision Michelle Bowman has argued for the need for decisive interest rate cuts to counteract growing fragility in the U.S. labor market. In a recent speech, Bowman stated that recent data indicates a deteriorating job market and that the Federal Open Market Committee risks being "behind the curve" if it does not act proactively. She suggested that while inflation remains a concern, the focus should shift to the part of the Fed's dual mandate that is showing signs of weakness.

          <p>A financial strategy known as the "rule of thirds" is gaining attention as an alternative to traditional retirement withdrawal methods. The rule suggests converting one-third of one's retirement savings into a guaranteed lifetime income product, such as a fixed annuity, to cover essential expenses. The remaining two-thirds of the portfolio can then be invested for growth or used for flexible spending and unexpected costs. This approach aims to balance financial security with flexibility, providing a stable income floor while allowing for market participation, potentially reducing stress during volatile periods for retirees.
