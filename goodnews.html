          <p>China has successfully tested key technologies for an experimental bullet-shaped satellite designed for very low Earth orbit (VLEO). The Chutian-001 satellite, launched a year ago, demonstrated capabilities in satellite system performance, high-resolution imaging, and space environment monitoring. VLEO satellites offer advantages like lower signal latency and stronger transmission but require frequent thruster firings to combat atmospheric drag. This test is a step towards building a 300-satellite constellation for remote sensing and communications as part of China's commercial space sector growth.</p>

          <p>President Trump clarified that the Boeing 747 offered by Qatar will be given to the U.S. Air Force/Department of Defense, not to him personally. He stated the aircraft, a gift from Qatar, would be used as a temporary Air Force One until new Boeings are delivered. Some Democrats had called for an ethics investigation, arguing the gift violates the emoluments clause of the U.S. Constitution. Trump defended the decision, stating taxpayers should not foot the bill when the U.S. can get one at no cost.</p>

Police confirmed the radar images were not manipulated, adding to the mystery of the "notorious racer" duck.

          <p>The UK government plans to relocate thousands of civil servant jobs out of London to save money and distribute government roles across the country. The goal is to cut 12,000 roles in London and close 11 offices, saving ¬£94m annually by 2032. Two new government campuses will open in Manchester and Aberdeen, with roles created in other cities. The government aims to have 50% of UK-based senior civil servants in regional offices by 2030, expecting the changes to bring ¬£729m to the local economy by 2030.</p>
