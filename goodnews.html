          <p>The United States and Vietnam have finalized a new trade agreement, introducing a 20% tariff on many Vietnamese exports while granting preferential market access for U.S. goods, including large-engine cars. This deal, announced by President Trump, preempts a higher 46% tariff that was imminent. Concerns remain about the interpretation and enforcement of transshipment rules, with the U.S. aiming to levy a 40% tax on third-country goods relabeled in Vietnam. China has cautioned against trade agreements that negatively impact third parties.</p>

        </div>
        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Urban heat islands are metropolitan areas significantly hotter than their rural surroundings, primarily due to heat absorption by concrete and asphalt, lack of vegetation, and trapped air from tall buildings. This phenomenon intensifies heatwaves, posing risks to urban populations and exacerbating climate change through increased energy demands for cooling. Solutions include greening cities with trees and parks, implementing "cool roofs" and pavements that reflect sunlight, and adopting practices like water spraying to lower temperatures and promote environmental stability.</p>

The leather shoes, estimated to be nearly 2,000 years old, were preserved in low-oxygen soil conditions within a defensive ditch used as a rubbish dump.

The author highlights the richness derived from global usage and cultural blending, citing examples of vocabulary differences across Spanish-speaking regions. While debates exist, the overall attitude among Spanish speakers fosters linguistic diversity and expressiveness.
