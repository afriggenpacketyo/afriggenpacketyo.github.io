          <p>A $400,000 annuity purchased at age 65 can yield monthly payments ranging from approximately $2,246 to $2,590, contingent on factors like gender and payout option.

Single life annuities provide higher monthly payments but cease upon death, while joint life annuities offer continued payments to a surviving spouse. Deciding if a $400,000 annuity is suitable requires evaluating one's financial situation, retirement objectives, and risk tolerance. (not investment advice)</p>
