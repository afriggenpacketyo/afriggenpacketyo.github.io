          <p>President Trump announced that the United States has reached a new trade agreement with Vietnam ahead of a July 9 deadline. The deal involves the U.S. imposing a 20% tariff on goods from Vietnam and a 40% tariff on items transshipped through the country to avoid other duties. In return, Vietnam has reportedly agreed to grant the U.S. "total access" to its markets, allowing American products to be sold there with zero tariffs. The announcement was made via social media, with further details and official confirmation from Vietnam still pending.</p>

          <p>A new wave of digital creators, known as "VTubers," are using artificial intelligence to power virtual avatars that are attracting massive online followings and generating significant revenue. These animated personalities, like the popular gaming character Bloo, are often "puppeteered" by humans but utilize AI for tasks like video editing and language dubbing. The trend, which began in Japan, is now growing globally as AI technology makes it easier to create high-quality content. While some creators aim for fully AI-run channels, the technology still faces challenges in replicating human creativity and intuition.</p>

          <p>With potential interest rate cuts on the horizon, opening a certificate of deposit (CD) is presented as a worthwhile strategy for savers. By locking in a CD now, individuals can secure a fixed high-interest rate, protecting their earnings from future declines. This provides a predictable return on savings, unlike variable-rate accounts. The article suggests that a CD can offer significant interest earnings and provide savers with a stable place for their money while they consider their next financial moves in an uncertain economic environment.

          <p>A new expedition is planned for this fall to search for the lost aircraft of aviator Amelia Earhart, who disappeared over the Pacific Ocean 88 years ago. The team will travel to Nikumaroro, a remote atoll between Hawaii and Australia, to investigate a "visual anomaly" detected in satellite imagery within the island's lagoon. This effort, led by the Purdue Research Foundation and the Archaeological Legacy Institute, is based on the long-held hypothesis that Earhart and navigator Fred Noonan landed on the island. Researchers believe this offers the best chance yet to solve the enduring mystery.</p>

          <p>New York City may experiment with municipally owned grocery stores if Democratic mayoral nominee Zohran Mamdani wins the election. His proposal involves opening a non-profit grocery store in each of the five boroughs to combat high food prices and food insecurity. The plan, which has public support, draws from precedents in small rural towns, but would be a first-of-its-kind experiment for a major U.S. city. Critics question the financial viability and operational challenges of such a plan, while proponents argue it is a necessary step to address rising food costs.</p>

          <p>Researchers have sequenced the first whole genome from an ancient Egyptian, revealing details about a potter who lived between 4,500 and 4,800 years ago. The man's well-preserved remains, found buried in a ceramic pot, allowed for this groundbreaking analysis. The study determined he had brown hair and eyes, lived a hard life indicated by arthritis in his foot, and had ancestry from both North Africa and the Fertile Crescent. This finding provides the first genetic evidence confirming the mixing of populations from North Africa and the Middle East during this pivotal period of Egyptian history.</p>
