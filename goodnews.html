          <h2>Singapore Gains Popularity as an Educational Destination for Chinese Students Amid Shifting US Perceptions</h2>
          <div class="timestamp">2025-07-07 23:00:09 EDT</div>
        </div>
        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>A growing number of Chinese students are choosing Singapore for higher education over the United States, citing cultural similarities and safety concerns. Difficulties in cultural adjustment and parental worries about security in the U.S. are prompting this shift. Singapore is seen as an attractive alternative due to its high economic and diplomatic openness, familiar cuisine, and warm climate. Industry experts predict this trend may lead to a short-term increase in applications to Singaporean universities from China.</p>

          <div class="timestamp">2025-07-07 22:43:22 EDT</div>
        </div>
        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>The Transportation Security Administration has begun phasing out the requirement for passengers to remove their shoes during standard security screenings at several U.S. airports. This change, confirmed by sources, is being implemented at airports including Baltimore, Fort Lauderdale, and Philadelphia, though some travelers reported the relaxed rule at other major hubs as well. The shoe removal mandate was officially implemented nationwide in 2006, years after the attempted "shoe bomber" incident in 2001. The TSA stated it is continuously exploring ways to improve the passenger experience while maintaining security.</p>

          <div class="timestamp">2025-07-07 22:29:33 EDT</div>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>The Los Angeles City Council has moved to permanently restrict landlords from evicting tenants for the purpose of substantial remodels, a practice known as "renoviction." The new amendment to the "just cause" ordinance will require landlords to obtain a government agency order to vacate a unit for renovations, typically issued for safety code violations. This measure aims to close a loophole that some landlords used to evict long-term tenants and subsequently raise rents for new occupants. The city is also developing rules for tenant relocation assistance and penalties for landlords who violate the ordinance.</p>

          <p>A federal judge has temporarily blocked a provision in a new law that would have cut Medicaid funding to Planned Parenthood for non-abortion services for one year. Planned Parenthood filed a lawsuit arguing the provision unconstitutionally targets the organization for its role in providing and advocating for legal abortion access. The group, which serves over a million Medicaid patients annually, warned that the funding loss would be devastating for patients and could force clinic closures. The temporary restraining order will remain in effect for 14 days pending a further hearing.</p>

          <p>China has significantly expanded its visa-free entry policy, now allowing citizens from 74 countries to visit for up to 30 days without a visa. This move is part of a broader government effort to revive tourism, stimulate the economy, and enhance its international image following the pandemic. The policy has already led to a substantial increase in foreign visitors and bookings, with travel companies reporting a surge in demand. While most eligible countries are in Europe, Asia, and Latin America, the policy notably excludes major African nations and offers more limited transit options for citizens of the U.S. and U.K.</p>

          <p>Caltech has announced it will sever ties with e-learning company Simplilearn after settling a class-action lawsuit that alleged the partners misrepresented a cybersecurity boot camp. The lawsuit claimed the program was marketed as having close ties to the prestigious university when the connection was minimal, misleading students who took on significant debt. As part of the settlement, Caltech and Simplilearn will not hire instructors whose only credential is a boot camp certificate and will provide tuition refunds to over 260 students. The university will also establish a faculty oversight committee for its other professional education programs.</p>

          <p>The Department of Veterans Affairs has canceled its plan to lay off tens of thousands of employees, stating that a large-scale reduction-in-force is no longer necessary. The agency is on track to reduce its workforce by about 30,000 by the end of the fiscal year through attrition, retirements, and a hiring freeze, which it claims has eliminated the need for the previously considered RIF. VA Secretary Doug Collins stated the department is "headed in the right direction" and that a department-wide RIF is "off the table." However, some lawmakers criticized the announcement, suggesting the high attrition rate is due to a "toxic work environment."</p>

          <p>A comprehensive review by the Department of Justice and the FBI has concluded that there was no "client list" or evidence of blackmail against prominent figures in the Jeffrey Epstein case. The review, detailed in a public memo, also reaffirmed the official finding that Epstein died by suicide in his Manhattan jail cell in 2019. Investigators stated they found no credible evidence to pursue charges against uncharged third parties and that perpetuating unfounded theories serves no public interest. The memo aims to dispel widespread conspiracy theories that the government was concealing information to protect powerful individuals.</p>

          <p>Los Angeles Dodgers pitcher Clayton Kershaw was named to his 11th career All-Star team, this time as a "Legend Pick" by the MLB Commissioner. The 37-year-old veteran, who has only made nine starts this season after returning from surgery, admitted he was surprised by the selection and doesn't feel he deserves it based on his 2025 performance. However, he expressed gratitude for the "tremendous honor" and said he would enjoy the experience, whether he pitches in the game or not. The selection recognizes his storied, future Hall of Fame career, which includes recently reaching 3,000 strikeouts.</p>

          <p>South Korea has aborted a planned $2.2 billion purchase of 36 additional AH-64E Apache attack helicopters, a decision influenced by the weapon's perceived vulnerability in modern warfare. A South Korean lawmaker stated that the effectiveness of drones and advanced air defense systems, as demonstrated in the war in Ukraine, prompted the move. Instead of investing in expensive legacy platforms, the country will redirect funds toward developing drones and other smart systems better suited for the future battlefield. This decision reflects a growing global debate about the survivability and relevance of traditional attack helicopters.</p>

          <p>Police in Budapest have decided not to prosecute or fine individuals who participated in the city's Pride parade in late June, even though the event had been officially banned by the government. Authorities cited public uncertainty over the event's legal status, created after Budapest's mayor declared it an official municipal event, which are exempt from such bans. Despite the government's anti-LGBTQ+ stance and the threat of penalties, the march attracted a record crowd of over 200,000 people. The mayor, Gergely Karacsony, however, remains under investigation for organizing a prohibited gathering.</p>

          <p>King Charles III is set to host French President Emmanuel Macron for a three-day state visit, the first by an EU leader since Brexit, aimed at strengthening the UK-France alliance. The King will emphasize the need for the two nations to stand together against complex modern threats, from military aggression to climate change. The visit will feature ceremonial events, including a state banquet at Windsor Castle, and a UK-France summit at Downing Street to discuss issues like illegal migration. The trip is seen as a "soft power" opportunity to reinforce diplomatic, trade, and defense partnerships.</p>
