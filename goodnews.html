The club has invested heavily in facilities, staff, and the team, leading to a Carabao Cup victory and Champions League qualifications, but financial regulations have prevented unchecked spending. The article examines how the club has worked to increase revenue and navigate Profit and Sustainability Rules, while also addressing the ongoing criticism from human rights groups regarding the source of the club's ownership and wealth.</p>

          <p>Music icon Lionel Richie has revealed in his new memoir that he was training to become an Episcopal priest before his career in music took off. The famously shy artist considered the clergy until a pivotal moment while performing with his college band, The Commodores, when a woman in the audience shouted, "Sing it, baby!" Richie said this simple acknowledgment gave him the confidence to pursue music, leading him to inform the church he would not be continuing his priesthood training and instead focus on his songwriting.</p>

          <p>Germany's government is advancing a "Modernization Agenda" to integrate artificial intelligence across public services, aiming to reduce bureaucracy and enhance efficiency. The plan includes using AI to streamline export regulations and expedite visa processing, reflecting a broader push to establish Germany as a leader in key technologies.

          <p>A federal judge has issued a temporary restraining order preventing the Trump administration from deploying the Oregon National Guard to Portland. U.S. District Judge Karin Immergut ruled that the president's justification for federalizing the troops did not meet the high legal standard required for such an action without the governor's consent. The judge stated that the protests in the city were not disruptive enough to warrant military intervention, and warned that the administration's actions risked blurring the line between civilian and military authority.</p>
