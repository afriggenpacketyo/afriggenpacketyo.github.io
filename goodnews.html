          <p>In a significant move to bolster its resource security, China's Ministry of Natural Resources has announced the identification of 38 new mineral reserve sites in the first half of the year. These discoveries include substantial deposits of rubidium and gold, which are crucial for electronics, aerospace, and telecommunications. Investment in mineral exploration saw a major increase, particularly for elements like tin, tungsten, and copper, which are vital for green energy and semiconductor industries. This strategic push aims to strengthen China's national resource security amid a growing global race for critical minerals.</p>

          <h2>Federal Judge Poised to Halt Indiscriminate Immigration Stops in Los Angeles</h2>
          <div class="timestamp">2025-07-10 21:56:45 EDT</div>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>A federal judge in California has indicated she will likely order the Trump administration to cease indiscriminate stops and arrests of immigrants in the Los Angeles area. In a tentative ruling, Judge Maame Ewusi-Mensah Frimpong expressed skepticism about the government's justification for the widespread raids, noting a lack of specific evidence to refute claims of racial profiling. The lawsuit, filed by the ACLU and other rights groups, argues that federal agents have unlawfully targeted brown-skinned individuals, creating fear and disrupting the local economy. A final order is expected soon, which could significantly impact the administration's mass deportation strategy.</p>

          <p>First responders successfully rescued 31 construction workers who were trapped underground following a tunnel collapse in the Wilmington area of Los Angeles. The incident occurred at the site of the Los Angeles Effluent Outfall Tunnel, a major sanitation project, when a section of the tunnel caved in. The Los Angeles Fire Department deployed its Urban Search and Rescue teams in a massive operation, and all workers were brought to safety without any visible injuries. The project has been put on hold as Cal/OSHA investigates the cause of the collapse to ensure future safety.</p>

          <p>A federal judge in New Hampshire has temporarily blocked President Trump's executive order aimed at ending birthright citizenship for children of undocumented immigrants and foreign visitors. The ruling came in response to a class-action lawsuit filed by the ACLU, which argues the order is unconstitutional under the 14th Amendment. This decision effectively pauses one of the administration's key immigration policies, which was set to take effect soon following a recent Supreme Court ruling that limited but did not eliminate such injunctions. The White House has criticized the judge's decision and vowed to continue fighting the legal challenges.</p>

          <p>Kenneth Bianchi, one of the two notorious 'Hillside Strangler' serial killers, has been denied parole after serving 46 years in prison. The California Board of Parole Hearings ruled that Bianchi, now 74, remains a risk and will not be eligible for another hearing for ten years. Along with his cousin Angelo Buono Jr., Bianchi was responsible for the murders of 12 women in the Los Angeles area and Washington state during the 1970s, where they impersonated police officers to lure their victims. Bianchi pleaded guilty and testified against Buono, who died in prison in 2002.</p>

          <p>Sotheby's is auctioning the largest known piece of Mars on Earth, a meteorite named NWA 16788, with an expected price of up to $4 million. The 54-pound rock was likely ejected from Mars by an asteroid strike and traveled 140 million miles before landing in the Sahara Desert, where it was discovered in 2023. Martian meteorites are exceptionally rare, comprising only about 0.6% of all meteorites found on our planet. This specific piece represents a significant portion of all known Martian material on Earth, offering a unique opportunity for scientific study and collection.</p>

          <p>The Denver Museum of Nature and Science has made a remarkable and improbable fossil discovery directly on its own property. A hockey-puck-shaped vertebra from a plant-eating dinosaur was found in a core sample drilled over 750 feet deep under the museum's parking lot during a geothermal energy study. Museum officials described the find as incredibly rare, likening the odds to hitting a hole-in-one from the moon. The fossil is believed to be from the late Cretaceous period, approximately 67.5 million years ago, making it Denver's deepest and oldest dinosaur discovery to date.</p>

The meeting's agenda was not disclosed, but it occurs as Nvidia navigates U.S. export controls on its advanced AI chips, particularly those intended for the Chinese market. The Trump administration's restrictions have effectively cut off Nvidia's sales to China, a market Huang has valued at $50 billion. President Trump praised Nvidia's stock performance in a social media post prior to the meeting. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>Political strategist Chris Bruni-Lowe claims to have identified a formula for effective political slogans after analyzing 20,000 campaign messages from around the world. In his new book, he identifies eight words that resonate most with voters: people, better, democracy, new, time, strong, change, and together. He describes these words as "emotional shortcuts" that work across different cultures and political ideologies, serving as building blocks for memorable messaging. While not a guarantee of victory, he argues these words tap into instinctive voter promises, unlike highly specific slogans that may have a shorter shelf life.</p>

The application to the Arizona Department of Transportation covers operations both with and without human safety drivers. This move signals Tesla's ambition to expand its autonomous vehicle program beyond its initial pilot in Austin, Texas, as it works to catch up with market leader Waymo, which has operated a driverless service in Phoenix since 2020. Concurrently, CEO Elon Musk has indicated that the service will likely expand to the San Francisco Bay Area within months.</p>

          <p>Despite South Korea having the world's lowest birth rate, its fertility clinics are experiencing a surge in demand, with treatments rising nearly 50% between 2018 and 2022. This boom is attributed to a generational shift where more people, including single women and couples, are seeking control over their family planning, often delaying childbirth due to social and financial pressures. While the country's birth rate remains critically low, it saw a slight increase in 2024 for the first time in nine years, offering a glimmer of hope. However, the high cost and emotional toll of IVF remain significant barriers for many.</p>
