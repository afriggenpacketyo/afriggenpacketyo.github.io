          <p>Microsoft's stock increased by 7% in after-hours trading following a fiscal fourth-quarter report that surpassed analyst expectations for both earnings and revenue. The company's Intelligent Cloud division, which includes Azure, was a major driver of this success, generating nearly $30 billion in revenue. For the first time, Microsoft revealed that its Azure and other cloud services business has surpassed an annual revenue of $75 billion, growing 34% in the 2025 fiscal year. This strong performance comes despite recent layoffs and as the company celebrates its 50th anniversary.</p>

          <p>The Federal Reserve announced its decision to keep the benchmark interest rate unchanged, maintaining its current range of 4.25% to 4.5%. The central bank cited ongoing uncertainty about the economic outlook, particularly regarding the impact of tariffs on inflation, while noting that economic growth remains steady. The decision was not unanimous, with two FOMC members dissenting in favor of a rate cut, a rare occurrence. Fed Chair Jerome Powell emphasized that the economy is in good shape but faces risks, justifying the "wait-and-see" approach despite pressure from President Trump to lower rates.</p>

          <p>With interest rates on traditional savings accounts remaining low, this article explores the potential returns of placing $10,000 into a high-yield savings account. While these accounts currently offer attractive rates, often above 4%, their variable nature means that earnings can fluctuate with market conditions. The article provides examples showing that a $10,000 deposit could earn over $400 in one year at current rates, significantly more than a traditional account. It emphasizes that while these accounts offer liquidity, savers should be aware that the interest rate is not fixed like a CD. (not investment advice)</p>

During his press conference, Fed Chair Jerome Powell expressed concern that tariffs could lead to "serious inflation," signaling a cautious approach to future rate decisions.

          <p>Ford Motor Company has reinstated its full-year financial outlook after suspending it due to tariff uncertainty, now projecting a net $2 billion negative impact from the import duties. The automaker's second-quarter revenue surpassed expectations, driven by strong performance in its "Pro" commercial vehicle division. However, its "Model e" electric vehicle unit continued to post significant losses, and the company took a charge for a recent SUV recall. CEO Jim Farley highlighted the strength of the company's turnaround plan, while executives noted ongoing "constructive conversations" with the Trump administration regarding tariffs.

          <p>RB Leipzig's 22-year-old striker, Benjamin Sesko, is a top target for several Premier League clubs this summer, including Manchester United and Newcastle. The 6ft 5in Slovenian international is highly rated for his speed, strength, and clinical finishing, drawing comparisons to Erling Haaland. Despite a strong scoring record in the Bundesliga and Champions League, his club's failure to qualify for European competition has fueled speculation of a move. A reported informal agreement suggests Sesko could leave if a top club offers around £70 million, making him an attainable, albeit expensive, target for England's elite teams.</p>

          <p>For homeowners with significant equity, home equity loans and Home Equity Lines of Credit (HELOCs) present more affordable borrowing options compared to high-rate credit cards or personal loans. As of late July 2025, average rates for home equity loans range from 8.25% to 8.40%, while the average HELOC rate is around 8.26%. The article explains the difference between the two products: fixed-rate lump-sum loans versus variable-rate lines of credit. It also notes potential tax benefits but warns that the home is used as collateral, making it crucial for borrowers to shop for the best terms. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>Shares of life sciences company Danaher have rallied since its recent earnings report, but analysts question if the momentum is sustainable. The company has faced headwinds from a slow recovery in China and reduced spending from biotech firms, though its latest quarter beat expectations. Management raised its full-year earnings guidance but kept its revenue growth outlook conservative, citing ongoing uncertainty. An RBC analyst suggests a sustained rally for the sector is still a quarter or two away, pending a return to mid-single-digit revenue growth, despite some positive signs in Danaher's performance.

          <p>The annual tarantula mating season, primarily occurring in September and October, is expected to lead to a significant increase in sightings of the large, hairy spiders. Tens of thousands of male tarantulas will be actively searching for mates in states like California, Colorado, New Mexico, and Texas. These spiders, which can reach the size of a baseball, are typically reclusive but become more visible as males wander in search of female burrows. The National Park Service notes that despite their intimidating appearance, tarantulas are generally timid and will not bite unless seriously provoked.</p>

          <p>A Senate committee has advanced legislation to ban members of Congress and their spouses from owning or trading individual stocks, with Republican Senator Josh Hawley joining all committee Democrats in an 8-7 vote. The bill, named the PELOSI Act, would require lawmakers to sell their stocks within 180 days and certify their compliance annually. The vote highlighted a rift among Republicans, with Senator Rick Scott defending the right of lawmakers to be wealthy. It is not yet clear if the measure will receive a full vote on the Republican-controlled Senate floor.</p>
