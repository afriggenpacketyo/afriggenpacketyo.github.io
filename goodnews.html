          <p>A recent report from Intercontinental Exchange reveals that U.S. homeowners' tappable equity has hit a new record of $11.6 trillion. This provides an average of $213,000 in accessible value for approximately 48 million mortgage holders. The article details several methods for borrowing against this equity, including home equity loans, HELOCs, and reverse mortgages for eligible seniors. It highlights the comparatively low interest rates of these options but also cautions about the risks involved, as the home serves as collateral. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>President Trump has signed an executive order to delay the reimposition of high tariffs on Chinese imports for an additional 90 days, pushing the deadline to mid-November. This extension prevents U.S. duties from reverting to their peak levels of 145%, which were in place before a temporary pause was agreed upon in May. The move follows recent trade negotiations in Stockholm and reflects the administration's unpredictable approach to trade policy, which has created uncertainty for businesses.

          <p>Shares of lithium companies, including U.S. miner Albemarle, saw a significant increase on Monday following news of a production halt at a major Chinese mine. The suspension at the Yichun Project, operated by battery maker CATL, was due to an expired permit. This mine accounts for approximately 4% of the global lithium supply forecast for 2025, and its temporary closure has tightened an already constrained market, driving investor speculation about rising lithium prices.
