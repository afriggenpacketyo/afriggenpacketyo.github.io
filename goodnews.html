          <p>The practice of 'credit cycling,' where cardholders repeatedly max out and pay down their credit cards, is a risky behavior.  Experts warn that this can lead to card cancellation, loss of reward points, and potential damage to credit scores.  While occasional cycling may be acceptable, consistent use carries significant financial consequences.  Card issuers view frequent credit limit maximization as a potential sign of financial instability or illegal activity (not investment advice).</p>
