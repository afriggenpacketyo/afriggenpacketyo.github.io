        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Recent research suggests that specially formulated eye drops could offer a non-surgical alternative to reading glasses for individuals with age-related farsightedness, or presbyopia. A two-year study found that drops containing pilocarpine and a mild anti-inflammatory significantly improved near-vision for most participants, with benefits lasting over a year for many. While side effects were minor, experts caution that more research on long-term daily use is needed before the treatment becomes widely available for public use.</p>

The inclusion is seen as crucial for raising awareness and promoting action, particularly in lower-income countries where the condition is often overlooked despite its growing prevalence and impact on families.</p>

          <p>New England Patriots owner Robert Kraft has agreed to sell an 8% minority stake in the NFL team in a deal that values the franchise at $9 billion. The buyers are reportedly Sixth Street Partners and investor Dean Metropoulos, with the proceeds from the sale intended to remain on the team's balance sheet. This transaction, which still requires approval from the NFL's finance committee, reflects the soaring valuations of professional sports franchises, far surpassing the $172 million Kraft originally paid for the team in 1994.</p>

        </div>
        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Following a recent interest rate cut by the Federal Reserve, the monthly costs for home equity loans have decreased, making them a more affordable borrowing option for homeowners. For example, a $75,000 loan with a 15-year term now has an average monthly payment of around $726, down from nearly $740 earlier in the year. The article details how these lower rates can provide financial flexibility, though homeowners should still carefully compare options like HELOCs to find the best fit for their needs.

          <p>A deal to keep TikTok operating in the United States will see Oracle, Silver Lake, and Abu Dhabi's MGX become the main investors in the newly formed TikTok USA. These three entities will control approximately 45% of the company, with TikTok's Chinese parent, ByteDance, retaining a 19.9% stake. The remaining shares will be held by other ByteDance investors and new stakeholders, structuring the company to address U.S. national security concerns while avoiding an outright ban of the popular social media application ahead of a looming deadline.</p>

          <p>A new study on Maria Branyas Morera, who died last year as the world's oldest person at 117, suggests her extreme longevity was due to a combination of unique genetic variants and healthy habits. Researchers at the University of Barcelona found she possessed genes that protected against many disorders, some never seen before. Her lifestyle, which included not smoking, avoiding alcohol, and a diet rich in fish, olive oil, and daily yogurt, likely contributed by promoting beneficial gut bacteria and combating chronic inflammation, a key factor in aging.</p>

          <p>Pharmaceutical company Eli Lilly has stopped a midstage clinical trial that was testing its experimental muscle-preserving therapy, bimagrumab, in combination with its popular weight-loss drug, tirzepatide. The company stated the decision was based on "strategic business reasons" and was not related to any safety or tolerability issues with the treatment. The trial, which had not yet enrolled any patients, aimed to see if the combination could help obese patients with Type 2 diabetes lose weight while retaining more muscle mass, a common concern with GLP-1 drugs.</p>

          <p>As the Ryder Cup begins, a prevailing sentiment is that the competition needs an away team to win to maintain its competitive balance, as home teams have dominated recent contests. This year, Team Europe is considered well-positioned to challenge the U.S. on their home turf at Bethpage Black, with stars like Rory McIlroy leading a well-prepared squad. An away victory would break a pattern of one-sided results and inject fresh excitement and legitimacy into the biennial golf tournament, which has grown significantly as a corporate and sporting event.</p>

          <p>Tropical Storm Humberto is currently active in the Atlantic, and forecasters are monitoring the possibility of a rare interaction with another developing system nearby. This phenomenon, known as the Fujiwhara effect, occurs when two storms get close enough to orbit a common center, potentially merging or altering each other's paths. While meteorologists consider this outcome unlikely in the current scenario, the possibility highlights the complex dynamics of an active hurricane season, with both systems being watched for potential impacts on the southeastern United States.</p>
