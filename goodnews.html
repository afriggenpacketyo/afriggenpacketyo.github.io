          <p>The Internal Revenue Service has debunked widespread social media rumors claiming that new stimulus checks, such as a $1,390 direct payment, are being distributed to Americans in 2025. Officials clarified that no new federal stimulus program has been authorized by Congress, and the deadline to claim the last of the COVID-era payments has already passed on April 15, 2025. While some states have issued their own inflation relief checks, there are no new nationwide payments. The article also addresses other financial rumors, including potential rebates from tariffs or a "DOGE dividend," none of which have been enacted into official policy.</p>

          <p>For the first time, all 32 NATO member states are projected to meet the alliance's long-standing defense spending target of 2% of their GDP this year. A new NATO report indicates that countries like Spain, Italy, and Belgium, which had previously lagged, have increased their military expenditures, largely in response to Russia's invasion of Ukraine and pressure from the U.S. However, the report also reveals that only three nations—Poland, Lithuania, and Latvia—are currently meeting the new, more ambitious target of 3.5% of GDP. NATO's Secretary General emphasized that financial commitments must translate into tangible military capabilities.</p>

          <p>The controversial immigration detention facility in the Florida Everglades, nicknamed "Alligator Alcatraz," is expected to have zero detainees within a few days, according to a state official. The head of the Florida Division of Emergency Management confirmed the development in an email to an interfaith community group. This facility, which has been the subject of lawsuits that halted the intake of new detainees, was projected to cost approximately $400 million. The closure of this center comes as Florida Governor Ron DeSantis announces the opening of a new immigration facility in the state, which he has dubbed the "Deportation Depot."</p>

          <p>Nvidia announced quarterly earnings and revenue that surpassed Wall Street expectations, with a forecast for continued sales growth above 50 percent, indicating sustained high demand for its artificial intelligence hardware. Despite the strong overall performance, the company's stock declined in after-hours trading because its data center revenue, a key metric, fell slightly short of analyst estimates for the second consecutive quarter. The results confirm Nvidia's central role in the global AI infrastructure boom, with the company projecting trillions in spending by the end of the decade. The report also noted that no H20 chips, designed for the Chinese market, were sold during the quarter. (not investment advice)</p>

          <h2>Los Angeles Mayor Appoints New Film Liaison After Extended Delay</h2>

          <p>After more than two and a half years in office, Los Angeles Mayor Karen Bass has appointed a new film liaison to serve as the point person between City Hall and the entertainment industry. Board of Public Works president Steve Kang will take on the role, which was established to help productions navigate the city's bureaucracy and streamline the filming process. The lengthy delay in filling the position had frustrated industry advocates, who viewed it as a critical role at a time when Los Angeles is facing increased competition for film and TV production from other locations. The appointment fulfills a key campaign promise to the city's signature industry.</p>

          <p>The UK government is urging eligible working parents in England to apply for its expanded childcare program, which will offer 30 hours a week of funded care for children from nine months to three years old starting in September. This final phase of the government's plan aims to alleviate the high cost of childcare, which averages over £12,000 annually for a full-time nursery spot. To qualify, most parents must earn more than £9,518 but less than £100,000 per year. However, concerns remain about whether there are enough staff and available places to meet the increased demand generated by the expansion.</p>

          <h2>Charity Finds Success in Preventing Homelessness by Giving Direct Cash Payments</h2>

          <p>A UK charity named Greater Change is pioneering an approach to tackling homelessness by providing direct cash grants to people at risk of losing their homes. The organization reports that 86% of the people it has supported have moved into stable housing, with the funds typically used for rent deposits, bills, or clearing debts. This model, which gives individuals the "dignity of choice," is based on international evidence suggesting that people make responsible decisions when given direct financial aid. While the initiative is small-scale, the charity argues it saves taxpayer money in the long run by preventing the higher costs associated with full-blown homelessness.</p>

          <p>Author Jacqueline Wilson has released "Picture Imperfect," an adult sequel to her acclaimed 1999 children's book, "The Illustrated Mum." She describes the new novel, which revisits sisters Dolphin and Star and their mother Marigold who has bipolar disorder, as both the easiest and hardest book she has ever written. The sequel explores the long-term impact of growing up with a mentally ill parent, with 33-year-old Dolphin still serving as her mother's primary caregiver. Wilson reflects on her commitment to writing truthfully about difficult subjects, even when it pushes boundaries, and her desire to explore the complex, often unresolved realities of family life.</p>

          <p>China has rapidly become the dominant force in the global electric vehicle market, surpassing Japan as the world's largest vehicle exporter in 2023 and overtaking Tesla in EV revenue. This transformation, driven by massive government subsidies, lower labor costs, and a robust battery supply chain, has been led by companies like BYD. The influx of affordable, technologically advanced Chinese EVs is putting pressure on traditional automakers in Europe and the U.S., leading to new tariffs and regulatory scrutiny. Analysts predict China's influence will continue to grow, with the country expected to produce four out of every ten cars built globally by 2030. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>Following Nvidia's better-than-expected earnings report, CNBC's Jim Cramer pushed back against growing fears of an artificial intelligence market bubble. He argued that the massive AI-related spending by major tech companies like Amazon, Microsoft, and Google is a worthwhile investment, not a repeat of the dot-com bust. Cramer acknowledged that Nvidia's stock dipped after the report but attributed it to sky-high expectations rather than fundamental weakness. He asserted that today's major AI players have competent leadership and strong balance sheets, distinguishing the current boom from the speculative frenzy of 25 years ago. (not investment advice)</p>
