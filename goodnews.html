          <p>UK Culture Secretary Lisa Nandy asserts that financially distressed football clubs like Sheffield Wednesday and Morecambe can be saved from collapse. She highlights the crucial role of a new independent football regulator, which will be granted powers to oversee club ownership and even force sales under certain circumstances. Nandy acknowledges the urgency of the situation, referencing the past collapse of Bury FC as the catalyst for the new legislation, and promises to work at pace to establish the regulator and protect clubs as vital community assets.</p>

          <p>A new trend of "AI veganism" is emerging, where individuals choose to abstain from using artificial intelligence for ethical, environmental, and personal wellness reasons. This movement raises questions about our increasing reliance on AI, from its potential to harm critical thinking to its significant environmental footprint and exploitation of underpaid labor. The article suggests that while total abstinence from AI may be unrealistic for the masses, a greater awareness of our "AI consumption" and its broader impacts is a valuable step for everyone to consider.</p>

          <p>In an effort to combat its declining birth rate, China has announced it will waive tuition for the final year of public kindergarten, starting this autumn. The policy, which also provides subsidies for children in private kindergartens, is part of a broader plan to make preschool education free and reduce the financial burden on families. This move aims to incentivize procreation by lowering education costs amid a slowing economy and a weak labor market that have eroded household wealth for many citizens.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Scientists in Switzerland have created an innovative, ultra-thin sound-absorbing material designed to significantly reduce traffic noise. The material, a multi-layered mineral foam only 2.1 inches thick, performs as well as much bulkier traditional insulation like rock wool. A real-world test in Zurich demonstrated a measurable drop in noise levels, offering a promising, space-saving solution for urban noise pollution in both indoor and outdoor settings. Although currently handmade, efforts are underway to commercialize and scale up production.</p>

          <p>A California Court of Appeal has ruled that the University of California's policy barring the hiring of undocumented students for on-campus jobs is discriminatory under state law. The court found that the university’s justification—fear of federal litigation and retaliation—was improper grounds for maintaining the facially discriminatory policy. While the ruling does not mandate that UC must hire these students, it forces the university system to reconsider its policy based on proper legal criteria, marking a significant victory for immigrant rights advocates.</p>

Many of his students migrated to California, creating a legacy of unique, site-specific, and structurally expressive buildings that challenged the architectural mainstream of the mid-20th century.</p>

In response, Novo Nordisk has pledged to cut costs and sharpen its commercial focus, while also facing potential White House tariffs and pressure to lower U.S. drug prices.
