        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>23andMe, the DNA testing firm, is set to be acquired by Regeneron Pharmaceuticals for $256 million following a bankruptcy filing. Regeneron has committed to adhering to 23andMe's privacy policies and will use the firm's data for drug development. The acquisition comes after a challenging period for 23andMe, marked by weak demand, a failed subscription service, and a significant data breach in 2023 that exposed the genetic data of millions of users.  Dr. Jennifer King notes that the profit-driven mission will be clearer under Regeneron's control, as the company's original non-profit framing obscured its for-profit intentions.</p>

          <p>SAG-AFTRA has filed an unfair labor charge against Llama Productions, a subsidiary of Epic Games, over the use of an AI-powered version of Darth Vader's voice in the video game "Fortnite." The guild alleges that the company replaced the work of human performers with AI technology without providing notice or bargaining. While James Earl Jones had granted permission for Lucasfilm and Disney to use AI and archival recordings to replicate his voice for future "Star Wars" projects, SAG-AFTRA emphasizes the need to protect bargaining rights regarding voice uses that replace member's work.</p>

          <p>A federal judge has ruled that the Trump administration's takeover and dismantling of the U.S. Institute of Peace (USIP) was unlawful. The decision orders the reinstatement of USIP's acting president, George Moose, and declares the actions of the Department of Government Efficiency (DOGE), led by Trump advisor Elon Musk, as "null and void." Judge Beryl Howell criticized the administration's use of force and "threats of criminal process" to take over USIP, which she emphasized is an independent think tank supporting both the Executive and Legislative branches.</p>

          <p>Former President Joe Biden's recent diagnosis of advanced prostate cancer that has spread to his bones has prompted questions about his screening history and the disease's progression. Biden, now 82, did not undergo prostate cancer screening during his last medical checkup in February 2024, as screenings are not routinely recommended for men over 70. His diagnosis came after he saw a doctor for urinary symptoms, leading to the discovery of a nodule in his prostate. Experts emphasize the importance of tailoring medical decisions to individual circumstances and note advancements in treating advanced prostate cancer.</p>

          <p>A provision in the House Republicans' tax bill to eliminate federal income taxes on tips has garnered bipartisan support but faces scrutiny from economists and restaurant groups. The proposal, a campaign pledge from President Trump, could benefit tipped workers, but concerns have been raised about its potential impact on wage pressure and low-income workers. Some argue that the tax break is more of a middle-income benefit and may not significantly help lower-income Americans who already owe little or no federal income taxes.</p>

          <p>While annuities can provide a guaranteed retirement income stream, concerns about losing the initial investment often deter potential buyers. Fixed annuities typically protect the principal, guaranteeing its return after a set period with locked-in interest rates. Fixed indexed annuities also offer protection against losses, though upside gains are capped. Variable annuities, however, expose the principal to market risks, potentially leading to losses. Factors like surrender periods, early withdrawal penalties, and rider fees can also impact the net return. (not investment advice)</p>
