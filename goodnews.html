          <h2>Trump Proposes "Golden Dome" Missile Defense System Similar to Israel's Iron Dome</h2>
          <div class="timestamp">2025-06-17 03:00:59 EDT</div>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>President Trump has requested congressional funding for a comprehensive missile defense system for the United States, dubbed the "Golden Dome," inspired by Israel's Iron Dome. The Iron Dome is a network of interceptor missiles strategically placed throughout Israel, which has successfully intercepted thousands of rockets. However, experts note that building a similar system in the U.S. would be significantly more complex due to America's larger size and the different types of missiles it would need to defend against, likening the difference to that between a kayak and a battleship. This initiative aims to enhance national security by providing a robust defense against potential missile attacks. The prospect of enhanced protection contributes to a sense of security. </p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Bullet train services on the Tohoku shinkansen line between Tokyo and Sendai were suspended on Tuesday due to an inspection of an out-of-service train that halted between stations. JR East, the operator, anticipates resuming services around 7 p.m. after completing the inspection. The affected train, which debuted in spring last year on the Yamagata shinkansen line, stopped between Utsunomiya and Nasushiobara stations around 11:25 a.m., causing delays for other trains. The suspension highlights the importance of safety checks in maintaining reliable transportation services. The anticipation of service resumption provides some reassurance.</p>

          <p>Chris Woakes is set to return to the England squad for the upcoming five-Test series against India, marking a crucial moment for the team and the Ben Stokes-Brendon McCullum project. At 36, Woakes' experience and skill are more important than ever, especially given his past contributions to pivotal series wins. Woakes is likely to bowl the first over for England, leveraging his accuracy and movement to challenge an Indian lineup with limited experience in English conditions. His role as a senior bowler, inherited after James Anderson's retirement, underscores his importance to the team's strategy and leadership. The return of a seasoned player brings a sense of stability.</p>

          <p>Shohei Ohtani made his return to the major league mound for the first time since August 2023, pitching one inning and driving in two runs in the Los Angeles Dodgers' 6-3 win over the San Diego Padres. Ohtani allowed a run in his 28-pitch outing, with his fastball reaching 100 miles per hour, and expressed gratitude for being back healthy and pitching again. The Dodgers' two-way star also contributed offensively, going 2-for-4 with a run-scoring double and an RBI single. The team's bullpen limited the Padres to four hits over eight innings, securing the victory. Ohtani's successful return to pitching adds excitement to the season.</p>

          <p>President Donald Trump has signed an executive order to reduce tariffs on UK cars being shipped to the US, implementing parts of a tariff deal agreed between the two countries last month. The order will allow up to 100,000 cars into the US at a 10% tariff, instead of the 25% import tax imposed earlier in the year, and also removes tariffs on certain aerospace products. While the deal does not address the removal of charges on steel imports, the UK government stated it would "continue to go further and make progress towards 0% tariffs on core steel products as agreed". Prime Minister Starmer hailed the move as a "very important day" for both countries, and a "sign of strength" between Britain and America. The implementation of the tariff reductions is seen as a positive step for UK businesses.</p>

          <p>Japan's central bank has announced it will slow the cuts to government bond purchases from April next year, while holding the benchmark rate at 0.5% amid rising growth risks. The Bank of Japan (BOJ) will reduce its monthly purchases of Japanese government bonds by about 400 billion yen ($2.76 billion) per quarter to about 3 trillion yen until March 2026. From April 2026 to March 2027, the cuts will slow to 200 billion yen per quarter, aiming to reach a monthly purchase amount of about 2 trillion yen. The BOJ's decision is aimed at improving the functioning of the JGB markets and supporting market stability. The adjustments reflect a cautious approach to managing economic growth.</p>

          <p>Gold has surged 30% in 2025, outpacing traditional safe havens like the Japanese yen, Swiss franc, and U.S. Treasurys, prompting investors to reconsider what constitutes true safety amid fiscal sustainability concerns and geopolitical tensions. Experts emphasize gold's independence from government liabilities as a key advantage, contrasting it with assets tied to specific economies. U.S. Treasurys have faced sell-offs due to President Trump's tariffs and a Moody's downgrade, raising concerns about fiscal discipline, while the Japanese yen has been weakened by interest rate differentials. Gold's demand has been fueled by instability and uncertainty, making it a preferred safe haven. The shift towards gold reflects a broader reassessment of financial security.</p>

          <p>A federal judge in Massachusetts has ruled that directives from the Trump administration leading to the cancellation of several National Institutes of Health (NIH) research grants were "void" and "illegal." The judge found that the cancellations, which targeted studies involving LGBTQ+ issues, gender identity, and diversity, equity, and inclusion (DEI), violated federal law and constituted discrimination. The judge ordered the NIH to restore the terminated grants, estimated to be worth up to $1.8 billion. The ruling is a victory for researchers and advocates who argued the cancellations were politically motivated and harmful to important scientific research.
