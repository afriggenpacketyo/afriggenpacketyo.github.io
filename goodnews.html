          <p>A new effort in Brooklyn is reshaping inclusion in Jewish matchmaking, focusing on connecting individuals with physical disabilities who are seeking love and family. Therapist Eli Portal, who was paralyzed after an accident, partnered with matchmaker Rivkah Fox to create events that look beyond physical appearance and connect people on a deeper level. Chaim Lebowitz, who has worked with a traditional matchmaker, hopes to meet someone at the event in Brooklyn, seeking a partner who values personality and shared goals over physical conditions. Avrumi and Chani Lunger, who both have physical disabilities, emphasize the importance of networking and finding others with similar experiences to foster understanding and empathy.</p>

          <p>Former President Joe Biden has been diagnosed with an aggressive form of prostate cancer that has metastasized to the bone. The diagnosis came after he reported urinary symptoms, leading doctors to find a nodule on his prostate. While the cancer is stage 4, it appears to be hormone-sensitive, which allows for effective management. Lawmakers from both sides of the aisle, including President Trump and former Vice President Kamala Harris, have extended their well wishes to Biden and his family, expressing hope for his speedy recovery, as did former Secretary of State Hillary Clinton.</p>

          <p>The NJ Transit strike has ended after the Brotherhood of Locomotive Engineers and Trainmen approved a deal, halting a three-day work stoppage that disrupted commutes across the state. The agreement was reached after negotiations regarding pay parity with neighboring transit agencies and the rising cost of living. While the terms of the deal were not immediately available, NJ Transit announced that trains would resume service on Tuesday morning to allow for equipment inspections. The previous strike in 1983 lasted three weeks, with a potential strike averted in 2016 just a day before it was scheduled to begin.</p>

          <p>Nicusor Dan, the liberal and pro-EU mayor of Bucharest, won the Romanian presidential race against George Simion, a right-wing nationalist, after months of political turbulence. Simion, leader of the far-right AUR party, had a strong first-round victory, fueled by anger over the annulled previous election due to Russian interference claims. Dan's victory, securing 55% of the vote, was particularly strong in Romania, though Simion led among diaspora voters. Dan campaigned on fighting corruption and supporting Ukraine, while Simion attacked the EU and proposed cutting aid to Kyiv.</p>

          <p>Nicusor Dan, a centrist mayor of Bucharest, won the presidential election in Romania, defeating George Simion, a nationalist aligned with President Trump. Dan secured 54% of the vote in the presidential runoff, while Simion drew only 46%. Mr. Dan‚Äôs victory will likely calm fears in Europe‚Äôs political mainstream that Romania, which borders Ukraine and plays a vital role in defending NATO‚Äôs eastern flank against Russia, might join Hungary and Slovakia in opposing help for Ukraine and in cozying up to Moscow.</p>

          <p>A secretive US factory in Arizona, built by Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing Company (TSMC), is mass producing advanced semiconductors. This factory represents the contradiction in Trump's economic and diplomatic policy, which calls for America First while relying on global technologies. While the original strategy was to make Taiwan indispensable in this area of critical technology, the pandemic supply chain difficulties changed the calculus because relying on a single country seemed like a greater risk.</p>
