          <p>United Launch Alliance (ULA) has postponed the second launch of Amazon's Project Kuiper internet satellites due to a problem with the rocket booster. The launch was scrubbed with roughly 30 minutes left in the countdown due to an elevated purge temperature within the Atlas V rocket's booster engine, according to ULA CEO Tory Bruno. The launch from Florida's Space Coast was originally scheduled for last Friday but was rescheduled to Monday due to inclement weather. A new launch date will be provided later as engineers work to resolve the issue with the GN2 purge line. </p>

          <p>Advanced Micro Devices (AMD) shares experienced a significant rise following optimistic assessments from analysts at Piper Sandler, who foresee a rebound in AMD's graphics processing units (GPUs) in the fourth quarter. The analysts anticipate that AMD will have largely absorbed the $800 million in charges related to new U.S. license requirements affecting semiconductor exports to China and other countries. The unveiling of AMD's next-generation AI chips, the Instinct MI400 series, including the Helios full-server rack, has also fueled enthusiasm. Piper Sandler has raised its price target for AMD's share price from $125 to $140. (not investment advice)</p>

        </div>
        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>A $400,000 annuity purchased at age 65 can provide a substantial monthly income, generally ranging from approximately $2,246 to $2,590, but this amount varies based on several factors. These factors include gender, life expectancy, the current interest rate environment, the annuity type and structure, and any optional features selected. Women typically receive lower monthly payments than men due to longer life expectancies, and different annuity structures (like single life vs. joint life) affect payouts. While annuities offer financial security through guaranteed income, they also involve trade-offs such as reduced liquidity and potential for lower returns compared to other investments.
