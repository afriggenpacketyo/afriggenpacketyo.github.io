          <p>Eli Lilly has increased its 2025 sales and earnings forecast, citing robust demand for its popular diabetes and weight-loss drugs, Mounjaro and Zepbound. The company's second-quarter results surpassed Wall Street expectations, with revenue reaching $15.56 billion, a 38% increase from the previous year. However, shares declined after data from a new experimental obesity pill, orforglipron, showed less weight loss than analysts had anticipated. The positive financial report comes as the pharmaceutical industry prepares for potential new U.S. tariffs on imported drugs. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>For homeowners looking to borrow money, home equity loans and Home Equity Lines of Credit (HELOCs) currently offer more affordable interest rates compared to personal loans or credit cards. As of early August 2025, average rates for these products are in the low 8% range, varying by loan term and lender. This article explains the difference between the two loan types, with home equity loans providing a fixed-rate lump sum and HELOCs offering a variable-rate revolving line of credit.

          <p>Eli Lilly announced that its experimental daily obesity pill, orforglipron, resulted in approximately 12% weight loss in patients during a late-stage clinical trial. While doctors considered the outcome clinically meaningful and a promising needle-free alternative, the results fell short of some Wall Street expectations, causing the company's stock to drop. The trial data also noted that about 10% of patients on the highest dose discontinued treatment due to gastrointestinal side effects. Eli Lilly plans to submit the drug for regulatory approval by the end of the year.</p>

          <p>Despite facing a pandemic, high inflation, and rising interest rates, the U.S. stock market has continued to surge, confounding many economic theories. This article from The Atlantic explores the shifting explanations for the market's strength, from economic fundamentals to Federal Reserve liquidity, none of which fully account for its recent performance. A leading current theory points to an AI-driven speculative bubble, concentrated in a few "Magnificent Seven" tech companies, while another suggests the rise of passive investing has created a market that continually expands regardless of economic conditions. The piece concludes that no single theory can definitively explain the market's unprecedented and resilient run. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>With inflation remaining a concern, high-yield savings accounts offer a way for savers to protect the purchasing power of their money. While the national average savings rate is a low 0.38%, top online banks are offering rates between 4.11% and 4.30% APY as of early August 2025. This article explains that online banks can typically offer better rates due to lower overhead costs compared to traditional brick-and-mortar institutions. To secure the best rate, consumers are advised to compare different high-yield accounts, paying attention to both the interest rate and any associated fees. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>Indian Prime Minister Narendra Modi is expected to visit China later this month to attend a Shanghai Cooperation Organisation (SCO) summit, according to multiple media reports. This would mark his first trip to China in seven years and signal a significant thaw in relations between the two Asian powers. The visit comes after years of heightened tensions following a deadly border clash in 2020. The potential diplomatic engagement is also viewed in the context of India's growing trade friction with the United States, prompting speculation that New Delhi may be recalibrating its foreign policy approach toward Beijing.</p>

          <p>Warner Bros. Discovery's second-quarter earnings were significantly boosted by the strong performance of its film studios, which released several box office hits. The studios segment saw its revenue increase by 55% to $3.8 billion, thanks to the success of films like "A Minecraft Movie" and "F1," which collectively grossed $2 billion globally. CEO David Zaslav noted the division's turnaround, attributing it to strategic hires and a focus on major franchises like "Lord of the Rings" and "Superman."
