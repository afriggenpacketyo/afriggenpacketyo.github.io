          <p>Romania is making new efforts to confront its role in the Holocaust, specifically the genocide of the Sinti and Roma people, known as the "porajmos." At a commemoration event in Bucharest, the country's new pro-European president emphasized the need to address a history often silenced in public discourse. The ceremony highlighted the deportation and murder of over 25,000 Roma by Romania's World War II regime and stressed the ongoing dangers of right-wing extremism. Officials called for better enforcement of anti-racism laws and greater inclusion of the Roma community, which remains a vital part of the nation.</p>

        </div>
        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>A psychological technique known as "dopamine anchoring" is gaining popularity as a way to boost motivation for unpleasant tasks. The method involves pairing an enjoyable stimulus, like music or a favorite snack, with a chore to train the brain to anticipate a reward and release dopamine. Psychiatrists confirm the strategy is supported by neuroscience and can be particularly helpful for individuals with conditions like ADHD or depression. Experts caution against using unhealthy anchors and advise that the technique should be a tool to build intrinsic motivation, not a long-term crutch.</p>

Major financial institutions like BlackRock and Deutsche Bank are increasingly building on Ethereum's network, valuing its stability and dependability.

          <p>England's pursuit of a 374-run target in the fifth Test against India was dealt a late blow on day three when opener Zak Crawley was dismissed. The hosts ended the day at 50-1, needing another 324 runs to secure a series victory. India set the formidable total after a strong batting performance, led by Yashasvi Jaiswal's century and a surprise fifty from nightwatchman Akash Deep. Despite the challenging chase, improved batting conditions at The Oval offer England hope, setting up a tense and decisive final two days of the series.</p>

          <p>Cat Eccles, the Member of Parliament for Stourbridge, is under investigation by the parliamentary standards commissioner for failing to declare a sponsored trip on time. The inquiry centers on a visit to Israel and the Palestinian territories in May, funded by Labour Friends of Israel, which was valued at £2,600. Parliamentary rules require MPs to register such interests within 28 days, but the trip was reportedly registered over a month late. A spokesperson for the MP attributed the delay to an administrative error, stating there was no intention to conceal the visit.</p>

          <p>England's Charley Hull has positioned herself as a strong contender heading into the final round of the Women's Open at Royal Porthcawl. A superb third-round score of 66 moved her to within three strokes of the leader, Miyu Yamashita of Japan. Yamashita, who held a larger lead at the halfway point, struggled on Saturday, reducing her advantage to just one shot over her nearest competitor. With several players, including Hull, close behind and challenging weather forecast for Sunday, the championship is set for a dramatic and wide-open conclusion.</p>

          <h2>Analysis Explores How TikTok is Reshaping News Consumption for Younger Generations</h2>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>A growing percentage of young adults now regularly get their news from TikTok, relying on content creators and algorithm-driven feeds rather than traditional media outlets. This shift is changing how news is packaged and consumed, with an emphasis on speed, brevity, and entertainment value, often through skits or rapid-fire summaries. Creators like Aaron Parnas have amassed millions of followers by quickly breaking down complex events into digestible, minute-long videos. While some users find this format more convenient and less biased, it raises concerns about misinformation and the loss of detailed, holistic reporting.</p>

          <h2>Appeals Court Upholds Restrictions on Immigration Raids in Los Angeles Area</h2>
          <div class="timestamp">2025-08-02 13:45:02 EDT</div>
        </div>
        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>The Ninth Circuit Court of Appeals has largely upheld a lower court's order restricting how federal immigration agents can conduct "roving" raids in the Los Angeles area. The ruling affirmed that agents cannot base arrests solely on factors like a person's race, their use of Spanish, or their presence in a particular location, as these do not constitute reasonable suspicion. The decision stems from a lawsuit filed after a series of high-profile raids by ICE and CBP in Southern California. Pro-immigrant advocates praised the ruling as a crucial protection against racial profiling and unconstitutional seizures.</p>

          <p>The England women's rugby team secured an overwhelming 97-7 victory against Spain, scoring 15 tries in a lopsided match. The dominant performance, however, was overshadowed by a red card issued to captain Marlie Packer for a dangerous clearout. The dismissal means Packer could face a suspension, potentially impacting her availability for the start of the upcoming Rugby World Cup. While the Red Roses showcased their offensive power, the disciplinary issue presents a significant concern as they head into their final warm-up match before the tournament begins.</p>

A sitting lawmaker, local officials, and national guard personnel were allegedly involved in taking kickbacks from state contracts. The announcement came just two days after the independence of these anti-graft bodies was restored by parliament, following public protests against a government move to curb their power.

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Florida has quietly become a leader in solar energy, surpassing California last year in the addition of new utility-scale solar capacity. This growth is primarily driven by large utilities like Florida Power & Light, which are capitalizing on favorable economics and streamlined regulations for building new projects. With natural gas prices rising, solar has become the cheaper option for energy production, even as the state government removes climate change from its official policy. However, the industry faces future headwinds from the rollback of federal tax credits and growing constraints on the existing power grid. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>An appreciation of the late Malcolm-Jamal Warner's performance as Theo Huxtable on "The Cosby Show" highlights the complexity he brought to the character. Initially presented as a typical slacker teen, Theo's journey became a central arc of the series, evolving from an underachiever into a young man with purpose. Warner skillfully balanced comedy with vulnerability, especially as the character navigated his parents' high expectations and a later diagnosis of dyslexia. Ultimately, Theo's story was not just a punch line but a nuanced exploration of finding one's own path, challenging assumptions about success.</p>
