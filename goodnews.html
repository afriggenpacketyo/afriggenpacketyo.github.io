          <p>A SkyWest pilot executed an "aggressive maneuver" to avoid a collision with a military aircraft, reportedly a B-52, during its landing approach in Minot, North Dakota. The pilot informed passengers that the other aircraft was not announced by the control tower, which lacks radar capabilities. The Federal Aviation Administration is investigating the incident, which involved a flight with 76 passengers and four crew members. Passengers applauded the pilot for his quick action in the startling near-miss event.</p>

          <p>Following deadly floods that killed over 130 people in central Texas, Governor Greg Abbott has called a special legislative session to address the state's emergency response. The session will focus on improving future preparedness, including enhancing flood warning systems, emergency communications, and disaster relief funding. The historic flash flooding over the Fourth of July weekend left a devastating impact, with several people still reported as missing. This legislative action aims to prevent a recurrence of such a large-scale tragedy through better planning.</p>

          <p>Liverpool Football Club has agreed to a deal with Eintracht Frankfurt to sign French striker Hugo Ekitike for an initial fee of £69 million. The total deal could be worth up to £79 million with add-ons, and the 23-year-old is expected to sign a six-year contract. Ekitike, who scored 15 goals for the German club last season, will join Liverpool's pre-season tour in Asia. His signing pushes Liverpool's summer spending past £250 million, following other high-profile acquisitions to bolster the squad.</p>

          <p>Analysts in China are urging the government to tackle "neijuan," a term for excessive and inefficient internal competition, by stimulating domestic consumption and fostering innovation. A report from China International Capital Corporation argues that expanding market demand creates an "incremental cake," providing a better macro environment than the current zero-sum game. The analysts suggest that top-down macroeconomic policies are essential, as companies alone cannot solve the problem. The proposed solution involves encouraging firms to focus on research and development to create differentiated products, fostering a more positive economic cycle.</p>

          <p>Amid rising prices and global instability, affluent investors are increasingly turning to gold, with some doubling their portfolio allocations to the precious metal this year. High-net-worth individuals are utilizing various methods, from buying fractional ownership of gold bars to storing physical bullions in high-security vaults, such as converted Swiss military bunkers. Bankers note a particular uptick among U.S. clients seeking to diversify away from a depreciating dollar, viewing gold as a tangible safe-haven asset. Investment options range from unallocated gold accounts held by banks to purchasing specific, allocated bars. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>A 1906 shipwreck in the North Sea is being used in an innovative project to reintroduce the native flat oyster, a species that has largely vanished from the region due to overfishing and disease. Belgian scientists have deposited 200,000 oyster larvae onto the wreck, which is located in a protected area where fishing is banned. The goal is for the oysters to establish a reef, which will in turn purify water and create a rich habitat for other marine life. This environmental project aims to leverage the shipwreck as a biodiversity hotspot.</p>

In the first half of 2025, China's national railway recorded a record 2.24 billion passenger trips. Officials attribute the growth to a recovering economy, rising travel demand, and improved service quality across the expanding network.</p>

          <p>Ryanair CEO Michael O'Leary has stated the airline is considering an increase to the bonus paid to staff for intercepting passengers with oversized carry-on bags. Currently, staff receive about €1.50 per bag, a practice intended to enforce the airline's baggage rules and reduce boarding delays. The airline says over 99% of passengers comply with the rules, and the fee-sharing incentive is aimed at the small minority who do not. The discussion comes as the European Parliament pushes for standardized free carry-on allowances, a proposal O'Leary predicts will not pass.</p>
