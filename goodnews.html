          <p>Nvidia's shares climbed to a record high, surpassing its previous intraday peak, as investors remain confident in the company's leadership in artificial intelligence despite export controls in China. The stock's surge reflects Nvidia's dominant position in graphics processing units (GPUs) used for AI workloads. Nvidia is now valued at $3.7 trillion, exceeding Microsoft in market capitalization, even though the company faces restrictions in the world's second-largest economy. Investors are betting that Nvidia's technological advantage will outweigh the challenges posed by Chinese export controls. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>A bipartisan group of U.S. lawmakers introduced a bill to ban Chinese artificial intelligence systems from federal agencies, emphasizing the need for the U.S. to win the global AI competition.

Lawmakers and experts stressed the importance of maintaining export controls on advanced chips to China and ensuring that AI systems built in democracies reflect democratic values. The proposed No Adversarial AI Act aims to identify and ban AI systems developed by foreign adversaries from use in the U.S. government.</p>

          <p>A Los Angeles judge ruled that the California FAIR Plan's smoke-damage policy violates state law by providing less coverage than required. The court found that the FAIR Plan's requirement of "permanent physical changes" for fire claims made it difficult for homeowners to be compensated for smoke damage. The ruling could have significant implications, given the FAIR Plan's rapid growth as insurers withdraw from California's home insurance market. The judge also struck down the plan's requirement that smoke damage be perceptible without laboratory testing.</p>

          <p>The United States is experiencing a significant decline in its prison population, projected to decrease by roughly 60 percent by 2035. This trend is attributed to a drop in crime rates among younger generations, leading to fewer young offenders entering the prison system. The impact of this shift is now being felt as the prison population from the high-crime era of the late 20th century gradually diminishes. Experts suggest policies to accelerate decarceration, such as opposing new prison construction and compassionate release of sick and aging inmates.</p>

          <p>A credit card grace period is the time between the end of your billing cycle and your payment due date when you won't be charged interest on new purchases if you pay your full statement balance by the due date. It's essentially a temporary, interest-free loan, typically lasting 21 to 25 days. To maximize the benefits of a grace period, pay your full statement balance by the due date every month, automate payments, track your billing cycle, and avoid cash advances.

          <p>President Trump's trade policies are causing investor unease in the US, leading them to consider opportunities in Europe, particularly in Germany. Germany's DAX index has risen, and the US dollar has weakened against the euro. The IMF and Germany's Bundesbank have warned about potential turbulence in global financial markets due to the trade conflict. While the US faces growing debt, Europe is becoming more attractive to investors, with firms like Blackstone planning significant investments.</p>
