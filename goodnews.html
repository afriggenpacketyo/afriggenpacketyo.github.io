          <p>Jerome Cohen, a highly respected and pioneering scholar of Chinese law, has died at the age of 95, leaving a profound legacy spanning over six decades. As professor emeritus at New York University’s School of Law and founder of its US-Asia Law Institute, Cohen was instrumental in shaping global discourse on China’s legal system, trade, and human rights. He holds the distinction of being the first American to practice law in the country under Communist rule, and his extensive writings on Chinese criminal procedure are considered groundbreaking. Cohen was renowned for his dual role as an advocate for Chinese dissidents and a proponent of continued engagement with Beijing, making a significant and lasting impact on the field.</p>

          <p>A new oral weight loss drug, orforglipron from Eli Lilly, has shown "meaningful weight loss" and cardiometabolic improvements in phase 3 clinical trials, potentially offering an alternative to injectable GLP-1 medications. The study, published in the New England Journal of Medicine, found participants on the highest dose lost an average of 27.3 pounds, with significant percentages achieving 10-15% body weight reduction and improved blood sugar. Its safety profile is consistent with existing GLP-1s, featuring mild to moderate gastrointestinal side effects. Eli Lilly aims for approval by 2026 for obesity and type 2 diabetes, though some medical professionals express caution regarding its non-peptide nature and long-term effects.</p>

          <p>California's Senate Bill 576, aimed at quieting loud commercials on streaming services, has passed the Legislature and awaits the governor's signature. The legislation, prompted by consumer frustration, would mandate that streaming advertisements do not exceed the volume of the content they accompany, mirroring existing regulations for traditional television. Initially, streaming industry groups voiced opposition, citing the complexity of controlling ad volumes from diverse sources. However, their stance changed to neutral after the bill was amended to prevent private legal action. This article details the legislative progress and notes that federal regulators are also considering expanding their Commercial Advertisement Loudness Mitigation Act to include streaming platforms, as a surge in complaints highlights this persistent issue for viewers.</p>

          <p>China has officially endorsed Brazil’s $125 billion Tropical Forests Forever Facility, a landmark fund aimed at incentivizing tropical forest preservation. This initiative, unveiled at a UN sideline event and developed with World Bank support, plans to invest in low-risk assets, distributing returns to tropical nations at up to $4 per hectare of standing forest. Payments are tied to maintaining annual deforestation below 0.5 percent, with penalties for forest degradation, and a significant portion allocated to Indigenous peoples. Brazilian President Lula da Silva, who committed $1 billion from Brazil, emphasized this as a crucial investment against climate chaos, urging global participation before COP30. This article details a major international collaboration designed to provide predictable, long-term financial support for critical global ecosystems.</p>

          <p>The Liberal Democrats, during their recent conference, unveiled a more aggressive political strategy, primarily focusing on Reform UK leader Nigel Farage to galvanize their base. Sir Ed Davey's speech contained numerous direct references to Farage, aiming to frame the prospect of a Reform premiership as a critical call to action for both activists and potential donors. The party identifies an opportunity to position itself as a distinct alternative to both Reform and the current Conservative leadership under Kemi Badenoch. This article highlights the Lib Dems' strategic adjustment in a rapidly changing political landscape, buoyed by internal polling suggesting increased voter receptiveness, as they contend with a new, noisy rival for protest votes.</p>

This achievement marks a significant recovery for the brewer, coming two years after its Bud Light brand lost its leading position due to a consumer boycott. Modelo Especial, the previous top seller, along with other consumer brands like Coca-Cola, has attributed some sales declines to the Trump administration's stricter immigration policies, impacting Hispanic consumer spending. This article highlights the dynamic shifts in the U.S. beer market and broader consumer behavior, noting Michelob Ultra's success is partly due to its non-alcoholic offering and strategic marketing investments.

          <p>Car buyers are accelerating their electric vehicle (EV) purchases to capitalize on federal tax credits, offering up to $7,500 for new and $4,000 for used EVs, before their expiration on September 30. These credits are ending due to President Trump's "One Big Beautiful Bill Act." The approaching deadline has propelled EV sales to record levels in August, with new and used EV sales surging by 17.7% and 59% respectively, year-over-year. Dealerships are also contributing to the rush by offering significant incentives to reduce inventory. While September 2025 is projected to be a record month for EV sales, industry experts anticipate a challenging sales environment post-expiration, leading some automakers to already slow EV production.
