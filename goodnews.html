          <p>British and Irish Lions coach Andy Farrell is preparing for the crucial second Test against Australia, calling it "the biggest game of our lives." Key players like Joe McCarthy and Mack Hansen are likely to miss the match due to injuries, forcing Farrell to reconsider his lineup. Speculation surrounds potential changes in the backline, with Garry Ringrose possibly returning, and on the bench, where several players are vying for a spot. The team aims to secure a series victory at the momentous Melbourne Cricket Ground.</p>

          <p>Dottie Dorion, a 91-year-old athlete and avid Peloton user, successfully campaigned for the fitness company to expand its age categories for competitive rankings. After discovering the brackets topped out at 60-plus, she spent 14 months, with legal assistance, urging Peloton to create new divisions for older riders. In response, Peloton has now added 90-plus and 100-plus age groups, allowing senior athletes like Dorion to compete more fairly. Her persistence highlights a commitment to lifelong fitness and advocacy for senior representation in athletic communities.</p>

          <p>Arsenal is close to finalizing a deal to sign Swedish striker Viktor Gyokeres from Sporting for a reported €73.5 million (£63.5 million). While personal terms and a five-year contract have been agreed upon, the completion of the transfer has been delayed by ongoing negotiations between the clubs over add-on payments. Gyokeres has been a top target for Arsenal manager Mikel Arteta, who is keen to add an elite goal-scorer to his squad. The striker is coming off a prolific season, having scored 54 goals in 52 appearances for Sporting.</p>

          <p>The remains of U.S. Air Force Tech. Sgt. Willis R. Hall, who was killed during an attack in Laos in 1968, have been officially accounted for after 57 years. Hall was one of 11 American soldiers killed when their remote radar site on a mountain peak was overrun by enemy commandos during the Vietnam War. His remains were unrecoverable at the time. After several joint U.S.-Laos recovery missions over the decades, evidence and remains discovered earlier this year were positively identified as his through DNA and anthropological analysis, bringing closure to his family.</p>

          <p>Microsoft has recently hired approximately two dozen employees from Google's DeepMind AI research division to bolster its own AI initiatives, including the consumer-facing Copilot assistant. Among the new hires are high-level talents like Amar Subramanya, a former Google vice president of engineering who worked on the Gemini assistant. This talent acquisition is part of a broader, aggressive competition among major tech companies to secure top AI experts. The moves highlight Microsoft's strategic push to strengthen its AI capabilities under the leadership of Mustafa Suleyman, a DeepMind co-founder who now heads Microsoft's AI group.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>As employees return to the office, companies are increasingly using anonymous body heat sensors to understand and improve workspace utilization. Startups like Butlr, a spinoff from MIT Media Lab, provide technology that tracks occupancy, foot traffic, and interaction patterns without using cameras, thus ensuring privacy. The data helps companies make informed decisions on office layout, hybrid work schedules, energy efficiency, and cleaning routines. This technology is gaining traction as businesses seek to create more productive and collaborative environments while managing the rising costs of office upgrades and maintenance.</p>

          <p>US Treasury Secretary Scott Bessent has announced that he will meet with his Chinese counterparts in Stockholm, Sweden, next week for a third round of high-level trade negotiations. The talks aim to continue progress on resolving economic and trade disputes between the two nations. The discussions suggest that the current pause on escalating tariffs, which was set to expire in mid-August, could be extended. Both sides have recently expressed a cautiously optimistic tone, with Beijing's embassy in Washington noting that "new progress" had been made in recent engagements.</p>

          <p>For the first time, AI models from Google and OpenAI have achieved gold-medal-level scores at the prestigious International Mathematical Olympiad (IMO), a competition for top young mathematicians. While the AI programs solved five out of six complex problems, they were still outperformed by human contestants, five of whom achieved perfect scores. The rapid improvement of AI in such a challenging domain is seen as a major milestone, demonstrating astonishing progress in mathematical reasoning capabilities. However, the results also affirm that human ingenuity remains at the forefront of creative problem-solving.</p>

          <p>Students in the Los Angeles Unified School District have achieved their highest-ever test scores in math and English, erasing pandemic-era learning losses and surpassing pre-2020 results. This marks the second consecutive year of strong gains across all tested grade levels, which experts view as solid evidence of effective instruction. While the improvement is significant, particularly for Black and Latino students, overall achievement remains a challenge, with a majority of students still not meeting state standards in math.

The collared cougar attacked the child on a popular trail before the father intervened, pulling the animal off. The child was airlifted to a trauma center with injuries but has since been discharged. Park rangers later tracked and euthanized the animal. While harrowing, officials emphasize that such attacks are extremely rare and there is no ongoing danger to park visitors.</p>
