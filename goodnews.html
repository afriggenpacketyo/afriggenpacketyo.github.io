          <p>The California Department of Corrections and Rehabilitation has announced the planned closure of a state prison in Norco by fall 2026. The decision is attributed to a significant decline in the state's inmate population and is expected to save California approximately $150 million annually. The nearly 3,000 inmates at the medium-security facility will be transferred to other prisons, and the state will attempt to reassign the 1,200 employees. The site, which was once a luxury hotel, may be repurposed, with local officials hopeful for its restoration.</p>

          <p>The U.S. Department of Justice has arrested and charged two Chinese nationals in California for allegedly orchestrating an illegal scheme to ship sensitive AI technology to China. The individuals are accused of exporting tens of millions of dollars' worth of high-end chips, including Nvidia's powerful H100 GPUs, without the required licenses. These chips are subject to strict export controls designed to prevent China from accessing advanced semiconductor technology with potential military applications. The case highlights Washington's growing concern over the smuggling of critical technology and its efforts to enforce export restrictions.</p>

          <p>Economists and policy thinkers in China are currently debating whether the country should establish official, measurable targets for consumption as part of its national economic strategy. Proponents argue that setting a benchmark for the household consumption rate, similar to the GDP growth target, could help expand domestic demand and improve living standards. However, other experts express skepticism, questioning whether such metrics are operationally feasible as policy goals. The discussion is part of the broader planning for China's next five-year economic blueprint, highlighting the focus on boosting internal spending. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>Los Angeles Dodgers rookie pitcher Roki Sasaki is making encouraging progress in his recovery from a shoulder injury that sidelined him earlier this season. After an underwhelming start to his MLB career, the Japanese phenom has begun a throwing program and is showcasing improved velocity, hitting 96 mph in a recent bullpen session. He has also added a two-seam fastball to his arsenal, a change the team hopes will make him more effective. The Dodgers remain optimistic that Sasaki could return by late August and potentially contribute to their postseason push.</p>

          <p>After more than 50 years, police in Virginia have identified the body of a young boy found in 1972 as four-year-old Carl Matthew Bryant from Pennsylvania. The breakthrough in the cold case was made possible through advanced DNA testing on a hair sample and forensic genetic genealogy, which led investigators to the boy's relatives. While the identification provides a name to the victim, the circumstances of his death, believed to be from blunt force trauma, remain a mystery. His six-month-old brother, James, also disappeared at the same time and has never been found.</p>

          <p>Lebanon's government has directed its army to create a plan for the disarmament of Hezbollah, aiming for state institutions to be the sole bearers of arms by the end of the year. The decision is a key component of a ceasefire agreement and follows significant pressure from the United States. Prime Minister Nawaf Salam announced the army must present its implementation plan to the cabinet by the end of August. However, Hezbollah leader Naim Qassem immediately rejected the timeline, stating the group will not disarm while facing Israeli aggression.</p>

          <p>A federal judge in Boston has issued a temporary injunction preventing the Trump administration from reallocating over $4 billion in FEMA disaster mitigation funds. The ruling follows a lawsuit from 20 states arguing that the administration unlawfully terminated the Building Resilient Infrastructure and Communities (BRIC) program and redirected its funds without congressional approval. The judge determined that the move could cause "irreparable harm" to communities vulnerable to natural disasters. The injunction blocks the government from repurposing the funds while the court considers the case.</p>

          <p>After being stalled for 17 years, a major copper mining project in Afghanistan backed by a state-owned Chinese company is reportedly making significant progress. China Metallurgical Group Corporation announced it is preparing to begin extraction this year at the Mes Aynak mine, which holds one of the world's largest untapped copper deposits. The project, first awarded in 2008, was delayed by security issues and concerns over protecting ancient archaeological remains at the site. The Taliban has since approved a switch to underground mining to help preserve the historical relics.</p>

          <p>A new COVID-19 variant, known colloquially as "Stratus" and technically as XFG, is becoming more prevalent in the United States, accounting for an estimated 14% of cases by late June. The variant, a combination of two other strains, was first detected in Southeast Asia and has since spread globally. While its mutations may help it evade some immune responses, the World Health Organization has assessed its public health risk as "low" at a global level. There is currently no evidence that XFG causes more severe disease or significantly different symptoms than previous variants.</p>

Notably, motor vehicle thefts saw a historic one-year drop of 18.6%, though the rate remains higher than pre-pandemic levels. The positive trend reflects a continued decline from the crime spike that occurred during the COVID-19 pandemic, with overall property crime reaching its lowest rate since 1961.</p>

          <p>Following a federal appeals court order, U.S. border agents have been directed to stop deporting migrants under the Trump administration's sweeping asylum ban. The court found that while the government can pause access to the asylum system, it cannot ignore laws protecting migrants from being returned to places where they face torture or persecution. This directive effectively reopens humanitarian protection pathways that had been closed to those crossing the border illegally. The administration had credited the ban for a historic drop in migrant apprehensions at the southern border.</p>
