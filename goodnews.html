          <p>Senator John Fetterman (D-PA) has publicly supported President Trump's decision to strike three Iranian nuclear sites, calling it "the correct move" on X. Fetterman stated that Iran is the world's leading sponsor of terrorism and should not possess nuclear capabilities, expressing gratitude to the U.S. military. Trump declared the operation a "very successful attack" targeting key nuclear sites, while urging de-escalation. The strike, involving bunker buster bombs and Tomahawk missiles, marks a major escalation in the region, following weeks of Israeli strikes to eradicate Iran's offensive missile capabilities. </p>

          <p>An essay explores the experience of not owning a smartphone in a society where they are ubiquitous, noting a shift from being viewed with disdain to being seen with fascination and even envy. The author reflects on the downsides of being phoneless, such as difficulties with navigation and social interactions, but argues that smartphones have negatively impacted people's attention spans, social skills, and overall engagement with the real world. The piece critiques the reliance on technology for social connection and the outsourcing of responsibility to devices, suggesting that the lack of a smartphone allows for a more authentic and present existence. The author concludes by acknowledging that their refusal to get a smartphone is an implicit admission that they would become just as addicted to it as anyone else.</p>
