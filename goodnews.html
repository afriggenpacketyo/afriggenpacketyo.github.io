          <p>Apple has announced a price increase for its Apple TV+ streaming service, raising the monthly subscription cost for U.S. customers from $9.99 to $12.99. The annual subscription price will remain unchanged at $99.99. This change is effective immediately for new subscribers, while existing customers will see the new price reflected 30 days after their next renewal date. This marks the second price hike for the service in less than two years, following an increase from $6.99 to $9.99 in October 2023, signaling a shift in strategy for the content platform.</p>

          <p>Federal Reserve Chair Jerome Powell is scheduled to deliver a highly anticipated speech at the annual Jackson Hole economic symposium, where markets expect signals about a potential September interest rate cut. The address comes during a period of intense political pressure from the Trump administration, which has been critical of the Fed's policies and leadership. Analysts expect Powell to discuss the economic outlook and the Fed's long-term policy framework, all while navigating the challenges of maintaining the central bank's independence from political influence.

        </div>
        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>As U.S. credit card debt surpasses $1.2 trillion and delinquency rates climb, debt forgiveness programs are becoming a key option for struggling borrowers. Generally, individuals who qualify for these programs have at least $7,500 in unsecured debt, are facing verifiable financial hardship such as job loss or medical emergencies, and are often already behind on their payments. Creditors are more willing to negotiate a settlement for less than the full amount owed when they believe a borrower is genuinely unable to pay, making these conditions critical for eligibility.

        </div>
        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>A recent survey reveals a growing trend where 44% of American adults are ordering meals from children's menus at restaurants. The primary motivations cited for this behavior are saving money and preferring smaller portion sizes, reflecting heightened economic pressures on consumers. This trend coincides with reports from major fast-food chains like McDonald's and Wendy's of slowing sales, particularly among lower-income customers. For many adults, the lower prices and simpler options on kids' menus offer a practical solution for dining out on a budget.</p>

        </div>
        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>The rapid expansion of data centers across the U.S. is creating a significant labor shortage, as these facilities compete with other industries for a shrinking pool of skilled trade workers like electricians and HVAC technicians. With many older workers retiring and fewer young people entering these trades, an estimated 400,000 skilled jobs are currently unfilled, a number projected to grow substantially. While technology companies are developing software to improve efficiency, industry experts emphasize the need for aggressive recruitment into well-paying apprenticeship programs to fill the critical labor gap.</p>

          <p>The Women's National Basketball Association (WNBA) has officially broken its all-time single-season attendance record, with over 2.5 million fans attending games so far this year. The league achieved this milestone with fewer games and teams than when the previous record was set in 2002, highlighting a significant surge in popularity for women's basketball. This achievement comes as the WNBA is actively expanding, with plans to grow from 15 to 18 teams by 2030, adding new franchises in cities like Toronto, Portland, and Philadelphia to meet growing demand.</p>

          <p>With mortgage rates trending downward and a possible Federal Reserve rate cut on the horizon, financial experts are advising homeowners to prepare for a potential refinancing opportunity. Key preparatory steps include reviewing credit reports for errors, protecting credit scores by avoiding new debt, and estimating home equity. Homeowners should also begin gathering necessary documents like proof of income and insurance. By taking these steps in advance, borrowers can act quickly and opportunistically if rates drop to a level that makes refinancing financially beneficial. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>A new $3 billion biologics manufacturing plant in North Carolina by Fujifilm highlights the significant time and investment required for pharmaceutical companies to increase U.S. production. The five-year project timeline illustrates the difficulty of quickly shifting supply chains in response to potential tariffs threatened by the Trump administration. While recent policy changes have made U.S. manufacturing more attractive, the complexity and regulatory hurdles of building new facilities mean that outrunning tariffs will be a long-term challenge for the industry.

        </div>
        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Sales of previously owned homes in the U.S. rose by 2% in July from the previous month, defying analyst expectations for a decline. The increase is attributed to a slight dip in mortgage rates during May and June when these sales contracts were likely signed. Concurrently, housing inventory reached its highest level since May 2020, which is helping to ease pressure on prices. The median home price saw only a minor 0.2% annual increase, suggesting the market may be reaching an inflection point toward greater affordability. (not investment advice)</p>
