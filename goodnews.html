          <p>Amazon has significantly expanded its same-day delivery service to include fresh groceries like produce, meat, and dairy in 1,000 U.S. cities and towns. The service, free for Prime members on orders over $25, aims to create a one-stop shop for a wide range of customer needs, from household goods to electronics. This major expansion positions Amazon to compete more directly with services like Instacart and Walmart+. The company plans to extend the service to an additional 2,300 locations by the end of 2025, reflecting the high demand for convenient grocery options.</p>

        </div>
        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Walmart announced it is expanding its 10% employee discount to cover nearly all grocery items, including milk, meat, and frozen foods, effective immediately. This benefit, previously limited to produce and seasonal food items, will now apply to 95% of store products for its 1.6 million U.S. employees. The move comes as rising tariffs spark concerns about higher consumer prices, which Walmart's CFO has acknowledged the company cannot fully absorb. The expanded discount aims to alleviate financial pressure on its workforce and may also boost employee retention and spending at its stores.</p>

          <p>A recent report from Intercontinental Exchange reveals that U.S. homeowners' equity has reached a record high, with approximately 48 million mortgage holders possessing tappable funds. The average homeowner now holds about $213,000 in accessible equity, which can be borrowed through financial products like home equity loans or HELOCs. This surge in equity is attributed to a combination of consistent mortgage payments and rising property values. While this provides a significant financial resource for many, homeowners are advised to borrow cautiously as their property serves as collateral for these loans. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>Amazon Web Services CEO Matt Garman advises that critical thinking will be the most crucial skill for success in the age of artificial intelligence, rather than highly technical abilities. He emphasizes that as AI tools become more integrated into the workplace, employers will prioritize soft skills like creativity, flexibility, and the ability to learn and adapt. Garman believes that AI cannot replicate the human intellect required for generating new ideas and making nuanced judgments. He suggests that both students and current workers should focus on honing these skills to remain valuable in the evolving job market.</p>

          <p>China's largest lithium producer, Ganfeng, has partnered with Swiss-based Lithium Argentina to develop a major lithium extraction project in Argentina. The joint venture aims to produce the equivalent of 150,000 tonnes of lithium carbonate annually from saline water in the nation's northwest. This collaboration intensifies the global race for lithium, a critical component for electric vehicle batteries and renewable energy storage. The alliance is expected to provide access to advanced technology and greater financial flexibility, strengthening the global lithium supply chain.</p>

          <p>Small-cap stocks experienced a significant rally, with the Russell 2000 index gaining over 1%, while large-cap technology stocks saw a downturn. This market rotation is driven by growing investor confidence that the Federal Reserve will cut interest rates in September. Lower rates are expected to particularly benefit smaller companies, which often rely on borrowing for operations and expansion, by reducing their capital costs. Interest rate futures traders are now pricing in a nearly 100% probability of a rate cut at the Fed's next meeting, a sharp increase in confidence from a month ago. (not investment advice)</p>

          <h2>Port of Los Angeles Reports Record July Imports Driven by Tariff Preemption</h2>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>The Port of Los Angeles processed a record-breaking volume of containers in July, a direct consequence of shippers front-loading cargo to get ahead of new tariffs on Chinese goods. The port handled over one million container units, the highest in its 117-year history, with imports also hitting an all-time high. This surge in activity, driven by retailers like Walmart and Home Depot, reflects a broader trend of an early and intense peak shipping season. However, analysts note that the high tariff levels have still led to a pullback in overall order volumes, particularly for lower-cost retail items. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>European leaders expressed cautious optimism following a virtual meeting with President Trump ahead of his summit with Russian President Vladimir Putin. Trump reportedly assured them his goal is to secure a ceasefire in Ukraine and that any territorial decisions must involve Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky. The call was a last-ditch effort by European allies to ensure their security concerns and Ukraine's interests are prioritized. Despite Trump's assurances, leaders remain nervous that he could be persuaded by Putin to concede Ukrainian territory in exchange for a halt in fighting.</p>

          <p>A recently passed federal budget bill has increased the flexibility of 529 college savings plans, making them more powerful tools for education-related expenses. Originally designed for higher education, these tax-advantaged accounts can now be used for a broader range of costs, including vocational programs, required continuing education courses, and professional licensing exam preparation. This expansion addresses a common concern among parents that their children might not pursue traditional college, making the accounts a more versatile option for funding various career paths. The changes also include a provision for rolling unused funds into an IRA. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>Social Security beneficiaries may receive a 2.7% cost-of-living adjustment (COLA) in 2026, according to a new estimate from the Senior Citizens League. This projection, based on the latest inflation data, is slightly higher than the 2.5% increase retirees received for 2025. The Social Security Administration determines the annual COLA each fall to ensure benefits keep pace with inflation, with the official announcement scheduled for October. While inflation has remained relatively stable in 2025, some economists express concern that a moderate COLA might not be sufficient if consumer prices rise later in the year.
