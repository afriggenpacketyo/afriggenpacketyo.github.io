          <p>Australia's central bank has unexpectedly kept its key interest rate at 3.85%, diverging from economists' predictions of a rate cut. The Reserve Bank of Australia stated it needs more time to assess incoming data and confirm that inflation is sustainably moving towards its 2.5% target. Recent monthly inflation indicators were slightly stronger than anticipated, although the annual rate remains at a four-year low. The decision comes as Australia's economy faces a slowdown, with weaker consumer demand and shrinking public spending contributing to lower-than-expected growth in the first quarter.

          <p>A new gene therapy, delivered via a single injection, has successfully reversed hearing loss in a clinical trial involving both children and adults with a specific genetic mutation. The research, published in Nature Medicine, involved delivering a healthy copy of the OTOF gene into the inner ear. All ten participants showed considerable hearing improvement within six months, with one seven-year-old regaining nearly full hearing. The therapy was found to be safe and well-tolerated, offering hope that similar treatments could one day be developed for other common genetic causes of deafness.</p>

          <p>Singapore is becoming an increasingly popular destination for Chinese students seeking overseas education, as the United States loses some of its traditional appeal. Many Chinese nationals are now shifting their postgraduate ambitions from the U.S. to Singapore, citing cultural adjustment difficulties and safety concerns in America. They are drawn to Singapore's welcoming environment, cultural similarities, and high degree of economic and diplomatic openness. Industry experts predict this trend may lead to a short-term increase in applications from Chinese students to Singaporean universities, which already host a significant international student population.</p>

          <p>The Transportation Security Administration is ending its nearly 20-year-old policy requiring passengers to remove their shoes at security checkpoints. The change is being rolled out in phases, with travelers at several major airports, including BWI and Fort Lauderdale, now permitted to keep their footwear on through standard screening lanes. This move, which previously only applied to TSA PreCheck members, is part of an effort to enhance the passenger experience and speed up security lines. The original no-shoes rule was implemented nationwide in 2006, years after the attempted "shoe bomber" incident in 2001.</p>

          <h2>Los Angeles City Council Advances Policy to Curb Tenant Evictions for Renovations</h2>
          <div class="timestamp">2025-07-07 22:29:33 EDT</div>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>The Los Angeles City Council has moved to permanently restrict "renovictions," where landlords evict tenants under the guise of substantial remodels to charge higher rents. An approved amendment to the city's "just cause" ordinance will prevent landlords from using renovations as a legal reason for eviction unless they have an official government order to vacate the property for safety reasons. The city is also developing rules to ensure tenants are properly relocated during legitimate remodels, either through monetary compensation or by providing comparable temporary housing, with the right to return afterward.</p>

          <p>In an effort to revive its tourism sector and economy, China has significantly expanded its visa-free entry policy, now allowing citizens from 74 countries to visit for up to 30 days without a visa. The move has led to a noticeable increase in foreign visitors, with travel companies reporting a sharp rise in bookings, particularly from European countries included in the new policy. While most visitors are still domestic tourists, the relaxed regulations are making travel to China much less of a hassle, and tour operators are preparing for a larger influx of international travelers.</p>

          <p>Caltech has announced it will sever ties with the e-learning company Simplilearn after settling a class-action lawsuit. The suit alleged that the university and the firm misled students by marketing a cybersecurity "boot camp" that had minimal connection to Caltech's faculty or standards. As part of the settlement, Simplilearn will refund tuition to hundreds of students and agreed to greater transparency in its marketing. The move is a significant development in the scrutiny of online program managers that partner with prestigious universities to sell courses of sometimes questionable quality.</p>

          <p>The Department of Veterans Affairs has reversed its plan to lay off tens of thousands of employees, stating that a large-scale reduction-in-force is no longer necessary. The VA is on track to reduce its staff by about 30,000 by the end of the fiscal year through attrition, retirements, and a hiring freeze, which has eliminated the need for the previously considered RIF. The initial plan, which aimed to cut the workforce by up to 15%, had drawn criticism from some lawmakers who worried about the impact on veterans' care and a toxic work environment contributing to staff losses.</p>

          <p>A comprehensive review by the Justice Department and FBI has concluded that disgraced financier Jeffrey Epstein died by suicide in 2019 and that investigators found no evidence of a "client list" or of him blackmailing prominent individuals. The findings, detailed in a memo, aimed to address years of public speculation and conspiracy theories. The review confirmed that video footage showed no one entered Epstein's cell at the time of his death. The DOJ stated that perpetuating unfounded theories serves no purpose and that no further disclosure of materials is warranted.</p>

          <p>Dodgers pitcher Clayton Kershaw has been named to his 11th career All-Star team, this time as a "Legend Pick" by the MLB Commissioner. The selection, which recognizes his career accomplishments, came as a surprise to the 37-year-old pitcher, who has only made nine starts this season after returning from surgery. Kershaw expressed gratitude for the "tremendous honor," calling the selection "weird but cool." While his limited workload would not normally warrant a spot, his performance has been solid, and the pick celebrates his status as a future Hall of Famer.</p>

          <p>Police in Budapest have announced they will not pursue legal action against the thousands of people who participated in the city's Pride parade in late June, despite the event being officially banned by the government. Authorities cited public uncertainty over the event's legal status, which was created after Budapest's mayor declared it an official municipal event, potentially exempting it from the ban. The decision comes as a relief to participants who faced potential fines. The march attracted a record crowd of over 200,000 in defiance of Prime Minister Viktor Orban's anti-LGBTQ+ policies.</p>
