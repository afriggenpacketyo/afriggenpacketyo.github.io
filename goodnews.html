          <p>England completed a comprehensive ODI series sweep against the West Indies with a dominant nine-wicket victory in a rain-shortened match at Taunton.

          <p>Amid parliamentary deadlock, French politicians are turning to remembrance policies, adopting texts that reclassify historical events or offer reparations. The National Assembly voted to posthumously promote Alfred Dreyfus and passed a law to recognize and compensate former returnees from French Indochina. Additionally, the Assembly adopted a resolution addressing Haiti's "double debt" dating back to 1825. While some see this as social maturity, others view it as symbolic gestures easier to pass than structural reforms. </p>
