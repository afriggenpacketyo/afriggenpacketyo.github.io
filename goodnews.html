          <p>Small-cap stocks experienced a significant rally, with the Russell 2000 index gaining over 1% while major technology stocks, including the Magnificent 7, saw a decline. This market rotation is driven by growing investor confidence that the Federal Reserve will cut interest rates in September, which would lower borrowing costs and potentially boost companies that are more sensitive to economic cycles. Despite the recent gains, small-cap stocks have underperformed larger tech companies significantly since late 2022, but the prospect of monetary easing is now shifting investor focus.

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>The Port of Los Angeles processed a record-breaking volume of containers in July, a surge directly attributed to shippers front-loading cargo to get ahead of tariff deadlines imposed by the Trump administration. The port handled over one million twenty-foot equivalent units, the highest in its 117-year history, reflecting a rush to import Chinese goods before increased tariffs took effect. However, industry experts note that this has created an unusual, front-loaded peak season, and they anticipate a subsequent slowdown in shipping volumes, which could negatively impact trucking and rail companies.</p>

          <p>This opinion article supports President Trump's decision to use federal resources to address the high crime rate in Washington, D.C., framing it as a common-sense move to restore public safety. The author criticizes Democrats for allegedly downplaying the severity of the crime problem and argues that ensuring safety is a fundamental government responsibility, drawing parallels to Rudy Giuliani's successful efforts in New York City. The piece suggests that by tackling issues like juvenile crime and cashless bail, the initiative could set a positive national trend for urban safety.</p>

          <p>A recently passed federal budget bill has significantly increased the flexibility of 529 college savings plans, making them more powerful tools for funding education and career development. Originally designed for higher education, these tax-advantaged accounts can now be used for a broader range of expenses, including vocational programs, required continuing education courses, and costs related to professional licensing exams. This expansion, along with a provision allowing unused funds to be rolled into an IRA, aims to alleviate parents' concerns that the saved money might go unused. (not investment advice)</p>

This projection is based on recent inflation data, which has held steady, though some economists worry it may not be sufficient if inflation rises later in the year due to factors like tariffs. The official COLA, which is designed to help benefits keep pace with rising prices, will be announced by the Social Security Administration in October after reviewing inflation data from the third quarter.</p>

          <p>Shares of the cryptocurrency exchange Bullish surged dramatically in their New York Stock Exchange debut, more than doubling from their initial public offering price. The company, which is backed by Peter Thiel and led by former NYSE President Tom Farley, raised approximately $1.1 billion after pricing its IPO well above the expected range. The successful listing is seen as a sign of growing institutional interest in the crypto market, coming amid a more favorable regulatory attitude from the Trump administration and following other successful public offerings by crypto-related firms this year.

          <p>The stock market saw modest gains driven by an unexpected leader, the healthcare sector, while the typically dominant artificial intelligence and chip stocks took a breather. Companies like UnitedHealth Group and Eli Lilly experienced a bounce-back, lifting the health-care sector, which has otherwise underperformed this year. The pullback in AI-related stocks, including Nvidia and Broadcom, followed a cautious earnings outlook from data center company CoreWeave, which cited power availability constraints rather than a drop in demand for its unchanged capital expenditure forecast.

          <p>A new analysis of an ancient Incan khipu, a record-keeping device made of knotted cords, suggests that their creation was not limited to the ruling elite as previously thought. Researchers studying a khipu made from human hair determined from its chemical composition that its creator had a diet of a commoner, not an elite. This discovery challenges the historical understanding of literacy and record-keeping within the vast Inca Empire, which relied entirely on this system instead of a written script. The finding could help bridge the gap between ancient imperial khipus and more modern versions.</p>

          <p>A new poll shows progressive Democrat Zohran Mamdani widening his lead in the New York City mayoral race, placing him 19 points ahead of his nearest rival, former Governor Andrew Cuomo. Mamdani, a 33-year-old state assemblyman endorsed by prominent left-wing figures, is now facing increased scrutiny over his credentials and personal finances as the frontrunner. To counter attacks from rivals and consolidate support, his campaign has shifted focus to a "Five Boroughs Against Trump" tour, aiming to unite New York Democrats against the current U.S. president.</p>

A $75,000 deposit in a one-year CD at a 4.40% rate could earn $3,300, while a five-year CD at 4.15% could yield nearly $17,000 in interest. Because CD rates are fixed, they lock in current high returns and protect savers from potential future interest rate cuts, making them an attractive option for those who can part with their funds for a set term.

          <p>Walmart announced it is expanding its employee discount to cover nearly all grocery items, a move that comes as rising tariffs are expected to increase consumer prices. The company's 1.6 million U.S. employees will now receive a 10% discount on food items like milk and meat, which was previously a limited-time holiday perk. In a memo, Walmart's chief people officer acknowledged that the expanded benefit was one of the most requested by staff.

Dundon, a Dallas-based businessman and chairman of Dundon Capital Partners, is also the majority owner of major pickleball associations. The sale, which is subject to NBA approval, would transfer ownership from Jody Allen, who has managed the team since her brother's death in 2018.</p>

His comments come as Spain's La Liga and Italy's Serie A are seeking permission to stage league games in the United States and Australia. The Premier League had previously considered a "39th game" concept over a decade ago but shelved it after backlash from fans. Masters explained that the league has found other ways to grow internationally, making the controversial move unnecessary.</p>

          <p>A new federal policy, part of the "One Big Beautiful Bill Act," is set to provide significant tax relief to retirees in Ohio by exempting Social Security income from federal taxes for most seniors. The law introduces a new deduction that is expected to benefit approximately 2.1 million of the state's 2.2 million seniors. The policy primarily helps middle-income retirees, as it phases out for high-earners and offers no additional savings for those who already owe no federal income tax. This senior deduction is temporary and set to expire after the 2028 tax year.</p>
