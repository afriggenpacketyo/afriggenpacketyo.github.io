          <p>Former President Donald Trump is planning to attend the Iowa State Fair this summer, signaling his continued focus on the state that played a key role in his return to the White House. The visit, with dates still under discussion, is seen as an effort to bolster Republican support in farm country and commemorate the nation's 250th anniversary. Trump last attended the fair in August 2023, drawing large crowds and relishing the spectacle, and he later won the Iowa caucuses by a significant margin. During his previous visit, Trump also proposed hosting a year-long exhibition at the Iowa State Fairgrounds for the nation's semiquincentennial in 2026, showcasing pavilions from all 50 states.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>A $50,000 annuity can supplement retirement income, providing consistent monthly payments for life, but the exact amount varies based on several factors. For a 65-year-old man, a $50,000 immediate fixed annuity might yield around $325 per month, while a woman of the same age could receive about $313 per month, according to Annuity.org analysis of Cannex data. These figures are influenced by age, gender, annuity type (joint life annuities pay less), interest rates, and optional features. Deciding if a $50,000 annuity is suitable depends on prioritizing guaranteed income over potential investment growth, with considerations for liquidity and opportunity costs.

          <p>Aiden Markram's unbeaten century has propelled South Africa to the verge of a historic victory over Australia in the World Test Championship final. Markram's stellar innings, combined with an unbroken 143-run partnership with Temba Bavuma, has left South Africa needing just 69 runs to secure the win. The match, characterized by fluctuating fortunes, saw Australia initially gain the upper hand before South Africa's strong batting performance shifted the momentum. A win would end South Africa's long wait for a major men's final victory, potentially shedding their reputation as international cricket's chokers.</p>

          <p>The WNBA and E.W. Scripps have announced a multiyear media rights agreement to broadcast Friday night WNBA games on Ion, along with a new weekly studio show dedicated exclusively to WNBA coverage. The deal's value remains undisclosed, though the original deal, expiring at the end of 2025, was estimated at $13 million annually. Ion's viewership of WNBA Friday Night Spotlight has surged by 133% year-over-year, reaching over 23 million unique viewers, driven by the popularity of stars like Caitlin Clark and Angel Reese. WNBA Commissioner Cathy Engelbert highlighted the partnership's role in expanding the league's reach and visibility, coinciding with an 11-year media rights deal with Disney, Amazon, and NBCUniversal valued at approximately $200 million per year.</p>

          <p>Many countries face shortages of blood donors, prompting the search for artificial, lab-made blood, with several promising approaches being explored by scientists worldwide. These include genetically modifying red blood cells, neutralizing blood types with gut bacteria enzymes, and creating microscopic artificial blood cells. The US military is also backing research to enhance red blood cells with nanoparticles for military applications, and Japanese researchers are testing artificial hemoglobin derived from unused blood bank reserves. Despite progress, challenges remain, including the risk of anaphylactic reactions and the need to replicate all functions of biological blood, making human blood donations essential for the foreseeable future.</p>

          <p>The FDA has broadened its approval of Moderna's respiratory syncytial virus (RSV) vaccine, mRESVIA, to include adults under 60 at increased risk of the disease. This expansion follows a clinical trial demonstrating the vaccine's ability to boost immune responses in younger adults, with over one-third of adults between 18 and 59 having underlying conditions that elevate their RSV risk. While the FDA approves vaccines, the CDC sets recommendations for who should receive them, and the CDC's advisory committee will need to vote on recommending the vaccine for this new age group. The CDC director role remains vacant, and recent changes to the advisory committee's membership may influence future vaccination recommendations.</p>

This shift coincides with a moderation in heated rhetoric surrounding President Trump's tariffs and progress in trade negotiations, particularly with China.
