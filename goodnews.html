          <p>German Finance Minister Lars Klingbeil has called for a swift resolution to the trade tariff dispute with the United States, emphasizing the shared interest in avoiding economic harm. His statement follows President Trump's recent push for a 50% tariff on goods from the European Union, which could significantly impact both the U.S. and German economies. Klingbeil stressed the importance of joint solutions and highlighted that tariffs could raise consumer prices in the United States, particularly on German products like cars, pharmaceuticals, and machinery (not investment advice).</p>

          <h2>Emotionally Safe Parenting Emerges as Effective Approach</h2>
          <div class="timestamp">2025-05-25 13:36:51 EDT</div>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>A new parenting style called "emotionally safe parenting" is gaining traction as a more effective approach than traditional methods. This framework emphasizes emotional attunement, self-awareness, and inner healing, focusing on creating a safe environment for children to express their emotions openly. Emotionally safe parents accept their child's feelings without judgment, view misbehavior as a signal for support, and set boundaries with empathy rather than control. The approach involves parents doing their own inner work to become less reactive and modeling healthy conflict resolution by apologizing and reconnecting after difficult moments.</p>

          <p>Tommy Paul, the 12th-seeded American tennis player, secured a victory in his first-round match at the French Open, but the win was overshadowed by his recent experience with a repossessed truck. Paul explained that he missed three payments on his Ford F-150 after changing banks, leading to the vehicle's repossession, an incident he found humorous despite his $10.8 million career earnings. After discovering the truck was missing through his trainer, Paul was able to recover it, sharing the experience on social media with a video set to Celine Dion's "My Heart Will Go On."</p>
