          <h2>Chinese Researchers Discover Exercise-Induced Compound That May Slow Aging</h2>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>A team of Chinese scientists has identified betaine, a compound naturally produced in the kidneys during sustained exercise, as a key factor in slowing the aging process. Their research, published in the journal Cell, reveals that betaine combats inflammation and organ aging by inhibiting a specific enzyme. This discovery helps explain the molecular mechanisms behind the anti-aging benefits of physical activity. The findings suggest that simulating the effects of exercise through strategies involving betaine could offer new avenues for anti-aging therapies.</p>

This strategy is part of a fierce competition for AI expertise against other tech giants like Google. The market's positive reaction positions Meta alongside Microsoft and Nvidia as tech megacaps reaching new valuation peaks driven by the AI boom. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>A burgeoning coffee culture is spreading from China's urban centers to its countryside, leading to a rapid increase in rural cafes. These new establishments often attract customers with unique natural settings perfect for social media, but some observers question the long-term viability of this trend. While China's coffee industry is now valued at over $42 billion and consumption continues to grow, the reliance on a novelty-seeking, influencer-driven customer base may not be sustainable. The phenomenon reflects a significant cultural shift in a nation traditionally dominated by tea.</p>

          <p>The Los Angeles Lakers have agreed to a two-year, $12 million deal with forward Jake LaRavia shortly after losing key role player Dorian Finney-Smith to the Houston Rockets. Finney-Smith, who opted out of his contract with the Lakers, signed a four-year, $53 million deal with Houston. LaRavia, a 6-foot-7 wing, provides the Lakers with needed depth after the departure of Finney-Smith, who was a versatile defender and contributor for the team last season. LaRavia averaged 6.9 points and shot 42.3% from three-point range in the previous season.</p>

Business Secretary Jonathan Reynolds stated that the system has not been seriously examined for decades and needs modernization to better support working families. Campaign groups have praised the review, calling it a generational opportunity for improvement, while a recent parliamentary committee labeled the UK's current system one of the worst in the developed world.

          <p>The U.S. military commander overseeing National Guard troops in Los Angeles has asked the Trump administration to return 200 troops to California's command to assist with wildfire season. The request comes as the state's specialized firefighting Guard unit is reportedly at only 40% of its normal staffing levels. Governor Gavin Newsom, who has legally challenged the federalization of the troops for immigration-related unrest, supports the move, urging President Trump to "stop the political theater" and return the Guard to their critical firefighting duties as multiple wildfires burn across Southern California.</p>

In an interview, Jassy explained that both Amazon and its third-party sellers mitigated the impact by purchasing inventory in advance to avoid the uncertainty. He also noted that the diversity of sellers on Amazon's marketplace creates competition that helps keep prices stable, as some sellers will absorb costs to gain market share.

          <p>Energy bills for 21 million households in Great Britain are set to fall by 7% starting Tuesday under the latest price cap from regulator Ofgem, providing some relief to consumers. However, analysts caution that prices are unlikely to fall substantially further and remain hundreds of pounds above pre-pandemic levels, with future costs for the winter still uncertain due to global market volatility. Ofgem is encouraging consumers to explore fixed-rate deals, which could offer more payment certainty and potential savings. The change applies to customers on variable tariffs, while those on fixed deals will see no change.</p>
