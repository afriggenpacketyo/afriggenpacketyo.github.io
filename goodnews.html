          <h2>Psychiatrist Argues for Nuanced Understanding of Antidepressant Harms</h2>
          <div class="timestamp">2025-05-03 13:40:48 EDT</div>
        </div>
        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>A psychiatrist, Dr. Awais Aftab, argues that while antidepressants are transformative for some, a less advertised side includes sexual side effects, manic episodes, suicidal thoughts, and severe withdrawal symptoms. He notes the medical community's alarm at comparisons to heroin, yet many patients feel validated by such concerns due to their experiences with withdrawal. Given the long-term use of antidepressants, Dr. Aftab stresses the need for more research into their long-term effects and safe tapering strategies, highlighting the current lack of high-quality trials and official guidelines. The article calls for scientific transparency and engagement with patients' concerns to maintain credibility in psychiatric care.</p>

          <p>The Three Brothers Diner in Danbury, Connecticut, a family-run business for 50 years, is facing economic uncertainty due to decreased consumer sentiment. Owner Stanley Kallivrousis has noticed reduced foot traffic and altered eating habits, with customers sharing meals and taking leftovers home. Economic challenges have paused expansion plans and made staff retention difficult, with many cooks leaving for the gig economy. Despite these challenges, Kallivrousis emphasizes the diner's role as a community gathering place, supported by loyal customers who make it part of their routine.</p>
