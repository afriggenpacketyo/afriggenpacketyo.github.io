          <p>Former Sinn F√©in leader Gerry Adams has been awarded ‚Ç¨100,000 in damages after winning a libel case against the BBC regarding a 2016 BBC NI Spotlight program and online article. The article alleged that Adams sanctioned the 2006 murder of Denis Donaldson, a claim Adams denies. The court found that the BBC did not report the allegations in good faith, and the jury sided with Adams after deliberating for nearly seven hours. Adams stated that the case was about holding the BBC accountable for upholding the ethos of the British state in Ireland, which he believes is out of sync with the Good Friday Agreement. The legal bill for the case is believed to be between ‚Ç¨3-5 million, making it one of the most expensive cases the corporation has ever fought.</p>

Cramer also discussed upcoming earnings reports for CrowdStrike and Broadcom, highlighting the progress Broadcom is making with cloud software firm VMWare.

The CDC still recommends COVID-19 vaccines for moderately or severely immunocompromised children and most adults. COVID-19 vaccines during pregnancy are now listed as "No Guidance/Not Applicable," where they were previously recommended for all pregnant adults.</p>

          <p>With the Federal Reserve indicating that interest rate cuts are unlikely in the near future, consumers are advised to take proactive steps to manage their finances. Experts recommend paying down credit card debt, locking in high-yield savings rates, and improving credit scores. Switching to a zero-interest balance transfer credit card or consolidating high-interest credit cards with a lower-rate personal loan can help reduce debt. Moving money into a high-yield savings account can provide better returns before rates potentially decrease. (not investment advice)</p>

Experts advise borrowing an amount that can be comfortably repaid, considering the potential for changing interest rates and market conditions.

The interest rates on both have steadily declined in recent months, with HELOCs hitting a two-year low and home equity loan rates falling to a 2025 low this month. (not investment advice)</p>
