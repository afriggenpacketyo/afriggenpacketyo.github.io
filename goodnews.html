        </div>
        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>According to the Office for National Statistics (ONS), the number of babies born to fathers aged 60 and over in England and Wales saw a significant 14.2% increase in 2024 compared to the previous year. This trend of older fatherhood coincides with a continued decrease in births to parents under 30, reflecting a broader pattern of delaying parenthood. While total births in England rose slightly for the first time since 2021, experts and charities point to the high cost of living as a major barrier for younger people starting families.</p>

          <h2>Business Professor Recommends Asking 'What Kind of Person Should Not Work Here?' in Job Interviews</h2>

        </div>
        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>NYU Stern professor and author Suzy Welch suggests a powerful question for job seekers to uncover a company's true values: 'What kind of person should not work at this company?' This question often elicits more honest and less rehearsed answers from hiring managers, revealing the real workplace culture beyond corporate platitudes about innovation and excellence. Welch advises asking this question late in the interview process, as the responses can provide crucial insights into whether a company's actual operational values align with a candidate's personal ones.</p>

          <h2>Analysis Explains Why Trump's Tariffs Have Not Yet Caused Major Price Spikes in the U.S.</h2>

        </div>
        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Despite initial fears, President Trump's tariffs have not led to a significant surge in U.S. inflation, with key price indexes remaining relatively stable. Economists attribute this to several short-term factors, including companies 'front-loading' inventory to pre-empt the tariffs, absorbing some costs to avoid losing customers, and using logistical loopholes like bonded warehouses to delay duty payments. However, experts caution that these are temporary buffers and that price increases are still likely to materialize in the latter half of the year. (not investment advice)</p>

          <h2>Essay Explores the Mainstreaming of Kink in Literature and Culture</h2>
          <div class="timestamp">2025-07-01 09:50:00 EDT</div>
        </div>
        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>This article examines the cultural shift that has moved literary works exploring kink and BDSM from the fringes to the mainstream, sharing shelf space with other major genres. It notes how the de-pathologization of these practices in psychology has corresponded with a growing market for both fiction and non-fiction on the topic. The essay reviews Brittany Newell's novel 'Soft Core,' praising it as an ambitious work that delves into the psychology of kink with emotional depth and intellectual rigor, capturing the complex feelings of its characters.</p>
