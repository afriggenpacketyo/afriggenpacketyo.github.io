          <p>The Trump administration has lifted its stop-work order on Equinor's Empire Wind 1 offshore wind farm project in New York, allowing construction to resume. This decision follows apparent compromises related to gas pipeline projects within the state. Empire Wind 1 will be the first offshore wind project to deliver electricity directly to New York City and is expected to support 1,500 union jobs. Equinor aims to proceed with installation activities this year to achieve commercial operations by 2027, minimizing the impact of the prior work stoppage.</p>

        </div>
        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>As seniors face financial pressures, experts are weighing the pros and cons of using a home equity line of credit (HELOC) versus a reverse mortgage. HELOCs offer flexible financing at lower interest rates, beneficial for short-term needs like home improvements or debt repayment. Reverse mortgages, typically available to seniors 62 and up, allow homeowners to convert home equity into cash without monthly payments, ideal for those with limited income. However, reverse mortgages accrue interest and fees, reducing home equity over time, making HELOCs preferable for those who can afford the monthly payments. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>Texas senators and a congressman are advocating for federal reimbursement for the state's border security expenses incurred under the Biden administration. The proposed State Border Security Assistance Act would create funding sources within the Justice Department and Homeland Security Department to reimburse states for border security actions taken after January 20, 2021. Texas initiated and funded Operation Lone Star due to perceived federal inaction, and lawmakers argue the state deserves reimbursement for costs related to border wall construction, law enforcement surveillance, and the detention and prosecution of illegal immigrants.</p>
