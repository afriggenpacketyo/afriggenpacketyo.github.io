          <p>France staged a dramatic comeback to defeat Ireland 18-13 in the Rugby World Cup quarter-finals, ending Ireland's hopes of a semi-final appearance. Ireland established a dominant 13-0 lead in the first half, scoring two tries while two French players were in the sin bin. However, a crucial defensive stand by France before halftime proved pivotal. In the second half, France scored 18 unanswered points, with a decisive try from Joanna Grisez completing the turnaround. The victory sends France to a semi-final match against either England or Scotland, continuing Ireland's winless streak against the French side since 2017.</p>

          <p>A new exhibition at the Art Institute of Chicago is spotlighting the work of Gustave Caillebotte, often considered one of the lesser-known French Impressionist painters. While his most famous work, "Paris Street; Rainy Day," is widely recognized, the exhibition delves into his broader portfolio, which unconventionally focused on male subjects in daily life. Some of his works, like "The Floor Scrapers," were considered scandalous at the time for their realistic portrayal of working-class men and intimate male nudes. The show aims to re-integrate Caillebotte into the Impressionist narrative, allowing his unique and sometimes provocative artistry to be rediscovered by a modern audience.</p>

Wayans, known for his roles in comedies like "White Chicks" and the "Scary Movie" franchise, discussed how he now draws upon deep personal loss to inform his acting. He explained that the recent passing of his mother and other close relatives allows him to access genuine emotion for his roles, a departure from having to manufacture tears in the past.

Founded by a resident who lost her home, the club organizes weekly gatherings at different family-owned restaurants, providing them with a vital economic boost. The events have also created a support network for those who have experienced profound loss, allowing strangers united by tragedy to build connections and share their experiences over a meal. This grassroots effort serves as both a tool for economic recovery and a source of communal healing.</p>

          <p>This article outlines a balanced investment strategy for the emerging quantum computing industry, which could become commercially viable by 2030. It recommends a mix of high-risk, high-reward startups and more established technology companies. The pure-play suggestions are IonQ, which uses an accurate trapped-ion approach, and D-Wave Quantum, which specializes in quantum annealing for optimization problems. For safer exposure, the article suggests Alphabet, a leader in quantum chip development, and Nvidia, which is creating technology to integrate quantum and traditional computing systems, positioning itself as a key enabler for the entire sector.

          <p>Automaker Kia has significantly improved its reputation for reliability, now ranking within the top 10 brands for new car dependability according to Consumer Reports. This marks a significant turnaround from decades ago when the brand was known for budget vehicles with questionable longevity. Other industry sources, such as J.D. Power and RepairPal, corroborate this positive trend. J.D. Power awarded high reliability scores to several 2025 models, including the new K4 sedan, while RepairPal ranks Kia 3rd out of 32 brands and notes its average repair costs are well below the industry average, indicating strong long-term value for consumers.</p>

          <p>Historians Jill Lepore and Jeffrey Rosen emphasize that the U.S. Constitution was intentionally designed as a work in progress, with Article V providing a mechanism for amendments by the people. The document's framers expected it to be revised, as evidenced by the more than 200 amendments proposed by states, which led to the Bill of Rights. The article notes that significant constitutional change has stalled for over 50 years, and modern interpretations often come from the Supreme Court rather than the amendment process. Rosen argues that despite its age, the Constitution's principles of limited government remain timeless and essential to preventing tyranny.</p>

          <p>Amazon has introduced "Hear the Highlights," a feature using an AI-generated voice to provide audio summaries of product information and customer reviews. This tool aims to simplify the shopping experience by distilling thousands of comments, which could be particularly beneficial for visually impaired users. However, critics raise concerns that AI summaries may strip away the nuance, context, and personal stories found in human reviews, potentially overlooking niche needs or critical safety warnings. There is also concern that by blending marketing descriptions with user feedback without clear attribution, the AI could unintentionally mislead consumers by presenting promotional content as unbiased information.</p>

          <p>In an unconventional training move, Europe's Ryder Cup captain Luke Donald has equipped his players with virtual reality headsets to prepare them for the anticipated hostile crowds at Bethpage in New York. Rory McIlroy revealed that the technology simulates the sights, sounds, and even abusive comments from fans to desensitize the team before the event. This innovative approach reflects the team's detailed preparation as they aim to win on American soil for the first time since 2012. McIlroy noted that while nothing can fully replicate the real experience, it is part of a comprehensive effort to be as ready as possible.</p>

          <p>A panel of sports journalists provides their predictions and analyses for the 2025 WNBA postseason. Topics include whether the playoffs are better off without the much-discussed rivalry between Angel Reese and Caitlin Clark, and which non-playoff teams will be missed the most. The experts identify high-seeded teams at risk of an early exit, such as the Phoenix Mercury, and long shots like the expansion Golden State Valkyries. Napheesa Collier and A'ja Wilson are highlighted as the most important players, with the Minnesota Lynx emerging as a slight favorite to win the championship in what many expect to be a revenge tour.</p>

          <p>This article explores the rise of New York assembly member Zohran Mamdani, whose people-powered campaign has made him a mayoral frontrunner, and considers what lessons the UK's struggling Labour party might learn. Mamdani's success is attributed to a sharp focus on economic issues like affordability, coupled with clear, compelling policies such as free bus transport and a rent freeze. His campaign has also crafted a strong narrative that identifies adversaries and clearly states whose side he is on. Furthermore, his savvy use of social media, particularly TikTok, has allowed him to connect with a broad audience in a way that many traditional politicians have not.</p>

          <p>A 12-year-old Ukrainian girl, Kira Skliarova, successfully received a heart transplant at the Kyiv Heart Institute during one of the most intense Russian missile attacks on the city. The donor heart came from a 4-year-old who died in an accident. The surgical team, led by Dr. Borys Todurov, risked their lives, driving through the bombarded city to retrieve the organ and performing the delicate surgery as explosions shook the hospital. The girl, whose own heart was severely weakened by illness, is now recovering. The story highlights the resilience of Ukrainian medical professionals and the profound human connections forged amidst the devastation of war.</p>
