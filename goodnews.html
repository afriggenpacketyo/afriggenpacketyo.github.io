        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>JPMorgan Chase reported second-quarter results that surpassed analyst expectations, largely due to robust performance in its fixed income trading and investment banking divisions. The bank's earnings were $5.24 a share on $45.68 billion in revenue, beating estimates despite a 17% drop in net income compared to the previous year, which was inflated by a gain on Visa shares. CEO Jamie Dimon highlighted the U.S. economy's resilience but also reiterated warnings about risks from trade policy, geopolitical conflicts, and high fiscal deficits. The report indicates the bank successfully navigated market turbulence during the quarter. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>The founder of Chinese robotics firm Unitree Robotics, Wang Xingxing, has called for greater collaboration between the U.S. and China to advance the development of humanoid robots. Speaking at a government press conference, Wang emphasized that China's strength in manufacturing and hardware complements the rich AI software ecosystem in the United States. He argued that despite the technological competition between the two nations, working together would benefit the global promotion of the burgeoning robotics field. This call for partnership comes as the private sector's role in Chinese innovation continues to grow.</p>

          <p>Nvidia CEO Jensen Huang announced that the Trump administration has approved the company's request to sell its advanced H20 computer chips to China. This decision reverses a previous policy that had restricted such sales due to national security concerns. The approval is seen as a significant boost for Nvidia, allowing it to compete with rivals like Huawei in the large and innovative Chinese market. Analysts believe this move will help ease trade frictions and benefit the global semiconductor supply chain, though some Chinese firms remain cautious about the long-term stability of U.S. policy.</p>

          <p>The UK government is introducing a new grant scheme to lower the cost of new electric vehicles (EVs) by up to £3,750. The discounts, funded by a £650 million program, will apply to eligible cars costing up to £37,000, aiming to encourage drivers to switch from petrol and diesel. While the government and some industry figures welcome the move, critics argue it forces families into expensive vehicles before the country's charging infrastructure is adequate. Many potential buyers and experts highlight the need for more public charging points to truly spur widespread EV adoption.</p>

          <p>In a personal essay, a writer reflects on their experience growing up in the Southern Baptist tradition and later leaving a conservative Anglican church. The departure was driven by the realization that they could not reconcile their identity as a lesbian with the church's exclusionary theology regarding same-sex relationships. The author describes the agonizing choice between their community and their personal integrity, ultimately finding a deeper faith after leaving. The essay argues that for many LGBTQ Christians, affirming their identity is a sincere religious conviction, not a capitulation to secular culture.</p>

          <p>A pastor and divinity school professor argues that despite a recent IRS rule change allowing political endorsements, houses of worship should refrain from this practice. While acknowledging the historical necessity for churches, particularly in the Black church tradition, to address political issues of justice, the author distinguishes this from endorsing specific candidates. Endorsing candidates is seen as potentially destructive, risking the creation of deeper political divisions within congregations and reducing the church's role to a political tool. The piece advocates for maintaining the church's focus on moral guidance over partisan politics.</p>
