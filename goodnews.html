          <p>A suspected clerical error on the Deliveroo app led to some Co-op products being priced with up to a 100% discount, allowing some customers to acquire items like pasta sauce, coffee, and cookies for free. The Co-op spokesperson said that the error was quickly resolved, and they apologized for any inconvenience caused. Some shoppers, who learned of the glitch through social media, quickly placed orders before the prices were corrected. One customer in Lancashire secured over ¬£80 worth of goods for just ¬£3.29 and plans to donate most of the items to a local food bank. There is no suggestion that this was linked to the cyber attack that affected the Co-op's IT systems recently.</p>

          <p>Prime Minister Shigeru Ishiba stated that Japan will prioritize its national interests during ongoing tariff negotiations with the United States. While acknowledging the talks as positive, Ishiba emphasized the need for both nations to exert maximum effort to bridge existing gaps. Top negotiator Ryosei Akazawa called for a review of President Trump's tariff policy during meetings with U.S. officials. The United States has been hesitant to exempt Japan from higher tariffs on key imports like cars, iron, steel, and aluminum, and further negotiations are scheduled for mid-May. Finance Minister Katsunobu Kato suggested Japan could leverage its U.S. Treasury holdings as a negotiating tool.</p>

          <p>The relationship between Bill Belichick and Jordon Hudson has drawn intense scrutiny due to their significant age gap. Relationship expert Jackie Dorman suggests the public's fascination stems from the contrast with Belichick's previous relationships, including his marriage to his childhood sweetheart and a 16-year partnership with someone closer in age. Dorman notes that people are questioning whether Belichick's legacy is being tarnished by this relationship, with some speculating about transactional motives. She highlights the statistical improbability of success for relationships with such a large age difference, while emphasizing the importance of shared life goals and compatibility. Former Patriots star Julian Edelman suggested that Hudson was acting more like a publicist than a girlfriend.</p>

          <p>Marco Rubio, the former senator from Florida, has taken on an unprecedented four government positions, including Secretary of State, acting administrator of U.S.A.I.D., acting archivist for the National Archives, and interim national security advisor. This accumulation of titles raises questions about his capacity to effectively manage these roles, especially under President Trump's unconventional approach to governance. Trump announced Rubio's newest position on social media, surprising even State Department officials. Analysts have raised concerns about potential conflicts of interest, particularly regarding the archivist's role in overseeing record preservation for agencies Rubio also leads. It remains unclear whether Rubio will receive additional compensation or how he will balance his responsibilities.</p>

Miller's book "Slaves to Fashion: Black Dandyism and the Styling of Black Diasporic Identity." The event will be co-chaired by actor Colman Domingo, Formula 1 racer Lewis Hamilton, rapper A$AP Rocky, and singer Pharrell Williams. The theme seeks to challenge social and cultural hierarchies through fashion, examining issues of identity, representation, and power. The article also reflects on past Met Gala moments, such as Rihanna's papal-inspired ensemble and Doja Cat's feline transformation, highlighting the event's history of pushing fashion boundaries.</p>

          <p>Secure 2.0 introduces a higher 401(k) catch-up contribution limit for workers aged 60 to 63, increasing it to $11,250 in 2025. This allows eligible investors to defer up to $34,750 into their 401(k). While most retirement plans have adopted this feature, a small percentage have not, potentially limiting catch-up contributions for some workers. Experts like Dan Galli see this as a valuable tool, especially for higher earners seeking a tax deduction. However, only a small fraction of employees actually maximize their 401(k) contributions, indicating that affordability remains a significant barrier for many.</p>

          <p>As debates surrounding President Trump's policy agenda intensify, potential changes to the state and local tax (SALT) deduction are being discussed. The $10,000 limit on the federal deduction, enacted in 2017, is set to expire after 2025 without congressional action. Raising the SALT cap has been a priority for lawmakers from high-tax states, and Trump has expressed support for reform. Lawmakers are considering various updates, but a complete repeal is unlikely due to budget constraints. A higher SALT deduction limit could impact higher earners in high-tax states.</p>

          <p>Zhao Xintong delivered a dominant performance against Ronnie O'Sullivan in their World Snooker Championship semi-final, establishing a significant lead. Zhao took all eight frames in the Friday morning session, becoming only the fourth player to win a session 8-0 against O'Sullivan at the Crucible. O'Sullivan, who has been struggling with his cue, made changes after the opening session, but Zhao capitalized on his mistakes. Zhao compiled breaks of 112 and 115, positioning himself to potentially become the first Chinese player to win the title in Sheffield.</p>

          <p>A chimney has been installed on the Sistine Chapel as the Vatican prepares for the conclave to select the new pope. The voting process is scheduled to take place on May 7, and the chimney will be used to signal the election outcome to the public. Black smoke will indicate that no pope has been elected, while white smoke will signify the selection of the 267th pope. The Catholic Church faces financial challenges that the new pope will need to address.</p>
