          <p>JetBlue and United Airlines announced a new partnership that will allow frequent fliers to earn and use points on both airlines and swap terminal slots at New York area airports. United will gain seven takeoff and landing slots at JFK Airport in New York starting in 2027, marking United's return to JFK since 2022. In exchange, JetBlue will get eight takeoff and landing slots at Newark Liberty International Airport in New Jersey. The deal is subject to regulatory review, and airlines will remain independent.</p>
