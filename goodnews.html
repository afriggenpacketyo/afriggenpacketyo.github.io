          <h2>UK Government Borrowing Exceeds Expectations in April</h2>
          <div class="timestamp">2025-05-22 02:28:37 EDT</div>
        </div>
        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Official figures indicate that the UK government's borrowing was higher than expected in April, reaching ¬£20.2 billion, a ¬£1 billion increase from the previous year. This figure surpasses analysts' predictions of ¬£17.9 billion. The Office for National Statistics reported that this is the fourth-highest April borrowing figure since monthly records began in 1993. The difference between government spending and tax income is the key factor contributing to this increased borrowing. (not investment advice)</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Bitcoin's rally continued, reaching a new record high above $111,000 before slightly decreasing. The price surge is attributed to positive momentum, growing optimism regarding U.S. crypto regulation, and sustained interest from institutional buyers. According to CoinShares, broader macro concerns, including Moody's downgrade of U.S. sovereign debt, contributed to Bitcoin's appeal as a hedge against fiat instability. This price increase occurred despite a drop in U.S. stock markets, indicating investors are seeking alternative stores of value. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>Japanese Finance Minister Katsunobu Kato and U.S. Treasury Secretary Scott Bessent agreed that the current dollar-yen exchange rate reflects economic fundamentals during discussions on bilateral tariff negotiations. This acknowledgement suggests the yen's weakness against the dollar should no longer be a point of contention in trade talks. Kato expressed concerns about the impact of U.S. tariffs on the global economy, emphasizing that tariffs are an inappropriate tool for addressing trade imbalances. The two countries are aiming to strike a mutually beneficial trade deal as early as June.</p>

          <p>Shares of Chinese electric-vehicle maker Xpeng are expected to continue their rally, with analysts predicting profitability by the fourth quarter of 2025. Xpeng's Hong Kong shares increased significantly following positive earnings reports and a strong revenue forecast for the second quarter. First-quarter revenue more than doubled due to robust sales, narrowing the net loss and improving the gross margin. Analysts attribute this positive outlook to Xpeng's strong sales momentum and upcoming new models. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>This New York Times opinion piece discusses the claims of oppression made by white Afrikaners in South Africa, particularly in the context of Tucker Carlson's show and President Trump's policies. The author argues that these claims are largely unfounded and serve to rewrite South Africa's history, casting former oppressors as victims. The piece also touches on the influence of MAGA culture in South Africa and the complexities of the country's transition from apartheid to democracy. The author concludes that while South Africa faces challenges, the forgiveness extended to the white minority is a remarkable moment in history.</p>

The Guardian notes the government's climbdown will help head off a backbench rebellion.

          <p>The Japanese government has initiated a revamped gasoline subsidy aimed at reducing prices by 10 yen per liter to ease cost-of-living pressures ahead of a parliamentary election. The subsidy will provide a fixed sum regardless of prices, which have recently dropped below the previous benchmark. The government aims to reduce the wholesale gasoline price gradually, with price reductions expected to reach gas stations in a few weeks. The program has allocated around 1 trillion yen and could last until March 2026.</p>
