          <p>In a rare move, the U.S. government has taken a roughly 10% equity stake in chipmaker Intel, becoming its largest single shareholder. This action, converting grants from the CHIPS and Science Act into equity, is motivated by strategic competition with China and the race for artificial intelligence dominance. The goal is to revitalize cutting-edge microchip manufacturing on U.S. soil to reduce reliance on foreign suppliers like Taiwan's TSMC and mitigate geopolitical risks, such as a potential conflict over Taiwan. While the move aims to secure national and economic security, experts note it also carries risks associated with government intervention in a private company.</p>

          <p>Japan's Prince Hisahito, nephew of Emperor Naruhito, has officially reached adulthood in a formal coming-of-age ceremony, becoming the first male royal to do so in 40 years. As the second in line to the Chrysanthemum Throne, his status is crucial for the continuation of the world's oldest monarchy. The event has once again brought Japan's male-only succession law into sharp focus. With a shrinking number of male heirs, the country continues to debate whether the rules should be changed to allow a female, such as the Emperor's daughter Princess Aiko, to ascend the throne.</p>

          <p>The influential Bauhaus art and design school is celebrating the 100th anniversary of its move to Dessau, Germany, with a series of exhibitions and events. However, the centennial is shadowed by political attacks from Germany's far-right Alternative for Germany (AfD) party, which has condemned the movement's legacy, echoing the rhetoric used by the Nazis who shut the school down in 1933. The Bauhaus Dessau Foundation's director expressed fear for the institution's future if the AfD gains more power, but also noted that the attacks have generated a significant wave of public support for the celebrated modernist institution.</p>

          <p>In a personal essay, the author recounts her journey from being a sports-agnostic individual to a devoted fan of the Buffalo Bills. This transformation was initiated by her Buffalonian boyfriend and his family, who introduced her to the team's culture. The article explores how the Bills' underdog spirit and resilience mirror the character of the city of Buffalo itself. Ultimately, it reflects on how sports fandom can create a powerful sense of belonging, community, and home, even for someone who previously felt no connection to the world of athletics.</p>

          <p>The board of directors at Tesla has proposed a new, highly ambitious compensation package for CEO Elon Musk that could potentially make him the world's first trillionaire. The plan would grant him 12% of the company's stock over the next decade, contingent on Tesla achieving aggressive growth targets, including a market capitalization of at least $8.5 trillion by 2035. This move, which requires shareholder approval, is seen as a powerful incentive to ensure Musk remains focused on leading Tesla's expansion into AI and robotics, despite his involvement in other major ventures.</p>

Beyond the famous save, the piece reflects on Higuita's pioneering role as a 'sweeper-keeper' and his complex legacy as a national icon who was also embroiled in controversy, including a prison sentence for his involvement in a cartel kidnapping.</p>
