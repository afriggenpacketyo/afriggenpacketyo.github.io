          <p>In response to Russian air incursions, several European Union member states will hold initial talks about creating a unified anti-drone defense system. The discussions, which will include Ukraine, were prompted by recent drone incidents over countries like Denmark and Poland. European Commission President Ursula von der Leyen has advocated for this "drone wall" to bolster the bloc's security against aerial threats. The initiative aims to leverage Ukraine's expertise in detecting and neutralizing drone swarms, enhancing collective defense capabilities along the EU's eastern border.</p>

          <p>London-based fintech company Checkout.com has initiated a share buyback program for its employees, establishing a new internal valuation of $12 billion. This figure represents a significant decrease from its $40 billion valuation during a 2022 funding round, reflecting broader trends in the tech sector where companies are staying private longer. The payments platform, a competitor to Stripe and PayPal, is offering the buyback to provide liquidity for its staff. Despite the valuation drop, the company reports it is on track to exceed 30% core net revenue growth this year. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>High-level officials from the United States and China met in New York, agreeing to enhance communication to manage ongoing diplomatic tensions. During the talks, Chinese Vice-Foreign Minister Ma Zhaoxu reiterated Beijing's stance on Taiwan as an internal affair, while U.S. Deputy Secretary of State Christopher Landau pressed for action on the fentanyl crisis and the repatriation of undocumented Chinese nationals. Both sides described the conversation as "candid" and "constructive," signaling a mutual desire to stabilize the relationship.

          <p>The Ryder Cup begins this week at Bethpage Black, with Team USA favored to reclaim the trophy from Europe on home soil. Experts suggest the outcome will hinge on several key factors, including the ability to make a fast start in the opening foursomes, where home teams have historically dominated. Managing the famously boisterous New York crowd will be crucial for the European team, which aims to win an away match for the first time since 2012. The experience of European veterans like Rory McIlroy and Justin Rose will be tested against the top-ranked American player, Scottie Scheffler.</p>

          <p>During a farewell meeting with departing Chinese ambassador Huang Xilian, Philippine President Ferdinand Marcos Jr. stated that maritime disputes in the South China Sea should not define the entire relationship between the two nations. Both sides agreed on the need to manage differences while encouraging deeper trade, cultural, and people-to-people exchanges. This sentiment echoes language from a 2023 joint statement, suggesting a mutual effort to de-escalate tensions and prevent territorial conflicts from derailing broader bilateral cooperation. The ambassador expressed hope that relations could be put "back on track at an early date."</p>

          <p>England rugby sensation Ellie Kildunne, recently named world player of the year, has had a remarkable journey to the top of her sport. The article details her early days playing on boys' teams and having to invent a club name to attend a county trial after options for girls' rugby became scarce. Kildunne, who was also a talented footballer, showcases an unapologetic ambition and creative energy, which she partly attributes to a recent ADHD diagnosis that she calls her "superpower." Her on-field talent and off-field charisma have made her a fan favorite as she leads England in the Women's Rugby World Cup.</p>

          <p>After being a prime takeover target earlier in the year, British energy giant BP has seen its fortunes improve, dampening acquisition rumors. The company's shares have climbed over 32% since April, outperforming many rivals, due to a strategic reset, strong quarterly profits of $2.35 billion, and a series of successful oil discoveries. This turnaround has quieted talk of potential buyouts from competitors like Shell or Exxon Mobil. CEO Murray Auchincloss has emphasized that the company is focused on its own growth strategy to drive shareholder value, moving it out of the takeover spotlight. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>On his BBC podcast, former Manchester United and England striker Wayne Rooney shared several amusing and strange anecdotes from his experiences playing in away dressing rooms. He recounted how Chelsea's was always too hot, Liverpool's was freezing, and Sunderland's was once flooded by leaking toilets from the floor above. Rooney also recalled how pre-match hotel stays were often disrupted, including one instance where a New Year's Day firework display was set off on the hotel roof directly above the team's rooms at midnight. These stories offer a behind-the-scenes glimpse into the less glamorous side of professional football.</p>

          <p>Chinese toy company Pop Mart has stated it is pleased to see the secondary market prices for its popular Labubu monster toys decrease after a period of extreme hype. At their peak, some editions were resold for over 2,000% above retail, but prices are now falling as the company has increased production tenfold to meet demand and deter scalpers. Pop Mart says its goal is to make its art accessible to genuine fans rather than fueling a speculative market that alienates real customers. The company is now focusing on sustainable growth and expanding its intellectual property through international collaborations and animation projects. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>The Seattle Seahawks defeated the Arizona Cardinals 23-20 in a dramatic Thursday night game, thanks to a 52-yard field goal by Jason Myers as time expired. Seattle had built a 14-point lead in the fourth quarter, but a late rally by Cardinals quarterback Kyler Murray, including a game-tying touchdown pass with 33 seconds left, set up a tense finish. A penalty on the subsequent kickoff gave the Seahawks good field position, allowing quarterback Sam Darnold to connect on a key pass to move into range for the winning kick. The victory marks Seattle's eighth consecutive win over their NFC West rival.</p>

In a recent interview, he affirmed that Ukraine would hold elections even during a temporary ceasefire, should one be agreed upon with Moscow. Zelenskyy, whose original five-year term would have ended in May 2024, has been leading under martial law, which prohibits elections. His remarks indicate a focus on national victory over personal political ambition, envisioning a return to democratic processes as soon as the conflict allows.</p>

          <p>Raj Ganguly, co-founder of venture capital firm B Capital, believes the world is in the very early stages of an artificial intelligence "super cycle" that could last for two decades. He argues that AI will fundamentally change every industry, from drug development to the job market, in a profound and global way. While acknowledging that parts of the market are currently "frothy" and overvalued due to short-term hype, he sees the next decade as being defined by deep tech like generative AI. Ganguly also identified India as a key market for building AI-native applications that could become global leaders.</p>

          <p>China is preparing to open the world's highest bridge to traffic in the mountainous southwestern province of Guizhou. The new bridge spans the Huajiang Grand Canyon and rises 625 meters (2,050 feet) from the river below to its deck, a height comparable to China's tallest skyscraper. With a total length of 2,890 meters, it is also set to become the world's longest mountain bridge. This engineering feat adds to Guizhou's reputation as a hub for record-breaking infrastructure, as the province is already home to nearly half of the world's 100 tallest bridges.</p>
