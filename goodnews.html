          <p>Nvidia CEO Jensen Huang is scheduled to meet with President Donald Trump at the White House, a significant event coinciding with Nvidia becoming the first company to close with a market capitalization over $4 trillion. The meeting's agenda is not public, but it occurs as Nvidia navigates U.S. export controls on its advanced AI chips, particularly impacting sales to the Chinese market. The Trump administration recently implemented rules requiring export licenses for certain processors, a move Nvidia has stated effectively closes off the $50 billion China market to its products. This high-level discussion underscores the intersection of technology, national security, and international trade policy.</p>

          <p>Levi Strauss has increased its full-year sales and earnings guidance after reporting second-quarter results that surpassed Wall Street expectations. The denim company now projects annual revenue growth of 1% to 2%, a significant improvement from its previous forecast, citing strong consumer demand and successful new product pricing. However, the company is navigating the economic uncertainty of new U.S. tariffs, which it anticipates will cost $25 million to $30 million for the remainder of the year. While Levi's is currently absorbing some of these costs, executives acknowledge that future trade policy developments could force a change in strategy. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>Thousands of fans, including many from overseas, traveled to Thailand's Khao Kheow Open Zoo to celebrate the first birthday of Moo Deng, a baby pygmy hippo who has become a global social media sensation. The zoo organized a four-day event, with fans singing "Happy Birthday" as the hippo enjoyed a large cake made of fruits and vegetables. Moo Deng's fame has significantly boosted zoo attendance and raised awareness for the conservation of her endangered species. Zoo officials hope her popularity will translate into broader support for wildlife protection, noting there are only a few thousand pygmy hippos left in the wild.</p>

          <p>The U.S. Department of Defense is set to become the largest shareholder in MP Materials, the owner of the only operational rare earth mine in the U.S., through a $400 million investment in preferred stock. This public-private partnership aims to bolster the domestic supply chain for rare earth magnets, which are critical components in advanced military systems like F-35 jets and drones. The move is a direct response to U.S. dependence on China for these materials and will fund the expansion of MP Materials' processing and magnet production capabilities. The company's shares surged approximately 50% following the announcement. (not investment advice)</p>

This upward momentum was part of a broader trend, with other cryptocurrencies like Ether and Solana also seeing gains. The sustained price level above $100,000 has been supported by substantial inflows into bitcoin ETFs and large purchases by public companies. (not investment advice)</p>

The carrier now expects full-year adjusted earnings between $5.25 and $6.25 per share.

Financial experts suggest homeowners can use this time strategically by checking their credit reports, working to improve their credit scores, and shopping around for lenders with the most competitive offers.
