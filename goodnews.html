Trump's appearance, intended to boost fundraising for the Kennedy Center, was met with a mix of cheers and boos, with drag queens present in the audience in response to his criticism of the venue for hosting drag shows. The event was marked by cultural ignorance from some of Trump's allies, and the atmosphere was described as different from the Kennedy Center's traditional Democratic events. Trump stated he loved Les Mis√©rables and that he was untroubled by reports of understudies performing due to boycotts by cast members.</p>

          <p>With U.S. restrictions hindering China's access to advanced semiconductors for AI development, Beijing is focusing on domestic alternatives like Huawei. U.S. curbs impact the entire semiconductor value chain, from design to manufacturing equipment, prompting China to invest billions in filling these gaps. Huawei's Ascend 910B GPU is progressing, closing the performance gap with Nvidia's export-restricted chips, but China still faces challenges in AI chip fabrication and equipment. While SMIC is producing 7-nanometer chips, it lags behind TSMC, and restrictions on ASML's advanced chipmaking equipment hinder mass production of advanced GPUs.</p>

          <p>Chinese court astronomers recorded details of a dying star's explosion in 1408, during the Ming dynasty. The astronomers spotted a mysterious new star glowing in the southern sky, near the heart of the Milky Way, describing it as "about the size of a cup-shaped oil lamp, with a pure yellow colour, smooth and bright." The rediscovered memorial confirms that the phenomenon was a nova, a slow, temporary brightening caused by a dying star, rather than a comet or meteor. The unprecedented details, including the star‚Äôs size and brightness, helped narrow down the star‚Äôs possible position.</p>

          <p>US President Donald Trump has announced that a deal with China is "done," stating that China has agreed to supply US companies with magnets and rare earth minerals, while the US will walk back threats to revoke visas for Chinese students. The agreement follows two days of intense talks in London aimed at resolving conflicts that emerged after a truce was reached in May. Details about the new agreement are limited, but it is intended to address US concerns about China's rare earth exports and Chinese criticisms of US restrictions on semiconductors. The deal is subject to final approval from President Xi and Trump.</p>
