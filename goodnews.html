          <p>Oracle's stock experienced a significant surge of 40% after the company revealed impressive cloud demand figures, positioning it for its best day since 1992 and nearing a $1 trillion market cap. The company's remaining performance obligations (RPO) have increased by 359% year-over-year, reaching $455 billion, which analysts have described as astounding and historic. Oracle has benefited significantly from the artificial intelligence boom due to its cloud infrastructure and access to Nvidia's GPUs, enabling it to compete with other major cloud providers like Microsoft, Amazon, and Google. Despite missing expectations on top and bottom lines in its fiscal first-quarter report, analysts remain optimistic, with some upgrading the stock and raising price targets, highlighting Oracle's role as a key AI enabler.

          <p>Payments for Facebook's $725 million privacy settlement have begun, with approved claimants receiving emails from the settlement administrator. The settlement addresses lawsuits alleging Facebook improperly shared user data with third parties, including Cambridge Analytica, though Meta denies any wrongdoing. Payment amounts vary based on Facebook usage duration between May 2007 and December 2022, with distribution expected over the next 10 weeks. Claimants will receive an email notification approximately 3-4 days before their payment is issued, with the payments representing a portion of the settlement fund after administrative costs and lawyers' fees.</p>

          <p>Embraer has secured its first U.S. sale of E2 jets with a 50-plane order from Avelo Airlines, a startup carrier focusing on smaller cities. Avelo, which began flying in 2021 with used Boeing 737s, is modernizing its fleet with the more fuel-efficient E195-E2 planes, betting on their customer appeal with a two-by-two seating configuration and quieter cabins. The order, valued at $4.4 billion at list prices, will support Avelo's growth strategy, while Embraer, known for its regional jets, sees this as a significant win amidst competition from Airbus. The E195-E2 can seat up to 132 passengers and is expected to enhance Avelo's service network.</p>

          <p>ATM fees in the U.S. have reached a record high, with Americans now paying an average of $4.86 for out-of-network withdrawals, according to a Bankrate.com survey. The increase is attributed to banks freely charging fees without regulatory limits and making up for lost revenue as consumers shift towards digital payments. Atlanta, Phoenix, and San Diego have the highest ATM costs, while Boston and Seattle have the lowest, and financial analysts recommend strategies like getting cash back at stores or using in-network ATMs to avoid the rising charges. The survey underscores the increasing cost of accessing cash and the importance of strategic banking practices.</p>

He is preparing to defend his titles against Terence Crawford, a fight considered a clash of styles and power between Mexico and the United States. Álvarez credits his success to discipline, sacrifice, and the support of his family and trainers, particularly Chepo and Eddy Reynoso. Despite facing challenges and setbacks, including a suspension and a loss to Dmitry Bivol, Álvarez remains focused on continuing his legacy and making his family proud.</p>

          <p>Weleda, a natural cosmetics company, has launched an inquiry into its historical links to a Nazi concentration camp following allegations that an anti-freeze cream it produced was tested on prisoners. A report claims Weleda ordered raw materials from Dachau and that an SS doctor used the cream in human experiments, though a previous report found no evidence of the latter. The company, known for its Skin Food range, condemns the Nazi regime's atrocities and commits to transparently researching its history, with results expected in early 2027. Weleda has provided historians with full access to its archives to investigate the claims and ensure a complete reappraisal of its past.</p>

While they welcome his presence, organizers believe a later arrival would ease logistical challenges with the larger Ryder Cup attendance and fixed starting times. The PGA of America aims to deliver a seamless and secure event, and European captain Luke Donald acknowledges the need to prepare for the disruptions caused by Trump's appearance. Trump's continued involvement in golf is further emphasized by the announcement that his Doonbeg resort will host the Irish Open in 2026.</p>

          <p>A judge has blocked President Donald Trump from firing Federal Reserve Governor Lisa Cook while a lawsuit challenging her removal continues, citing the public interest in Federal Reserve independence. The judge stated that legal cause for removing a Fed governor is limited to actions related to their behavior in office, and not for conduct that occurred before they began in office. The ruling means Cook will participate in the Fed's next meeting, and her attorney emphasized the importance of safeguarding the Federal Reserve's independence from illegal political interference. The White House maintains that Trump lawfully removed Cook due to credible allegations of mortgage fraud, but the legal battle is expected to continue.</p>

Nearly 90% of Medicare beneficiaries supplement their coverage to address these gaps, with options including Medicare Advantage (Part C) and Medicare Supplement (Medigap) plans. Medicare Advantage plans combine Part A and Part B coverage, often including additional benefits, while Medicare Supplement plans cover out-of-pocket costs like copayments and deductibles.

While non-biological processes could be responsible for the findings, lead researcher Joel Hurowitz calls it the best candidate yet in the search for potential signs of long-ago life.
