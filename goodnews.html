          <p>President Trump announced that Coca-Cola has agreed to switch from high-fructose corn syrup to cane sugar for its beverages sold in the United States. While the company has not explicitly confirmed the change, it acknowledged the president's enthusiasm and hinted at new product innovations. The move is praised by health advocates like Health Secretary Robert F. Kennedy Jr., but faces criticism from the Corn Refiners Association, which warns of potential job losses and depressed farm income. This change would align U.S. Coke products with those sold in many other countries.</p>

The new Base App combines a wallet, trading, payments, and social media functions on the company's Base blockchain. This move aims to replicate the success of "super apps" like China's WeChat by creating a single platform for various daily activities, powered by USDC stablecoin payments. The strategy is intended to diversify Coinbase's revenue and drive crypto utility for a broader consumer audience, including content creators. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>A powerful 7.3-magnitude earthquake off the coast of Alaska prompted a tsunami advisory for a sparsely populated 700-mile stretch of its southern coastline. The U.S. Tsunami Center initially issued a warning but later downgraded it to an advisory, with the first waves expected to hit the village of Sand Point. Officials in communities like Unalaska and King Cove urged residents in coastal areas to move to higher ground as a precaution. As of an hour after the quake, no significant damage had been reported, and authorities confirmed there was no tsunami threat to Hawaii or the U.S. Pacific Northwest.</p>

          <p>Country music star Darius Rucker had to unexpectedly end his concert at the Hard Rock Hotel & Casino in Atlantic City mid-performance after his voice gave out. The Hootie & the Blowfish frontman apologized to the audience, explaining he had never experienced this before and was physically unable to sing. He promised attendees a full refund and performed one final song, "Wagon Wheel," with the crowd singing along before he left the stage. Rucker later confirmed that all tickets would be refunded and, after vocal rest, he has been cleared to resume his tour schedule.</p>

          <p>Former President Barack Obama and former first lady Michelle Obama have jointly addressed and humorously dismissed the divorce rumors that have circulated over the past year. Speaking on the "IMO" podcast, which Michelle co-hosts with her brother, the couple joked about the speculation. Michelle Obama explained that public perceptions of trouble arise when they are not seen together, but she reaffirmed the strength of their marriage. She had previously stated that she is now in a stage of life where she feels free to make her own decisions about which public events to attend.</p>

          <p>Continuing the advocacy work of his late mother, Princess Diana, Prince Harry walked through a minefield in Angola with the HALO Trust. The visit echoed Diana's historic walk in 1997, which helped galvanize support for an international land mine ban treaty. Harry visited a de-mining site near a village in Cuito Cuanavale, an area he had previously visited in 2013 when it was still an active minefield. He emphasized that the remnants of Angola's 27-year civil war continue to threaten lives daily, highlighting the ongoing need for de-mining efforts in the country.</p>

          <p>Germany is set to pass new legislation by the end of the year to crack down on gangs smuggling migrants across the English Channel to the United Kingdom. The change will make it illegal in Germany to facilitate illegal migration to a non-EU country like the UK, which is not currently a crime. This move, announced during the German chancellor's visit to the UK, is expected to help authorities disrupt smugglers' supply lines by targeting warehouses used to store small boats. The agreement comes as the UK government faces pressure to address the rising number of Channel crossings.</p>

          <p>For the first time, astronomers have observed the birth of a new solar system, capturing the moment planets began to form around a baby star named HOPS-315, located 1,300 light-years away. Using NASA's Webb Telescope and the ESO's Alma telescope network, scientists identified the formation of silicate minerals, the building blocks of planets, in the disc of gas and dust surrounding the protostar. This discovery provides a glimpse into a process similar to how our own solar system formed billions of years ago. Researchers say this provides a crucial new understanding of planetary development.</p>

          <p>United Airlines reported second-quarter earnings that exceeded Wall Street expectations and issued a strong full-year forecast for 2025, signaling growing confidence in the travel market. CEO Scott Kirby stated that the world feels "less uncertain" than it did at the start of the year, when weaker demand from price-sensitive domestic travelers had lowered airfares. While quarterly revenue was slightly below estimates, the airline's premium cabin sales remained strong. The company now expects to post adjusted earnings between $9 and $11 per share for the full year. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>Doctors in the UK have successfully used a pioneering technique involving DNA from three people to allow the birth of eight healthy babies, free from devastating hereditary conditions. The method, known as mitochondrial donation, combines the nuclear DNA from the parents with healthy mitochondria from a female donor's egg. This prevents the transmission of incurable mitochondrial diseases, which are passed from mother to child and can cause fatal organ and brain damage. While the technique is a permanent genetic change passed down through generations, it offers hope to families plagued by these tragic disorders.</p>

          <p>President Donald Trump has acknowledged that Beijing is making significant progress in its efforts to control the flow of fentanyl into the United States. This marks a notable shift in tone from February, when he cited the fentanyl crisis as a justification for doubling tariffs on Chinese imports. The positive comments come as high-level trade negotiations between the two countries are ongoing. Trump's administration has long pressed China to crack down on the production and export of the deadly synthetic opioid and its precursors, which have fueled the U.S. overdose crisis.</p>
