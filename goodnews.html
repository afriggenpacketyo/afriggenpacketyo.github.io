          <p>The recently passed U.S. tax and spending package is poised to deliver a substantial budget increase to the U.S. Space Force, potentially raising its funding by 30% to nearly $40 billion by 2026. A significant portion of these funds, around $25 billion, is allocated for the 'Golden Dome' missile defense system, a project aimed at achieving space superiority amid growing military capabilities from China. This investment provides a major boost for defense and space contractors, especially as it contrasts with recent budget cuts at NASA, signaling a strategic pivot from space exploration to defense.

          <div class="timestamp">2025-07-04 02:43:14 EDT</div>
        </div>
        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Despite a recent critique from Chinese state media calling for tighter regulations on "blind box" toys, analysts believe toy company Pop Mart will remain resilient. The concern, which briefly caused the company's stock to drop, is that the business model entices heavy spending, particularly among minors. However, experts argue that Pop Mart's primary demographic consists of young adults with purchasing power, not children, which should insulate it from the most severe regulatory impacts. The company's strong and growing overseas sales, particularly in Southeast Asia and North America, also provide a significant buffer against domestic policy shifts.</p>

          <div class="timestamp">2025-07-04 02:15:47 EDT</div>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Experts from the UK Meteor Network (UKMON) believe that pieces of a small meteor have landed in the west Highlands of Scotland after it was seen streaking across the sky. The event, which produced an orange glow and a loud bang reported by dozens of people, was captured on security cameras. UKMON calculated that the meteor, which originated from the asteroid belt between Mars and Jupiter, likely scattered fragments over a wide area near Ben Nevis. While finding the meteorite pieces will be challenging in the mountainous terrain, the network has urged hillwalkers to be on the lookout.</p>

          <p>After a strong victory against a former champion, British tennis player Emma Raducanu is preparing for a formidable challenge against world number one Aryna Sabalenka in the third round of Wimbledon. Raducanu acknowledges the significant gap between her current level and the sport's top players, stating she needs to improve her serve and add more weapons to her game. Despite progress this season, she has struggled against elite opponents like Iga Swiatek and Coco Gauff.

          <p>The Australian hearing-implant company Cochlear has introduced its new smart hearing implant system in China, making it one of the first markets globally to receive the technology. The launch is being facilitated through Hainan province and Hong Kong. This advanced cochlear implant system is designed for individuals with severe to profound hearing loss for whom traditional hearing aids are no longer effective. Unlike hearing aids, the device bypasses damaged inner ear cells and directly stimulates the auditory nerve, offering a more effective solution for significant hearing impairment.</p>

          <p>California Governor Gavin Newsom is scheduled for a two-day visit to rural South Carolina, a state that holds an early spot in the Democratic presidential primary calendar, fueling speculation about a potential 2028 run. His tour will cover eight of the state's most economically challenged counties, many of which are Republican strongholds. While Newsom's political advisors deny the trip is about a presidential campaign, stating the focus is on helping Democrats in the 2026 midterms, the visit is seen as a significant political overture. The tour aims to show that Democrats have not forgotten rural voters.</p>

          <p>A team of Chinese scientists has successfully grown a heart structure containing human cells inside a pig embryo, which continued to beat for 21 days. The research, led by the Guangzhou Institutes of Biomedicine and Health, marks a significant advance in the field of chimera research. To achieve this, scientists reprogrammed human stem cells to improve their survival and then implanted them into pig embryos at an early stage of development. This breakthrough follows the same team's previous success in cultivating humanized kidneys in pigs, opening new possibilities for organ generation and transplantation research.</p>

          <p>South Korea's military has taken an individual into custody after they crossed the heavily fortified border from North Korea. The person, an unarmed man, traversed the Military Demarcation Line in the central-west section of the Demilitarized Zone (DMZ) and was safely guided out by a South Korean military team. The Joint Chiefs of Staff confirmed the man is being investigated by relevant authorities, though it was not immediately stated if it was a defection attempt. The crossing occurs amid heightened border tensions, despite recent efforts by South Korea's new president to rebuild trust with the North.</p>
