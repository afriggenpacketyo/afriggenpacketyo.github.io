          <p>The Federal Trade Commission is investigating approximately a dozen advertising groups and watchdogs, examining whether they violated antitrust laws by coordinating boycotts among advertisers. The investigation centers on potential collusion among these groups, which could have impacted advertising practices and market competition. The probe aims to determine if these groups worked together to influence advertising decisions in a manner that stifled competition or otherwise violated antitrust regulations. The investigation is ongoing, and further details are expected as the FTC gathers more information.</p>

The event was observed by fans of the webcam, which also captures the activities of mom Jackie, dad Shadow, and sibling Gizmo. Sunny's first flight was brief, with the eaglet later found perching in a nearby tree, as her parents will continue to protect and provide food for her for a few weeks or months. The first year of an eagle's life is often perilous, but Sunny is the fourth eaglet from Jackie and Shadow to successfully fledge.</p>

          <p>Donald Trump has pardoned two shark divers from South Florida, Tanner Mansell and John Moore Jr., who were convicted of theft for freeing 19 sharks and a grouper from a fisherman's longline in 2022. The divers, who believed the line was illegal, were charged with theft after officials said it belonged to a licensed fisherman. Despite avoiding prison time, the felony convictions prevented them from voting, owning firearms, and traveling freely. The pardons erase these convictions, with attorneys for the divers stating that the case should never have been filed.</p>

          <p>The Trump administration is temporarily halting its plan to garnish Social Security benefits for individuals who have defaulted on their student loans. The Education Department spokesperson stated that this decision reflects the administration's commitment to protecting Social Security recipients who often rely on a fixed income. This policy reversal provides older student borrowers with additional time to address their defaulted loans and avoid reductions in their benefit checks. The federal government possesses considerable authority to collect on student loans, including the ability to seize tax refunds, paychecks, and Social Security benefits.</p>

          <p>A judge in California has blocked the Trump administration from using the Alien Enemies Act to deport Venezuelan migrants in the Los Angeles area, citing inadequate due process. The ruling, issued by a Trump-appointed judge, is the latest in a series of legal challenges to the administration's use of the 1798 law. The judge argued that the government has not provided sufficient notice for individuals to challenge their deportation. The ruling adds to the complex legal landscape surrounding the Alien Enemies Act, with courts in various states reaching different conclusions.</p>

International sales have surged, led by increases in the US and Europe, making Pop Mart a new favorite among investors.
