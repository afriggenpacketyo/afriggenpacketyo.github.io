          <p>Actor and director Ben Stiller's new documentary, "Stiller & Meara: Nothing Is Lost," delves into the complex marriage and comedic partnership of his late parents, Jerry Stiller and Anne Meara. The film uses archival footage and newly discovered secret audio recordings made by his father to explore their professional tensions, personal struggles, and the balance between their public personas and private family life. Through this process, Stiller confronts his own experiences as a parent and the challenge of breaking generational patterns, making the film a deeply personal examination of family dynamics.</p>

          <p>Following a recent policy speech by Taiwanese President William Lai, whom Beijing has labeled a "troublemaker," the People's Liberation Army (PLA) has not conducted any major military exercises near the island. According to Taiwan's defense ministry, daily PLA sorties have remained relatively low, numbering between seven and 27 in the week after the address. This level of activity is significantly less intense than previous large-scale drills, such as one in April that involved 76 sorties, which Beijing described at the time as a "serious warning" to pro-independence forces.</p>

          <p>In a "60 Minutes" interview, Jared Kushner, a key negotiator of the recent Israel-Hamas peace deal, stated that the agreement's success hinges on creating a viable governing alternative to Hamas in Gaza. He warned that Hamas will likely use violence to try and reassert control, and that preventing this requires the establishment of the interim governing body outlined in the 20-point plan. Kushner believes that if Israel and its international partners can successfully implement this new governance structure, Hamas will ultimately fail and Gaza will no longer pose a threat.</p>

          <p>The British government has unveiled a comprehensive strategy aimed at creating 400,000 new jobs in the clean energy sector within the next five years. The plan focuses on training and recruiting workers for priority occupations such as plumbers, electricians, and welders to support the expansion of renewable industries like wind, solar, and nuclear power. To facilitate this, the government will establish five "technical excellence colleges" and launch programs to help veterans, ex-offenders, and oil and gas workers transition into green energy roles, aiming to boost local economies.</p>

          <h2>Federal Judges Praised for Challenging Trump's Justification for National Guard Deployments</h2>

          <p>An opinion article highlights recent actions by two federal district court judges who blocked President Trump's orders to deploy National Guard troops to Portland and Chicago. The judges ruled that the administration's rationale for the deployments, which cited extreme civil unrest, was "untethered to the facts" on the ground. The article praises these rulings as a courageous and necessary judicial check on executive power, contrasting them with what the author perceives as the Supreme Court's deference to the president and arguing for the importance of speaking truth to power.</p>

          <p>With Medicare's open enrollment period running until December 7, experts are urging beneficiaries to carefully review their options rather than automatically renewing their current plans. It is crucial to check for changes in coverage for preferred doctors and necessary prescription drugs, which can significantly impact out-of-pocket costs. The article outlines the key differences between original Medicare and private Medicare Advantage plans, noting that while the ongoing government shutdown may cause minor delays in accessing information, it is not expected to disrupt the overall enrollment process.</p>

          <p>Georgia Congresswoman Marjorie Taylor Greene, long considered one of Donald Trump's most loyal supporters, has recently taken several positions that diverge from the Republican mainstream. She has criticized the war in Gaza as a "genocide," pushed for the release of the Jeffrey Epstein files, and sided with Democrats to continue Affordable Care Act subsidies. This streak of independence has drawn surprise and even praise from some political opponents, sparking speculation about whether her motives are rooted in populist principle or personal political ambition.</p>

          <h2>Neuroscientist Explains Why Our Common Understanding of Memory Is Flawed</h2>
          <div class="timestamp">2025-10-19 06:30:00 EDT</div>
        </div>
        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>According to neuroscientist Dr. Charan Ranganath, memory functions less like a factual filing cabinet and more like a dynamic resource for shaping our life's narrative. In an interview about his book "Why We Remember," he explains that memory's primary purpose is to help us understand the present and plan for the future, not to perfectly record the past. The article delves into why forgetting is essential, how emotions prioritize what we recall, why traumatic memories persist, and how our malleable memory system constructs our sense of self.</p>
