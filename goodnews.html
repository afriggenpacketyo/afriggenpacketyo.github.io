          <p>Nippon Steel Corp.'s top executive, Eiji Hashimoto, expressed confidence that the U.S. government's oversight role in its $14.1 billion acquisition of U.S. Steel will not impede the U.S. unit's business operations. Hashimoto emphasized that the substantial $11 billion investment in U.S. Steel operations and the golden share issued to the U.S. government are justifiable conditions, even though analysts perceive them as potential risks to U.S. Steel's management. The agreement ensures that a U.S. president or designated official can approve key management decisions, including facility closures. Hashimoto highlighted the strategic importance of U.S. Steel, particularly with the likelihood of continued U.S. tariffs on steel products, which would benefit Nippon Steel's high-grade steel production used in electric vehicles (not investment advice).</p>

          <p>Archaeologists have reconstructed 2,000-year-old wall paintings from a luxurious Roman villa in Central London, piecing together thousands of fragments of plaster. The frescoes, depicting musical instruments, birds, flowers, and fruit, provide insights into the affluence of the area, described as the "Beverly Hills of Roman London." The discovery includes a fragment with the Latin word "Fecit," suggesting clues about the artists who created the frescoes. This collection is considered one of the largest assemblages of Roman wall plaster and paintings ever found in Roman London, shedding light on the city's rich Roman history and the sophistication of its inhabitants.</p>

          <p>As tariffs increase, businesses are using "tariff engineering" to reduce costs by altering product materials or dimensions to fit into lower-tariff categories. This legal practice involves strategically designing products to qualify for different tariff classifications and duty rates. For example, manufacturers are bundling steel and aluminum to qualify for lower duties or switching synthetic materials for cotton. This trend highlights how companies are adapting to the changing landscape of international trade and finding creative ways to minimize the impact of tariffs (not investment advice).</p>
