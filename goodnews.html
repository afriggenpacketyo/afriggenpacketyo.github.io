          <p>Kilmar Abrego Garcia, a Salvadoran native wrongly deported in March and later returned to the U.S. to face human smuggling charges, has been released from criminal custody in Tennessee. A federal judge ordered his return to Maryland, blocking further deportation attempts by immigration authorities. Abrego Garcia, who pleaded not guilty to the charges, must remain under his brother's custody in Maryland and adhere to specific release conditions, including anger management and avoiding MS-13 gang members, allegations his family denies. This development marks a significant step in his ongoing legal battle, although his attorneys emphasize he is "far from safe."</p>

          <h2>Key Factors That Can Reduce Your Social Security Benefits</h2>
          <div class="timestamp">2025-08-22 17:01:20 EDT</div>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Many American retirees rely on Social Security, but several factors can unexpectedly reduce these crucial benefits. Working while receiving benefits before full retirement age can trigger an earnings test, leading to temporary reductions. Medicare Part B premiums, especially Income-Related Monthly Adjustment Amounts for high-income earners, are often automatically deducted, significantly lowering monthly payments. Furthermore, a portion of Social Security benefits can be subject to federal income tax if combined income exceeds certain thresholds. Understanding these potential reductions is vital for retirement planning, with options like reverse mortgages or part-time work available to supplement income. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>The U.S. government has officially acquired a 10% stake in chipmaker Intel through an $8.9 billion investment, converting CHIPS Act grants and other program funds into common stock. This move, spearheaded by the Trump administration, marks a significant shift in U.S. industrial policy, with the government taking an active role in the private sector. Intel's CEO confirmed the deal, emphasizing the company's commitment to American-made advanced technologies, despite facing challenges in chip production and competition. The government will not have board seats or governance rights, but this unprecedented equity stake highlights efforts to bolster domestic semiconductor manufacturing. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>Tennis legend Serena Williams has openly discussed using GLP-1 weight-loss medication, aiming to reduce the stigma associated with such drugs. Despite her intense training, Williams stated she struggled to lose weight after childbirth, leading her to "try something different." While her transparency, especially as a spokesperson for a GLP-1 provider, is seen by some as a breakthrough against stereotypes of laziness, critics worry it further emphasizes appearance over achievement and may demotivate others due to the high cost and accessibility challenges of these medications. Her admission underscores the pervasive societal pressure on body image, even for elite athletes who have achieved unparalleled success.</p>

          <p>Netflix's animated hit "KPop Demon Hunters" is making an unusual theatrical debut with sold-out sing-along screenings across North America, potentially topping the weekend box office. Despite industry estimates projecting significant earnings, Netflix maintains its long-standing policy of not releasing box office figures, frustrating industry professionals and theater owners. This high-profile move underscores the streamer's complex relationship with cinemas, often using theatrical runs primarily as marketing for its subscriber base rather than a core business model. The film's immense popularity, fueled by its catchy soundtrack and strong female characters, highlights a growing demand for social viewing experiences, even for content already available at home.</p>

          <p>Alphabet shares rose over 3% following reports that Apple is in early discussions to potentially integrate Google's Gemini AI models into an updated version of its Siri assistant, possibly launching next year. This development comes as Google's Gemini models consistently lead in AI benchmarks, contrasting with Apple's struggles to define its own AI strategy. The reported talks also highlight potential risks to Google's lucrative search deals with Apple, as a U.S. judge is expected to rule on Google's alleged search monopoly. Apple is reportedly exploring partnerships with other AI developers like Anthropic and OpenAI to enhance its Apple Intelligence framework. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>Welsh Fire secured a crucial eight-wicket victory over Birmingham Phoenix, narrowly avoiding elimination from The Hundred men's knockout stages.

This vital win leaves both teams on eight points, still trailing Northern Superchargers in third place with two games remaining in the competition. While qualification remains unlikely, both Fire and Phoenix cling to the slim possibility of advancing if they win their remaining matches and other results favor their score.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>As credit card debt and delinquencies rise, many Americans seek relief, with credit card forbearance emerging as a temporary option. Forbearance allows borrowers to pause or reduce payments for a limited time, potentially including fee waivers and interest relief, but it does not erase debt. Qualification typically requires demonstrating legitimate financial hardship, such as job loss or unexpected expenses, along with a history of on-time payments. If forbearance isn't an option, alternatives like debt management plans, consolidation loans, balance transfers, or even bankruptcy can help manage unmanageable debt. Acting quickly is crucial to avoid deeper financial distress. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>Canadian Prime Minister Mark Carney announced that Canada will drop some of its billions of dollars in retaliatory tariffs on U.S. goods, though levies on autos, steel, and aluminum will remain in place. This decision, effective September 1st, follows a phone call with President Trump and aims to re-establish free trade for the vast majority of goods moving between the two countries. The move is a response to the U.S. ending its tariffs on goods compliant with the US-Mexico-Canada free trade agreement. While the White House welcomed the "long overdue" action, Canadian conservatives criticized Carney for "capitulation," highlighting ongoing political and trade tensions. The focus now shifts to accelerating negotiations on remaining key sectors ahead of a USMCA review next year.</p>

          <p>Major League Baseball is finalizing new three-year media rights agreements with ESPN, NBC, and Netflix, aiming to expand its reach and secure new revenue streams in a shifting media landscape. Under the proposed deals, NBC would acquire Sunday night games and Wild Card playoffs for approximately $200 million annually, while Netflix would gain Home Run Derby rights for about $50 million. ESPN is set for a new $550 million package, including digital out-of-market games and rights to five local teams. These partnerships reflect MLB's strategic effort to capitalize on streaming services as traditional TV viewership declines, developing new media alliances that could lead to further opportunities after 2028.
