          <p>PBS has filed a lawsuit against the Trump administration challenging an executive order that targets public broadcasting. The lawsuit alleges unlawful interference in the operations of the Corporation for Public Broadcasting and violations of the First Amendment, including viewpoint discrimination and illegal retaliation. The executive order instructs the CPB to "cease direct funding to NPR and PBS" and prevents indirect funding by prohibiting local stations from using taxpayer dollars to support the organizations. Additionally, the order directs the FCC to investigate whether NPR and PBS have engaged in unlawful discrimination. The lawsuit aims to protect PBS's editorial independence and the autonomy of its member stations.</p>

          <p>Loretta Swit, best known for her role as Maj. Margaret "Hot Lips" Houlihan on the TV series "M*A*S*H," has passed away at the age of 87. Swit died at her home in New York City, reportedly from natural causes, and had a career spanning stage and screen, but is most remembered for her role on the long-running CBS series. The show, adapted from the 1970 film, followed a mobile Army surgical hospital during the Korean War, and Swit won two Emmys and was nominated for four Golden Globes for her performances. She aimed to portray Houlihan as a real person, even if it meant sacrificing some jokes, and felt her character was constantly developing throughout the show's run.</p>

          <p>President Trump praised Elon Musk for his work with the Department of Government Efficiency (DOGE) as Musk's tenure as a "special government employee" concludes. Trump credited Musk with overhauling the federal government and cutting wasteful spending, though DOGE's savings fell short of Musk's initial $1 trillion promise, with some estimates suggesting the initiative could cost the government $135 billion. Despite his departure, Trump indicated that Musk would remain involved, continuing to advise the administration, and Musk defended DOGE's work, expressing confidence that the $1 trillion goal would be achieved over time. Musk has publicly split from Trump over the "One Big Beautiful Bill Act" which would increase the deficit, and Musk was wearing a DOGE baseball cap and "DOGEfather" t-shirt during his Oval Office appearance.</p>

Trump credited Musk with leading the most sweeping government reform program in generations and said he will continue to be "back and forth" to the White House.
