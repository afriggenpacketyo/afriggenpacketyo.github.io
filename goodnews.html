          <h2>Biden's Prostate Cancer Diagnosis Raises Questions About Screening Guidelines</h2>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>This New York Times article addresses questions surrounding President Biden's prostate cancer diagnosis, including why it went undetected and whether it explains his occasional affect. Science reporter Gina Kolata explains that Biden's cancer is aggressive and has spread to his bones, making it incurable but controllable with drugs. The article notes that Biden's physicians stopped testing his prostate-specific antigen (PSA) after 2014, possibly contributing to the delayed diagnosis. The piece also discusses the guidelines for prostate cancer screening in older men and whether Biden should have been tested more regularly given his position.</p>

          <p>Toyota Motor Corp. announced that the redesigned 2026 Toyota RAV4 will only be offered as a hybrid or plug-in hybrid model, eliminating the traditional gas engine option. The decision is driven by the growing popularity of hybrids and the need to meet fuel economy regulations. Toyota's electrified vehicle sales accounted for 43.1% of its domestic sales in 2024, and RAV4 sales increased 9.3% last year, with hybrids making up roughly half of those sales. The all-hybrid RAV4 lineup includes interior and exterior design changes, as well as upgrades to performance and technologies.</p>
