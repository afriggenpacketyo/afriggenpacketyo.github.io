          <p>Japan's governing Liberal Democratic Party (LDP) has elected Sanae Takaichi, a conservative hard-liner, as its new leader, making her the presumptive choice for the country's first female prime minister. A 64-year-old protégé of former Prime Minister Shinzo Abe, Takaichi is known for her hawkish stance on China and regular visits to the controversial Yasukuni Shrine. Her election is seen as an effort by the LDP to regain support from its conservative base after recent election losses. She now faces the challenge of uniting a fractured party and addressing significant economic and diplomatic issues.</p>

          <p>With one month until Election Day, the political landscape in key 2025 races is heavily shaped by former President Donald Trump and the ongoing federal government shutdown. Gubernatorial contests in New Jersey and Virginia are being framed as early referendums on Trump's agenda and popularity ahead of the midterms. In New Jersey, candidates are trading blame for the shutdown, while Virginia's race is impacted by federal spending cuts. Other high-stakes contests include New York City's mayoral election, a California redistricting proposition, and crucial state Supreme Court races in Pennsylvania.</p>

          <p>Scientific analysis of the first-ever rock samples returned from the far side of the moon by China's Chang'e-6 mission has revealed a significant thermal difference between the two lunar hemispheres. A team of Chinese and British researchers found that minerals from the far side appear to have formed in lava that was approximately 100 degrees Celsius cooler than on the near side. This discovery provides crucial new data for understanding the moon's formation and the long-observed asymmetries in its topography and crustal structure. The findings help solve a long-standing mystery that could not be investigated without physical samples from the far side.</p>

        </div>
        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>A new study by Italian researchers suggests that one of Venice's most famous symbols, the bronze winged Lion of St. Mark, may have originated in Tang dynasty China over a thousand years ago. The theory posits that the statue began as a 'zhenmushou,' a mythical beast used as a tomb guardian, before being transported to Europe and heavily modified. Researchers support this claim with stylistic comparisons and lead isotope analysis that traces the statue's copper to ore sources in China's Lower Yangtze River basin. They even speculate it could have been brought to Venice by the family of explorer Marco Polo.</p>

          <p>The new film 'The Smashing Machine,' starring Dwayne "The Rock" Johnson, is bringing the dramatic story of MMA pioneer Mark Kerr to a new generation. The movie is based on a 2002 documentary of the same name that unflinchingly chronicled Kerr's reign as the world's top heavyweight fighter while battling a severe addiction to opioids. After years of personal and professional decline following his fighting career, Kerr is now sober and has collaborated with Johnson and director Benny Safdie on the film. The project represents a second chance at notoriety and a moment of redemption for the retired fighter.</p>

          <p>Renowned mountain athlete Kilian Jornet has completed an extraordinary endurance feat, summiting the 73 highest mountains in the contiguous United States in just 31 days. The project, titled 'States of Elevation,' involved Jornet cycling over 3,000 miles between the peaks and running up each one, covering six states from Colorado to Washington. Jornet, widely considered the greatest mountain athlete of all time, approached the challenge not as a race but as an artistic expression, choosing what he called "the most aesthetic line." His journey highlights the limits of human endurance and serves as an exploration of American wilderness.</p>

          <p>While the Nobel Prize is globally recognized for celebrating monumental achievements, its history is filled with fascinating and controversial facts. For instance, Marie Curie is the only person to win in two different sciences, and her family has accumulated five Nobels in total. Albert Einstein gave his prize money to his ex-wife as part of their divorce settlement, years before he actually won. The prize has also faced criticism for overlooking key female scientists like Lise Meitner and Rosalind Franklin, and has been awarded for discoveries, such as the lobotomy, that were later deemed harmful.</p>

This event will be the first in a series of three back-to-back supermoons, with the next two occurring in November and December. The name 'Harvest Moon' is given to the full moon closest to the autumn equinox, a time traditionally associated with gathering crops.</p>
