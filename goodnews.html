          <p>Singapore's passport has again been named the most powerful globally for 2025, granting its citizens visa-free access to 193 countries, according to the latest Henley Passport Index. This continues the city-state's dominance in the rankings, which are based on data from the International Air Transport Association. In contrast, the report highlights a continued decline for both the United States and United Kingdom passports, which once held top positions but have now slipped to tenth and sixth place, respectively. The rankings underscore a significant shift in global mobility, with Asian and European nations dominating the top tiers.</p>

          <p>The United States and Japan have announced a significant trade deal, which includes lowering U.S. tariffs on Japanese automobiles from 25% to 15%. The agreement, described by President Trump as one of the "largest ever," is also expected to see Japan invest $550 billion in the U.S. and open its markets to more American goods. The news prompted a major surge in the stock prices of Japanese automakers like Toyota and Honda, providing relief to an industry that had been hit hard by previous tariff threats.

          <p>Tennis legend Venus Williams has become the second-oldest woman in the sport's professional era to win a tour-level singles match, defeating Peyton Stearns at the DC Open. At 45 years old, Williams secured her first singles victory in nearly two years, showcasing her powerful serves and groundstrokes in a 6-3, 6-4 win. The only older player to achieve such a feat was Martina Navratilova, who won a match at age 47. The victory marks a significant comeback for the seven-time Grand Slam singles champion after a long absence from the sport due to health issues.</p>

          <p>England's journey to the Euro 2025 final has been significantly powered by the clutch performances of substitutes Chloe Kelly and Michelle Agyemang. Much like the super-subs of their victorious 2022 campaign, this new duo has repeatedly changed the course of games, most notably in the quarter-final and semi-final. Agyemang, a 19-year-old newcomer, scored crucial equalizers in both matches, while Kelly provided key assists and scored the dramatic extra-time winner against Italy. Their impact from the bench has been a defining feature of the Lionesses' resilient and successful tournament run.</p>

          <p>A Pulitzer Prize-winning photograph taken in 1975 by Stanley Forman, depicting a woman and child falling from a collapsed fire escape in Boston, had a profound and lasting impact on public safety.
