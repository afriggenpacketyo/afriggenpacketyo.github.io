          <p>Alaska Airlines resumed flights after a nationwide ground stop caused by a technology outage, leading to disruptions. Operations were restored early Friday morning, but the airline is working to get back on track after canceling over 400 flights on Alaska and Horizon Air. More than 49,000 passengers experienced travel disruptions, and the airline has issued an apology and implemented a flexible travel policy. The carrier did not provide details about the specific nature of the tech outage that prompted the FAA to issue a ground stop. Alaska Airlines operates primarily on the West Coast, serving 140 destinations worldwide.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Vikings coach Kevin O'Connell defended his decision to keep quarterback Carson Wentz in the game despite a significant loss to the Chargers and Wentz's apparent shoulder discomfort. O'Connell stated that he repeatedly checked with Wentz, who insisted he was able to continue playing and felt confident in his throwing ability. Reserve quarterback Max Brosmer entered the game briefly in the fourth quarter, and O'Connell acknowledged considering using him earlier but weighed Wentz's experience against asking a rookie to navigate a difficult situation. McCarthy is expected to return as the starting quarterback in Week 9 against the Lions if he recovers fully from his ankle injury, as the Vikings have now lost back-to-back games. The team's current record stands at 3-4, and Wentz was seen slamming his helmet on the sideline in frustration, yet he maintained that the injury did not affect his throwing ability. </p>

          <p>Ontario Premier Doug Ford announced that the province would pause its anti-tariff advertisement campaign in the U.S. after President Trump terminated trade talks. The decision came after Ford spoke with Prime Minister Mark Carney and agreed to pause the TV spot on Monday so that trade talks could resume. Trump criticized the ad, which quoted former President Ronald Reagan saying tariffs hurt every American, calling it fake and egregious. Ford stated that the intention of the advert was to initiate a conversation about the kind of economy that Americans want to build and the impact of tariffs.</p>

          <p>House Minority Leader Hakeem Jeffries endorsed Zohran Mamdani in the race for New York City mayor, marking a significant show of support for the Democratic assemblyman. Jeffries cited Mamdani's focus on addressing the affordability crisis and his commitment to being a Mayor for all New Yorkers. Mamdani welcomed Jeffries' support and reiterated his commitment to an affordability agenda and fighting Trump's authoritarianism. The endorsement comes as Mamdani's opponent, former Gov. Andrew Cuomo, received an endorsement from outgoing Mayor Eric Adams, and Mamdani's campaign was sent a cease-and-desist letter over an ad that depicted a modified version of team's logo that replaced the word "Knicks" with "Zohran."</p>

          <p>Mayor Karen Bass has selected Jaime Moore, a longtime LAFD leader, as the new fire chief of the Los Angeles Fire Department. Moore, currently a deputy chief, will take over after a nationwide search and interviews with fire chiefs from other major cities. The announcement comes months before the anniversary of the deadly Palisades fire, which has led to scrutiny of the department's handling of the disaster. Bass ousted the previous fire chief, citing a lack of communication, and has instituted new protocols for red flag weather warnings.</p>
