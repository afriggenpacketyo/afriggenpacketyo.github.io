          <p>Nvidia is reportedly developing a new artificial intelligence (AI) chip tailored for the Chinese market to comply with US export regulations. The new B30 chip will allow users to link multiple units, creating high-performance computing clusters.

The new GPU is expected to be introduced in July and will likely be based on the company‚Äôs Blackwell platform. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>Neurotech startup Paradromics announced it has successfully implanted its brain-computer interface (BCI) in a human for the first time. The procedure took place at the University of Michigan during a neurosurgery to treat epilepsy, with the device being implanted and removed in approximately 20 minutes. The procedure demonstrated the safety and ability of the system to record neural activity. Paradromics plans to initiate a clinical trial later this year to study the long-term safety and efficacy of its Connexus Brain-Computer Interface in humans, aiming to assist patients with severe motor impairments to communicate through computers.</p>

          <p>The government is planning to remodel the UK's flight paths, potentially leading to shorter journey times, fewer delays, and more flights for passengers. The UK Airspace Design Service (UKADS) will redesign routes over UK airspace, many of which were established around 70 years ago. The initial focus will be on modernizing the airspace in and around London, but changes are not expected to take effect for several years. These changes aim to reduce aviation's climate change impacts and pave the way for new technologies like flying taxis.</p>

          <p>Maintaining a romantic relationship requires effort, communication, and compromise, but modern culture often promotes cutting off relationships that require too much work. Research suggests that putting effort into a relationship leads to long-term happiness, but it shouldn't come at the expense of one's mental and physical health. The key lies in finding a balance and ensuring both partners are willing to contribute to the relationship's growth. Recognizing when enough is enough and prioritizing self-care are crucial for maintaining a healthy partnership.</p>

          <p>While self-knowledge is often encouraged, the pursuit of perfect self-understanding is unattainable due to limitations in human perception and unconscious biases. Overly intense introspection can lead to rumination and negative thought spirals. Instead of seeking a fixed true self, individuals should focus on building a flexible sense of self that allows for change and surprise. Embracing a changeable self is linked to positive outcomes, including lower stress and better physical health.</p>

          <p>Democrats have been debating the party‚Äôs political and policy mistakes since Kamala Harris‚Äôs defeat. A new poll from Demand Progress suggests that voters prefer a populist message focused on fighting corporate power over an ‚Äúabundance‚Äù message focused on reducing regulatory bottlenecks. However, the political case for abundance reforms rests on their material benefits, not their rhetorical appeal, and there is no inherent tension between populism and abundance. The debate is primarily about policy, not politics, and Democrats should focus on governing effectively.</p>
