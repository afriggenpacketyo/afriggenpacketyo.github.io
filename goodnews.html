        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>President Trump, during a speech in Saudi Arabia, criticized Western intervention and nation-building efforts in the Middle East, drawing both applause and skepticism. He declared that the United States would no longer lecture other nations on how to live and urged the people of the region to chart their own destinies. While some in the Middle East welcomed the sentiment, viewing it as a rejection of past American policies, others expressed concern about the potential impact on human rights and regional stability. Trump also expressed a desire for Saudi Arabia to recognize Israel and for a deal with Iran over its nuclear program, meeting with the new Syrian leader, Ahmed al-Shara, during his Gulf tour.</p>

          <p>The Los Angeles City Council approved a plan to raise the minimum wage for hotel and airport workers to $30 per hour by 2028, despite warnings from business leaders about potential job losses and a slowdown in tourism. The proposal, hailed by labor leaders as the highest minimum wage in the country, also requires employers to provide $8.35 per hour for health care by July 2026. While supporters argue that the wage increase will benefit workers and boost the local economy, opponents predict that hotels and airport businesses will cut back on staffing and investment in the city, potentially impacting the 2028 Olympic Games.</p>

          <p>Harvard University President Alan Garber is taking a voluntary 25% pay cut in response to the Trump administration's decision to cut $450 million in grants to the university. This action follows a lawsuit filed by Harvard after the administration froze $2.2 billion in federal funding and threatened to revoke the university's tax-exempt status. Dozens of tenured Harvard professors have also pledged to donate 10% of their salaries to support the university's legal challenge. The administration claims Harvard has failed to address race discrimination and anti-Semitic harassment on campus, while Harvard argues it has made necessary changes and is compliant with federal law.</p>
