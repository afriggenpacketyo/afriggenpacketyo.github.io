          <p>This article explains the true cost of collection debt, which extends beyond the original balance and includes factors like interest, late fees, collection agency fees, legal costs, and damage to your credit score. Unpaid credit card debt turned over to collections can quickly balloon due to these added charges, making it even more difficult to manage. The article provides advice on lowering collection debt, such as negotiating settlements, requesting fee waivers, seeking professional help, and considering legal options. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>A federal judge has issued an injunction against President Trump's attempt to eliminate the Institute of Museum and Library Services (IMLS), which provides federal funding to libraries and museums. The ruling states that Trump's executive order violated the Administrative Procedure Act and disregarded Congress's constitutional role in appropriating funds. The IMLS, established in 1996, is a primary source of federal funding for public libraries, especially benefiting small and rural libraries. The article notes the agency's employees were placed on administrative leave, and some states had grants rescinded before the injunction.</p>

          <p>The Trump administration's efforts to minimize the focus on the nation's racial past are meeting resistance, as demonstrated by the temporary rescinding of federal grants to the Whitney Plantation in Louisiana, a museum dedicated to portraying the lives of enslaved people. Despite an executive order denouncing cultural institutions that attempt to rewrite history, some institutions, like the Smithsonian's National Museum of African American History and Culture, are pushing back. The article emphasizes the importance of preserving and accurately portraying Black history and the challenges of altering historical narratives after years of reckoning with the nation's racist past.</p>

          <p>A new study suggests that the Chav√≠n people in the Peruvian Andes used psychoactive drugs during exclusive rituals to potentially establish social and political hierarchies. Archaeologists discovered artifacts, including snuff tubes, at Chav√≠n de Hu√°ntar, a UNESCO World Heritage Site, with traces of DMT and other hallucinogenic substances. The study suggests these rituals were conducted in small, restricted-access rooms, indicating that only certain members of society participated. The findings offer new insights into the ritual practices of the Chav√≠n civilization, a predecessor to the Inca civilization.</p>
