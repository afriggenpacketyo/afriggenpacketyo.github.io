          <p>Hong Kong and Shanghai have signed an action plan to enhance financial cooperation, aiming to support mainland Chinese companies in their global endeavors. The agreement, signed at the Lujiazui Forum, focuses on expanding the Connect program between the two cities' stock markets to include more diverse financial instruments like equities, bonds, ETFs, and gold. Additionally, the plan addresses cross-border settlements and the utilization of the digital yuan. Hong Kong's Financial Secretary emphasized the plan's role in clarifying cooperation directions and injecting new content into financial collaboration, highlighting its support for mainland companies' 'go global' strategy. The agreement marks the first of its kind since the forum's inception, signaling Beijing's commitment to market liberalization.</p>

          <p>A federal judge in Massachusetts has blocked the State Department from enforcing an executive order that required Americans to select their gender assigned at birth on new passports. The ruling allows individuals needing to renew, apply for a new passport, or change their name or sex designation to choose the gender they identify with, including selecting 'X' on the application. This expands on an earlier decision that only applied to six plaintiffs, reversing a Trump-era policy that mandated only male or female designations. The ACLU, representing transgender and nonbinary plaintiffs, argued the policy was discriminatory, with the judge agreeing that the administration failed to provide a rationale for the change.</p>

          <p>Tom Homan, former border czar, asserts that President Trump's leadership has led to the most secure border in U.S. history, citing a record low of 95 illegal immigrant encounters in a single day. Homan contrasts this with the Biden administration, which he claims released the 'vast majority' of encountered illegal immigrants into the U.S., compared to zero releases under Trump. He advocates for the passage of the 'Big Beautiful Bill' to solidify these gains and implement a large-scale deportation operation. These numbers reflect a trend since Trump's return to office, with significantly fewer releases of illegal immigrants compared to the Biden years.</p>

          <p>China's humanoid robotics companies are offering salaries more than three times the urban average to attract top engineers and AI talent, highlighting a significant talent crunch. The average monthly pay for humanoid robot algorithm engineers is around 31,512 yuan (US$4,386), with higher pay for experienced roles. This contrasts with the subdued hiring landscape in other sectors due to economic slowdown and corporate earnings decline. The high demand for skilled workers in humanoid robotics stands out as a positive trend amid broader job market pressures and high youth unemployment rates.</p>

          <p>Endangered sharks, rays, and native oysters could thrive in warmer UK waters as species shift habitats in response to rising ocean temperatures, according to scientists. Researchers mapped how 19 threatened marine species will respond to climate change in UK seas, with many finding new homes in North Sea biodiversity hotspots. Native oysters, basking sharks, and spurdog sharks are expected to benefit, while static creatures like sea pens and ocean quahogs may struggle. This analysis aims to guide government efforts to protect marine species as climate change alters their habitats.</p>

          <p>Extreme heat is altering holiday travel, with many Europeans modifying plans due to climate change. The 2023 summer heatwave, causing over 47,000 deaths in Europe, has prompted travelers to seek milder destinations or travel during cooler months. A report indicates 81% of Europeans have adjusted holiday plans due to climate-related factors, with almost a third choosing destinations with milder weather. This shift could impact Mediterranean resorts reliant on summer tourism, with some adapting by offering evening activities and investing in winter connectivity.</p>

Trump tried to force a sale of TikTok to an American buyer in 2020, during his first term in office. But last year, Trump said he liked the platform because he believed it had helped him win the 2024 presidential election.</p>
