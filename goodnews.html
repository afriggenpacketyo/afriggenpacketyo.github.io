The communique issued vowed that the committee would "face major tests" and "tackle difficulties" amidst "high winds, rough waves and raging storms," signaling significant internal and external challenges. These discussions underscored the party's commitment to technological upgrades and self-reliance to meet medium and long-term economic and social development benchmarks, which are anticipated to be detailed in the country's next five-year plan. Officials present included the head of the top economic planner, the minister of commerce, and the minister of science and technology, highlighting the comprehensive nature of the policy review.</p>

          <h2>China's Strategic Planning Powers Green Energy Transition, Draws Western Anxiety</h2>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>This opinion article highlights how China's long-term strategic planning, bolstered by political stability and policy continuity, is propelling its green energy transition, generating considerable attention and some anxiety in Western media. Publications like The New York Times have detailed China's vast ultra-high-voltage power lines, capable of transmitting more electricity than any U.S. utility line, from remote deserts to populous regions. The Financial Times described China as the world's first significant "electrostate," contrasting its renewable energy support with the U.S.'s fossil fuel emphasis. China's consistent energy strategy has seen renewable energy's share in power generation capacity jump from 40% to 60% since 2021, aiming for peak carbon emissions by 2030 and carbon neutrality by 2060.</p>

          <p>Sophia Forchas, a 12-year-old girl critically wounded in an August shooting at a Minneapolis Catholic church, has been released from the hospital to a celebratory homecoming. Shot in the head, Sophia endured severe brain damage and was once feared to be the third fatality, following the deaths of two other children and injuries to 17 people. Minneapolis Police Chief Brian O’Hara hailed her return as a "miracle," escorting her in a limousine to cheers from the community. Although her recovery journey continues with outpatient therapy, her parents expressed profound gratitude, noting daily improvements in her speech, walking ability, and the resurgence of her personality.</p>

          <p>Thieves responsible for a multi-million dollar daylight heist at the Louvre museum, where they stole eight pieces of French crown jewels valued at an estimated €88 million, left behind extensive forensic evidence. Paris prosecutor Laure Beccuau confirmed the discovery of over 150 DNA, fingerprint, and other traces on items like a helmet, angle grinders, and gloves abandoned by the four burglars. Surveillance footage revealed the thieves initially struggled to open display cases before using other tools, while internal alarms activated immediately. The museum director acknowledged security vulnerabilities on the outer walls, committing to CCTV network upgrades and a police station inside the Louvre, with investigators optimistic about tracking the perpetrators using public and private cameras.</p>

          <p>President Trump announced the cancellation of a federal deployment to San Francisco, initially planned for Saturday, following discussions with Mayor Daniel Lurie and prominent tech company bosses. Trump stated that Mayor Lurie "asked, very nicely" for an opportunity to improve the city's situation, a sentiment echoed by leaders like Nvidia CEO Jensen Huang and Salesforce CEO Marc Benioff, who cited San Francisco's promising future. Mayor Lurie confirmed the federal withdrawal, presenting recent crime statistics showing a nearly 30% citywide reduction and violent crime at its lowest levels since the 1950s. This decision, which also garnered support from Governor Gavin Newsom and former House Speaker Nancy Pelosi, underscores a collaborative effort to address public safety concerns while respecting local governance.</p>

          <p>European Union leaders concluded a summit by pledging financial support for Ukraine through 2026 and 2027, but deferred a concrete decision on the funding strategy until a December meeting. All EU leaders, except Hungary, endorsed a statement committing to address Ukraine's urgent financial requirements. A primary point of contention was the proposal to use hundreds of billions of dollars in frozen Russian Central Bank assets as collateral for a large loan, a plan fraught with legal and financial risks, especially for Belgium, where most of these assets are held. Divergent views, such as Germany's preference for defense-only funding, mean the European Commission will develop specific financing options for the upcoming summit.</p>
