          <p>The third round of the US PGA Championship at Quail Hollow was delayed due to inclement weather, specifically thunderstorms. The start was pushed back to 16:43 BST on Saturday, impacting the original tee times. Practice was also temporarily suspended earlier due to the threat of lightning in the area, and the tee times were revised to accommodate the delay. This change affected players such as Rory McIlroy and defending champion Xander Schauffele, who were scheduled to tee off in the second group.</p>

          <p>The release of a 2023 audio recording of President Biden's interview with Special Counsel Robert Hur has reignited concerns about his mental and physical fitness for office. The recording, obtained by Axios, captures Biden's halting speech and memory lapses, providing a fuller picture of why Hur described him as an 'elderly man with a poor memory' in his report on Biden's handling of classified information. This development follows the release of a forthcoming book detailing instances of Biden's cognitive decline and advisers' efforts to suppress discussions of his age-related limitations.</p>

          <p>President Trump is advocating for the use of coal plants to power AI data centers, aiming to revive the struggling coal industry. This proposal clashes with the tech industry's environmental goals, as coal produces significantly more carbon emissions than other energy sources. While the tech industry acknowledges the need for fossil fuels to meet the growing electricity demand from AI, the focus is primarily on natural gas. Experts suggest that the industry's power needs may inadvertently extend the life of existing coal plants, despite long-term commitments to renewable energy.</p>

This decline is attributed to factors such as the increased availability of naloxone, policies stemming from the COVID-19 pandemic, and the flow of opioid-settlement cash to state and local governments.
