          <p>Former FBI Director James Comey was interviewed by the Secret Service regarding an Instagram post that some interpreted as a threat against President Trump. The post featured seashells arranged to form "86 47," a phrase critics have used to dismiss or remove Trump, the 47th president. Comey stated he was unaware of any violent connotation and removed the post. The Secret Service's investigation and the strong reactions from Trump administration officials highlight the ongoing contentious relationship between Trump and Comey. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>This Fox News article recalls how former President Joe Biden dismissed concerns about his mental fitness raised in Special Counsel Robert Hur's report.

The storm caused ground stops at Midway International Airport and forced drivers on Interstate 55 to pull over.

          <p>The BBC reports on the emergence of audio from a 2023 interview with former President Joe Biden, revealing his memory lapses during an investigation into his handling of classified documents. The audio shows Biden struggling to recall key milestones, such as the year he left office and the date of his son's death. This supports Special Counsel Robert Hur's description of Biden as a "well-meaning, elderly man with a poor memory," which influenced the decision not to press charges. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>Michelle Goldberg discusses the Democratic Party's failure to recognize Joe Biden's declining health, despite clear signs. The author suggests that groupthink, inertia, and risk aversion led to a collective denial of the president's increasing infirmity. Goldberg argues that party leaders need to grapple with the disastrous missteps that paved the way for Trump's return and be honest about what they got wrong. She also points out that a gerontocracy is increasingly the norm in American politics.</p>
