          <p>At 80 years old, John Fogerty gave an explosive and powerful rock-and-roll performance at the Hollywood Bowl as part of his "Celebration Tour." The concert heavily featured classics from his time with Creedence Clearwater Revival (CCR), whose song rights he fully regained two years ago after a long legal battle. Despite his age, Fogerty's vocal performance remained remarkably consistent and strong, and he played guitar for the full two-hour show without a break. The performance showcased the enduring power of his iconic songs like "Bad Moon Rising," "Fortunate Son," and "Proud Mary," reaffirming his legendary status.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>In a show of unity against potential U.S. trade actions, Brazil and India have announced their intention to triple bilateral trade flows. The move comes after President Trump criticized the BRICS bloc of emerging economies, claiming it was designed to harm the U.S. dollar and threatening a 10% tariff on member nations. The BRICS group, which includes Brazil, Russia, India, China, and other nations, aims to increase cooperation among Global South economies. This development signals a strategic realignment by major emerging markets in anticipation of a more aggressive U.S. tariff policy.</p>

          <h2>Opinion: Hong Kong Positioned to Fill Global Development Role as U.S. Influence Wanes</h2>

          <p>This opinion article argues that Hong Kong is uniquely positioned to become a new hub for providing global public goods as the United States scales back its international development efforts. The piece contrasts the recent dismantling of USAID as an independent agency with China's launch of the International Organisation for Mediation (IOMed) in Hong Kong. As Beijing takes a more proactive role in global development, the author suggests that Hong Kong's cosmopolitan status can be leveraged to fill the void. This shift represents a potential new path to prominence for the city on the international stage.</p>

          <p>Mandonna Kashanian, an Iranian mother who has lived in the U.S. for 47 years, was released from ICE detention after Republican House Majority Leader Steve Scalise intervened on her behalf. Kashanian was detained last month despite having no criminal record and consistently complying with immigration check-in requirements for decades. Her case drew significant community support, with neighbors and local officials advocating for her release. The intervention highlights the complex and sometimes arbitrary nature of immigration enforcement, as her attorney noted that many others in similar situations lack the political connections to achieve such an outcome.</p>

          <p>A Wall Street analyst has reiterated a bullish outlook on Nvidia, projecting its stock has the potential for significant further upside as it approaches a $4 trillion market capitalization. This optimism is fueled by expectations of soaring demand for AI factories and accelerators, with spending in the sector potentially reaching $2 trillion by 2028. The company is seen as maintaining a near-monopoly on critical AI technology, with its data center revenue forecast to more than double. While the stock's valuation is historically high, the company's market leadership and the early stage of the AI revolution support a positive long-term view. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>The U.S. Treasury Department has sanctioned Song Kum Hyok, a member of North Korea's Reconnaissance General Bureau, for his role in a sophisticated IT worker scheme. Song is accused of helping North Korean operatives fraudulently pose as American remote workers to get jobs at global companies, with their salaries funneled back to fund the nation's weapons programs. The scheme involved stealing the personal information of U.S. citizens to create fake identities for the operatives. This action is part of a broader U.S. effort to disrupt North Korea's illicit methods of circumventing international sanctions and funding its military ambitions.</p>

          <p>As forecasters predict an above-average Atlantic hurricane season, a growing number of coastal homeowners are investing in climate-resilient home designs to withstand stronger and more frequent storms. Companies like Deltec Homes specialize in building hurricane-resistant houses, often with aerodynamic round shapes and reinforced structures rated to withstand Category 5 winds. These designs, while costing more upfront, can lead to long-term savings, particularly on insurance. Research institutes are also testing building materials and techniques to make both new and existing homes safer, emphasizing features like reinforced roofs and wind-rated garage doors.</p>

          <p>The International Criminal Court (ICC) has issued arrest warrants for the Taliban's supreme leader, Haibatullah Akhundzada, and its chief justice, Abdul Hakim Haqqani. The charges accuse them of the crime against humanity of gender-based persecution against girls and women in Afghanistan. The court alleges that since seizing power in 2021, the Taliban has systematically deprived women and girls of fundamental rights to education, movement, and expression. The Taliban dismissed the warrants as "nonsense." While the ICC has no enforcement power, the warrants theoretically restrict the leaders' ability to travel to member states.</p>

          <p>China is rapidly expanding its offshore wind energy capacity, adding over 4.4 gigawatts in the first half of the year, matching its total for all of 2024. A report from Global Energy Monitor projects China will account for more than half of all new global offshore wind capacity this year, with another 22 GW already under construction. This surge is driven by strong government support, including subsidies and strategic planning, as part of President Xi Jinping's push to advance the nation's "marine economy." The expansion is seen as a key driver for job creation, energy security, and economic growth in coastal provinces.</p>

          <p>The UK's Advertising Standards Authority (ASA) has banned an Instagram post by TV personality Gemma Collins for illegally advertising a prescription-only weight-loss drug. The post promoted the brand Yazen, a service that combines prescription medication with a lifestyle app. It is illegal to advertise such medications directly to the public in the UK. The ASA ruled that although a specific drug wasn't named, the ad's references were a clear breach of the code. This was one of nine similar adverts from various companies that were banned in a recent crackdown on the promotion of prescription weight-loss treatments.</p>
