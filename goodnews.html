        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>As the fall 2025 semester approaches, students and families are weighing their options between federal and private student loans. Federal loans for the upcoming academic year offer fixed rates of 6.39% for undergraduates, but private lenders are advertising rates as low as 3.2% for borrowers with excellent credit. While private loans can offer substantial savings, they lack the robust protections of federal loans, such as income-driven repayment plans and forgiveness programs. Experts suggest starting with federal loans for their accessibility and safety nets, but recommend credit-worthy borrowers compare private options to potentially secure lower overall costs.

          <p>President Trump's proposed 'big beautiful bill' is expected to introduce significant tax changes primarily benefiting high-income earners. Experts note the legislation would make many 2017 tax cuts permanent, including raising the state and local tax (SALT) deduction cap and expanding benefits for qualified small business stock (QSBS) investments. The bill also makes the higher estate tax exemption permanent while placing new limits on the value of itemized deductions for top earners. While it offers a new charitable deduction for non-itemizers, it could decrease the value for wealthy donors. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>The island nation of Cape Verde is celebrating 50 years of independence from Portugal, reflecting on significant progress in development, education, and healthcare. Since 1975, the country has dramatically improved its social indicators, reducing illiteracy from 65% to about 3% and establishing a robust healthcare system. Despite these gains, challenges like youth unemployment and migration persist, with about 6% of the population leaving in recent years. However, with a stable democracy and development scores above the African average, the nation is viewed as a success story, shaped by a history of resilience against poverty and drought.</p>

Democrats have unified in opposition, with Leader Hakeem Jeffries delivering a marathon speech criticizing the bill's deep cuts to Medicaid. The legislation, which also raises the debt limit, now moves to a final debate and vote before heading to the president's desk. (not investment advice)</p>

In contrast, the federal government continued to shrink, shedding 7,000 jobs in line with the Trump administration's focus on cutting the federal workforce.
