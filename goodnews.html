          <p>Maine Governor Janet Mills has officially announced her bid for the 2026 Senate race, aiming to unseat long-serving Republican Senator Susan Collins. Mills, a popular two-term Democratic governor, is seen as a key recruit for national Democrats seeking to flip control of the Senate. However, she faces a potentially contentious primary against progressive challenger Graham Platner, backed by Senator Bernie Sanders. This high-stakes contest is expected to be one of the most closely watched races in the upcoming midterm elections, reflecting broader national tensions within the Democratic party regarding generational change and political strategy.</p>

          <p>Disney is nearing the announcement of Bob Iger's successor, with internal candidates Dana Walden and Josh D'Amaro as frontrunners. The board is reportedly considering a co-CEO structure, inspired by Netflix's success. However, corporate governance experts and company insiders warn against this for Disney, citing its famously political corporate culture, Iger's history of extended leadership, and past power-sharing issues with Bob Chapek. The article suggests that while a dual leadership might retain top talent, Disney's unique history and complex structure make such an arrangement prone to instability and internal conflicts, potentially undermining effective leadership.</p>

          <p>Stellantis is revamping its Jeep Grand Wagoneer lineup for the 2026 model year as part of a broader turnaround strategy for the Jeep brand. The overhaul includes updated exterior styling, the introduction of a new extended-range plug-in hybrid (EREV) powertrain, and a simplified, less expensive model lineup under the single "Grand Wagoneer" name, discontinuing the standalone "Wagoneer" nameplate. This move addresses past issues with consumer confusion and high pricing, aiming to expand market share. The Grand Wagoneer is expected to be Jeep's first EREV SUV, marking a crucial step in Stellantis' product strategy.</p>

The bank's profit surged 12% to $14.39 billion, with revenue rising 9% to $47.12 billion. CEO Jamie Dimon attributed the strong results to a resilient US economy but also acknowledged heightened uncertainty from geopolitical conditions and trade policies. Despite the positive quarter, the bank increased its provision for credit losses, signaling preparation for potential future turbulence and loan defaults. (not investment advice)</p>

          <h2>UK Forecast to Be Second-Fastest Growing G7 Economy by IMF, But Faces High Inflation</h2>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>The International Monetary Fund (IMF) predicts the UK will be the second-fastest-growing G7 economy in 2025 and 2026, with modest growth rates of 1.3%. This outlook, an upgrade from previous forecasts, is attributed to strong activity and an improved trade outlook, partly due to a new US-UK trade deal. However, the IMF also forecasts the UK to have the highest inflation in the G7 for 2025 and 2026, primarily driven by energy costs. The global economic outlook is influenced by US tariffs, a weakened dollar, and potential risks from an "excessively optimistic" AI tech boom. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>Former President Barack Obama is urging Californians to vote for Proposition 50 in a new television ad, framing the congressional redistricting ballot measure as crucial for protecting democracy. Spearheaded by Governor Gavin Newsom, Prop. 50 aims to counter Republican efforts to redraw districts to gain congressional seats. Obama asserts that the measure will level the electoral playing field and preserve independent redistricting. This multi-million-dollar campaign highlights the ongoing national debate over gerrymandering, with opponents like former Governor Arnold Schwarzenegger arguing the proposition favors entrenched politicians over voters.</p>

          <p>Marina Hyde's opinion piece argues that understanding President Donald Trump requires viewing him as a "pomp-era megastar" rather than a conventional politician. She contends that his actions, including brokering peace deals, are driven by an ego-centric, showbiz ethos, constantly referencing "ratings" and seeking to attach his name to projects. Hyde suggests that traditional political analyses fail because they compare him to statesmen like Kissinger, instead of entertainment figures like Taylor Swift. This perspective highlights Trump's solipsistic, unpredictable, and attention-driven approach to politics, where commerce often serves as a metric of success.</p>

          <p>The Pentagon's upcoming defense strategy report is expected to outline significant changes in the US approach to countering China's military and economic power. According to Chinese defense researchers, the report will prioritize homeland defense, including US skies and borders, while deterring China in the Indo-Pacific. Reports suggest a shift towards prioritizing homeland security over perceived threats from China and Russia. However, this does not necessarily mean reduced attention on the Indo-Pacific; instead, it might indicate a broader, indirect containment strategy through peripheral regions, rather than direct confrontation, according to one researcher.</p>

Other legislation includes AB 56, requiring mental health risk labels on social media, and AB 1043, demanding age verification tools in app stores.

          <p>The European Commission has fined luxury brands Gucci, Chloe, and Loewe over €157 million for violating EU competition rules by engaging in price fixing. The brands allegedly restricted independent retailers from setting their own online and offline prices, dictating minimum sales prices, maximum discount rates, and specific sales periods. This anti-competitive behavior led to higher prices and reduced consumer choice. Gucci-owner Kering has acknowledged the probe and ledgered the penalty, while Richemont (Chloe's owner) and LVMH (Loewe's owner) have not yet commented. This action underscores the EU's commitment to fair market practices.</p>
