          <h2>Japan's Economy Contracts Unexpectedly Amid Export Decline</h2>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Japan's economy contracted by 0.2% in the March quarter, marking the first decline in a year, primarily due to a sharp fall in exports. The GDP data was worse than economists anticipated, with exports falling 0.6% quarter-on-quarter, offsetting domestic demand growth of 0.6%. While a weak yen provided a competitive edge, it was overpowered by China's machinery and tool exports. The Bank of Japan is expected to maintain current rates, anticipating a reasonable trade deal with the U.S. to mitigate tariff impacts.</p>

The company is also creating a team for 24/7 monitoring of Grok's responses to address any incidents not caught by automated systems.</p>

          <p>Charles Strouse, the composer behind enduring musical theater numbers like "Tomorrow" from "Annie" and "Put On a Happy Face" from "Bye Bye Birdie," died at 96. With more than a dozen Broadway shows to his credit, Strouse won three Tony Awards, a Grammy, and an Emmy. His music was recorded by artists such as Frank Sinatra, Barbra Streisand, and Jay-Z, who sampled "It's the Hard-Knock Life" for his 1998 single. Trained under musical eminences, Strouse initially intended to compose concert music before finding success in musical theater.</p>

          <p>Lawyers increasingly seek out federal jurisdictions with sympathetic judges for divisive political issues, a practice known as venue shopping. A CBS News analysis suggests conservatives often file cases against the Biden administration in small Texas federal courts with single judges appointed by Republicans. The Supreme Court is weighing whether a single federal judge should dictate policy for the entire country. The analysis also shows that cases during Trump's second term have increasingly been landing before judges in Massachusetts, which is the bluest district in the circuit with the bluest appeals court.</p>

          <p>Northern California's commercial crab season is under threat from migrating whales, leading to experimental solutions like pop-up gear to reduce whale entanglements. Traditional crab fishing ropes have harmed hundreds of whales, prompting the state to shorten the season. Fisherman Brand Little uses a high-tech pop-up system that minimizes rope use and has not injured any whales. However, the cost of the new technology presents a challenge for many fishermen in an already struggling industry.</p>
