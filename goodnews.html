          <p>The city of Nanjing, China, employs drones with AI to patrol areas overlooked by human patrols, focusing on crime deterrence. This initiative is part of China's broader effort to scale up AI use in urban management to handle challenges from rapid urbanization. The Chinese leadership views AI as a tool for economic transformation and governance refinement, having launched the "smart cities" initiative over the past decade. Despite progress, China faces challenges in AI governance, including privacy protection and community involvement, mirroring issues in other countries adopting the technology.</p>

          <p>Stephanie Case, an ultramarathon runner and new mother, breastfed her six-month-old daughter three times during a 100-kilometer race in Wales and surprisingly won the female category. Case balanced her athletic goals with her role as a mother, consuming 80 to 100 grams of carbohydrates per hour to maintain her energy and milk supply. The Snowdonia course presented challenges, including significant elevation gain and technical terrain, requiring scrambling and climbing. She hopes her story shows that women don't have to lose themselves in motherhood and can still set big goals.</p>

          <p>A key U.S. inflation gauge indicated that price growth cooled in April, with consumer prices rising 2.1% year-over-year, down from 2.3% in March. The report also showed that Americans cooled off on spending, with overall consumer spending rising only 0.2% in April, down from 0.7% in March, which could reflect early caution in response to higher goods prices. Incomes rose 0.8% in April, largely due to an increase in Social Security benefits resulting from the Social Security Fairness Act. The Federal Reserve is expected to keep interest rates steady while evaluating the impact of tariffs on inflation and jobs (not investment advice).</p>
