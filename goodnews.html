          <p>England's Red Roses began their Women's Rugby World Cup campaign with a resounding 69-7 victory over the United States, played before a record-breaking crowd of 42,723. Star player Ellie Kildunne delivered an exceptional performance, scoring two tries and setting up two more, earning player-of-the-match honors. While the team showcased smooth execution, head coach John Mitchell identified areas needing refinement, including midfield passes and defensive intensity, stressing that the team has much growth ahead. This commitment to continuous improvement, even after a dominant win, suggests a formidable challenge for their upcoming opponents.</p>

          <p>Ether, the cryptocurrency linked to the Ethereum blockchain, reached a new record high for the first time since 2021, following Federal Reserve Chair Jerome Powell's speech hinting at potential interest rate cuts. Powell's remarks from Jackson Hole, suggesting a possible adjustment to the policy stance, triggered a "panicked repositioning" in the market, leading to significant short liquidations for Ether. This surge also boosted shares of companies focused on accumulating Ether and other crypto-related firms. The article notes Ether's recent leadership in the crypto market, attributed to regulatory tailwinds and growing institutional interest in stablecoins. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>South Korean cafes, particularly in student-dense areas, are grappling with "Cagongjok" – customers who extensively use cafe spaces for studying or working, often for entire days. This cultural trend, more prevalent than in Western countries, has led to issues like customers monopolizing outlets with multiple devices or leaving tables unattended for prolonged periods. Starbucks Korea recently issued guidelines to address "extreme cases," aiming to restore a comfortable environment for all patrons. While some cafes implement "No Study Zone" policies, others try to accommodate these long-stay customers, reflecting a broader societal discussion about the need for public study spaces in South Korea's hyper-competitive environment.</p>

          <p>The Consulate General of India has leased a full floor in downtown Los Angeles' AON Center, marking its second office in California and a significant expansion of India's diplomatic presence. This 10-year lease for over 20,500 square feet is a positive sign for the area's high office vacancy rates. The move is expected to foster increased cooperation between Los Angeles and India, especially with upcoming global events like the 2028 Olympics, which will feature cricket. The consulate aims to better serve the over half a million Indian Americans in Southern California and enhance trade, investment, and cultural connections.</p>

          <p>Meta is set to unveil its "Hypernova" smart glasses at the upcoming Connect conference, featuring a small digital display in the right lens and a wristband for gesture control. These consumer-ready glasses, expected to cost around $800, represent Meta's deeper push into smart eyewear, building on its partnership with EssilorLuxottica. The accompanying wristband, utilizing sEMG sensor technology from Meta's CTRL Labs, is designed to interpret hand movements for device control, serving as a key input for future AR glasses. While Meta anticipates limited initial sales due to the device's bulk, this launch marks a significant step in the company's long-term augmented reality ambitions.</p>

          <p>Major League Baseball is finalizing new media rights deals with ESPN, NBC, and Netflix, aiming to expand its partnerships and reach. Under the proposed agreements, NBC would acquire Sunday night games and wild-card playoffs for approximately $200 million annually, while Netflix would secure Home Run Derby rights for about $50 million per year. ESPN is slated for a new $550 million package, including MLB TV and in-market games for five local teams, plus a midweek national game package. These three-year deals, expiring after the 2028 season, reflect MLB's strategy to diversify beyond traditional TV and engage with streaming platforms amidst declining cable viewership.</p>

          <p>Alphabet shares rose over 3% following reports that Apple is in early discussions to integrate Google's Gemini AI models into an updated version of its Siri assistant, potentially launching next year. This development comes as Google's Gemini models consistently lead AI benchmarks, while Apple has struggled to define its own AI strategy. The potential partnership could mitigate risks to Google's lucrative search deals with Apple, currently under antitrust scrutiny. Apple is reportedly exploring multiple AI collaborations, including with Anthropic and OpenAI, as it seeks to enhance its Apple Intelligence framework with advanced conversational and multimodal AI capabilities.</p>

          <p>The Rev Martin Smyth, a former Ulster Unionist Party (UUP) MP and Grand Master of the Orange Lodge during the Troubles, has died at the age of 94. Smyth, a Presbyterian minister, served as MP for South Belfast after winning a by-election in 1982. He was a leader of "unwavering principle and determination" and a "stalwart of the Orange cause," according to the Grand Orange Lodge of Ireland. UUP leader Mike Nesbitt noted Smyth's significant, though often behind-the-scenes, influence in local politics, describing him as a conservative and staunch figure who commanded immense respect within the unionist community.</p>

          <p>House Democrats have introduced a new bill aiming to establish clear legal thresholds for advanced chips that would require congressional approval before export to China. The proposed legislation specifies benchmarks for processing performance, memory speeds, and interconnect speeds that would trigger a review, targeting chips deemed too advanced for unrestricted sale. This initiative seeks to prevent China from using cutting-edge chips to fuel surveillance, military modernization, and influence campaigns, addressing national security concerns. The bill faces an uphill battle to pass both the Republican-led House and Senate without bipartisan support.</p>

The move follows Trump's earlier criticism of Intel's CEO regarding ties to China and his administration's broader strategy to boost domestic chip production and maintain a technological lead over China.

          <p>This opinion article argues that Hong Kong can establish a crucial role in climate resilience within the economically dynamic Greater Bay Area (GBA), which faces increasing risks from extreme weather. With a population of over 86 million and a GDP of $2 trillion, the GBA's integration means climate disruptions in one area can cascade throughout the region. The article proposes developing a cross-border early warning platform and implementing common infrastructure standards, similar to the EU's Copernicus service, to safeguard trade and investment. Investing in resilient infrastructure is presented as an economic strategy, with every dollar spent potentially yielding four dollars in benefits.</p>
