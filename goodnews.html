          <p>An NYU Stern School of Business professor suggests that job seekers can cut through corporate platitudes by asking one specific question during an interview: "What kind of person should not work at this company?" This question often elicits honest, unrehearsed answers that reveal a company's true values regarding work-life balance, collaboration, and workplace environment. The article advises asking this question near the end of the interview process, after an offer is made, to avoid defensiveness. The goal is to help individuals find a job that aligns with their personal values, which many people struggle to articulate clearly.</p>

          <p>With many high-interest certificates of deposit (CDs) opened in 2023 and 2024 now maturing, savers face a changed economic landscape with lower available rates. This article advises accountholders to act strategically to continue maximizing their returns in a climate of anticipated interest rate cuts. Key recommendations include preventing automatic rollovers into lower-yield accounts, actively shopping for the best available rates, particularly at online banks, and considering long-term CDs to lock in current rates for several years. This proactive approach can help savers navigate the shifting interest rate environment effectively. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>A recent study published in Frontiers in Psychology suggests a possible connection between diet and dream quality, with some participants reporting that dairy products led to worse sleep and nightmares. The research, based on surveys of over 1,000 college students, found that 22% of those who felt food affected their dreams attributed nightmares to dairy. The study's authors theorize this could be linked to gastrointestinal distress from lactose intolerance disrupting sleep. While acknowledging potential biases, the findings support the notion that food-induced physical symptoms during sleep can negatively impact the dreaming experience.</p>

          <p>According to the mortgage lender Nationwide, UK house prices fell by 0.8% in June, marking the most significant single-month decline since February 2023. This drop may be a reflection of weaker demand following recent changes to stamp duty tax thresholds, which made property purchases more expensive for many. Despite the monthly fall, the annual growth rate stood at 2.1%, though this is the slowest pace in nearly a year. Economists suggest this market softness is likely temporary, expecting activity to rebound due to supportive factors like low unemployment and potential future interest rate cuts.

          <p>With over 100 million Americans facing a collective $220 billion in medical debt, this article outlines several potential avenues for relief. One primary option is hospital charity care, as federal law requires nonprofit hospitals to offer free or discounted care to patients who meet certain income criteria based on federal poverty levels. For those who don't qualify, debt settlement with a debt relief company can reduce balances, though it may impact credit. As a final resort, filing for Chapter 7 or Chapter 13 bankruptcy can eliminate or reorganize overwhelming medical and other unsecured debts.</p>

          <p>California Governor Gavin Newsom has signed a major bill overhauling the California Environmental Quality Act (CEQA), a landmark 1970s environmental law. The governor and other housing advocates argue that the law, while well-intentioned, has become a significant bureaucratic obstacle to building much-needed housing in the state. Newsom had made the CEQA overhaul a condition for signing the state budget, framing it as an essential step to address California's severe housing shortage and homelessness crisis. The move was passed despite opposition from some environmental groups who are concerned about weakening protections.</p>
