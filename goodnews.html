          <p>After a 16-year hiatus, the band Oasis launched their highly anticipated reunion tour with a performance in Cardiff, Wales. The Gallagher brothers, Noel and Liam, put aside their long-standing feud to play a set of their classic 1990s hits to a crowd of 70,000 enthusiastic fans. The concert was widely praised for the band's rejuvenated energy and Liam Gallagher's powerful vocal performance, with many considering it their best form since their mid-90s peak. The show's success has set a positive tone for the remainder of their sold-out tour dates across the UK.</p>

          <p>British tennis player Emma Raducanu has been eliminated from Wimbledon after a hard-fought third-round loss to world number one Aryna Sabalenka. Despite a strong performance that pushed the top seed, Raducanu ultimately fell in straight sets, 7-6, 6-4, on Centre Court. The 22-year-old showed significant improvement and resilience, even leading in the second set before Sabalenka mounted a comeback. While a difficult loss, Raducanu's competitive play against a three-time Grand Slam champion signals a positive trajectory for her career.</p>

          <p>China's ambition to lead Global South-based organizations like the Shanghai Cooperation Organisation (SCO) and Brics is facing challenges from India. Both alliances operate on a consensus model, which gives India significant leverage to block or influence outcomes. This dynamic was evident at a recent SCO defense ministers' meeting where a joint statement was not adopted due to a lack of consensus on language related to terrorism, a key issue for India. This highlights how India's strategic positioning within these groups can act as a check on China's efforts to dominate the agenda.</p>

          <p>A cardiologist with over two decades of experience treating heart disease has shared a list of five common food types he considers potentially harmful and does not feed his children. The list includes microwave popcorn due to bag linings and flavorings, flavored yogurts for their high sugar content, and processed meats like bacon and deli meats because of preservatives and nitrates. He also advises against sugary cereals and drinks, as well as deep-fried foods, which can promote inflammation. The doctor advocates for healthier alternatives like air-popped popcorn and unprocessed proteins.</p>

          <p>The technology IPO market is showing signs of life after a prolonged downturn, sparked by the successful public offering of crypto company Circle. The firm's stock has surged since its debut, creating a multi-billion dollar return for its venture capital backers and boosting confidence in the market. After a near-standstill in public offerings since early 2022, June 2025 saw an uptick in tech IPOs. While caution remains, investors are hopeful that this momentum signals the beginning of the end of the "liquidity drought" for venture-backed companies. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>In a recent interview, filmmaker Ken Burns described the American Revolution as one of the most important events in world history because it introduced the novel concept of a "citizen." He argued that before this, people were merely subjects under a ruler, and the revolution "turned the world upside down" by establishing a government based on the idea of unalienable rights. Burns emphasized that the greatness of America comes from telling its full, complicated stories, including the flaws of its founders and the struggles of marginalized groups.</p>

          <p>A provision within the newly passed "big, beautiful bill" creates a new federal tax deduction for tipped workers, a move President Trump has framed as "no tax on tips." The legislation allows workers like waiters and bartenders to deduct a portion of their tip income, thereby lowering their federal tax liability, though other taxes still apply. However, critics note the tax break is temporary, expiring in 2028, and will not benefit the lowest-earning tipped workers who already have no federal income tax liability to begin with.
