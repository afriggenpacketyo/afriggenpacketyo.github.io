          <p>Cambodia has allowed warships from multiple nations, including Vietnam, Japan, and Russia, to access its Ream naval base, signaling an inclusive approach to regional security and dispelling notions of it being solely a Chinese outpost. This move aligns with China's vision of an inclusive regional security framework, as expressed during President Xi Jinping's Southeast Asian tour. China has outlined a new security doctrine emphasizing peaceful dialogue and resolving disputes through sovereign states directly concerned, particularly in the South China Sea. For this vision to foster lasting trust, China needs to prioritize openness, consistency, and multilateral engagement.</p>

          <p>Newark Mayor Ras Baraka, arrested for trespassing at a federal immigration facility, defended his actions during a gubernatorial debate, asserting he did not interfere with law enforcement. Baraka stated he attended a press conference, not a protest, and that Homeland Security escalated the situation by making arrests. Other gubernatorial candidates expressed varying levels of support for Baraka's actions, with some suggesting he was invited in and did nothing wrong. The arrest occurred amidst calls for access to the privately-run detention facility, with Baraka emphasizing the need for the facility to obey local laws and respect constitutional rights.</p>

Appointed as the first postwar U.S. ambassador to Vietnam in 1997, Peterson sought accountability for missing Americans and fostered a new diplomatic relationship, emphasizing openness and transparency.

          <p>Gold prices have surged by over 40% in the past year, reaching an all-time record due to factors like unpredictable US trade policies and geopolitical uncertainty, prompting investors to seek a stable asset. Central banks have also been net buyers of gold, adding to their official reserves, especially since 2022. While gold is considered a safe haven, it is not immune to price fluctuations, with past surges followed by significant falls. Experts suggest the upward trend may continue, but caution that a market bubble could be forming, advising investors to diversify their portfolios. (not investment advice)</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Doctors and researchers are debating who should take GLP-1 drugs, effective for weight loss but expensive and with side effects. The article argues that the primary goal should be health changes, not just weight changes, as these drugs reduce visceral fat, linked to metabolic diseases. Identifying individuals with excess visceral fat is crucial, using waist size and blood-lipid patterns as indicators, rather than solely relying on BMI. The FDA's guidelines and clinical trials still use BMI, despite its limitations, highlighting the need for a better diagnostic test for insulin resistance to determine appropriate treatment with anti-obesity medications.</p>

          <p>Japan is seeing a boom in gold investment amid heightening concerns over a global economic slowdown caused by U.S. President Donald Trump's hefty tariffs. The benchmark price of gold set by Tokyo's Tanaka Precious Metal Technologies Co. hit an all-time high in yen terms on April 22, exceeding 17,000 yen ($115) and surging around 15 percent in the three months since Trump took office on Jan. 20. Among investment trusts, the inflows to the Mitsubishi UFJ fine gold fund that reflects gold prices totaled some 19.2 billion yen in March, up by about 2.6-fold from last December.
