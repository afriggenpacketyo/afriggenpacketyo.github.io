          <p>Two-time Super Bowl champion Eli Manning shared a humorous story about his mentorship of New York Giants rookie quarterback Jaxson Dart, who also attended Ole Miss. After offering to help the rookie with football-related matters or adjusting to the new city, Manning was surprised by Dart's first request. Instead of seeking advice on plays or housing, Dart called Manning to ask for a reservation at a highly exclusive five-star restaurant. Manning good-naturedly declined, stating that securing tough dinner reservations was not part of their mentorship deal and that such perks must be earned.</p>

        </div>
        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>The UK's Liberal Democrat party has proposed a novel solution to the country's persistent asylum backlog, suggesting the use of the Civil Contingencies Act. This act, typically reserved for national emergencies and wartime, would be invoked to establish temporary "Nightingale processing centres" and rapidly double the number of asylum caseworkers. The party argues this emergency measure is necessary to clear the backlog, reduce the costly reliance on hotels for housing asylum seekers, and create a more humane system. The plan also includes ending the ban on asylum seekers working while their claims are processed.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>The S&P 500 and Nasdaq indexes achieved multiple all-time closing highs this week, driven by the Federal Reserve's decision to cut its benchmark interest rate by a quarter-point. This marks the first rate reduction since last December, with central bankers signaling the possibility of two additional cuts in the coming year. The market also saw significant movement in individual stocks, with cybersecurity firm CrowdStrike surging after a positive outlook and Apple's stock jumping on favorable demand for its newly released iPhone 17 models. Nvidia also saw gains after announcing a strategic partnership with Intel. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>Peter and Barbie Reynolds, an elderly British couple detained by the Taliban in Afghanistan since February, have been released and have returned to the United Kingdom. The couple, who had lived and run a charitable training program in Afghanistan for nearly two decades, were reunited with their daughter in Doha, Qatar, before flying to London's Heathrow Airport. The Taliban stated the couple had broken Afghan laws but never specified the charges, releasing them after judicial proceedings. Their family expressed immense gratitude for the diplomatic efforts, particularly the "vital role" played by Qatar in securing their release.</p>

          <h2>Trump Administration Intervenes to Prevent U.S. Steel Plant Closure Using New Powers</h2>

          <p>The Trump administration has utilized new "golden share" rights to block U.S. Steel from shutting down its plant in Granite City, Illinois, which would have affected nearly 800 workers. These rights, a condition of the recent $14.1 billion takeover by Japan's Nippon Steel, grant the White House veto power over major strategic decisions like plant closures. After Commerce Secretary Howard Lutnick warned the company the administration would not permit the closure, U.S. Steel reversed its decision. This marks the first use of these powers and highlights the administration's increasing direct intervention in the private sector.</p>

          <p>In a recent interview, Monica Lewinsky reflected on her journey from being the subject of international scorn in the 1990s to becoming an anti-bullying activist and producer. She described her decision to re-enter the public eye in 2014 as a way to become a "poster child for having survived shame," inspired by the tragic suicide of Tyler Clementi. Lewinsky noted a significant cultural shift, crediting younger generations for re-evaluating her story with a focus on the power imbalance involved. She also discussed how movements like #MeToo provided new language and context for understanding past events.</p>

          <p>Chinese President Xi Jinping and U.S. President Donald Trump held a nearly two-hour phone conversation described by both sides as productive and constructive. The call has sparked hopes for increased stability in bilateral relations, which have been strained by issues like trade and tensions over Taiwan. Following the discussion, Trump announced plans to meet with Xi at the upcoming APEC summit in South Korea and to visit China early next year.

          <p>A growing number of American students are choosing to pursue higher education abroad, driven by the high cost of U.S. universities and domestic political turmoil. Data shows a significant increase in U.S. students studying overseas over the past five years, with applications to UK universities alone rising 14% this year. For many, the lower tuition fees in Europe, averaging around $9,000 per year, present an affordable alternative to mounting student debt in the U.S. Others cite concerns over the political climate and safety as key factors in their decision to seek an international education.</p>

          <p>A massive 1,000-pound American bomb from World War II was discovered at a construction site in Hong Kong's Quarry Bay district, prompting the evacuation of approximately 6,000 people. Police bomb disposal experts conducted a delicate, multi-hour operation to successfully defuse the device without any injuries. The discovery is a stark reminder of the city's history, as it was a target of Allied air raids during the Japanese occupation. Such unexploded ordnance from the war continues to be found periodically in Hong Kong and across Europe, requiring large-scale safety measures.</p>
