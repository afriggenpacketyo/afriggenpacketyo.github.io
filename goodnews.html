          <p>South Korea's military has observed North Korea taking down some of its propaganda loudspeakers along their shared border. This action follows South Korea's own removal of speakers, a move initiated by the new liberal government to de-escalate tensions. The psychological warfare, which included blasting K-pop and critical messages, has been a significant source of friction between the two nations. These developments occur ahead of upcoming large-scale U.S.-South Korea military exercises, which could potentially reignite tensions in the region.</p>

          <p>A small meteorite that crashed through the roof of a home in McDonough, Georgia, has been analyzed by a University of Georgia geologist and found to be 4.56 billion years old. This makes the space rock approximately 20 million years older than our planet. The rock, which left a dent in the homeowner's floor, is believed to be from a large asteroid that broke up 470 million years ago in the belt between Mars and Jupiter. Scientists plan to officially name it the McDonough Meteorite, marking it as the 27th meteorite recovered in Georgia.</p>

          <p>Four astronauts from the Crew-10 mission have safely returned to Earth, splashing down in the Pacific Ocean off the coast of San Diego after a five-month stay on the International Space Station. The crew, consisting of two NASA astronauts, a Japanese astronaut, and a Russian cosmonaut, traveled aboard a SpaceX Crew Dragon capsule. This landing marks the first time a NASA-sponsored crew has splashed down in the Pacific, a change made by SpaceX to ensure discarded hardware lands away from populated areas. During their mission, the astronauts conducted over 200 scientific experiments.</p>

De Gea, who left United two years ago after 545 appearances, was given a standing ovation by the crowd of over 60,000, providing a farewell he was not afforded at the time of his departure. The match ended in a 1-1 draw, with Manchester United winning the subsequent penalty shootout 5-4. The event reignited discussions among fans about the club's decision to replace the veteran goalkeeper.</p>

          <p>An abandoned 19th-century college campus in Brooklyn's Bedford-Stuyvesant neighborhood has been redeveloped into a 205-unit luxury apartment building called The Hartby. Developers secured a 99-year ground lease for the site of the former St. John's College, which had been deteriorating for decades. The $104 million project preserved many of the building's historic architectural elements while adding modern amenities and a new wing. Of the 205 units, 62 are designated for affordable housing, with market-rate rents ranging from approximately $3,100 to $6,950 per month.</p>

          <p>According to nutrition experts, specific foods can provide key nutrients to support skin health and maintain a youthful appearance. Foods rich in vitamin C, like sweet potatoes and orange juice, are recommended for promoting collagen synthesis, which helps keep skin firm. Edamame contains isoflavones that may reduce wrinkles, while the lycopene in tomatoes can protect against sun damage. Additionally, the omega-3 fatty acids in salmon, the zinc in pumpkin seeds, and the probiotics in kefir all contribute to skin hydration, healing, and protection.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>William Bengen, the financial advisor who developed the famous "4% rule" for retirement withdrawals, has new advice for today's retirees. He argues that due to better portfolio diversification, many retirees can safely withdraw more, suggesting a rate closer to 5.25% to 5.5% for current retirees. His original research in the 1990s established 4.15% as a conservative baseline for a 30-year retirement, but he has since refined his model. Bengen emphasizes that inflation is the greatest enemy of retirees and that his original number represented a worst-case scenario. (not investment advice)</p>
