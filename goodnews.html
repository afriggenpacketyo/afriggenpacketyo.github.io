        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>The United Kingdom is set to formally recognize a Palestinian state, a major foreign policy shift intended to maintain the viability of a two-state solution to the Israeli-Palestinian conflict. Prime Minister Keir Starmer had previously set a deadline for Israel to take substantive steps toward peace, including a ceasefire in Gaza, before the UK would change its long-held position. This decision aligns the UK with a growing number of European nations and over 140 UN member states that already recognize Palestine. The move has been welcomed by the Palestinian Authority but criticized by Israel and the United States, who argue it rewards terrorism.</p>

          <h2>Opinion Piece Argues for Empathy to Counter Rising Societal Hate and Division</h2>
          <div class="timestamp">2025-09-21 05:00:38 EDT</div>
        </div>
        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>In an era of increasing political polarization and hostility, a recent opinion piece reflects on the critical need for empathy to preserve democratic societies on both sides of the Atlantic. The author uses personal experiences with racism and references recent acts of violence to argue that a deficit of empathy is fueling a culture of cruelty and othering. Drawing on the teachings of Martin Luther King Jr. and Rabbi Jonathan Sacks, the article posits that love and understanding are the only forces capable of overcoming hate. It calls for empathy to become a public practice, urging accountability for leaders who foster division and advocating for grace over grievance.</p>

          <p>UK Justice Secretary David Lammy announced that 10,000 additional prison officers will receive protective body armor as part of a £15 million funding increase aimed at improving safety within the nation's jails. The initiative, which also includes 500 Tasers for trained staff, follows several high-profile attacks on officers, including one allegedly involving Manchester Arena bomb plotter Hashem Abedi. Lammy stated the investment is intended to restore order and provide frontline staff with the necessary tools to perform their duties safely. The move has been welcomed by critics who argue that officers have been left vulnerable for too long.</p>

          <p>After a difficult start to 2025 that saw its stock fall 32%, healthcare giant UnitedHealth Group (UNH) showed strong signs of recovery in August. The company's struggles were attributed to rising medical costs and leadership changes, but a significant investment from Warren Buffett's Berkshire Hathaway helped restore investor confidence. With a new strategy to increase premiums and control costs using AI, alongside a solid 2.5% dividend yield, the article suggests the stock may be undervalued. It posits that the current dip could represent a favorable entry point for investors looking for long-term value. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>Lucy Guo, a 30-year-old self-made billionaire who dropped out of Carnegie Mellon University, recommends that aspiring entrepreneurs spend at least one to two years in college. Despite leaving her studies to accept a Thiel Fellowship and co-founding Scale AI, Guo emphasizes that higher education is invaluable for building a network of talented peers. She argues that college provides a unique environment with a high concentration of intelligent people who are open to forming friendships, which can later become a crucial hiring pool. This network, she believes, is one of the most significant assets a founder can have when building a company.</p>

The Trojans' potent rushing attack, led by Waymond Jordan's 157 yards, ultimately secured the victory. USC now faces a challenging stretch of games against ranked opponents in the Big Ten.</p>

          <div class="timestamp">2025-09-21 01:15:55 EDT</div>
        </div>
        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Top Premier League clubs Arsenal and Manchester City are increasingly adopting a more direct, long-ball style of play, a tactical shift from the short-passing, possession-based approach they are known for. This evolution is seen as a response to the prevalence of high-pressing defenses, which make building from the back riskier. By utilizing goalkeepers with strong distribution skills to launch long passes, often targeting tall forwards in wide areas, teams can bypass the press, gain territory, and create unpredictable attacking opportunities. This tactical adaptation demonstrates how elite managers are evolving to counter common defensive setups and maintain a competitive edge.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>As several Western nations, including the UK and France, move to recognize a Palestinian state, the practical impact of this diplomatic gesture is being widely debated. While largely symbolic, proponents argue that recognition elevates Palestine's standing in international negotiations, strengthening its position for a future two-state solution. However, critics, including some Palestinian advocates, dismiss it as performative politics that fails to address the immediate realities of occupation and conflict. The article suggests that for recognition to be effective, it must be followed by concrete actions, such as economic pressure on Israel, to halt settlement expansion and advance a tangible peace process.</p>
