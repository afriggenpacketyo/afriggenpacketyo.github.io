          <p>Following a period of extreme heat, wind and rain are moving across the UK, bringing milder temperatures. The Met Office forecasts a fresher Sunday with scattered showers, and a weather front arriving from the west on Monday evening. Saturday saw the hottest day of the year, with temperatures reaching 33.2C in Charlwood, near Gatwick, and an amber heat health alert remains in place until Monday morning. The coming week is expected to be more unsettled with rain and sunshine, though eastern parts of England may experience some very warm weather at times.</p>

          <p>Fred Smith, the founder of FedEx Corp., passed away at the age of 80, leaving behind a legacy of revolutionizing the express delivery industry. Starting in 1973, FedEx transformed package delivery by offering faster service than the postal service, and Smith's leadership turned the company into a global transportation and logistics giant. A Marine Corps veteran, Smith attributed his business acumen to his military experience and created a delivery system based on coordinated air cargo flights centered on a main hub. His company also played a major role in the shift by American business and industry to a greater use of time-sensitive deliveries and less dependence on large inventories and warehouses.</p>

          <p>South Korea is set to join the global race to develop sixth-generation fighter aircraft, according to a senior aerospace executive. Korea Aerospace Industries (KAI) indicated that technologies showcased at the Paris Air Show, including 4.5-generation fighters and unmanned aerial vehicles, would be key elements in the transition. This move positions South Korea alongside countries like China and the United States, who are also pursuing sixth-generation fighter programs. KAI's display included the KF-21 Boramae fighter jet, FA-50 light combat aircraft, and next-generation unmanned combat aircraft, highlighting its focus on crewed-uncrewed teaming.</p>

          <p>The author, who has never owned a smartphone, reflects on the changing reactions people have had to this fact over time, from disbelief and disdain to fascination and envy. The author believes they have avoided the worst effects of smartphone addiction, such as a short attention span and social atrophy. The author also touches on the downsides of not having a smartphone, such as getting lost and missing out on group chats. The author describes witnessing people engage in self-abasing activities on their phones, a devitalized substitute for some real-life activity, and incredibly demoralizing, at least in the eyes of a phoneless naif.</p>
