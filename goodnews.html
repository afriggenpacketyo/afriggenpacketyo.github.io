          <p>The United States appears to be making significant progress in combating the drug overdose crisis, with provisional figures showing a record drop in overdose deaths in 2024. Some 27,000 fewer Americans died of a drug overdose in 2024 than in 2023, the steepest single-year decline since record-keeping began 45 years ago. The biggest factors behind the decline include the growing availability of naloxone and the use of telehealth to access addiction treatment. The article notes that the Trump administration‚Äôs draft budget proposes major cuts to naloxone distribution, which could take the most potent tool for stopping overdose deaths out of the hands of those who need it most.</p>

          <p>The Trump administration is reportedly considering significant policy changes to expand access to in vitro fertilization (I.V.F.), including requiring insurers to cover the procedure. Aides have discussed declaring I.V.F. an ‚ÄúEssential Health Benefit‚Äù under the Affordable Care Act and pushing Congress to mandate private insurance coverage for infertility treatments. The White House has been consulting with fertility experts and conservative policy groups, though one leading medical society says it has been shut out of the process. The move comes amid concerns about declining U.S. birthrates and follows Trump's earlier support for protecting I.V.F. access after an Alabama Supreme Court ruling.</p>
