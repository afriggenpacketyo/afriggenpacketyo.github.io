          <p>A preliminary magnitude 4.1 earthquake struck Tennessee on Saturday morning, with tremors felt in Atlanta, Georgia, and western North Carolina. According to the U.S. Geological Survey, the earthquake originated about 12 miles from Greenback, Tennessee, which is south of Knoxville. Residents reported feeling the shaking, and while earthquakes are not uncommon in the region, this event reminded many of a similar quake in 2018.

          <p>CNBC's Investing Club addresses the question of whether retirees should remain in the stock market, advising that pulling out entirely may not be the best approach. Jim Cramer suggests staying the course with good stocks to avoid missing upside recoveries, while tailoring a strategy to individual risk tolerance and liquidity needs. The article also explains the terms 'risk on' and 'risk off,' describing how investor sentiment and economic factors influence market behavior.

          <h2>Cardinal Vincent Nichols Describes Peaceful Conclave to Elect Pope Leo XIV</h2>

          <p>Cardinal Vincent Nichols, the leader of the Roman Catholic Church in England and Wales, described the conclave to choose the new Pope as an 'immensely peaceful' experience. Nichols was one of 133 cardinals sealed off from the world in the Vatican's Sistine Chapel, ultimately electing Pope Leo XIV. He noted the absence of 'rancour' or 'politicking' and found the process calm and prayerful. Confiscation of mobile phones provided more time for reflection, and he learned patience throughout the process. He also noted everyone was peaceful and just wanting to do this well.</p>
