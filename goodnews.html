          <h2>Understanding the Development of Sexual Orientation</h2>
          <div class="timestamp">2025-05-26 08:33:00 EDT</div>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>This article explores the complex interplay of biological and psychosocial factors that influence the development of sexual orientation, emphasizing that it is not a choice but rather a stable aspect of identity formed during puberty. Experts highlight that no single factor determines sexual orientation, with research focusing on genes, hormones, and sociocultural influences. The piece underscores the importance of societal acceptance and support for individuals, particularly during adolescence, to foster self-esteem and prevent mental health issues, while also dispelling myths about conversion therapies and the notion of sexual orientation as a disease. It reinforces that human sexuality is diverse and that judging individuals based on their sexual orientation is unjust. </p>

          <p>Southwest Airlines is ending its long-standing "two bags fly free" policy, marking a significant shift for the company and its customers. Starting Wednesday, passengers will have to pay to check their bags, aligning Southwest with other major airlines that already charge baggage fees. This change comes as Southwest introduces other modifications to its business model, including the elimination of open seating and the debut of basic-economy tickets. The decision to start charging for checked bags reflects the industry trend of generating revenue through ancillary fees, as baggage fees brought in nearly $7.3 billion for U.S. airlines last year.</p>

          <p>Anthropologists and scholars are working to decipher the khipus, knotted cords used by the Inca empire to record information, in hopes of unlocking the lost history of the Andean people. The khipus, some of which are being kept secret by village elders, could provide insights into the Inca's advanced civilization, which spanned 25,000 miles of roads and included advanced calendars and surgical techniques. Deciphering the khipus requires linguistic flair, statistical savvy, and deep cultural knowledge, but recent breakthroughs and collaborative efforts are revitalizing the field. The article details the efforts of Sabine Hyland, who is working with villagers in Jucul, Peru, to unravel the mysteries of these ancient artifacts.</p>

          <p>Marcel Ophuls, the German-born filmmaker known for his powerful documentaries that challenged conventional narratives about World War II, has died at the age of 97. His most famous work, "The Sorrow and the Pity," debunked the myth of widespread French resistance to the Nazi occupation by interviewing ordinary citizens who collaborated or turned a blind eye to the persecution of Jews. Although controversial, the film paved the way for revisionist historical accounts of wartime France. Ophuls also directed "H√¥tel Terminus: The Life and Times of Klaus Barbie," which won an Academy Award.</p>

Macron himself addressed the incident, calling reports overblown and explaining that he and his wife were simply joking around. The incident occurred as Macron began a Southeast Asian tour to promote France as a reliable alternative to the U.S. and China.</p>

          <p>Five years after anti-police protests, initiatives aimed at improving officer mental health are gaining traction, spurred by the exacerbated stress and resignations following the killing of George Floyd. Law enforcement agencies are implementing wellness programs, including peer support teams, mental health debriefings, and dedicated wellness rooms, to help officers cope with job-related trauma. States are also mandating and funding wellness initiatives, while organizations like Valor Station offer specialized treatment for first responders. These efforts aim to reduce the stigma of seeking help and promote a culture of mental wellness within law enforcement.</p>

          <p>This article explores the idea of recognizing the aliveness of nature, challenging the traditional separation between living beings and inanimate matter, particularly in the context of climate change. Drawing on insights from indigenous cultures and the Rights of Nature movement, the author emphasizes the importance of acknowledging the interconnectedness of all things. Robert Macfarlane's book, "Is a River Alive?", is discussed as a means to unlearn damaging distinctions and appreciate the active role of natural elements in shaping our world. The piece advocates for humility and a willingness to blur the lines between humans and the natural environment.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Despite concerns about democratic erosion during Donald Trump's second term, the United States possesses several exceptional traits that protect it from a complete unraveling. A robust network of advocacy groups, a powerful and independent judiciary, a difficult constitutional amendment process, a diverse and free press, a federal system of government, and strong speech protections all contribute to this resilience. These features empower resistance and check executive power, making it harder for a leader to consolidate authoritarian control. These aspects of American society make the system worth defending.</p>
