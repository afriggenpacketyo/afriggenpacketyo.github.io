          <p>The UK government is implementing new regulations to oversee the rapidly growing "buy now, pay later" (BNPL) sector, aiming to protect consumers from potential debt traps. These rules will require BNPL firms to conduct upfront checks to ensure borrowers can repay their debts and facilitate easier access to refunds. City Minister Emma Reynolds stated that the measures are designed to address a sense of a 'wild west' in the BNPL space. Consumers will also have the ability to escalate complaints to the Financial Ombudsman.</p>

          <p>Presidential elections in Romania and Poland saw centrist parties holding off hard-right nationalist challenges, though discontent with mainstream parties remains. In Romania, Nicusor Dan, a centrist mayor, defeated George Simion, a hard-line nationalist, while in Poland, Rafal Trzaskowski, a liberal mayor, secured a spot in a runoff against Karol Nawrocki, a nationalist historian. The article notes that the results reflect a broader trend of voters moving away from established parties, potentially leading to future political instability. The article also highlights the involvement of figures like Donald Trump and Viktor Orban in supporting nationalist candidates.</p>

          <p>China is implementing stricter regulations to curb wasteful spending among party and government bodies, focusing on projects with little value, official vehicle use, lavish meals, and extravagant meeting venues. The new rules, jointly issued by the Communist Party Central Committee and the State Council, emphasize frugality and diligence, urging officials to avoid extravagance. Observers have described this round of tightening as the most detailed and stringent since the austerity campaign began 12 years ago. This move reflects Beijing's growing concern over mounting debts and aims to prevent wasteful spending at various government levels.</p>

          <p>Drinks giant Diageo, the maker of Guinness and Johnnie Walker, anticipates US trade tariffs will cost the company approximately $113 million annually. This is due to a 10% tariff on UK and European imports into the US imposed by President Donald Trump. Diageo is implementing a cost-cutting plan to mitigate about half of the tariff's impact on profits and is seeking further measures to offset the remaining costs. The company also launched a $375.6 million cost-saving program to support investments and improve its financial leverage.</p>

          <p>Domestic energy prices in the UK are forecast to decrease in July, marking the first drop in regulator Ofgem's price cap in a year. Analysts at Cornwall Insight predict that the typical household's annual energy bill will fall by ¬£129, a nearly 7% decrease. This would result in a typical annual bill of ¬£1,720 for a dual-fuel customer paying by direct debit, down from the current level of ¬£1,849. While this decrease is welcome, experts note that prices remain significantly higher than they were at the start of the decade.</p>
