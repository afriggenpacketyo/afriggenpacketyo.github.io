        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>South Korean semiconductor firm SK Hynix has announced record-breaking operating profit and revenue for the second quarter, significantly exceeding market expectations. This financial success is primarily driven by the robust and sustained demand for its high bandwidth memory (HBM) chips, which are essential components for artificial intelligence technologies used by companies like Nvidia. The company expressed confidence in continued strong demand for the remainder of 2025, citing stable customer inventories and the launch of new AI products. SK Hynix's performance has positioned it to challenge Samsung's long-held dominance in the global memory market. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>The iconic Mexican band Los Bukis received a star on the Hollywood Walk of Fame, an honor they dedicated to the immigrant community in the United States. During the ceremony, frontman Marco Antonio Solís delivered an emotional speech in Spanish, acknowledging the struggles and contributions of immigrant workers, especially during what he called "times of adversity." The event, which also featured speeches from actor Demián Bichir and comedian Gabriel Iglesias, celebrated the band's 52-year legacy. Solís's recognition makes him the only Hispanic artist to have two separate stars on the Walk of Fame, one for his solo career and now one with his band.</p>

          <h2>Federal Appeals Court Rules Trump's Birthright Citizenship Executive Order is Unconstitutional</h2>
          <div class="timestamp">2025-07-23 22:06:15 EDT</div>
        </div>
        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>A U.S. Court of Appeals for the 9th Circuit has ruled that President Trump's executive order aimed at curtailing birthright citizenship is unconstitutional. In its decision, the court stated the order contradicts the plain language of the Fourteenth Amendment, which grants citizenship to all persons born in the United States. The Trump administration argued the amendment's jurisdiction clause excludes children of undocumented immigrants, an interpretation the court rejected as unmoored from established legal principles. This ruling upholds a lower court's block on the policy, marking a significant legal setback for the administration's immigration agenda.</p>

          <h2>Rafael Devers Expresses Surprise Preference for Playing Defense with Giants</h2>

          <p>San Francisco Giants' Rafael Devers made his debut at first base and shared a surprising admission following the game. After being adamant about serving exclusively as a designated hitter with his former team, the Boston Red Sox, Devers stated he prefers playing a defensive position. He explained that being on the field keeps him more active and prevents him from overthinking his at-bats. This contrasts sharply with his stance earlier in the year when he reportedly shut down the idea of a position change while in Boston, making his new role and positive attitude a welcome development for the Giants.</p>

          <h2>Bipartisan House Resolution Aims to Halt Plan to Cull Barred Owl Population</h2>

          <p>A bipartisan group of lawmakers has introduced a House resolution to stop a federal plan to shoot approximately 450,000 barred owls in the Pacific Northwest over the next 30 years. The controversial plan, approved by the U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service, is intended to protect the rapidly declining northern spotted owl, which is being outcompeted by the more aggressive barred owl. Proponents of the resolution, led by Rep. Troy E. Nehls, argue the culling is inhumane, unworkable, and a waste of taxpayer money. However, some scientists and conservation groups warn that halting the plan will likely lead to the extinction of the spotted owl.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>South Korea's economy expanded by 0.6% in the second quarter compared to the previous one, narrowly avoiding a technical recession. The growth, which surpassed economists' expectations, was primarily driven by a strong performance in exports, particularly for semiconductors and petroleum products, as firms reportedly expedited shipments ahead of potential U.S. tariff adjustments. Despite the positive quarter, analysts remain cautious about the future, citing that weakening global trade and domestic consumption challenges could hinder sustained growth for the rest of the year.

          <p>The United States has concluded new trade deals with Indonesia and the Philippines, establishing a 19% tariff on imports from these nations while ensuring American exports face no duties. Analysts suggest these agreements are part of a broader U.S. strategy to reshape regional supply chains and indirectly counter China's economic influence, particularly by tapping into the region's rare earth mineral reserves. However, some economists note that Chinese firms are already ahead of this strategy by increasingly localizing their production within Southeast Asian countries. This makes them less reliant on the transshipment routes that these new trade dynamics aim to influence. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>The U.S. housing market is showing signs of a slight shift, though it remains a challenging environment for many prospective buyers. According to real estate experts, an increase in housing inventory is providing some relief, with 34% more sellers than buyers nationally in May. However, median home sale prices continue to hit record highs, driven by a lack of incentive for current homeowners with low interest rates to sell. The market varies significantly by location, with some cities in Texas and Florida favoring buyers, while areas in New Jersey and New York remain strong sellers' markets. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>NASA has successfully launched a pair of identical satellites, known as TRACERS, designed to study the interaction between the solar wind and Earth's magnetic field. The mission aims to provide a better understanding of "space weather," the dynamic conditions in space that can disrupt GPS signals, damage satellites, and even affect power grids on the ground. The twin spacecraft will fly in tandem, allowing for precise measurements of how energy from the sun couples with Earth's magnetosphere. This research is considered critical for developing predictive models to help protect vital technological infrastructure and astronauts in space.</p>

The roster is a blend of veteran experience, like quarterback Matthew Stafford, and young stars such as Puka Nacua and Jared Verse. However, concerns include Stafford's current back soreness, which is limiting his participation, and uncertainty at the offensive tackle position due to injuries and health issues. Other areas to watch are the cornerback group, which was not reinforced in the offseason, and the ongoing contract negotiations with star running back Kyren Williams.</p>

The Dodgers had initially led thanks to Shohei Ohtani's record-tying fifth consecutive game with a home run, but the bullpen faltered in the eighth inning, giving up the lead.
