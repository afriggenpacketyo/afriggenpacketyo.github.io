        </div>
        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Declining water levels at Iraq's largest reservoir, the Mosul Dam, have led to the discovery of approximately 40 ancient tombs. The unearthing occurred in the Khanke region of Duhok province as a result of a severe, multi-year drought plaguing the country. Archaeologists believe the tombs date back over 2,300 years to the Hellenistic or Hellenistic-Seleucid period. While the drought has had devastating effects on agriculture and electricity, it has provided a rare opportunity for excavation, with teams now working to preserve the artifacts before water levels rise again.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>A federal appeals court has ruled that former President Donald Trump exceeded his presidential powers by imposing widespread tariffs under the International Emergency Economic Powers Act (IEEPA). The 7-4 decision found that the law does not grant the president unlimited authority to implement tariffs, deeming the measures "unbounded in scope, amount and duration." The ruling voids the tariffs but has been stayed until October 14 to allow the administration time to appeal to the Supreme Court. The decision creates significant uncertainty for Trump's trade agenda and could lead to the refunding of billions in collected import taxes.</p>

          <p>The Utah Supreme Court has stayed the execution of Ralph Leroy Menzies, a 67-year-old inmate diagnosed with severe dementia who was scheduled to be executed by firing squad. His attorneys argued that his cognitive decline renders him unable to understand the reason for his execution, a standard protected by the U.S. Supreme Court. The court ruled that a lower court must re-evaluate Menzies's competency, acknowledging the suffering of the victim's family but emphasizing the need to adhere to the rule of law. Menzies was convicted for the 1986 abduction and murder of Maurine Hunsaker.</p>

His routine includes regular social interaction to reduce stress, engaging in lifelong learning by reading on unfamiliar subjects, and using a color-coded organizational system for tasks. He also emphasizes the importance of daily physical activity, such as swimming and walking, to increase blood flow to the brain. Finally, he maintains a healthy, nutrient-rich diet, ensures proper hydration, and gets at least seven hours of sleep each night.</p>

          <p>Jamie, Ewan, and Lachlan Maclean, three brothers from Scotland, have set a new world record by completing the fastest unsupported row across the Pacific Ocean in 139 days. They journeyed over 9,000 miles non-stop from Peru to Cairns, Australia, becoming the first team to row the full distance from South America to Australia. Throughout their voyage, they endured severe weather and personal challenges while successfully raising over £700,000 for clean water projects in Madagascar. The previous record for this challenging feat was 160 days, set by a solo rower in 2014.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>A new ranking from The Princeton Review identifies Princeton University as the private college delivering the best return on investment (ROI) in the United States. Despite a high sticker price, Princeton's generous financial aid brings the average cost down significantly, and graduates earn a median income of over $110,000 a decade after attending. The list, which also includes institutions like Caltech and MIT, highlights how elite private schools with large endowments can offer substantial aid, often through "no-loan" policies. This financial support allows students to graduate with less debt, contributing to a stronger long-term financial outcome compared to many public universities.</p>

It curates several past stories that explore this formative period of life, from lessons learned at reunions to the changing parent-child dynamic when a student leaves for school. The piece acknowledges that the round-the-clock culture of togetherness and frivolity is a beloved and largely unchanged feature of college. It frames college as a crucial time when young people make friends, make mistakes, and prepare for the wider world.</p>

          <p>Activist investment firm Elliott Management has taken a significant position in Rexford Industrial Realty, a REIT focused on the Southern California industrial warehouse market. Despite Rexford's prime portfolio, its stock has underperformed, trading at a discount to its net asset value, which Elliott attributes to poor corporate governance, bloated expenses, and misaligned management interests. Elliott, known for driving change at such companies, is expected to advocate for better capital allocation and governance, potentially pushing for a strategic review or even a sale of the company. The move has put Rexford in play, attracting attention from potential strategic and private equity buyers. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>A pastor from North Carolina who collapsed while wrapping Christmas presents has made a remarkable recovery after being diagnosed with AL amyloidosis, a rare and serious condition that caused his heart to become "hard as cement." After a major cardiac arrest, weeks on life support, and a dire prognosis, his doctors advocated for him to receive a dual heart and kidney transplant. The successful surgeries were followed by a difficult recovery, but eighteen months later, he shows no signs of organ rejection. He has since returned to his pulpit and even participated in a 5K run at the hospital that saved him.</p>

          <p>Indian cuisine in the United States is undergoing a transformation, moving beyond "cheap food and curry houses" to sophisticated, upscale dining experiences that are attracting significant diner and investor attention. Restaurants like Bungalow in New York City are seeing reservations sell out in seconds, driven by a growing interest in hyper-regional Indian flavors that go far beyond stereotypical dishes. This trend is fueled by younger consumers' "quest for flavors" and a growing, affluent Indian American population. As a result, private equity firms are now investing in the sector, signaling a shift that could see Indian fine dining rival established French and Italian cuisine.</p>

        </div>
        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>A new executive order from President Donald Trump directs federal officials to prosecute flag-burning whenever possible, calling the act "uniquely offensive." However, this article argues that the order is legally toothless and likely to backfire. The Supreme Court has twice ruled, in 1989 and 1990, that flag-burning is a form of protected speech under the First Amendment. While flag-burners can be charged under content-neutral public burning laws, the order's explicit focus on the message behind the act could provide defendants with a strong "selective prosecution" defense, making convictions even more difficult to secure.</p>

          <p>Major coffee chains like Costa Coffee are facing challenges as the beverage preferences of younger generations shift towards trendy, non-traditional drinks like matcha. Newcomers such as Blank Street Coffee have gained a cult following on social media with their colorful matcha creations, attracting Gen Z and Millennial customers who view such drinks as an affordable luxury. Analysts suggest that legacy brands are caught in the middle, not being as cheap as fast-food coffee nor offering the unique, high-end experience of artisanal shops. This market shift, combined with cost-of-living pressures, has put established chains in a difficult position, with Costa's owner reportedly exploring a sale.</p>
