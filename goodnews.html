          <p>David Beckham and Gary Neville have finalized their takeover of Salford City, acquiring the remaining shares from their Class of '92 teammates. Nicky Butt, Ryan Giggs, Paul Scholes, and Phil Neville are no longer shareholders but will continue to contribute to the club in various roles. Beckham expressed pride in joining the ownership group as they embark on the next chapter for Salford, which achieved four promotions in five seasons after the Class of 92's arrival in 2014, but has since remained in League Two. The Ammies narrowly missed a playoff spot in the recent season, finishing eighth.</p>

          <p>President Trump announced the framework of a trade agreement with the United Kingdom, the first deal since the implementation of 'reciprocal' tariffs. The agreement maintains a 10% tariff on UK imports but adjusts tariffs on UK autos, allowing 100,000 vehicles to be imported annually at a 10% rate, with additional vehicles facing a 25% rate. The deal also aims to create new export opportunities for U.S. farmers and streamline customs procedures. Some experts downplayed the deal's impact, noting that this approach may not be replicable with countries having larger trade surpluses with the U.S.</p>

          <p>Holly LaFavers of Lexington, KY, received 22 boxes containing 50,600 lollipops after her 8-year-old son, Liam, mistakenly ordered them from Amazon while planning a carnival for his friends. Initially facing a $4,200 charge, LaFavers was advised by Amazon to reject the shipments, but most had already been delivered. After a Facebook post about the incident gained traction, Amazon eventually issued a refund. LaFavers decided to donate the lollipops to local charities, schools, and churches, with Spangler Candy Co. even inviting her and Liam to visit their factory.

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>The US and the UK have reached an agreement regarding tariffs on certain goods traded between the two countries. While President Trump's 10% tariff on imports remains in place for most UK goods, the agreement reduces or removes tariffs on specific exports, including cars, steel, and aluminum. Car tariffs are cut to 10% for up to 100,000 UK cars annually, with a 27.5% tax on additional vehicles. The 25% tariff on steel and aluminum imports has been scrapped, benefiting industries like British Steel. Pharmaceuticals remain a key area for future negotiation, and the UK's digital services tax remains unchanged, with plans for a digital trade deal.</p>

          <p>At the Milken Institute Global Conference, financial leaders expressed a mix of anxiety and optimism regarding financial markets and the economy. While some CEOs voiced concerns about volatile markets and trade tensions, others were optimistic about technology, cost-cutting, and the overall direction of the economy. Despite a recent stock market recovery, uncertainty remains, with some skeptics suggesting fund managers are projecting a positive outlook to reassure investors. Concerns were also raised about the role of the dollar as the world's reserve currency and the potential impact of trade deficits on the government's debt.</p>

          <p>Bill Gates announced he will double his charitable giving to $200 billion over the next 20 years, motivated by global challenges and Andrew Carnegie's views on wealth. The Gates Foundation, already having given away over $100 billion, will close at the end of 2045 after Gates has given away "virtually all" of his wealth. Despite this increase, Gates noted that philanthropy cannot compensate for the multibillion-dollar cuts in foreign aid by wealthy countries. He expressed concern over whether the world's richest countries will continue to support its poorest people.</p>

        </div>
        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>A House of Lords committee heard that home working has led to a bigger decline in after-work drinking in city centers outside London. Urban economist Paul Swinney stated that while pub spending data suggests post-work drinks have shifted from Friday to Thursday in London, this trend is not seen in other large British cities. Spending in bars outside London is more likely to shift into the weekend, and the decline in city-center spending has not been matched by an increase for high streets outside urban centers. The data shows that 32% of weekly pub spending in big cities outside London now takes place on a Saturday.</p>

While CFO Jeff Hoffmeister acknowledged the tariff uncertainty, he stated that the expiration of de minimis is not expected to have a "meaningful impact" on Shopify in the near term. The company noted that consumers who purchase from Shopify businesses tend to be higher income and less price sensitive, helping to insulate merchants from potential market swings. Shopify is actively monitoring data to support its merchants and adapt to any arising changes.</p>
