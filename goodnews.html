        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>The U.K.'s Competition and Markets Authority (CMA) has officially designated Google's search and search advertising services with "strategic market status," activating new regulatory powers. This move follows a nine-month investigation concluding that Google holds "substantial and entrenched market power," with over 90% of U.K. searches on its platform. While not a finding of wrongdoing, the designation allows the CMA to impose new conduct requirements later this year, potentially mandating fairer search rankings and greater publisher control over content. Google expressed concern that the interventions could inhibit innovation and slow product launches in the U.K.</p>

          <p>A ceasefire between Israel and Hamas commenced at noon local time, with the Israel Defense Forces (IDF) repositioning troops along newly established deployment lines. This action initiates the first phase of an agreement that includes the release of all remaining Israeli hostages within 72 hours in exchange for over 1,000 Palestinian prisoners. As part of the deal, more humanitarian aid is scheduled to enter the Gaza Strip. To support and monitor the agreement, the U.S. Central Command is establishing a coordination center in Israel with 200 service members, who will not be deployed into Gaza.</p>

The remaining contenders include current Fed officials Michelle Bowman and Christopher Waller, former economic advisor Kevin Hassett, former Fed Governor Kevin Warsh, and BlackRock's Rick Rieder. Bessent is reportedly seeking a candidate open to new ideas on monetary policy and willing to address perceived mission creep at the Fed. The final nominee may first be appointed as a Fed governor before being elevated to chair to secure a full 14-year term. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>A Colorado pastor's act of compassion for a pizza delivery driver who brought the wrong order has gone viral, leading to a successful fundraiser. After the driver, Suzanna, apologized for the mix-up, Pastor Neal Seiwert and his family prayed with her on their porch for her well-being, a moment captured by a Ring camera. The video gained millions of views on social media, prompting the Seiwerts to start a GoFundMe campaign for Suzanna with her permission. The fundraiser quickly surpassed its $25,000 goal, demonstrating a widespread positive response to the family's gesture of kindness and faith.</p>

          <p>A provision from the Secure 2.0 Act is set to alter how high earners make 401(k) catch-up contributions, eliminating a popular tax break. Beginning in 2026, workers who earned more than $145,000 in the previous year will be required to make their catch-up contributions to an after-tax Roth account, rather than a traditional pretax one. This change removes the upfront tax deduction for these contributions, though withdrawals in retirement will be tax-free. Financial experts advise that affected savers should consult with advisors now to plan their contribution strategy for the coming years. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>The Knight First Amendment Institute, an organization affiliated with Columbia University, has secured a major legal victory against the Trump administration over the detention of pro-Palestinian students. A federal judge ruled that the detention and attempted deportation of Columbia student Mahmoud Khalil and others was unconstitutional and designed to suppress free speech. The ruling highlights a stark contrast between the institute's defiant defense of constitutional principles and Columbia University's more conciliatory approach, which recently included a settlement with the administration over antisemitism claims. The case has positioned the Knight Institute at the forefront of legal challenges to the administration's actions regarding campus speech.</p>

          <p>Ecuador's national soccer team is preparing for the 2026 World Cup with high expectations following a resilient and successful qualifying campaign where they finished second in South America. Under new coach Sebastián Beccacece, the team has developed a formidable defensive identity, conceding only five goals throughout the entire qualification process. This strategy is built on the talent of a new generation of stars, many of whom have emerged from strong domestic youth academies and now play in top European leagues. As they prepare for friendlies against the U.S. and Mexico, the team aims to prove they can make a deep run in the tournament.</p>

          <p>The Nobel Peace Prize for 2025 has been awarded to Venezuelan opposition leader María Corina Machado for her persistent efforts to promote democratic rights in the face of an authoritarian regime. The Norwegian Nobel Committee praised Machado as a "brave and committed champion of peace" who has led the struggle for a peaceful transition to democracy in Venezuela. The committee's announcement highlighted a global trend of democracy being in retreat and stressed that democratic principles are a fundamental precondition for lasting peace.

          <p>The Los Angeles Dodgers have advanced to the National League Championship Series after defeating the Philadelphia Phillies, despite their offense not yet reaching its full potential. Key players like Shohei Ohtani had a quiet series, and the team batted just .199 overall, winning primarily due to strong pitching performances. Manager Dave Roberts and players acknowledged that the team has "another gear" and can play much better, particularly on offense. This resilience and ability to win without hitting on all cylinders is seen as a testament to the team's battle-tested nature as they move deeper into the postseason.</p>

          <p>The European Commission is demanding information from four major U.S. tech platforms—Apple, Google, Snapchat, and YouTube—over concerns about insufficient child protection. The EU executive branch suspects that age restrictions are too easily circumvented, algorithms may cause addiction, and minors can access inappropriate content like gambling apps or drugs. This inquiry falls under the Digital Services Act (DSA), which requires platforms to ensure high levels of safety for minors. If the Commission finds an infringement, it could open formal proceedings and impose fines of up to 6% of a company's global turnover.</p>

The 62-year-old star, currently competing on "Strictly Come Dancing," underwent a hysterectomy and radiation therapy, finishing her treatment in late 2024. Kingston stated she had initially dismissed symptoms like bloating and aches as signs of aging before seeking medical help after a more serious symptom appeared. She is now urging other women not to ignore signs of ill health, explaining that her diagnosis inspired her to participate in the dance show because "life is too short."</p>

After his death, O'Brien inherited the stone, which she used as a garden decoration and forgot when she sold the house in 2018. The new owners, an anthropologist and her husband, identified the object's significance, and it is now being repatriated to its original museum in Italy.</p>

She described the situation in Broadview as calm and the military presence as an unnecessary overreaction.

          <p>Amid a divisive social climate, the legacy of composer Leonard Bernstein's musical memorials to President John F. Kennedy provides a model for collective grieving and national healing. Bernstein famously conducted Mahler's "Resurrection" Symphony on national television just two days after JFK's assassination in 1963, a legendary act that riveted the nation. He later wrote his "MASS" to open the Kennedy Center in 1971, a work that initially shocked audiences but is now seen as a masterpiece that transcends genre. These works demonstrate how music can address the essence of grief and cherish existence without engaging in political division.</p>

          <p>The Israel Defense Forces (IDF) have started pulling back troops from positions in the Gaza Strip as part of a newly brokered ceasefire agreement. The withdrawal, which began Friday morning, is the first step in a deal that requires the IDF to reposition to an agreed-upon boundary, leaving them in control of just over half of the territory. Following this 24-hour repositioning, Hamas has 72 hours to release all remaining living hostages. The deal also includes the release of hundreds of Palestinian prisoners and has drawn statements of support from international bodies like the Red Cross and potential peacekeepers like Turkey.</p>
