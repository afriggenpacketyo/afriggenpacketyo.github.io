          <p>Samsung has announced a major $16.5 billion chip supply deal with an undisclosed partner, providing a significant boost to its foundry business. The contract, effective from July 2024 to the end of 2033, has sparked speculation about the client, with analysts suggesting Qualcomm or Tesla as possibilities. This long-term agreement is a critical development for Samsung's 2-nanometer chip production, although the company's recent earnings forecasts have been weak due to struggles in capturing AI-related demand compared to competitors.

          <p>Authorities in Shenzhen, China's tech hub, have implemented new rules to encourage innovation by offering leniency to researchers whose state-funded projects fail. The policy states that if mistakes are made without misconduct or abuse of power, individuals and institutions should not be penalized or have their future funding applications hindered. This move aims to foster a culture of bold exploration and risk-taking, recognizing that failures can occur due to technical hurdles, market shifts, or the need to explore novel technologies.</p>

          <p>European leaders have responded to the new trade deal with the United States, which sets a 15% tariff on most EU goods, with a mixture of relief and reservation. Italian Prime Minister Giorgia Meloni called the agreement "positive" for ensuring stability, while German Chancellor Friedrich Merz noted it preserved fundamental interests by avoiding a worse outcome. However, Dutch Prime Minister Dick Schoof acknowledged that "no tariffs would have been better," reflecting a sentiment that while a trade war was averted, the new terms represent a compromise for Europe.</p>

          <p>Five Eastern Caribbean nations are experiencing a significant increase in demand for their "citizenship by investment" programs, which allow individuals to gain a passport by purchasing property. Estate agents and migration experts report that a majority of recent applicants are from the U.S., citing political volatility and other domestic concerns as motivating factors for seeking a "plan B" citizenship. While providing vital revenue for the islands, the programs have drawn scrutiny from the EU and US over security and transparency concerns.</p>

          <p>The United States and the European Union have reached a significant trade agreement, establishing a 15% baseline tariff on most EU goods and preventing a wider trade war. The deal was announced by President Donald Trump and European Commission President Ursula von der Leyen after negotiations in Scotland. As part of the agreement, the EU has committed to increasing its purchases of U.S. energy and investing heavily in the U.S., though a punitive 50% tariff on steel will remain in place. The pact brings stability to the €1.4 trillion transatlantic trade relationship. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>An investigation led by journalist Miriam Lewin and photographer Giancarlo Ceraudo successfully tracked down a Skyvan PA-51 airplane used by Argentina's military dictatorship for "death flights." By analyzing the plane's flight logs, found in the U.S., they were able to prove its use in the 1977 disappearance of a group of activists and nuns, providing crucial evidence for a landmark human rights trial. The plane has now been returned to Argentina and is displayed at the former ESMA detention center, serving as a tangible witness to state-sponsored terror.</p>
