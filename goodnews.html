          <p>Following the start of a ceasefire between Israel and Hamas, U.S. Admiral Brad Cooper, head of Central Command (CENTCOM), visited Gaza to discuss post-conflict stabilization. Cooper emphasized that while the U.S. will assist in peace efforts, no American troops will be deployed on the ground in the territory. The visit is part of a broader U.S.-led plan that includes establishing a Civil-Military Coordination Center and deploying a multinational task force composed mainly of troops from Arab and Muslim nations to help enforce the ceasefire.</p>

          <p>This opinion article describes a rally for New Jersey Republican gubernatorial candidate Jack Ciattarelli in Wildwood, highlighting an atmosphere of grassroots enthusiasm reminiscent of events held by Donald Trump and Charlie Kirk. The author notes that attendees were energized by issues like energy prices, taxes, and crime, but also by a broader sense of community and a desire to "take New Jersey back." The piece argues that such in-person, festive gatherings are a powerful tool for the GOP, fostering a sense of hope and shared purpose among voters that translates into broader political momentum.</p>

          <p>Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy reported having a "very productive" phone call with U.S. President Donald Trump, urging him to help broker peace in the war with Russia. Zelenskyy expressed hope that if peace can be achieved in other regions, it can also be achieved in Ukraine, and he discussed bolstering Ukraine's air defense capabilities. This conversation marks a significant warming of relations between the two leaders, who previously had a tense public meeting. Trump has recently expressed support for Ukraine's ability to win back its territory from Russia.</p>

          <h2>Analysts Credit Donald Trump's Pressure as Key Factor in Israel-Hamas Peace Agreement</h2>

        </div>
        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Panelists on "Washington Week With The Atlantic" discussed the recent peace agreement between Israel and Hamas, attributing its success largely to pressure from U.S. President Donald Trump. ABC News' Jonathan Karl argued that Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu, who has built his career on understanding American politics, recognized his fundamental need for U.S. support. As American sentiment has shifted, Trump's direct pressure on Netanyahu was a critical factor in bringing the parties together to end the war in Gaza. Trump is reportedly preparing to visit the Middle East following the breakthrough.</p>

          <p>According to BlackRock's Jay Jacobs, a significant trend in 2025 is investors moving away from traditional, broad technology sector funds and into more specialized, granular ETFs focused specifically on artificial intelligence. This shift reflects a desire to gain targeted exposure to the entire AI ecosystem, from semiconductor manufacturers like Nvidia to companies developing large language models. Jacobs also highlighted strong investor interest in blockchain technology, particularly around Ethereum, as another disruptive theme attracting capital. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>As part of a U.S.-brokered ceasefire deal, Hamas is insisting that Israel include prominent Palestinian prisoners, such as Marwan Barghouti and Ahmad Saadat, in an upcoming prisoner exchange. Israel's justice ministry published a list of 250 prisoners to be freed but excluded these key figures, who are viewed by many Palestinians as symbols of resistance. This disagreement could potentially complicate or delay the release of 20 Israeli hostages from Gaza. The exchange is a critical first step in the multi-phase peace plan designed to end the two-year war.</p>

          <p>The Welsh political party Plaid Cymru has announced a plan to offer trainee teachers payments of up to £30,000 if they commit to working in Wales for five years. The proposal, unveiled at the party's annual conference, is designed to address a teacher recruitment crisis by making Welsh incentives competitive with those in England. The focus would be on attracting teachers for priority subjects like math and science, as well as those who can teach in the Welsh medium. The party estimates the policy would cost around £6-7 million annually.</p>
