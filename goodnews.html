          <p>The National Football League and ESPN have entered into a nonbinding agreement for ESPN to acquire several of the league's media properties, including the NFL Network and NFL Fantasy. As part of the deal, the NFL would receive a 10% equity stake in ESPN, which is preparing to launch a direct-to-consumer streaming service. The agreement would see the NFL Network integrated into ESPN's platform, while ESPN would also gain distribution rights for the RedZone channel. The deal, which still requires final negotiations and regulatory approval, is seen as a strategic move to enhance ESPN's content offerings and further the NFL's revenue goals.</p>

The potential deal would allow current and former employees to sell their shares, with existing investor Thrive Capital possibly leading the round. This valuation marks a significant increase from its $300 billion valuation in March, reflecting strong growth as its flagship product, ChatGPT, approaches 700 million weekly active users. The company's annual recurring revenue is projected to exceed $20 billion by the end of the year, underscoring its dominant position in the generative AI market. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>A new national poll indicates that a significant portion of Latino voters who supported Donald Trump in 2024 may not vote for Republican congressional candidates in the 2026 midterm elections. The survey, conducted by Equis, found that only 27% of respondents would vote for a Republican candidate, a sharp drop from the 45% who reported voting for Trump. A quarter of those polled were undecided or would not vote Republican, signaling a potential challenge for the GOP, which is counting on sustained Latino support. The poll also revealed growing disapproval of Trump's job performance and a belief among many Latinos that neither political party truly cares about them.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>The California Department of Corrections and Rehabilitation has announced the planned closure of a state prison in Norco, Riverside County, by fall 2026. The decision is attributed to a significant decline in the statewide inmate population and is expected to save the state $150 million annually. The facility currently houses nearly 2,800 inmates and employs approximately 1,200 staff, who the state will attempt to reassign. The closure reflects a broader trend driven by criminal justice reforms and falling crime rates, with advocates hoping the savings will be reinvested into community-based safety and prevention programs. The future of the historic property, once a luxury resort, remains undecided.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>A debate is underway among Chinese economists regarding whether to include measurable consumption targets in the country's next five-year plan. Proponents argue that setting a benchmark for the household consumption rate, which was a low 39.6% of GDP in 2023, could be a key national indicator to stimulate domestic demand. However, other influential thinkers contend that such metrics are not practical as policy goals. This discussion is part of a broader effort by Beijing to find effective strategies to boost consumer spending and rebalance the economy away from its traditional reliance on investment and exports.

          <p>Los Angeles Dodgers rookie pitcher Roki Sasaki is showing significant signs of recovery after a shoulder impingement sidelined him early in the season. The Japanese phenom, who had an underwhelming start to his MLB career, has been progressing through a throwing program and is expected to begin a minor-league rehab assignment soon. The Dodgers are encouraged by adjustments he has made, including adding a two-seam fastball to his repertoire and improving his command. While his return is not critical to the team's immediate success, a healthy and effective Sasaki could provide valuable pitching depth as a starter or reliever for their postseason push.</p>

          <p>Meta, the parent company of WhatsApp, announced it has disabled 6.8 million accounts linked to global scams in the first half of this year. Many of these accounts were connected to criminal centers in Southeast Asia that often use forced labor to carry out fraudulent activities, such as fake investment schemes. The announcement coincided with WhatsApp rolling out new anti-scam features, including alerts when a user is added to a group chat by an unknown contact. This crackdown targets the growing tactic of hijacking accounts to promote scams, with Meta working to proactively detect and shut down these operations before they can harm users.</p>

          <p>A massive copper mining project in Afghanistan, backed by a state-owned Chinese company, is reportedly making significant progress toward beginning extraction this year. The Mes Aynak mine, which holds one of the world's largest untapped copper deposits, was awarded to the China Metallurgical Group Corporation (MCC) in 2008 but has been stalled for 17 years due to security issues and the presence of ancient archaeological remains. The Taliban-led government has announced a switch to more costly underground mining to help preserve the historical sites. The project's advancement signals a potential economic development for Afghanistan, though concerns about its implementation linger.</p>

          <p>A federal judge in Boston has issued a temporary injunction preventing the Trump administration from reallocating over $4 billion in FEMA disaster relief funds. The ruling came in response to a lawsuit from 20 states arguing that the administration unlawfully terminated the Building Resilient Infrastructure and Communities (BRIC) program and redirected its funding without congressional authority. The judge found that the transfer could cause "irreparable harm" to flood-prone areas that rely on the program for mitigation projects. The injunction temporarily halts the repurposing of the funds while the court further considers the states' legal challenge.</p>

          <p>A new COVID-19 variant, known colloquially as "Stratus" or XFG, is spreading in the United States and has become the third most prevalent strain. The variant, a combination of two other subvariants, accounted for 14% of U.S. cases in late June, up from nearly zero in March. The World Health Organization has placed XFG on its watchlist but assessed its global public health risk as "low," advising that current vaccines should remain effective against severe disease. While there is no evidence of more severe illness, common symptoms are consistent with previous Omicron variants, including cough, sore throat, and fatigue.</p>

          <p>Newly released FBI data reveals that crime in the United States decreased in every major category during 2024, continuing a downward trend from the spike seen after the COVID-19 pandemic. According to the annual Unified Crime Report, violent crime fell by an estimated 4.5%, with murders dropping by nearly 15%. Property crime also saw a significant 8.1% decrease, which included a record 18.6% one-year drop in motor vehicle thefts. While experts find the numbers promising, they note that aggravated assaults remain elevated compared to pre-pandemic levels and that most crimes are never reported to police.</p>

          <p>The Los Angeles County Board of Supervisors has passed a new law requiring landlords in unincorporated areas to ensure their rental units do not exceed 82 degrees. The ordinance, aimed at protecting vulnerable tenants from the health dangers of extreme heat, will take effect next month but will not be enforced until January 2027 to give landlords time to comply. Officials are encouraging the use of passive cooling methods like reflective roofing and blackout curtains over air conditioning. The law will be enforced based on tenant complaints, with the county's public health department focused on education and compliance over issuing fines.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Following a federal court order, U.S. border agents have reportedly been instructed to stop deporting migrants under President Trump's sweeping asylum ban. The policy had effectively closed the asylum system to those crossing the border illegally, but a federal appeals court ruled that the government cannot disregard laws protecting migrants from being sent to places where they could face persecution or torture. This move reopens access to certain humanitarian protections, though not necessarily asylum itself, and halts a key measure the administration credited for a steep drop in illegal border crossings. The Justice Department may still appeal the ruling to the Supreme Court.</p>
