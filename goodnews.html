          <p>Reform UK has made significant gains in recent local elections in England, securing control of multiple councils and winning a key by-election. The Liberal Democrats and Greens have also increased their representation, while the Conservatives have lost control of several councils, managing to retain one mayoral position. Labour retained its mayoralties in Doncaster, North Tyneside, and the West of England. These results reflect a shift in the political landscape and signal potential changes in local governance.

          <p>Amazon founder Jeff Bezos intends to sell up to 25 million shares of Amazon stock over the next year, valued at approximately $4.8 billion. This decision follows Amazon's recent earnings report, which exceeded expectations for profit and revenue but projected lower-than-expected operating income for the current quarter. The sale is part of a trading plan adopted in March. Bezos has previously used Amazon share sales to fund his space exploration company, Blue Origin, and his climate and biodiversity fund.

          <p>Wall Street has rebounded from a sharp sell-off in April, fueled by optimism surrounding potential trade talks between the U.S. and China. The S&P 500 has nearly erased its losses following President Trump's tariff announcements, supported by a positive labor market report. China's commerce ministry expressed willingness to engage in talks if Washington cancels tariffs, easing investor anxiety. Despite the recovery, the S&P 500 remains below its February high, with concerns lingering about the economic impact of Trump's trade policies. Optimism score: 65</p>

          <p>The U.S. government's remedies trial in the Google antitrust case concerning its advertising technology is scheduled to begin on September 22, following a ruling that Google held illegal monopolies in online advertising markets. The judge determined that Google tied its publisher ad server and ad exchange together, enabling it to establish and protect its monopoly power. Google faces increasing competition in the generative AI market from companies like OpenAI and Anthropic. Google argues that its proposed ad tech remedy fully addresses the court's decision, while the DOJ seeks a divestiture of Google's ad tech tools. Optimism score: 60</p>
