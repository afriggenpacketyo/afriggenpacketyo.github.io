          <p>Emma Hayes, the head coach of the United States women's national soccer team, has been inducted into the National Football Museum's Hall of Fame. The former Chelsea manager expressed her enjoyment of the transition to international coaching, comparing it to being a grandparent due to the limited time spent with players. Hayes, who led the US to an Olympic gold medal shortly after taking the role, noted that the position allows her to apply more strategic, long-term thinking, a change she was ready for after a highly successful club career.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>The world transfer record in women's football has been broken five times in 2025, signaling significant financial growth in the sport, particularly in England's WSL and the US's NWSL. While rising fees indicate a healthier economic ecosystem, experts warn it is also widening the competitive and financial gap between the top leagues and others, like Germany's Bundesliga. This rapid commercialization is driven by increased visibility and broadcast deals, but it risks creating a permanent elite tier of clubs that smaller leagues cannot compete with, mirroring trends in the men's game.</p>

          <p>Markets across the Asia-Pacific region traded mixed as investors reacted to the news of the U.S. government shutdown, which seemed to have a limited initial impact on Wall Street. In Japan, the Nikkei 225 continued its losing streak, while business sentiment among large manufacturers saw a slight increase according to the Bank of Japan's Tankan survey. Elsewhere, markets in South Korea and Taiwan posted gains, and India's Nifty 50 rose following the Reserve Bank of India's decision to hold interest rates steady. Markets in mainland China and Hong Kong were closed for a holiday. (not investment advice)</p>

The team's recent ODI form has been inconsistent, but head coach Ben Sawyer maintains they can defeat any opponent on their day and are ready to challenge the top-ranked teams.</p>

          <p>The Reserve Bank of India (RBI) has kept its key policy rate unchanged at 5.5%, a move widely anticipated by economists. The central bank is assessing the effects of previous rate cuts while acknowledging that global trade uncertainties could decelerate growth in the second half of the fiscal year. This decision comes as the Indian government works to mitigate the impact of U.S. tariffs by reducing the goods and services tax (GST) on various items to boost domestic consumption ahead of the festive season.

          <p>James Slipper, Australia's most-capped rugby player, has announced he will retire from international duty following this weekend's Test match against New Zealand. The 36-year-old prop recently earned his 150th cap for the Wallabies, becoming the first player to reach that milestone for the team. Over his distinguished 16-year career, Slipper represented Australia in four World Cups and served as captain on 15 occasions, describing his time in the gold jersey as the proudest achievement of his professional life.</p>

          <p>Pharmaceutical giant AstraZeneca is upgrading its U.S. stock market presence from an American Depositary Receipt (ADR) to a full listing on the Nasdaq. The move is intended to attract a broader base of global investors and improve access to the larger capital pools available in New York. While the company emphasized that its headquarters, primary listing, and tax residency will remain in the U.K., the decision fuels ongoing concerns about major companies shifting away from the London Stock Exchange in favor of U.S. markets.

          <p>Starting Wednesday, supermarkets and other large retailers in England are banned from offering multibuy promotions, such as "buy one, get one free," on food and drink products deemed unhealthy. The government measure, which had been delayed due to the cost-of-living crisis, is aimed at combating rising obesity rates, particularly among children. Public health advocates have welcomed the move as a long-overdue step, arguing that such promotions encourage impulsive over-purchasing rather than providing genuine savings for consumers.</p>

          <p>China has achieved a significant energy infrastructure milestone, with its total network of subsea oil and gas pipelines now extending over 10,000 kilometers. This was marked by the completion of a final pipeline section in Bohai Bay, one of the country's largest offshore oil production bases. The expanding network is a key part of China's strategy to enhance its energy security by tapping into offshore resources. These modern pipelines are also designed with the future capacity to transport green fuels like hydrogen, supporting the nation's energy transition goals.</p>

          <p>In his first year as NATO's Secretary General, former Dutch Prime Minister Mark Rutte has focused on navigating the precarious relationship with the United States under a reelected Donald Trump. His primary challenge has been to maintain U.S. commitment to the alliance while urging European members to increase defense spending. Foreign policy experts have given Rutte generally positive marks for his diplomatic efforts, which included persuading Trump to attend the NATO summit in The Hague. However, his ability to lead the alliance against direct external threats remains a key test for the future.</p>

          <p>To address the frustrating "8am scramble" for appointments, the UK government has mandated that all GP practices in England must offer online booking services throughout the workday, from 8:00 to 18:30. This new rule allows patients to request non-urgent appointments, ask questions, and describe symptoms online for a call back. While many practices already offered this service, the government aims to standardize access, free up phone lines for urgent cases, and modernize the NHS by bringing more of its services into the digital era.</p>

          <p>The Los Angeles Dodgers began their postseason campaign with a dominant 10-5 victory over the Cincinnati Reds in Game 1 of the wild-card series. The offense was explosive, matching a franchise playoff record with five home runs, including two each from Shohei Ohtani and Teoscar Hernández. However, the team's persistent bullpen issues surfaced late in the game, as three relievers struggled in the eighth inning, allowing three runs and turning a blowout into a tense situation. The performance highlighted both the Dodgers' championship potential and their most significant vulnerability.</p>

          <p>A growing number of young Americans are choosing skilled trades over traditional white-collar career paths, driven by concerns over high college tuition costs and the potential for AI to automate entry-level office jobs. Professions like electricians and plumbers are seen as more secure from automation, and the stigma associated with blue-collar work is diminishing. This trend is supported by a survey where 77% of Gen Z respondents indicated the importance of choosing a job that is difficult to automate, reflecting a significant shift in career priorities.</p>
