          <p>A 16-year-old from Essex, named Lincoln, has fully adopted a 1940s lifestyle, from his clothing and music choices to his 1939 bicycle. His passion for the era stems from a childhood interest in the World Wars and an appreciation for the period's sense of community and elegance. For the past two years, he has worked at an antiques shop and a 1940s-themed tea room, where he is adored by customers and his employer for his extensive knowledge and authentic attire. Supported by his family, Lincoln aims to one day own a home decorated entirely with period-appropriate items and appliances, driven by a belief in honoring the sacrifices of that generation.</p>

          <p>Returning to the Hollywood Bowl after a seven-year absence, Colombian music star Juanes delivered a powerful performance and an emotional message to the local Latino community. He addressed the fear and division caused by recent immigration raids under the Trump administration, calling for unity now more than ever. The concert featured songs from his new album "Vida cotidiana" alongside classic hits like "La camisa negra." In a special tribute to Mexican culture, he was joined by a mariachi band to perform classics by Juan Gabriel, reinforcing his deep connection to the city where his U.S. career began.</p>

          <h2>Personal Reflection on Turning 35 Reveals Life's Lack of Clear Answers</h2>
          <div class="timestamp">2025-07-18 00:00:42 EDT</div>
        </div>
        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>In a personal essay, the author reflects on turning 35 and the realization that adulthood does not come with a manual, concluding that most people are simply "winging it." Using the French comedy series "Bref" as a bookend to his own journey as an American immigrant in France, he explores themes of aging, regret, and the process of becoming. The author notes the stark contrast between his personally fulfilling life and a world facing immense political and environmental crises. He concludes that while he lacks definitive answers, he embraces the ongoing process of building a life, much like constructing with Lego bricks or writing a story.</p>

          <p>A farmer in China's Anhui province, identified only as Zhang, has captured local attention by building and successfully operating a homemade 7-meter submarine. Inspired by a television program in 2014, Zhang used 5,000 yuan (US$700) to buy steel plates and an engine, secretly constructing the vessel. Having managed a riverside dock for years, he was always fascinated by boats but felt a desire to create something that could go underwater. His invention fulfills a lifelong dream of building machines, demonstrating a remarkable feat of personal ingenuity and determination in his rural village.</p>

          <h2>Japan's Core Inflation Eases in June Amid Moderating Rice Prices</h2>
          <div class="timestamp">2025-07-17 23:13:45 EDT</div>
        </div>
        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Japan's core inflation rate, which excludes fresh food costs, cooled to 3.3% in June, down from a 29-month high and meeting economists' expectations. The easing was partly attributed to a slight moderation in rice price inflation, which had previously surged. Despite this, inflation has remained above the Bank of Japan's 2% target for 39 consecutive months, and the "core-core" rate, which also excludes energy, edged higher. Economists remain cautious, citing persistent yen depreciation and the potential impact of U.S. tariffs as significant risks to Japan's economic outlook ahead of the upcoming Upper House election.

          <p>German Chancellor Friedrich Merz has acknowledged past European shortcomings in defense spending, stating that Europe has been a "free-rider" on U.S. security guarantees. In an interview with the BBC, Merz affirmed that Germany and its allies now understand the need to increase their own defense contributions in response to the threat from Russia. He emphasized strong coordination with the U.S. on Ukraine and trade, despite President Trump's tariff threats. The comments were made as Merz visited the UK to sign a historic friendship and defense treaty, part of a new "triangular alliance" with the UK and France to bolster European security and economic growth.</p>

          <p>On the fifth anniversary of Congressman John Lewis's death, tens of thousands of people across all 50 states participated in "Good Trouble Lives On" protests against the Trump administration. Organizers planned over 1,500 events, including marches, rallies, and voter registration drives, to honor Lewis's legacy of civil disobedience and advocacy. In Atlanta, marchers gathered at Ebenezer Baptist Church to hear speakers condemn administration policies on civil rights, immigration, and social programs. The nationwide day of action was intended to show widespread opposition to the administration's policies and to carry forward Lewis's fight for justice and voting rights for all Americans.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Netflix has used generative artificial intelligence for on-screen visual effects for the first time in its Argentine science fiction show, "The Eternauts." Co-CEO Ted Sarandos announced that AI was used to create a scene of a collapsing building, completing the sequence ten times faster and at a cost that would have otherwise been unfeasible for the show's budget. He framed the technology as an opportunity to enhance creativity, not just cut costs. The move comes after the use of AI became a major point of contention in the 2023 Hollywood actors' strike, where many expressed fears about the technology replacing human jobs.</p>

          <p>The White House has announced that President Trump, 79, was diagnosed with chronic venous insufficiency (CVI) after noting mild swelling in his lower legs. Press Secretary Karoline Leavitt described CVI as a common and benign vein condition where leg veins struggle to return blood to the heart. This official disclosure aims to address public speculation fueled by images of Trump with swollen legs and a bruised hand, the latter of which was attributed to frequent handshaking and aspirin use. The presidential physician affirmed that Trump "remains in excellent health," as health concerns for both Trump and his predecessor continue to be a focus.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Homeland Security Secretary Kristi Noem has indicated that the Transportation Security Administration (TSA) may soon change its rules regarding liquids in carry-on luggage. Speaking at a conference, Noem said she is questioning "everything TSA does" and that the size limits for liquids could be the next policy to be revised. This follows the recent immediate removal of the requirement for passengers to take off their shoes during security screening. The potential change is linked to the deployment of new CT scanners at airports, which provide more detailed 3D images of bag contents, enhancing security while potentially allowing for less restrictive rules.</p>

          <p>The annual Congressional Women's Softball Game brought together female lawmakers from both parties to play on a unified "Team Congress" against a team of journalists. Unlike the partisan men's baseball game, this event sets aside political divisions to raise money for the Young Survival Coalition, a charity supporting young adults with breast cancer. Co-founded in 2009 by Rep. Debbie Wasserman Schultz, a breast cancer survivor herself, the game has raised nearly $5 million. The event highlights a rare moment of bipartisanship in Washington, with participants and attendees united by the personal and emotional connection to the cause.</p>
