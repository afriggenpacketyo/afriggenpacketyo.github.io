        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Faced with record high rice prices in Japan, supermarket chains like Aeon, Ito-Yokado, and Seiyu are increasing sales of foreign-grown rice, particularly from California and Taiwan, to offer consumers more affordable options. Aeon will begin selling California-sourced rice at a significantly lower price than domestic rice, hoping to increase overall rice consumption by providing consumer choice. U.S. Ambassador to Japan George Glass hailed Aeon's decision as historic for American farmers. The average price of rice at Japanese supermarkets has surged due to a poor harvest in 2023, prompting the government to consider measures to stabilize prices.</p>

          <p>Japan's chief tariff negotiator, Ryosei Akazawa, reported that the United States is increasingly recognizing Japan's economic importance after holding talks with U.S. Trade Representative Jamieson Greer and Commerce Secretary Howard Lutnick. Akazawa emphasized the need to remove additional tariffs imposed on Japan and discussed economic security issues like supply chains. A symbolic development was Trump's approval of Nippon Steel's acquisition of U.S. Steel.

This initiative is in response to mounting criticism over rising rice prices, which have doubled in the past year due to a poor harvest and increased demand from tourism. The government is likely to commence procedures for negotiated contracts and explore online sales to ensure broad distribution. While the move is intended to lower prices, its overall impact remains uncertain given the limited amount of rice in reserve.</p>
