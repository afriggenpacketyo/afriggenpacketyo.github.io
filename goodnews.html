          <p>House Republicans moved forward with President Trump's budget package after overcoming initial resistance from conservatives who felt the spending cuts weren't deep enough. Negotiations between Republican leadership and the conservative holdouts resulted in compromises, leading to a second vote by the House Budget Committee where the bill advanced. Speaker Mike Johnson indicated that minor modifications would be made to the legislation. The bill now moves closer to a floor vote before the Memorial Day deadline, marking a key step in enacting Trump's domestic policy agenda.</p>

          <p>The South Solon Meeting House in Maine holds a unique secret: its interior is covered in 70-year-old frescoes, leading some to call it the "Sistine Chapel of Maine." Painted by artists in the 1950s, the murals depict biblical scenes and have recently gained renewed interest thanks to a website created by Colby College students. The meeting house, built in 1842, serves as a space for community gatherings and artistic events. Artists involved in the original project recall their idyllic time painting the frescoes, which continue to inspire art lovers today.</p>

          <p>Portugal's governing right-of-centre Democratic Alliance has won snap parliamentary elections, marking the third election in as many years. However, the party once again fell short of securing a majority. Leader Lu√≠s Montenegro pledged to stimulate investment and guarantee prosperity and social justice. Socialist leader Pedro Nuno Santos announced his resignation after his party finished in second place, closely followed by the far-right Chega party, signaling a shift in the political landscape.</p>

          <p>Astronomers have discovered a perfectly spherical bubble in the Milky Way galaxy, named Teleios, using a powerful radio telescope. While identified as a supernova remnant, the object's origin is puzzling due to uncertain distance estimates and a lack of expected X-ray emissions. Researchers suggest it could be a Type Ia or Type Iax supernova remnant, but further observations are needed to determine its evolutionary history. The near-perfect symmetry of Teleios also adds to its intrigue, as supernova remnants are typically asymmetrical.</p>

          <p>Nicusor Dan, the liberal, pro-EU mayor of Bucharest, won the Romanian presidential election after a tense race against right-wing nationalist George Simion. Simion initially secured a first-round victory, but Dan ultimately won 54% of the vote, including significant support from Romanians abroad. The election took place amidst political turbulence, including the annulment of a previous election due to claims of Russian interference. Dan campaigned on fighting corruption and supporting Ukraine, while Simion attacked the EU and called for cutting aid to Kyiv.</p>

          <p>GPs in England will begin offering hepatitis C tests to patients who received blood transfusions before 1996, aiming to identify more victims of the contaminated blood scandal. Thousands of individuals may have been exposed to the virus through contaminated blood transfusions in the 1970s, 80s, and 90s. Early detection and treatment with modern anti-viral drugs can eliminate the virus, preventing severe liver damage. The initiative follows reports of undiagnosed cases and aims to address a significant treatment disaster in NHS history.</p>

          <p>According to a senior Asian economist, China‚Äôs yuan has the potential to rival the US dollar as a global currency if Beijing liberalizes convertibility and access for foreigners. The yuan already functions smoothly in cross-border purchase settlements, but deeper financial markets and new yuan-backed asset classes are needed to challenge the dollar's dominance.
