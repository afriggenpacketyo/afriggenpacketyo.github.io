          <p>Dr. Allen Frances, the psychiatrist who chaired the task force for the DSM-IV, states that his work played a role in the 60-fold increase in autism diagnoses. In an interview, he explains that the introduction of Asperger's disorder in 1994 created a much milder and more common form of autism, which, combined with educational incentives and internet self-diagnosis, drove the surge. He emphasized that these factors, not vaccines, are behind the increase and spoke out to counter prevalent conspiracy theories.</p>
