          <p>Consumer goods corporation Procter & Gamble announced fiscal first-quarter earnings and revenue that surpassed Wall Street expectations, largely driven by strong performance in its beauty and grooming divisions. Despite the positive results, the company issued a warning about anticipated higher costs in the upcoming fiscal year due to tariffs. P&G's sales volume remained flat, indicating that price increases, rather than higher demand, contributed to revenue growth. The company maintained its overall financial forecast for the year, signaling confidence in navigating the challenging economic environment. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>The total assets managed by the global hedge fund industry have reached an all-time high of nearly $5 trillion, according to a report from industry tracker Hedge Fund Research. This growth was propelled by the largest quarterly net asset inflow from investors in 18 years, combined with strong investment returns during the third quarter. Industry experts attribute the surge to successful strategies related to M&A activity, technology, and AI, as well as expectations of lower interest rates. The report suggests that institutions will likely continue increasing allocations to navigate ongoing geopolitical and economic uncertainty. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>In an economy marked by persistent inflation, Certificates of Deposit (CDs) are presented as a savings vehicle that can offer returns outpacing the current inflation rate. This article provides an overview of current national average CD yields for various terms, while also highlighting that top rates from online banks are significantly higher. It explains that short-term CDs currently offer better rates than long-term ones due to an inverted yield curve. The text suggests strategies for securing favorable rates, such as comparing online banks and considering a CD laddering approach to balance short-term gains with long-term savings goals.

          <p>Shohei Ohtani's recent performance in Game 4 of the National League Championship Series, where he struck out ten batters and hit three home runs, has temporarily silenced debate about whether he should focus on only hitting or pitching. The article argues that this dominant two-way display is a crucial reminder of his unique talent and the excitement he brings to baseball. While concerns about the physical toll of playing both positions are valid and will likely resurface, his ability to defy conventional wisdom and push the boundaries of the sport is what makes him a generational player. The piece concludes that baseball needs Ohtani's ambition to remain a two-way star.</p>

          <p>Plaid Cymru has achieved a significant victory in the Caerphilly by-election, a traditionally safe seat for the Labour Party, signaling a potential shift in the Welsh political landscape ahead of the next Senedd election. The win suggests Plaid's strategy of focusing on devolved issues and downplaying Welsh independence is resonating with voters looking for an alternative to the UK's Labour government. For Labour, the third-place finish is a deeply concerning result that reflects broader dissatisfaction. Meanwhile, Reform UK's strong second-place showing establishes it as a major political force in Wales, setting the stage for a competitive multi-party environment.</p>

          <p>Philip Pullman's new "Book of Dust" trilogy, a companion to his famous "His Dark Materials" series, delves into the concept of dangerous books and ideas, reflecting on contemporary book-banning controversies. The article explores how Pullman's original series was itself a frequent target of censorship for its critique of organized religion, written as a rebuttal to C.S. Lewis's "Chronicles of Narnia." The new books feature a world where post-truth philosophies cause people to become estranged from their souls, suggesting that certain ideas can indeed be harmful. This theme resonates with current cultural debates over which books and values are appropriate for young readers.</p>

          <p>A court in Turkey has dismissed a corruption lawsuit filed against the main opposition party, CHP, ruling that the case lacked legal merit. The lawsuit had sought to annul the party's 2023 congress, where a new leader was elected, alleging procedural violations and vote-buying. The CHP has consistently maintained that the legal action was a politically motivated attempt by President Erdoğan's government to undermine the opposition using the judiciary. The dismissal is seen as a potential easing of legal pressure on the party, which has faced a crackdown following its success in recent local elections.</p>

          <p>Scientists at the Fort Worth Zoo are leading a critical conservation effort to save the endangered Houston toad from extinction through an assisted reproduction program. By using techniques like hormone injections, ultrasounds, and artificial fertilization, researchers are breeding thousands of toads in captivity to be released into protected habitats. This ambitious project is part of a broader strategy that involves partnering with private landowners, who receive tax incentives for restoring their property to create suitable ecosystems for the toad. The mission represents a hopeful, science-driven approach to recovering a species that has declined by over 90 percent.</p>

          <p>A Chinese geopolitical expert has suggested that China could enhance its military capabilities by learning from the United States' success in integrating civilian technology with defense applications. The researcher, Gu Jianyi, pointed to innovative U.S. firms like SpaceX and Palantir as models for a new industrial ecosystem that leverages Silicon Valley-style innovation and agile development. The article notes that while China has a policy of military-civil fusion, institutional barriers still hinder private enterprises from fully contributing to national defense. Integrating the technological prowess of Chinese companies like Huawei and Tencent could provide a revolutionary boost to the country's military development.</p>

          <p>Zohran Mamdani's campaign to become New York City's first Muslim mayor is presented as the culmination of over two decades of political organizing within the city's Muslim community. In the aftermath of 9/11, young Muslim New Yorkers built grassroots organizations to counter Islamophobia and government surveillance, gradually developing significant political influence. This movement has shifted from reactive crisis management to proactively shaping the city's progressive political landscape. Mamdani's success is attributed not just to his personal skills but to this foundational work, which has mobilized a growing and increasingly influential voter base.</p>

          <p>In response to what they describe as the Trump administration's war on history, a group of professors, journalists, and podcasters are organizing a public teach-in at the Smithsonian National Museum of American History. The event aims to counter efforts to promote a whitewashed, patriotic version of the nation's past and to defend museums and curricula from political interference. Drawing inspiration from the anti-war teach-ins of the 1960s, the organizers seek to provide the public with well-sourced, nuanced historical context. They argue that protecting an honest account of the past is a crucial act of democratic defense against authoritarian tendencies.</p>
