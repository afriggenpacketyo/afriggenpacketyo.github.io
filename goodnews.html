          <p>In the aftermath of devastating floods in Texas Hill Country, Ingram Elementary School has transformed into a vital community resource. Initially serving as a reunification center for families and evacuated campers, the school is now a supply depot organizing donations for affected residents. An interim superintendent highlighted the overwhelming community response, with volunteers working to sort food, water, and toiletries. The effort is focused on providing sustained support for local families long after the initial wave of aid and media attention has moved on, preparing for long-term recovery.</p>

          <p>At a summit in Rio de Janeiro, the BRICS group of emerging economies issued a statement calling for the United Nations to lead the development of global governance for artificial intelligence. The leaders described AI as a major opportunity for growth but warned it could widen the digital divide without fair rules. They stressed the need for technical standards developed with public sector and UN involvement to ensure trust and security. The statement also called for equal access to AI technology for developing nations and promoted open-source collaboration to prevent market barriers.</p>

          <p>Two people were rescued from their SUV by courageous bystanders just minutes before it was engulfed in a massive explosion in Herriman, Utah. The vehicle had crashed into a Domino's Pizza restaurant following a three-car accident, rupturing a natural gas line. Fire authority video captured the subsequent explosion, which completely destroyed the pizzeria and significantly damaged adjacent businesses. The two individuals rescued from the SUV were hospitalized, but no one was inside the building at the time of the blast, and no firefighters were injured by the explosion.</p>

          <p>Firefighting crews are making significant progress against the Madre fire in San Luis Obispo County, the largest wildfire in California so far this year. Favorable weather conditions have helped nearly 1,400 personnel increase containment to 30% on the blaze, which has scorched over 80,000 acres. The fire, which started near New Cuyama, threatens the Carrizo Plain National Monument and has prompted evacuation orders for over 200 people. Officials are hoping to capitalize on the current weather before a projected heat wave arrives midweek, which could create more challenging conditions for firefighters on the ground.</p>

        </div>
        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>The United Kingdom's government is set to amend its Employment Rights Bill to provide a legal right to bereavement leave for parents who experience a miscarriage at any point during a pregnancy. Currently, this entitlement is only available for pregnancy loss that occurs after 24 weeks. Deputy Prime Minister Angela Rayner stated the change will give people necessary time away from work to grieve. The move has been welcomed by advocates and charities as a hugely important step that formally acknowledges the significant impact of early pregnancy loss on parents.</p>

          <p>The UK government plans to offer tax-free payments of £4,500 to early years teachers as an incentive to work in nurseries located in 20 designated disadvantaged areas. This initiative is part of a larger £1.5 billion "Best Start in Life" strategy aimed at boosting educational standards and narrowing the achievement gap among preschool children. Currently, only about one in ten nurseries employs a specialist early years teacher. The government hopes these direct payments will help attract and retain qualified staff where they are needed most, improving outcomes for the youngest learners.</p>
