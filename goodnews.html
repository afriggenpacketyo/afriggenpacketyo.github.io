          <p>FBI Director Kash Patel is scheduled to travel to China to address the flow of precursor chemicals used in fentanyl production, a key part of the administration's strategy to combat the opioid crisis. This diplomatic effort aims to hold China accountable for its role in the U.S. addiction problem and build on previous actions, such as indicting Chinese companies involved in the trade. The visit underscores the administration's focus on international cooperation to disrupt the supply chains that fuel the deadly drug epidemic. President Trump has also indicated he will make fentanyl a primary topic in his upcoming meeting with Chinese President Xi Jinping.</p>

Companies like Kohl's and Academy Sports and Outdoors are adjusting their promotional strategies, expecting customers to seek value and aggregate their purchases around key discount events.

          <p>Germany's women's national football team is one step closer to the UEFA Nations League final after a 1-0 victory against France in the first leg of their semifinal match. Bayern Munich's Klara Bühl scored the decisive goal late in the game, giving her team a narrow advantage heading into the second leg in France. Head coach Christian Wück commended his team's performance but noted their inefficiency in front of the goal, suggesting the victory should have been more decisive. The match was a tense encounter, reprising the rivalry from their dramatic European Championship quarter-final showdown.</p>

          <p>The German company that manufactures the furniture lift used in the recent $102 million jewel heist at the Louvre Museum has launched a humorous advertising campaign capitalizing on the incident. After recognizing their Böcker Agilo machine in news reports, the company's marketing head devised an ad with the tagline, "If you're in a hurry." The campaign, which focuses on the machine's speed and quiet electric motor, has gone viral, garnering millions of views on social media. While the company clarifies it does not condone criminal activity, it decided to embrace the publicity since no one was harmed during the robbery.</p>

          <p>Intel reported a return to profitability in its third-quarter earnings, ending a six-quarter losing streak with strong revenue driven by high demand for its chips. The company's client computing division, which includes PC and laptop chips, saw a 5% year-over-year revenue increase, benefiting from a stabilizing PC market and the rise of AI applications. CEO Lip-Bu Tan highlighted artificial intelligence as a key driver for long-term growth. While the company has improved its cash position, aided by a U.S. government investment, its foundry business remains a work in progress, with revenue declining 2% from the previous year.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>With the Federal Reserve's next meeting on October 29, prospective homebuyers and those looking to refinance are closely watching mortgage interest rates, which are currently influenced by inflation, unemployment, and a potential government shutdown. Although rates have fluctuated, they have generally declined throughout 2025, from an average of 7.04% in January to 6.19% now. There is a high probability the Fed will cut its benchmark interest rate again, which could offer further relief to borrowers. However, rising inflation could complicate future rate cuts, making it a critical time for borrowers to assess their options. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>A fourth Metropolitan Police officer, PC Jason Sinclair-Birt, has been dismissed for gross misconduct after being secretly filmed for a BBC Panorama investigation. A disciplinary hearing found that he gave a false account of using excessive force on a detainee, boasting about the incident to an undercover reporter for what he claimed was "comedic effect." The panel concluded that his actions breached professional standards, even though body-worn camera footage showed he did not use his baton as described. This dismissal follows those of three other officers earlier in the week, all stemming from the same undercover report on police conduct.</p>

          <p>A 13-year-old boy in New Zealand required surgery to remove 80 to 100 high-powered magnets he had ingested, according to a recent medical case report. The magnets clamped together inside his digestive system, forming four chains that caused pressure necrosis, or tissue death, in his bowel and large intestine. The teen, who had experienced abdominal pain for four days, recovered after the operation and was discharged from the hospital. The incident highlights the dangers of these small, powerful magnets, which are banned for sale in New Zealand but remain accessible through online retailers like Temu, where the boy purchased them.</p>

Jeffries' hesitation was notable, given Mamdani's decisive primary victory, and was attributed to concerns over the democratic socialist's progressive policies and rhetoric on Israel. The endorsement came after months of pressure from progressives and two in-person meetings between the two politicians. Jeffries stated he supports Mamdani's focus on affordability and his commitment to being a mayor for all New Yorkers, uniting the Democratic ticket.</p>

Despite claims that he is an investigator on the case, the photographer stated the man was simply a passerby evacuating the area.
