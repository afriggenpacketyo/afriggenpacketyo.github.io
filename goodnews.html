          <p>Quemoy, a Taipei-controlled island just miles from mainland China, serves as a unique case study in cross-strait relations. Once a heavily militarized front line in the conflict, the island has transformed into a quiet community caught between two political systems. On-the-ground interviews reveal the distinct limitations both Beijing and Taipei face in exerting their influence over the island's 130,000 residents. The island's status highlights a complex dynamic where neither side holds complete sway, showcasing a practical boundary to their respective political powers.</p>

          <p>Los Angeles Dodgers star Shohei Ohtani demonstrated his continued recovery as a pitcher by throwing two scoreless innings against the Kansas City Royals. During the outing, he recorded the fastest pitch of his Major League Baseball career, reaching 101.7 miles per hour. Despite his strong performance on the mound, Ohtani went hitless in four at-bats, and the Dodgers' five-game winning streak was snapped in a 9-5 loss. The game highlighted his progress since returning from elbow surgery.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>France has enacted a comprehensive ban on smoking in many public outdoor areas, including beaches, parks, and near schools and swimming pools. The new rules are designed to protect children from the dangers of passive smoking and are part of a broader national strategy aiming for a "tobacco-free generation" by 2032. While e-cigarettes are not included in the ban, violators face fines up to ‚Ç¨700. The policy reflects growing public support for such measures, despite France having one of Europe's higher smoking rates.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>A growing number of local-level civil servants in China are reportedly avoiding dining out due to unpredictable and increasingly stringent local austerity measures. This lifestyle change is prompted by what is known in Mandarin as "ceng ceng jia ma," or the practice of adding extra layers of control, where local rules become even stricter than those mandated by the central government. Officials fear that being seen dining out could attract negative attention during these intensified anti-corruption and austerity campaigns.</p>

Under the voluntary plan, food businesses are encouraged to make healthy food more appealing and accessible through promotions, loyalty point incentives, or by reformulating products. Retailers will report on their sales of healthy food to increase accountability, as part of a broader government strategy to improve public health and relieve pressure on the NHS, which is expected to be detailed next week.</p>

        </div>
        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>This article explains the science behind the "urban heat island" effect, a phenomenon where cities and built-up areas become significantly hotter than surrounding rural landscapes. The primary cause is the prevalence of hard, dark surfaces like asphalt roads and buildings, which absorb and retain the sun's energy instead of reflecting it. This stored heat is slowly released, raising ambient temperatures, especially overnight. As climate change makes heatwaves more frequent and intense, this effect makes growing urban populations particularly vulnerable to extreme heat.</p>
