          <p>U.S. Senator Marco Rubio conducted his first official meeting with the families of the 50 remaining hostages held by Hamas in Gaza. During the meeting in Washington, D.C., Rubio reaffirmed the Trump administration's commitment to securing the release of all captives. The families, including relatives of Omri Miran and Eitan Horn, urged the administration to pursue a single, comprehensive deal for the return of all hostages, rather than phased agreements. They expressed their trust in the government to act with urgency and make brave decisions to bring their loved ones home, stating that the time for partial deals has passed.</p>

          <p>In a significant policy shift driven by a new Trump presidency and the war in Europe, Germany is planning to build the continent's largest military. Chancellor Friedrich Merz announced that Germany will increase its defense spending to 3.5% of its GDP, a move that required a constitutional change to bypass its 'debt brake' for a special $117 billion fund. This decision marks a dramatic departure from Germany's post-war pacifism and aims to meet NATO expectations and address the current geopolitical climate. While defense companies are seeing a surge in business, the nation faces the longer-term challenge of rebuilding a culture of military service.</p>

          <h2>Op-Ed Argues Pride's Spirit Lies in Diversity, Not in Conservative Respectability Politics</h2>

          <p>This opinion column critiques conservative gay figures like Richard Grenell for promoting "respectability politics" that attempt to sideline more flamboyant and gender-nonconforming members of the LGBTQ+ community. The author argues that the history and strength of the gay rights movement are rooted in its diversity, citing the pivotal role of drag queens and transgender individuals at the Stonewall Riots. The piece contrasts Grenell's views with the community's broader voting patterns, which overwhelmingly oppose the Republican party's anti-LGBTQ+ platform. It concludes that the movement's progress has always been driven by a broad coalition, not a narrow, sanitized version of itself.</p>

          <p>Voters in the conservative stronghold of Huntington Beach, California, overwhelmingly passed two ballot measures to protect their public libraries from a MAGA-led city council's influence. The measures successfully blocked a parental review board that would have controlled children's book selections and prevented the privatization of the library system. This victory for the "Protect HB" coalition is being hailed as a significant rebuke of the council's overreach and a potential blueprint for how bipartisan, grassroots efforts can push back against extremist politics. Organizers noted that many conservative voters joined the cause, feeling the council had gone too far in its culture war agenda.</p>

          <p>Jazz saxophonist Kamasi Washington led a massive sonic event to mark the first public entry into the Los Angeles County Museum of Art's new David Geffen Galleries. Over one hundred musicians, spread across nine ensembles, performed an expanded version of Washington's 2018 EP, "Harmony of Difference," filling the still-empty building with music. The event drew parallels to the museum's original 1965 opening, which also featured a landmark musical performance. The unique acoustic properties of the new Peter Zumthor-designed structure created a fluid, immersive soundscape, demonstrating the building's potential as a major venue for performance art in Los Angeles.</p>

The departing pandas include 24-year-old female Rauhin and her three offspring, who are being sent to the Chengdu Research Base of Giant Panda Breeding. The zoo held a farewell ceremony attended by thousands of visitors, marking a temporary end to its successful joint breeding program, which has raised 17 cubs since 1994.

          <p>President Trump's administration navigated a momentous week, securing key victories while facing unresolved challenges on multiple fronts. A significant win came from a Supreme Court ruling that limits the power of lower courts to issue nationwide injunctions against his executive orders. Abroad, the administration touted a successful ceasefire between Israel and Iran and secured increased defense spending commitments from NATO allies. However, major domestic hurdles remain, including a bottleneck of unfinished trade deals ahead of a July 8 deadline and the uncertain fate of his "one big beautiful bill" containing his major tax and policy agenda in the Senate.</p>

          <p>As Russia intensifies its airstrikes using modernized Shahed drones, Ukraine is increasingly turning to interceptor drones as a key defensive strategy. These specialized, high-speed drones offer a much cheaper alternative to traditional anti-aircraft missiles, costing around $5,000 compared to potentially $1 million per missile. Russian tactics have evolved, with drones now flying at higher altitudes that make them difficult for mobile ground units to target. In response, Ukraine is ramping up domestic production of interceptor drones and training pilots for aerial combat, aiming to better protect its cities and critical infrastructure from the relentless attacks.</p>

He warned against illusions about Vladimir Putin's intentions in Ukraine and called for higher earners to contribute more to finance Germany's increased defense spending. The event marks a transition for the party, as co-leader Saskia Esken also did not seek re-election.

Louise Hill, founder of GoHenry, suggests parents use tangible methods to counteract the abstract nature of digital payments. Recommendations include giving children physical cash as regular pocket money to help them understand value and saving. For older kids, a "pizza budgeting" exercise, where slices represent household expenses, can visually demonstrate how income is allocated. These strategies aim to instill an understanding that money must be earned and spent thoughtfully.</p>

Peng notes that China has already built a mature regulatory framework for this type of platform-based digital money, positioning it ahead of competitors as stablecoins become a central topic in global finance.</p>

          <p>Los Angeles Dodgers star Shohei Ohtani hit his National League-leading 29th home run and added an RBI triple in a 5-4 victory over the Kansas City Royals. Ohtani's leadoff homer in the first inning set the tone, and his game-tying triple in the fifth was pivotal in securing the Dodgers' fifth consecutive win. He later scored the decisive run on a single by Mookie Betts. In other MLB action, Baltimore Orioles pitcher Tomoyuki Sugano earned an unusual win after giving up seven runs, as his team mounted a massive comeback to defeat the Tampa Bay Rays 22-8.</p>
