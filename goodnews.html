          <p>Columbia University activist Mahmoud Khalil was released from an ICE detention facility in Louisiana following a judge's order, after spending months in custody due to "foreign policy" concerns under the Trump administration. Khalil, a green card holder, was initially detained in March, causing separation from his pregnant wife and newborn son. The judge determined Khalil was not a flight risk or threat, criticizing the government's justification for his detention as an attempt to punish him for his anti-Israel speech. While the White House plans to appeal, Khalil's wife and the ACLU expressed relief at his release and return home to his family.</p>

          <p>As summer approaches, the appropriateness of wearing shorts in the office remains a contentious topic, despite the growing trend of more casual office attire. While some companies allow employees to dress comfortably and professionally, others maintain stricter standards, especially for client-facing roles. Stylists suggest that context is crucial, and employees should observe their colleagues' attire to determine if shorts are acceptable.

          <p>A panel of federal appellate judges has ruled that a Louisiana law requiring the Ten Commandments to be posted in public school classrooms is unconstitutional, marking a win for civil liberties groups. The court's ruling backs an order issued by a U.S. District Judge, who declared the mandate unconstitutional and ordered state education officials not to enforce it. Backers of the law argue the Ten Commandments belong in classrooms because they are historical and part of the foundation of U.S. law, but the court disagreed. The Louisiana Attorney General said she disagreed and believed the ruling only applied to school districts in the five parishes that were party to the lawsuit and that she would seek to appeal the ruling.</p>
