          <p>A tight contest is unfolding at the Tour Championship, with Patrick Cantlay and Tommy Fleetwood tied for the lead at 16 under par heading into the final day. Cantlay mounted a late charge with four birdies in his last five holes, positioning himself to challenge Fleetwood, who is seeking a long-awaited victory on American soil. The leaderboard also features Russell Henley two shots behind, while Keegan Bradley's strong performance has intensified speculation about his potential role as a playing captain for the upcoming Ryder Cup. The final round promises a dramatic conclusion to the prestigious golf tournament.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Scientists have digitally recreated the faces of two men who lived 2,500 years ago, based on skulls excavated from an ancient burial site in Tamil Nadu, India. The project, a collaboration between Madurai Kamaraj University and Liverpool John Moores University, aims to understand the appearance and ancestry of the region's early inhabitants. The reconstructed faces show features predominantly of Ancient Ancestral South Indians, with traces of Middle-Eastern and Austro-Asiatic ancestries, suggesting global migration. This research supports findings from the Keeladi archaeological site, which indicate the existence of an independent, literate urban civilization in southern India during that period.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Bayern Munich began the new Bundesliga season with a commanding 6-0 victory, reinforcing concerns about the league's lack of top-tier competition. This long-standing dominance is seen as a hindrance to the league's international commercial appeal, especially when compared to England's Premier League. In an effort to attract a new generation of global fans, the league's operator, the DFL, has controversially awarded streaming rights to YouTube content creators in the UK and Ireland. This move represents a strategic pivot towards non-traditional media consumption, though its success may still depend on the on-field competitiveness of the league itself.</p>

          <p>British tennis player Jack Draper is set to compete in the US Open after a seven-week layoff due to bone bruising in his left arm. The injury, which he first felt during the clay season and worsened on grass, forced him to withdraw from recent tournaments. Draper explained that continuing to play with the injury could have led to a more serious issue, necessitating a period of rest and recovery. Despite acknowledging that he may still feel some discomfort, he insists the injury will not hold him back as he prepares for his first-round match in New York.</p>

          <p>Major U.S. retailers like Walmart and Home Depot are navigating the impact of increased tariffs without implementing widespread price hikes, according to recent earnings reports. Companies have employed strategies such as diversifying their sourcing, negotiating with vendors, and importing goods early to absorb the rising costs. While some prices have increased, consumer spending has remained resilient, particularly for discretionary items, though lower-income households have shown more sensitivity to price changes. The retail sector continues to watch for further developments, as the full effect of tariffs, especially on goods from China, has not yet been finalized. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>Los Angeles Rams rookie tight end Terrance Ferguson made an impressive debut in the team's preseason game against the Cleveland Browns. After missing the first two games with a hamstring injury, the second-round draft pick showcased his potential with two key catches, including a 33-yard reception that highlighted his vertical speed. Coach Sean McVay praised Ferguson's performance, noting that his presence was immediately felt on the field. The strong showing suggests Ferguson will be a significant contributor in the Rams' offense alongside veteran tight ends Tyler Higbee and Colby Parkinson.</p>

          <p>Democratic socialist Zohran Mamdani is dominating the fundraising efforts in the New York City mayoral race, having raised nearly double the amount of his closest rivals between July and mid-August. Campaign finance records show Mamdani raised over $1 million, reflecting strong grassroots support. This financial advantage is mirrored in recent polls, which place him with a significant double-digit lead over his main challengers, former Governor Andrew Cuomo and incumbent Mayor Eric Adams, who are both running as independents. As the election enters its final months, pressure is expected to mount on the trailing candidates to consolidate the opposition against Mamdani.</p>

          <p>The historic Le Colisee theater in Beirut's Hamra district is set to reopen, symbolizing the cultural resilience of a neighborhood once the epicenter of the city's intellectual life. Led by director Kassem Istanbouli, a civil society initiative has revived the venue, aiming to provide a space for art that transcends Lebanon's political and sectarian divisions. Hamra, which suffered during the civil war and is now struggling through the country's severe economic collapse, has historically been a reflection of Lebanon's broader challenges. The theater's revival is seen as an investment in a shared cultural future, defying the ongoing instability and hardship.</p>

          <p>A federal judge has ruled that the Trump administration cannot withhold federal funding from Los Angeles and 30 other cities and counties over their "sanctuary" policies. The preliminary injunction expands on a previous ruling, stating that the president's executive order threatening to cut funding is likely unconstitutional and violates the separation of powers. These sanctuary policies typically limit local law enforcement's cooperation with federal immigration agencies but do not prevent them from enforcing judicial warrants. The ruling marks another setback for the administration's ongoing efforts to compel local jurisdictions to assist in federal immigration enforcement.</p>

          <p>Ron Howard's new film "Eden" tells the true story of European idealists in the 1930s who sought utopia on a remote Galapagos island, only to descend into conflict and murder. The movie stars Jude Law, Ana de Armas, Vanessa Kirby, and Sydney Sweeney as the mismatched settlers whose philosophical ambitions clash with harsh reality and each other. The review describes the film as a "sweaty hoot" and an "expensive reality show," more of a melodramatic potboiler than a deep exploration of the human condition. The article suggests the film is an entertaining and well-acted ensemble piece.</p>
