          <p>The Argentine Supreme Court uncovered documentation linked to the Nazi regime while preparing for a museum exhibit, including propaganda materials intended to spread Adolf Hitler's ideology in Argentina during World War II. The discovered items are believed to be connected to 83 packages that arrived in Buenos Aires in 1941 from the German embassy in Tokyo. Court President Horacio Rosatti has ordered the preservation and analysis of the material, found in a country with Latin America's largest Jewish population and a history of harboring Nazis after the war. The Holocaust Museum of Buenos Aires opened in 2001 and displayed Nazi-era relics found in a collector's home in 2017, underscoring Argentina's complex relationship with this history.</p>

          <p>The Colorado Rockies dismissed manager Bud Black and bench coach Mike Redmond due to the team's poor performance in the 2025 season. Owner Dick Monfort stated that the team's play was unacceptable and that changes were necessary to improve the team's performance. Warren Schaeffer has been named interim manager, with Clint Hurdle serving as interim bench coach. The Rockies have struggled this season, marked by a significant loss to the San Diego Padres and an overall negative run differential, and have not made the playoffs since 2018.</p>

          <p>Researchers in Switzerland are working on a "digital bridge" to help paralyzed individuals regain movement and bodily functions. The technology, developed by neuroscientist Gregoire Courtine and neurosurgeon Dr. Jocelyne Bloch, involves wirelessly sending signals from the brain to the spinal cord to bypass injuries. Beyond walking, priorities for patients include bladder control, sexual function, and blood pressure regulation, with spinal cord stimulation showing promise for Parkinson's disease as well. While still in early clinical trials, the goal is to make the therapy simple and widely accessible, offering patients a menu of options to restore various functions.</p>

          <p>CVS Caremark has decided to exclude Zepbound, a weight-loss drug, in favor of Wegovy, despite research indicating that Zepbound results in more weight loss. This decision is attributed to secret deals between drugmakers and pharmacy benefit managers (PBMs), affecting thousands of Americans who will be forced to switch medications. Caremark claims the decision was made to lower drug prices, reducing costs for employer clients by 10 to 15 percent. Doctors generally prefer Zepbound for its effectiveness, but patients are expressing concern over the change and its impact on their health progress.</p>

          <p>Marvel's "Thunderbolts" and Ryan Coogler's "Sinners" continued to lead the North American box office charts this weekend. Despite facing new competition, neither new release made a significant impact, with "Thunderbolts" taking the top spot with $33.1 million. Overall, it was a relatively quiet weekend, but thanks to "A Minecraft Movie," "Sinners," and "Thunderbolts," the year-to-date box office has increased by about 16% compared to last year.</p>

          <p>The UK Prime Minister has announced plans to overhaul the immigration system, including stricter English tests for visa applicants and their adult dependents. Migrants will need to wait ten years to apply for settlement instead of the current five, though a fast-track system will be established for nurses, engineers, and AI experts. The proposed changes aim to ensure integration and economic contribution, while critics warn of potential family separations and a more restrictive system compared to other high-income countries.</p>

          <p>India and Pakistan are both claiming victory after agreeing to a cease-fire, with each country emphasizing its own strength and downplaying the role of U.S. mediation. President Trump announced the cease-fire, but India avoided mentioning the U.S. role, framing it as a bilateral negotiation. India highlighted its tougher stance on terrorism, while Pakistan asserted its military superiority. Despite the claims of victory, uncertainty remains over whether the cease-fire will hold.</p>
