        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Following the large, nationwide "No Kings" anti-Trump protests, political experts are analyzing how to translate the energy of mass mobilization into tangible political results. Harvard professor Theda Skocpol argues that while protests are important for morale, their success hinges on follow-through with sustained, local-level political and electoral organizing, rather than just hitting a certain percentage of public participation. She cautions against focusing on internal party purity tests and instead advocates for a "militant inclusion" approach, building a broad coalition to win elections. The ultimate goal, she stresses, is not just demonstrating opposition but gaining and wielding political power to counter the administration's agenda.</p>

          <p>Shares for luxury group Kering, which owns Gucci, saw a significant jump of over 9% following a third-quarter report that exceeded sales expectations. While overall sales were down 5% compared to the previous year, this marked a notable improvement from the 15% decline in the second quarter, signaling a potential turnaround. The performance of the Gucci brand, in particular, showed a sharp sequential improvement, reassuring investors about the company's recovery strategy. Analysts have responded positively, with some upgrading their price targets for the company's stock. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>The third and final T20 cricket match between England and New Zealand in Auckland was abandoned due to persistent rain, resulting in a 1-0 series win for England. Only 3.4 overs were played before the weather, which has caused widespread disruption in New Zealand, forced the match to be called off. This marks the first overseas series victory for Harry Brook as England's white-ball captain, continuing an encouraging start to his leadership. The teams will next face each other in a three-match one-day international series, with several players from England's Ashes squad set to join.</p>

          <p>The Trump administration is reportedly in talks with several quantum computing companies, including IonQ and Rigetti Computing, about the Commerce Department taking equity stakes in exchange for federal funding. This move aligns with a broader strategy of securing government ownership in industries deemed vital to national security, following similar investments in rare earths and semiconductors. The policy reflects a greater willingness for government intervention to bolster key sectors, particularly in the technological and economic competition with China. Quantum computing is seen as a critical future technology with vast economic and national security implications. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>Shares of Sweden's Volvo Cars skyrocketed by as much as 41% after the company reported third-quarter operating income that significantly surpassed analyst expectations. The strong performance was driven by a successful cost-saving program and some one-off items, leading to an improved EBIT margin of 7.4%. CEO Håkan Samuelsson stated that the company's cost and cash actions are delivering results despite a tough market. While the automaker is on track for its best-ever trading day, it cautioned that the short-term outlook remains challenging due to macroeconomic pressures and price competition.

          <div class="timestamp">2025-10-23 05:06:48 EDT</div>

          <p>European Union leaders are expected to approve a plan to use frozen Russian state assets to provide Ukraine with a €140 billion "reparations loan." The proposal involves redirecting funds held in a Belgium-based financial institution to Kyiv, with the understanding that Russia would ultimately repay the amount through war reparations. The plan faces legal complexities and concerns from member states like Belgium about potential liability if Russia challenges the move. This initiative has become more urgent as U.S. support for Ukraine has diminished, and it represents an unprecedented step to fund both Ukraine's defense and future reconstruction.</p>

          <p>A large-scale analysis of over 150 clinical trials has systematically compared the physical side effects of dozens of antidepressants, providing a detailed reference for doctors and patients. The study, published in The Lancet, quantifies how different medications affect weight, blood pressure, heart rate, and cholesterol. It found that commonly prescribed SSRIs like Zoloft and Prozac generally have fewer physical side effects than older drugs. Researchers have created a digital tool to help clinicians tailor medication choices based on a patient's individual health profile and concerns, aiming to improve personalized mental healthcare.</p>

          <p>Pennsylvania Governor Josh Shapiro, a rising figure in the Democratic party, is set to campaign for gubernatorial candidate Abigail Spanberger in Virginia as the race enters its final stretch. Spanberger, a moderate Democrat, holds a narrow lead over Republican Lt. Gov. Winsome Earle-Sears in the contest to succeed Glenn Youngkin. The race has been complicated by a controversy involving the Democratic nominee for attorney general, creating an opening for Republicans. The involvement of nationally recognized figures like Shapiro and former President Obama underscores the high stakes in the closely watched Virginia election.</p>

          <p>The European Union has approved a new round of sanctions against Russia, for the first time targeting its natural gas sector with a ban on liquefied natural gas (LNG) imports. This move closely follows the Trump administration's decision to sanction Russia's two largest oil companies, a major policy shift that EU officials have welcomed as a "signal of strength." EU foreign policy chief Kaja Kallas stated that the coordinated pressure is necessary to deprive Russia of the revenue it uses to fund its war in Ukraine. The new EU package also targets Russian banks and entities in China and India.</p>
