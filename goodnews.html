        </div>
        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>A new trade agreement between the U.S. and the U.K. indicates that tariffs, particularly a 10% baseline, are likely to persist under a Trump administration. While the U.K. secured exemptions for 100,000 vehicles annually and tariff-free exports for steel and aluminum, most other goods remain subject to the 10% tariff. Analysts suggest this deal sets a precedent for future trade agreements, with limited exceptions and a focus on sector-specific concessions. The article notes that the deal may disproportionately benefit automakers assembling vehicles in the U.S. and could hinder the market share of British automakers like Jaguar Land Rover.</p>

          <p>Former President Joe Biden stated on "The View" that he wasn't surprised by Vice President Kamala Harris's loss in the 2024 election, attributing it to sexism and racism. Biden emphasized his "close" relationship with Harris and defended her qualifications, while also suggesting he could have defeated Trump had he remained in the race. He mentioned he's currently writing a book and considering his role post-presidency, while Harris contemplates her political future, possibly including a run for governor of California or president in 2028. Biden's remarks come amid ongoing discussions within the Democratic Party about its future leadership and priorities.</p>

The company has strategically diversified its supply chain over the past decade to reduce dependence on any single country, particularly China. By operating plants in multiple countries and working with diverse manufacturing partners, Keen aims to absorb tariff costs without passing them on to consumers. This approach contrasts with other retailers who are already implementing tariff surcharges.</p>
