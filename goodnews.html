          <p>Stablecoin issuer Circle has resumed its significant post-IPO rally, with its stock climbing 12% on Thursday. The surge in Circle's stock, which is up over 600% since its IPO, appears to be positively impacting its main distribution partner, Coinbase, whose shares also gained. Investors are weighing the opportunities in the stablecoin market as Congress considers regulatory frameworks like the GENIUS Act, while also monitoring potential interest rate cuts from the Fed that could affect Circle's earnings.
