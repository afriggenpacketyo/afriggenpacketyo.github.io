        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>The article discusses the overuse and ineffectiveness of corporate buzzwords, arguing they impede trust and create confusion, especially for Gen Z employees. While intended to foster inclusion and team spirit, jargon often masks underlying issues, such as layoffs disguised as "smartsizing." The author suggests using plain language instead of metaphors and buzzwords to improve communication and build genuine connections in the workplace. The piece advocates for radical candor and clear, human communication.</p>

Inflation data came in cooler than expected, adding to arguments that price pressures are easing, but concerns remain about the potential impact of tariffs on future inflation.

Prioritizing joy and being authentic are key to fostering healthy development and strong relationships with children, leaving developmental tables to the teachers and pediatricians.

Motherhood was a theme the Irish star returned to when she created the hit BBC series Motherland, alongside Holly Walsh and Graham Linehan.

          <p>Oscar Piastri secured pole position at the Spanish Grand Prix, outperforming his McLaren teammate Lando Norris. Piastri's advantage suggests that a rule change aimed at restricting the flexing of front wings had little effect on McLaren. Verstappen had been a long way off on his first run in the final session, after trying a different approach to preparing his tyres on the out lap which did not work, but leapt up on his final run. Norris made errors in a couple of corners on his final run and, although he improved his time, fell short of Piastri.</p>
