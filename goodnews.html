          <p>Coinbase has introduced a new "everything app" that integrates a crypto wallet, trading, and payment functions into a single platform. Built on its Base blockchain, the app aims to attract mainstream consumers who are not necessarily interested in speculative trading, thereby diversifying the company's revenue streams. Key features include the Base Account for identity verification and Base Pay, a one-click checkout system for USDC stablecoin payments developed with Shopify, which will soon support in-store tap-to-pay. This move reflects a broader industry trend towards creating "super apps" and comes amid a more favorable regulatory environment for cryptocurrency. (not investment advice)</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>A tsunami advisory for Alaska's southern peninsula was canceled after a 7.2 magnitude earthquake struck approximately 50 miles south of Sand Point. The initial quake prompted a tsunami warning, leading to evacuations in towns like Seward, but was later downgraded to an advisory as officials determined widespread, large waves were not expected. The U.S. Coast Guard also stood down its evacuation response in Kodiak once the threat passed. While the quake was felt across the region, there was no danger to Anchorage, and only small sea level changes were anticipated in the affected areas.</p>

          <p>President Donald Trump has announced that Coca-Cola agreed to switch from high-fructose corn syrup to cane sugar for its beverages sold in the United States, a move he personally advocated for. While Coca-Cola has not explicitly confirmed the change, a spokesperson acknowledged the president's enthusiasm and stated that details on new product innovations would be shared soon. This potential shift, aligning U.S. products with those in countries like Mexico and the UK, has been praised by health advocates but criticized by the Corn Refiners Association for its potential negative impact on American farmers and manufacturing jobs.</p>

          <p>Fox News Media has signed a licensing deal with the popular conservative podcast "Ruthless" to expand its digital presence and attract younger online audiences. This move is part of a broader trend where legacy media outlets are partnering with digital creators to reach consumers outside the traditional pay-TV ecosystem. The podcast, seen as a conservative counterpart to "Pod Save America," will operate under Fox News Digital, and its co-hosts will also serve as contributors on the Fox News Channel. The deal allows "Ruthless" to retain editorial control while sharing in the revenue generated across Fox's platforms.</p>

          <p>Former President Barack Obama and Michelle Obama addressed persistent divorce rumors during a joint appearance on a podcast, humorously dismissing the speculation. The conversation, which also included Michelle's brother Craig Robinson, touched on the public's perception when they are not seen together. The rumors had intensified after Barack Obama attended several high-profile events alone. Michelle Obama reiterated her commitment to their marriage, stating she has never considered leaving him, and explained her recent absences as a newfound freedom to make her own choices now that her daughters are grown.</p>

          <p>Continuing the advocacy work of his late mother, Princess Diana, Prince Harry walked through a partially cleared minefield in Angola. The visit was organized with the HALO Trust, the same charity Diana worked with during her historic visit in 1997, which helped galvanize support for an international land mine ban treaty. Harry highlighted the ongoing danger posed by land mines left from Angola's 27-year civil war, which ended in 2002 but still threatens civilians daily. This was not his first time undertaking such a walk, having previously done so in 2019 to raise awareness for the cause.</p>

          <p>Germany is set to pass new legislation by the end of the year to crack down on gangs smuggling migrants across the English Channel to the UK. The new law will make it illegal in Germany to facilitate illegal migration to a non-EU country, closing a loophole that existed post-Brexit. This commitment is part of a broader new agreement between the UK and Germany covering migration, business, and defense. The move is expected to help German authorities disrupt smuggling operations, particularly those involving the storage and supply of small boats used for the dangerous crossings.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>For the first time, astronomers have observed the initial moments of planet formation around a young, sun-like star named HOPS-315, located 1,300 light-years away. Using NASA's Webb Space Telescope and ESO's Alma telescope, scientists detected the formation of silicon monoxide, a mineral that forms at very high temperatures and is a key building block of rocky planets. This discovery provides a glimpse into a process similar to how our own solar system began, offering invaluable insights into the dawn of planetary systems. The finding helps scientists understand the conditions necessary for the birth of planets.</p>

          <p>United Airlines reported second-quarter earnings that beat estimates and issued an optimistic new profit forecast for 2025, signaling a positive outlook for the travel industry. CEO Scott Kirby stated that "the world is less uncertain today" and that travel demand is strengthening after a weaker-than-expected start to the year. The airline now projects adjusted earnings between $9 and $11 per share for the full year, a more confident stance than its previous forecast, which had included a "recessionary environment" scenario. The update suggests a stabilizing market, particularly in premium and international travel. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>A groundbreaking British study has demonstrated the success of a "three-parent" DNA technique in preventing children from being born with devastating inherited mitochondrial disorders. Researchers helped create eight healthy children for families plagued by these often-fatal genetic conditions by transferring nuclear DNA from a mother's egg into a donor egg with healthy mitochondria. While the results are hailed as a major scientific milestone, the procedure remains controversial, with critics raising concerns about long-term safety and the ethics of creating heritable genetic modifications, which could open the door to "designer babies."</p>

          <p>President Donald Trump stated that China is making significant progress in controlling the flow of fentanyl into the United States, a shift in tone from his previous rhetoric. He noted that while tariffs were imposed partly due to the fentanyl issue, he believes Beijing is now actively working to address the problem. This positive assessment comes amid ongoing high-level trade negotiations between the two countries. Previously, Trump had used China's role in the fentanyl crisis as a primary justification for imposing and increasing tariffs on Chinese imports.</p>
