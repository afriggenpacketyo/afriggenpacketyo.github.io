          <p>Baseball Hall of Famer Chipper Jones publicly rebuked an Atlanta sports radio host for comments made following the retirement of Braves manager Brian Snitker. The host claimed Snitker "did more with less" while legendary manager Bobby Cox "did less with more," prompting a sharp response from Jones. Jones, who played under Cox, defended both managers and called the host's take a disrespectful attempt to diminish Cox's legacy. The exchange highlights the passionate debates among fans and media regarding the careers of two of the most successful managers in the franchise's history.</p>

          <p>Amazon founder Jeff Bezos stated that while the artificial intelligence sector is currently experiencing an "industrial bubble," the underlying technology is real and will ultimately provide immense benefits to society. Speaking at an event in Italy, he compared the current hype to past bubbles where both good and bad ideas received funding, but noted that such periods can lead to significant long-term innovation. Bezos argued that unlike purely financial bubbles, industrial bubbles can be beneficial because society retains the valuable inventions that emerge after the speculative frenzy subsides.</p>

          <p>England head coach Thomas Tuchel has opted not to include Real Madrid star Jude Bellingham in his latest squad, signaling that no player is guaranteed a spot based on reputation alone. Despite Bellingham's desire to be called up after recovering from shoulder surgery, Tuchel stated the decision was based on the player's limited recent game time. The manager emphasized the need to build a team that is not solely reliant on one "special player," especially with the World Cup approaching. This move asserts Tuchel's authority and rewards other players who performed well in England's recent successful qualifiers.</p>

        </div>

          <p>This article provides an overview of the current interest rate environment for homebuyers and those looking to refinance. As of early October 2025, the national average for a 30-year fixed mortgage is around 6.34%, while a 15-year loan averages 5.64%. While rates remain higher than in previous years, they present options for borrowers, especially those with strong credit profiles. The article suggests that strengthening credit, comparing lenders, and understanding loan terms are key strategies for securing the best possible rate in the current market.

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Chicago Federal Reserve President Austan Goolsbee has voiced concern about cutting interest rates too quickly, citing simultaneous risks to both inflation and employment. He noted that the central bank is in a "sticky spot" with recent inflation upticks and deteriorating payroll numbers, affecting both sides of its dual mandate. While the Federal Open Market Committee recently lowered its benchmark rate, Goolsbee, a voting member, indicated he is wary of front-loading further cuts. He believes the underlying economy is stable enough to allow for gradual rate reductions over time rather than rapid changes. (not investment advice)</p>

          <h2>Electronic Shelf Labels Becoming Common in U.S. Grocery Stores, Sparking Debate Over Dynamic Pricing</h2>

          <p>Digital price tags, known as electronic shelf labels, are increasingly replacing paper tags in major U.S. retailers like Walmart, Kroger, and Whole Foods. This technology allows stores to update prices across thousands of items in minutes, improving efficiency and potentially reducing food waste by enabling quick markdowns on perishable goods. However, the shift has raised concerns among some lawmakers and consumer advocates about the potential for "dynamic pricing," where stores could surge prices during peak demand. Retailers currently deny using surge pricing, stating the technology is for operational efficiency and targeted discounts.</p>

Her successful week in Beijing included a notable victory over world number five Mirra Andreeva, the biggest win of her career so far.

          <p>This article outlines several investment types that financial experts recommend for baby boomers in retirement, even if they seem counterintuitive to risk-averse savers. To combat inflation over a long retirement, experts suggest maintaining a portfolio allocation to growth stocks, possibly through broad market ETFs. Other recommended assets include Treasury Inflation-Protected Securities (TIPS) to protect against rising costs, and Real Estate Investment Trusts (REITs) for real estate exposure and dividend income without direct ownership. High-yield savings accounts are also noted for providing liquidity for emergencies. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>A free-floating planet outside our solar system, named Cha 1107-7626, has been observed undergoing a massive growth spurt, accreting surrounding gas and dust at an astonishing rate. Researchers at the European Southern Observatory recorded the planet consuming material at the strongest rate ever seen for any planetary-mass object. This discovery blurs the lines between the formation of planets and stars, as the process appears to involve magnetic activity previously only seen in stars. The findings provide new insights into how these isolated "rogue" planets may form and evolve.</p>

          <p>This article explores the deep-rooted cumbia music scene in Monterrey, Mexico, a city that has become a second home for the Colombian genre. It focuses on the culture of "sonideros," DJs who have curated and popularized cumbia since the 1960s, leading to unique local styles like "cumbia rebajada." The music became intertwined with the identity of working-class and migrant neighborhoods, particularly the subculture known as "cholombianos." Despite periods of intense violence when organized crime suppressed public gatherings, the cumbia scene has shown resilience and is returning to the streets.</p>
