          <p>Kosmos-482, a robotic Soviet spacecraft launched in 1972 and intended for Venus, is expected to re-enter Earth‚Äôs atmosphere. Due to a rocket malfunction, the spacecraft has been adrift in space for 53 years. Experts are uncertain about the exact time and location of re-entry, but its orbit places it between 52 degrees north and 52 degrees south latitude. Although the spacecraft was designed to survive a Venusian atmosphere, there is a possibility that it will survive re-entry through Earth's atmosphere, though there is a low risk of injuries on the ground.</p>

          <p>Pupils in Edinburgh have been cut off from revision resources ahead of key exam dates due to an attempted cyber attack on the council's education department. Staff spotted a suspicious invitation to a meeting and realized it was a "spear-phishing" attempt. As a precaution, students' passwords have been reset, meaning they do not currently have access to school learning resources. The council is prioritizing support for students preparing for exams and has assured that no data has been compromised.</p>

          <p>Chinese buyers have purchased wheat from Australia and Canada due to concerns about heat damage to crops in China‚Äôs agricultural heartlands. Purchases included four or five shipments of wheat from Australia and around 200,000 tons from Canada. China is the world's top wheat grower, but also imports large amounts of grain when domestic supply falls short of demand. The bookings from Australia were the first made by China from the country since last year.</p>
