          <p>Bidders for a portion of Starbucks' China operations have submitted offers valuing the business at up to US$5 billion, potentially making it one of the largest divestments by a global consumer company in China recently. This valuation, based on approximately 10 times its expected 2025 EBITDA, indicates strong interest despite sluggish growth and intense local competition for Starbucks in the Chinese market. The sale would allow Starbucks to streamline its presence in a challenging but significant international market. At least one bidder offered a higher multiple, suggesting competitive bidding.

          <p>The Philadelphia Eagles narrowly defeated the Dallas Cowboys 24-20 in the NFL season opener, a game overshadowed by the ejection of Eagles defensive tackle Jalen Carter just six seconds in for spitting on Cowboys quarterback Dak Prescott. Carter's early exit significantly impacted the Eagles, who committed numerous penalties throughout the game. Despite these self-inflicted mistakes and a lightning delay, the Eagles secured the win, with Jalen Hurts accounting for 214 yards and Saquon Barkley rushing for a touchdown. The Cowboys' late drives were thwarted by dropped passes, allowing the Eagles to ice the game.</p>

          <p>Asia-Pacific markets saw gains after President Trump formalized a trade deal with Japan, lowering auto import tariffs to 15% and confirming $550 billion in Japanese investments in U.S. projects. The executive order also included Trump's intent to impose tariffs on semiconductor imports from companies not relocating production to the United States, causing several Asian chip stocks to rise. Japan's Nikkei 225 and South Korea's Kospi climbed, reflecting market reactions to these trade and manufacturing policy announcements. U.S. equity futures also showed slight movement ahead of the August jobs report, with overnight gains on hopes for a favorable report. (not investment advice)</p>

The initiative aligns with Secretary of Defense Pete Hegseth's push for the military to adopt commercial AI and drone technologies. The technology is being rolled out unit-by-unit, with continuous user feedback driving rapid software revisions, aiming to process battlefield data significantly faster than adversaries.</p>

          <p>French President Emmanuel Macron announced that 26 nations have pledged postwar security guarantees to Ukraine, including an international force on land, sea, and air to prevent future aggression. This commitment emerged from a summit where European leaders sought to solidify U.S. support from President Trump. While some countries will deploy troops, others will provide guarantees through training and equipping Ukrainian forces. Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy hailed the move as a "serious concrete step," though Russia dismissed the guarantees and reiterated its demands for Ukrainian territory. The agreement also includes significant U.S. arms deliveries to Ukraine.</p>

          <p>President Trump formalized a trade deal with Japan, implementing 15% baseline tariffs on most Japanese goods, including autos, while Tokyo committed to $550 billion in U.S. investments and increased purchases of American agricultural and defense products. This agreement, finalized after weeks of negotiation, aims to alleviate the impact of Trump's global tariff campaign on Japan's auto sector, which had faced significant financial hits. Domestically, Japanese Prime Minister Shigeru Ishiba faces mounting political pressure and potential leadership challenge within the Liberal Democratic Party following recent election losses and internal discontent.

          <p>President Trump reiterated his warning about "fairly substantial" tariffs on semiconductor imports, targeting companies that do not shift production to the U.S., but signaled exemptions for domestic investors like Apple. During a White House dinner with tech leaders, Trump mentioned that Apple CEO Tim Cook's company would be "in pretty good shape" following its pledge of an additional $100 billion in U.S. manufacturing initiatives. The administration's long-standing effort to onshore the semiconductor supply chain has already seen major companies like TSMC and Samsung commit billions to U.S. plants. While many details remain unclear, the policy aims to incentivize domestic production and strengthen national supply chain security. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>The Powerball jackpot has surged to an estimated $1.7 billion, the third-largest in U.S. lottery history, after no winner emerged from Wednesday night's drawing. The odds of winning the jackpot are 1 in 292.2 million, and Saturday's draw will mark a record 42nd consecutive drawing without a top prize winner. Data analysis shows that winners in states without income tax on lottery prizes, such as California and Florida, stand to take home significantly more after federal taxes. Conversely, states like New York have the lowest after-tax payouts due to higher state taxes, impacting the final annuity or lump-sum payment. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>A U.S. federal appeals court upheld an injunction preventing the State Department from enforcing President Trump's policy restricting transgender and nonbinary Americans from obtaining passports reflecting their gender identities. This decision follows Trump's executive order directing the government to only recognize male and female biological genders, reversing a previous Biden administration policy allowing an "X" gender marker. The American Civil Liberties Union successfully argued that the policy was arbitrary and reflected unconstitutional prejudice. The court noted the "immediate and irreparable harms" faced by affected individuals, solidifying the temporary block on the policy.</p>

Analysts suggest this initiative could improve real-time visibility and control over economic transactions, addressing persistent payment defaults.
