          <h2>Dodgers Reportedly Considering Outfield Upgrades Ahead of MLB Trade Deadline</h2>
          <div class="timestamp">2025-07-28 18:40:09 EDT</div>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>The Los Angeles Dodgers are reportedly exploring options to acquire an outfielder before the trade deadline to bolster their defense and struggling lineup. Despite a recent offensive surge from Michael Conforto, the team's overall outfield defense remains a significant weakness. One potential target is Minnesota Twins' Harrison Bader, a premium defender who is also having a solid offensive season. The move would aim to support the team's strong starting pitching by preventing runs, a strategy seen as crucial for a deep playoff run this year.</p>

          <p>A federal judge has rejected a lawsuit filed by an investment fund, Azoria Capital, that sought to compel the Federal Reserve to open its interest rate-setting meetings to the public. The judge ruled that the Federal Open Market Committee (FOMC) is not subject to the "Sunshine Act," which mandates open meetings for certain government agencies. The lawsuit, brought by a firm whose CEO is an ally of President Trump, had alleged the Fed was maintaining high interest rates to undermine the administration. The judge questioned if the lawsuit was a publicity stunt for the new fund.</p>

          <p>China's aviation regulator is surveying the country's airlines about their future fleet requirements, specifically asking about potential orders for Boeing aircraft. This move suggests that Boeing, which has often been caught in the middle of U.S.-China trade tensions, could see a significant increase in orders if broader diplomatic relations improve. The inquiry from the Civil Aviation Administration of China (CAAC) coincides with a meeting between its director and a Boeing senior vice president. Industry insiders believe Boeing is well-positioned to benefit from any thaw in the bilateral relationship.</p>
