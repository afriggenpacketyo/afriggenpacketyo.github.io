          <p>Ryanair's CEO, Michael O'Leary, is on track to receive a bonus potentially exceeding ‚Ç¨100 million after the airline's share price reached a key performance target of closing above ‚Ç¨21 for 28 consecutive days. The bonus is contingent upon O'Leary remaining with Ryanair until the end of July 2028, and he will have the option to receive 10 million shares. O'Leary has been with Ryanair since 1988 and has served as chief executive since 1994, spearheading the airline's growth into Europe's largest low-cost carrier. Ryanair emphasized that the share price aspect of the bonus is only one of two conditions, with the other being O'Leary's continued employment with the airline. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>Harvard University has fired tenured professor Francesca Gino for falsifying data in multiple published papers, marking the first time in at least 80 years that the university has taken such action. The accusations against Gino, whose academic focus was honesty in business, surfaced in 2023 with a series of posts on Data Colada detailing her apparent data manipulation. Gino's denials were unconvincing, and her subsequent lawsuit against Harvard and the Data Colada authors was dismissed. Harvard's handling of the Gino case is seen as a positive step towards addressing scientific fraud, though it highlights the need for academia to improve fraud detection and punishment.</p>

          <p>Niccol√≤ Machiavelli is often viewed as advocating ruthless pragmatism, but this interpretation is incomplete, according to political philosopher Erica Benner. Benner argues that Machiavelli's famous work, The Prince, is not a manual for tyrants but a satirical critique of authoritarian power. She suggests that Machiavelli was a republican who believed in shared power and cautioned against the dangers of inequality and partisanship. Machiavelli's Discourses on Livy further supports this view, espousing a deep belief in republicanism and representative government.</p>

          <p>Christina Ramberg, an artist affiliated with the Chicago Imagists, explored the artifice of the female body and the contradictions of femininity through her paintings. Her work often featured torsos in corsets, feet in high heels, and intricate updos, rendered in a crisp, flat style that lacked faces. These images, while sensual, are also depersonalized and often off-kilter, reflecting the taming and unruly forces that divide women's bodies. Ramberg's art probes the commodification of female sexuality and the artificiality inherent in self-presentation.</p>
