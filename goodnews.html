          <div class="timestamp">2025-07-29 10:21:00 EDT</div>
        </div>
        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>India, home to approximately 75% of the world's wild tigers, has seen its population increase to over 3,600. Despite this conservation success, experts warn that significant risks remain, primarily due to habitat fragmentation caused by deforestation, agriculture, and infrastructure projects. These developments isolate tiger populations, affecting their movement and breeding. Conservationists stress that protecting the quality of ecosystems, not just the number of tigers, is crucial for their long-term survival, especially as human-wildlife conflicts also rise.</p>

          <p>Procter & Gamble announced quarterly results that exceeded analyst expectations for both earnings and revenue. However, the consumer goods giant introduced a cautious fiscal year 2026 forecast, warning that new trade tariffs will create a pre-tax headwind of approximately $1 billion. In response, the company plans mid-single-digit price increases on about a quarter of its products, including brands like Tide and Charmin, to offset the higher costs. The CFO described the current consumer environment as increasingly "value-seeking" and "selective" amid economic volatility. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>Boeing reported a significant reduction in its quarterly losses, with revenue jumping 35% as it delivered the most aircraft since 2018. CEO Kelly Ortberg described 2025 as a potential "turnaround year," highlighting improved stability in production and performance. The company's adjusted loss per share was better than analysts expected, and it substantially reduced its cash burn compared to the previous year. While challenges remain, including delays for the 737 Max 7 and 10 certifications, the results suggest the aerospace giant is making progress in its recovery. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>Karl Schlögel, a German historian and expert on Eastern Europe, has won the prestigious 2025 Peace Prize of the German Book Trade. The jury recognized him as one of the first prominent voices to warn against Vladimir Putin's expansionist policies and for his continued affirmation of Ukraine's place in Europe. Schlögel's work, which includes deep analysis of Stalinist Russia and the historical context of the current war, has been praised for correcting prejudices and vividly documenting the region's history. The award highlights his message that European peace is not possible without a free Ukraine.</p>

          <h2>Opinion: Skilled Trades Offer Untapped Potential for Underserved Communities in the AI Era</h2>

          <p>In a Fox News opinion piece, Pastor Corey Brooks argues that the national emphasis on college and coding has overlooked a vital opportunity for underserved communities: the skilled trades. The author cites experts who note that while AI is displacing some tech jobs, it cannot replace manual labor roles like electricians, welders, and plumbers, which are in high demand. He contends that providing direct pathways to vocational training can reverse the decline caused by "post-60s liberalism" and offer a tangible route to prosperity for those in impoverished neighborhoods.</p>

          <p>Amid rumors of a potential shift of its primary stock listing to the U.S., AstraZeneca CEO Pascal Soriot has doubled down on the company's commitment to the American market.

The statements came as the pharmaceutical firm posted better-than-expected quarterly earnings, driven by strong demand for its cancer and biopharmaceutical products, reinforcing the strategic importance of its U.S. operations.</p>

        </div>
        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Mortgage experts predict that rates are unlikely to see a significant drop in August, as the Federal Reserve remains cautious about cutting its benchmark rate due to inflation concerns. The Fed's hesitation is partly influenced by uncertainty surrounding the current administration's tariff policies. While many analysts believe a rate cut may not occur until the September meeting, they also warn that waiting could be risky. A future decline in rates will likely bring more buyers into the market, potentially increasing competition and driving up home prices. (not investment advice)</p>
