          <p>This article examines the life and legacy of Malcolm X, highlighting his advocacy for Black self-confidence and resistance against oppression. Born in 1925, Malcolm X's childhood was marked by racism and violence, leading him to question American society and advocate for Black people to fight for their rights "by any means necessary." After joining the Nation of Islam, he denounced "white devils" and criticized Martin Luther King Jr.'s nonviolent approach. A pilgrimage to Mecca shifted his views, leading him to seek an alliance of oppressed people of color against white colonial oppression before his assassination in 1965.</p>
