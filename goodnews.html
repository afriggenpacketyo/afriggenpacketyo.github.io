        </div>
        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>A recent Congressional Budget Office (CBO) report has indicated that President Trump's tariffs, implemented between January and August 2025, are projected to decrease primary deficits by $3.3 trillion over the next decade. This surprising finding, which also forecasts an additional $0.7 trillion reduction in federal interest outlays, has sparked renewed debate among economists. While the report suggests significant revenue generation without triggering widespread inflation or a growth plummet, critics argue tariffs are ultimately a tax that diminishes domestic incomes. The article also highlights an ongoing legal challenge to the president's broad executive authority to impose such trade policies, questioning whether this power extends beyond clear national security concerns.

          <p>China has successfully launched the Jiangmen Underground Neutrino Observatory (Juno) in Guangdong province, which is now operational as the world's largest detector for elusive “ghost particles” known as neutrinos. This massive facility, featuring an 18,000kg liquid scintillator detector housed 700m underground, has commenced data collection for its mission. Its primary goal is to precisely measure the mass of different neutrino types originating from nearby nuclear power plants. Particle physicist Wang Yifang hailed the completion and data-taking as a "historic milestone" for the international project, initially proposed by the Chinese Academy of Sciences in 2008, signifying a major advance in fundamental physics research and global scientific collaboration.</p>

          <p>Twenty years after Hurricane Katrina, a student ID belonging to Catherine Hamel, lost during the storm, was remarkably found on Horn Island by Park Ranger Becky Copeland and subsequently returned. Hamel, who lived less than a block from the water in Bay Saint Louis, Mississippi, lost everything when the hurricane hit, including countless cherished mementos from the first 50 years of her life. The ID, discovered 249 miles from its origin, resurfaced after its faded text became legible, enabling Copeland to trace Hamel. This heartwarming discovery offers a poignant reminder of Katrina's devastating impact and the profound, enduring emotional value of lost personal items, bringing a sense of closure after two decades.</p>
