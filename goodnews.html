          <p>Federal Reserve Chair Jerome Powell stated that by many measures, equity prices appear to be at elevated levels. Speaking in Rhode Island, he clarified that while the central bank monitors overall financial conditions, it does not currently see a period of high financial stability risks. Powell acknowledged that markets anticipate the Fed's policy moves, pricing in expected interest rate changes, which has contributed to stocks reaching record highs following the recent rate cut. His comments provide insight into the Fed's perspective on current market valuations amid its policy decisions.</p>

          <h2>States Form Regional Alliances to Coordinate Public Health Guidance Amid Federal Uncertainty</h2>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>In response to perceived confusion and a leadership vacuum at the federal level, states on the West Coast and in the Northeast have formed regional public health alliances. These collaboratives aim to provide clear and unified guidance on issues like vaccines, creating consistent policies across state lines for their residents. The initiative, which includes joint recommendations and coordinated data sharing, highlights a significant shift towards localized public health authority as states take matters into their own hands to restore trust in science and avoid a patchwork of political responses.</p>

          <p>A Missouri woman has been sentenced to more than four years in federal prison for her role in a sophisticated scheme to fraudulently sell Elvis Presley's iconic Graceland estate. Lisa Jeanine Findley pleaded guilty to mail fraud, admitting she created a fictitious company and forged documents to falsely claim Presley's late daughter, Lisa Marie, had used Graceland as collateral for a $3.8 million loan. The plot was foiled when Presley's granddaughter, Riley Keough, obtained a court order to halt the illegal foreclosure sale.</p>

          <p>The 2026 Coachella Valley Music and Arts Festival has sold out all general admission and VIP passes for both of its weekends just three days after going on sale. This rapid sellout marks a return to the festival's pre-pandemic sales velocity, following several years of slower ticket sales. With a lineup headlined by Justin Bieber, Sabrina Carpenter, and Karol G, the strong demand is being viewed as a positive sign for the health of the live event industry, which has seen some other major festivals struggle in the post-pandemic market.</p>

          <p>NASA has announced that its Artemis II mission, which will send four astronauts on a flight around the Moon, could launch as early as February 2026, ahead of its previous schedule. This 10-day mission will be the first time humans have traveled beyond low-Earth orbit in over 50 years. The accelerated timeline reflects the agency's progress in preparing the spacecraft and rocket systems, as it aims to win what officials are calling a "second space race" against China, which also plans to land astronauts on the lunar surface by 2030.</p>

          <div class="timestamp">2025-09-23 12:32:07 EDT</div>
        </div>
        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Recent data indicates that the growth rate for single-family home rents in the U.S. is losing steam. In July, rents increased by just 2.3% compared to the previous year, a rate that is slower than the pre-pandemic average and a significant cooldown from the rapid increases seen in recent years. While some markets like Chicago continue to experience strong growth, others that were previously booming, such as Miami, have seen rent growth flatten completely. This trend suggests that landlords' pricing power may be diminishing as consumer finances become more constrained. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>A U.S. district judge has ordered the Trump administration to restore $500 million in federal grant funding to the University of California, Los Angeles. The administration had frozen the funds, which were designated for hundreds of medical research projects, over allegations of civil rights violations related to antisemitism and affirmative action on campus. In granting a preliminary injunction, the judge ruled that the government likely violated federal law by suspending the grants without providing specific procedures or explanations for its actions.</p>
