          <p>Supreme Court Justice Amy Coney Barrett defended her pointed remarks directed at Justice Ketanji Brown Jackson in a recent majority opinion concerning universal injunctions. Speaking at a public event in New York, Barrett stated she felt Jackson's dissent was argued in strong terms that "warranted a response," comparing her own sharp writing to adding a little Tabasco. While emphasizing her deep personal respect for Justice Jackson and attributing her approach to attacking ideas, not people, Barrett maintained that she "set the calibration right" in the exchange over the scope of judicial power.</p>

          <p>A recent labor market study analyzing over a billion job postings indicates a surge in demand for workers with artificial intelligence skills, with employers offering significant salary premiums. Jobs requiring at least one AI skill advertised salaries that were 28% higher on average, a figure that rose to 43% for roles requiring two or more. The demand is not limited to the tech sector; fields like marketing, public relations, and finance are increasingly seeking AI-proficient employees, suggesting that AI literacy is becoming a valuable differentiator across all industries.

          <p>The Trump administration has formalized a trade deal with Japan by signing an executive order that establishes a 15% baseline tariff on most Japanese imports, including automobiles. As part of the agreement, Japan has committed to investing $550 billion in U.S. projects and increasing its purchases of American agricultural and aerospace products. The finalization of the deal comes as Japanese Prime Minister Shigeru Ishiba faces significant internal pressure and discontent within his ruling Liberal Democratic Party, with analysts speculating he may not survive an upcoming leadership challenge.

          <p>As the Powerball jackpot swells to an estimated $1.7 billion, an analysis of lottery data highlights the significant impact of state taxes on a winner's final payout. Winners in states with no income tax on lottery prizes, such as Florida and Texas, would receive the largest after-tax amounts. Conversely, states with high income tax rates, like New York, would see the lowest payouts after both federal and state taxes are withheld. The article also notes that the odds of winning the jackpot are 1 in 292.2 million. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>A U.S. federal appeals court has rejected the Trump administration's attempt to enforce a policy preventing transgender and nonbinary citizens from obtaining passports that reflect their gender identity. The court upheld a lower court's injunction, which found the policy was likely rooted in "unconstitutional animus" and would cause irreparable harm. The policy, part of a broader executive order recognizing only biological sex, requires passport applicants to list their "biological sex at birth" and removes the "X" gender marker option.</p>

The art form is particularly popular among millennials, with over 40% having a tattoo, and is now being featured in art exhibits, reflecting its growing acceptance as a legitimate form of self-expression.</p>

The discovery sheds new light on Bowie's final creative period, showing he was pursuing a lifelong ambition to write for the theater even as he was creating his final album, "Blackstar."</p>
