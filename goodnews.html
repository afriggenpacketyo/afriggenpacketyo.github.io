        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>The U.S. Department of Health and Human Services is taking action to decertify the Life Alliance Organ Recovery Agency, a division of the University of Miami Health System, following years of documented patient safety failures. This move is part of a broader federal effort to reform the nation's organ transplant system after investigations revealed disturbing practices, including instances where the organ procurement process was initiated on patients who still showed signs of life. The reforms aim to restore trust in the system and improve accountability among the 55 organ procurement organizations nationwide, which coordinate access to transplants for over 100,000 people on waiting lists.</p>

          <p>Warren Buffett's Berkshire Hathaway has fully divested its highly profitable stake in the Chinese electric vehicle company BYD, which it first purchased in 2008 for $230 million. The investment, originally championed by the late Charlie Munger, saw its value increase by approximately 3,890% over the 17 years Berkshire held the shares. The gradual sell-off began in August 2022, with Buffett citing geopolitical risks associated with China as a key factor in the decision, similar to the reasoning behind the sale of its Taiwan Semiconductor stake. The final shares were sold by the end of March 2025. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>Seven U.S. states and New York City have established the Northeast Public Health Collaborative to strengthen and coordinate regional health guidance as national health agencies' recommendations become increasingly fractured. This alliance aims to create a unified approach to issues like emergency preparedness, vaccine purchasing, and laboratory capacity. The move comes as experts note a growing state-level variability in public health policies, particularly concerning vaccinations, creating a patchwork of rules across the country. The collaborative seeks to ensure consistent, evidence-based public health measures for the region's residents.</p>

          <h2>Opinion Piece Argues True Strength Lies in Emotional Mastery, Not Suppression</h2>
          <div class="timestamp">2025-09-21 08:00:29 EDT</div>
        </div>
        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>This opinion article contends that genuine resilience and strength are not achieved by suppressing emotions but by mastering them. The author argues against the traditional notion of toughness as the absence of feeling, stating that this approach makes individuals brittle rather than strong. Citing neuroscientific research, the piece explains that core emotions are hardwired survival responses and that acknowledging them enhances self-control. It promotes the idea of emotional grit as the foundation of perseverance, suggesting that skills in emotional regulation are essential for achieving long-term success and navigating life's challenges effectively.</p>

          <p>Apple has solidified its control over the core technology in its iPhones by introducing a suite of custom-designed chips that prioritize on-device artificial intelligence. The new A19 Pro system-on-a-chip features neural accelerators on each GPU core, while the company also debuted its first custom wireless chip, the N1, and a new modem, the C1X. This strategic shift allows Apple to enhance performance, improve battery life, and ensure privacy by processing AI tasks directly on the device. The move also reduces its reliance on third-party suppliers like Qualcomm and Broadcom for critical components.</p>

          <p>A growing number of LGBTQ+ individuals are running for political office in the United States, a trend largely motivated by what they perceive as increasing attacks on their rights from the political right. Organizations that train queer candidates have seen a significant surge in participation, with applicants from across the political spectrum, including both Democrats and Republicans. These candidates are not only aiming to counter anti-LGBTQ+ policies but are also advocating on broader issues like democracy and local community concerns. The movement reflects a desire for direct representation and a proactive defense against the erosion of civil rights.</p>

          <h2>Experts Advocate for Including Fertility and Reproduction Education in School Sex-Ed Curriculums</h2>
          <div class="timestamp">2025-09-21 08:00:00 EDT</div>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Reproductive health experts and doctors are calling for sex education programs to include comprehensive information about fertility, not just pregnancy prevention. They argue that many people reach adulthood with significant gaps in their knowledge about their own reproductive biology, such as the impact of age on fertility and factors affecting conception. This lack of education can lead to misconceptions and difficulties with family planning later in life. Proponents believe that teaching topics like ovulation and the fertile window in school could empower individuals to make more informed decisions about their reproductive health throughout their lives.</p>

          <p>Kenyan athletes dominated the 51st Berlin Marathon, with Sabastian Sawe winning the men's race and Rosemary Wanjiru claiming victory in the women's event. Sawe finished with a time of 2:02:15, while Wanjiru crossed the line at 2:21:05. Despite Berlin's reputation as one of the world's fastest marathon courses, the finishing times were slower than world-record pace, a factor attributed to the unusually warm and humid late-summer conditions in the German capital. The event saw over 55,000 participants, including several celebrities, running through the city's historic streets.</p>

          <p>The social media phenomenon known as "RushTok" offers a detailed look into the highly structured and competitive world of sorority recruitment at southern universities, particularly the University of Alabama. The trend, which primarily features potential new members showcasing their "outfit of the day," reveals a culture defined by specific fashion aesthetics, significant financial costs, and strict social protocols. While providing entertainment and brand opportunities, RushTok also implicitly highlights long-standing issues within the Greek system, including the reinforcement of class distinctions and a persistent lack of racial diversity in historically white sororities.</p>

          <p>Tropical Storm Gabrielle, the seventh named storm of the 2025 Atlantic hurricane season, has formed over the central Atlantic and is forecast to strengthen into a hurricane. According to the National Hurricane Center, the storm is expected to track north-northwest and pass east of Bermuda without making landfall. While no watches or warnings are currently in effect for land areas, swells generated by Gabrielle are predicted to cause life-threatening surf and rip current conditions along the U.S. East Coast from North Carolina northward, as well as in Atlantic Canada, into early next week.</p>

For example, Apple's AirPods Pro now include an FDA-authorized "Hearing Aid Feature" for mild to moderate hearing loss, as well as a new live translation function that can aid communication. Similarly, vision assistance tools are now standard on smartphones, and over-the-counter continuous glucose monitors are becoming available for diabetes management. This trend is lowering barriers and reducing the stigma associated with using assistive devices for sensory decline and chronic conditions.</p>

          <p>In the United Kingdom, scientists are deploying a novel high-tech strategy to combat the spread of invasive Asian hornets, which pose a significant threat to native honeybee populations and other vital pollinators. Response teams are capturing individual hornets and attaching miniature tracking devices to them. This allows the teams to follow the hornets directly back to their hidden nests, which can then be located and destroyed within an hour, a process that previously took days. The effort is heavily supported by public participation, with citizens using the Asian Hornet Watch app to report thousands of sightings.</p>
