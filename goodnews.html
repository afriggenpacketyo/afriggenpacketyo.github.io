The company is also building vertiports in key Dubai locations and has secured a major investment from a Saudi Arabian firm.

          <p>President Trump is set to sign an executive order to terminate the U.S. sanctions program on Syria, a move intended to support the country's new transitional government and path toward stability. The order will lift broad sanctions while maintaining targeted penalties against former president Bashar al-Assad, his associates, and those linked to human rights abuses, terrorism, and chemical weapons. This action follows months of lobbying by Syria's new leadership for sanctions relief to aid in reconstruction and economic recovery after the collapse of the Assad regime.

          <p>A key provision in President Trump's "big, beautiful bill" would eliminate federal income taxes on tips for many service industry workers, a move the White House frames as a victory for the working class. The proposal would create a new deduction, though the House and Senate versions differ on income caps and deduction limits, and the tax cut would expire in 2028. However, critics and policy experts note that the benefit is narrowly targeted and would not help the lowest-wage workers, as over a third of tipped employees already earn too little to owe federal income tax.

The new measures will include more frequent and sophisticated facial verification and fraud detection technology to ensure only registered account holders are making deliveries.

Since early May, Muncy has seen a dramatic increase in his batting average, home runs, and RBIs, re-establishing himself as a crucial offensive force for the team after struggling for several years following a major elbow injury.</p>

          <p>In a strategic move to de-escalate trade tensions, Canada has canceled its planned digital services tax (DST) that was set to take effect on Monday. The 3% levy would have primarily impacted major U.S. tech companies, and President Trump had labeled it a "blatant attack" on the U.S., freezing trade talks in response. By shelving the tax, Canada has successfully brought the U.S. back to the negotiating table for a critical trade and defense deal.

          <p>England's victory over India in the first Test was significantly influenced by their ability to quickly dismiss India's lower-order batsmen, a skill that has been a past weakness. Fast bowler Josh Tongue was particularly effective, taking three wickets in each innings against the tailenders, preventing them from adding crucial runs. This article argues that efficiently 'killing the tail' is a vital, often overlooked, aspect of Test cricket, providing a psychological lift and preventing momentum shifts. Tongue's aggressive and intimidating bowling style has provided England with a key weapon that will be essential for future success, including the upcoming Ashes series.</p>

          <p>In a landmark legal case, a 92-year-old man, Ryland Headley, has been convicted of the sexual assault and murder of 75-year-old Louisa Dunne in 1967, solving one of the United Kingdom's longest-running cold cases. The breakthrough came after investigators re-examined evidence in 2023, using modern forensic techniques to find Headley's DNA on the victim's skirt, which had been preserved for 58 years. This DNA evidence, along with a palm print from the scene, conclusively linked him to the crime. The conviction brings long-awaited justice and closure to the victim's family after nearly six decades.</p>
