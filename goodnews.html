          <p>Three Democratic governors, Kathy Hochul of New York, J.B. Pritzker of Illinois, and Tim Walz of Minnesota, testified before a House oversight panel to defend their states' policies toward migrants amid ongoing immigration protests. The governors disputed claims of failing to cooperate with federal authorities, with Walz emphasizing that Minnesota is not a sanctuary state and criticizing the federal government's approach to immigration. Hochul addressed the influx of migrants to New York City, highlighting the state's efforts to manage the humanitarian crisis while cooperating with ICE in criminal cases. Pritzker stated Illinois' commitment to public safety despite strained resources due to the lack of federal support during the crisis.</p>

          <p>The article discusses current certificate of deposit (CD) interest rates and strategies for securing optimal returns in an economy facing persistent inflation. It notes that while national average CD yields for 1-year, 3-year, and 5-year terms are around 2%, 1.70%, and 1.71% APY respectively, top CDs offer much higher rates, sometimes exceeding 4.40% APY. The article suggests considering online banks and short-term CDs to take advantage of the inverted yield curve, where shorter terms offer better rates, and recommends CD laddering as a practical approach for long-term savings. These strategies can help savers lock in competitive rates and achieve their financial goals more effectively (not investment advice).</p>

          <p>India is emerging as a key player in global manufacturing, driven by geopolitical factors, economic incentives, and strategic diversification, as highlighted in CNBC's "Inside India" newsletter. Companies like Shein, Apple, and Google are expanding their manufacturing operations in India, drawn by its large labor force and government incentives like the Production-Linked Incentive (PLI) scheme. While challenges remain, including logistical bottlenecks and labor concerns, India offers a relatively stable option for companies seeking resilient supply chains. This shift reflects a broader realignment across sectors, with India becoming an alternative manufacturing hub amid U.S.-China trade tensions.</p>

          <p>The author describes a weekly father-daughter routine called "Dad-urday," which has evolved over the years as his daughter has grown, strengthening their bond and providing uninterrupted time together. Initially involving naps and driving, Dad-urday has transformed into adventures that reflect her changing interests, from visiting parks and pet stores to exploring music shops and discussing the world. The author emphasizes the importance of the routine in tracking his daughter's growth and creating a memory archive of their shared experiences. The ritual provides structure and a sense of balance, and has made him a more present and aware parent.</p>

          <h2>India's Inflation Cools to 2.82% in May, Driven by Lower Food Prices</h2>

          <p>India's headline inflation eased to a lower-than-expected 2.82% in May, marking its lowest level since February 2019, according to the Ministry of Statistics and Programme Implementation. The decline was primarily driven by a slide in food prices, with food inflation hitting 0.99% in May, sharply below April's 1.78%. The Reserve Bank of India has been relaxing monetary policy amid these easing inflationary pressures, most recently cutting its benchmark repo rate by 50 basis points. Economists anticipate further rate cuts due to subdued inflation and weakened economic activity (not investment advice).</p>
