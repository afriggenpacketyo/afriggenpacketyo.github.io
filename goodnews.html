          <p>The 2025 French Open semifinals feature a matchup between veteran Novak Djokovic and rising star Jannik Sinner, highlighting the evolving landscape of men's tennis as the 'Big Three' era nears its end. Djokovic, despite being the oldest player to reach the semifinals since 1968, is considered underrated by some, while Sinner and defending champion Carlos Alcaraz represent the new generation of players dominating the sport. The article emphasizes Djokovic's recent wins against top players, suggesting he remains a formidable competitor despite his age, as Alcaraz looks to continue his dominance over Lorenzo Musetti in the second semi-final. The tournament showcases the blend of experience and youth vying for the Grand Slam title.</p>

          <p>Overcapacity in China's manufacturing sector is leading to a surge of cheap exports, causing concerns among other economies about being overwhelmed. However, this influx of low-cost Chinese goods may provide some relief to inflation-hit economies by lowering costs for consumers. This could allow central banks to ease monetary policy and cut interest rates, decoupling from the Federal Reserve's actions. For markets with limited manufacturing bases, like Australia, cheaper Chinese imports could alleviate the cost-of-living crisis.</p>

          <p>Thomas Mann, a Nobel laureate and literary exile, is remembered as a significant cultural figure 150 years after his birth. His literary genius reflected a life of diverse experiences, particularly after fleeing Germany in the 1930s due to the Nazi regime. Mann's works, including "Buddenbrooks" and "The Magic Mountain," earned him global acclaim, while his political essays and radio speeches during and after the Nazi era addressed the German "catastrophe."

          <p>India's central bank exceeded market expectations by cutting its benchmark policy rate by 50 points to 5.5%, the lowest since August 2022. The Reserve Bank of India (RBI) Governor Sanjay Malhotra cited softened inflation and slower growth as reasons for the move. The decision follows better-than-expected GDP growth in the fiscal fourth quarter, but the RBI maintained its full-year GDP estimate at 6.5%. The RBI also shifted its monetary policy stance to "neutral" from "accommodative," indicating limited room for further rate cuts. (not investment advice)</p>

Judge Allison Burroughs issued a temporary restraining order, citing the immediate and irreparable injury Harvard would sustain, and extended a previous hold on the administration's attempt to end Harvard's enrollment of international students. Harvard has attracted a growing number of international students, making it vulnerable to Trump's crackdown.</p>

          <p>A new report by PwC challenges common myths about AI's impact on jobs, finding that AI actually increases worker value. The report analyzed over 800 million job ads and company financial reports, revealing that AI is creating jobs and raising wages in AI-exposed occupations. Productivity growth has nearly quadrupled in industries positioned to adopt AI, and wages for workers with AI skills are significantly higher. The report suggests that workers need to adapt to new skills rather than fear job losses.</p>

MSC's Marie-Caroline Laurent stated that the competitiveness of Chinese shipyards is unmatched in the short term, especially for new vessels needed for the energy transition. The International Maritime Organisation's goal to achieve net-zero emissions has driven investments in decarbonization technologies, leading to a rise in new ship orders.
