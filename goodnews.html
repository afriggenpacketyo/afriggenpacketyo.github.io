        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>The House of Representatives passed a multitrillion-dollar tax and spending package, including many of President Donald Trump's priorities, and now policy experts anticipate Senate changes as GOP lawmakers aim to finalize the "big bill" by the Fourth of July. If enacted as drafted, the "One Big Beautiful Bill Act" would make Trump's 2017 tax cuts permanent and add new tax breaks, while also approving significant spending cuts to programs for low-income families. Policy experts expect considerable debate in the Senate, particularly regarding the Medicaid provision, though the overall bill is not expected to differ greatly. The outcome of these negotiations will significantly impact fiscal policy and social welfare programs. (not investment advice)</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Treasury Secretary Scott Bessent defended the Trump administration's tariff policies, stating that while some companies have announced price hikes, others like Home Depot and Amazon will not pass costs to consumers. President Trump doubled the tariff on foreign steel to 50% and accused China of violating a trade agreement by withholding critical exports. Bessent emphasized that the administration aims to "de-risk" from China, not decouple, citing national and economic security concerns, however retailers like Walmart and Best Buy warn that high tariffs could raise prices. Bessent argues that companies often present worst-case scenarios on earnings calls to mitigate legal risks, highlighting the administration's commitment to its trade stance.</p>

West Indies' 308 was built on Keacy Carty's century and half-centuries from Brandon King and Shai Hope, though England's sloppy fielding assisted the visitors.
