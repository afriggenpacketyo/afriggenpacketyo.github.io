        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>A federal judge has issued a preliminary injunction preventing President Trump from firing Federal Reserve Governor Lisa Cook. The judge ruled that Cook showed a strong likelihood that the removal attempt violated the Federal Reserve Act's "for cause" provision, suggesting it applies to conduct in office, not prior allegations. This decision allows Cook to participate in the upcoming Fed meeting and underscores the legal battle over the central bank's independence from political interference. The White House has stated it will continue to contest the ruling.</p>

          <p>El Salvador's government announced the seizure of 1.4 tons of cocaine, valued at approximately $35 million, found floating in the Pacific Ocean about 1,000 miles from its coast. President Nayib Bukele framed the operation as a significant blow against international drug trafficking, noting that the country has confiscated over 37 tons of cocaine since 2024. The U.S. Embassy praised the seizure, highlighting growing cooperation in combating criminal networks that use Central America as a key transit route for narcotics heading to the United States.</p>

          <p>San Diego Padres outfielder Fernando Tatis Jr. made an extraordinary defensive play, leaping at the wall to rob Cincinnati Reds catcher Tyler Stephenson of a home run. The incredible catch occurred in the fourth inning and momentarily kept the Padres in the game. However, Stephenson later hit a decisive two-run home run in the ninth inning, securing a 4-2 victory for the Reds. The win keeps Cincinnati's wildcard playoff hopes alive, while the Padres remain in a tight race for their division title.</p>

          <h2>Explainer: Why 15 Million Vacant U.S. Homes Are Not a Simple Fix for the Housing Crisis</h2>
          <div class="timestamp">2025-09-10 07:30:00 EDT</div>
        </div>
        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Despite a severe housing shortage in the United States, the existence of nearly 15 million vacant homes does not offer a straightforward solution. This article explains that the term "vacant" covers a wide range of situations, including homes for rent, seasonal vacation properties, and houses undergoing repairs, which are part of a normal housing market churn. While programs in cities like Detroit and Baltimore are working to reclaim derelict properties, these efforts are geographically limited and cannot address affordability issues in high-demand areas. The analysis concludes that solving the crisis requires building more new homes, not just repurposing existing ones.</p>

          <p>European stocks saw gains on Wednesday morning as market participants anticipated the release of key U.S. inflation data, which is expected to influence the Federal Reserve's upcoming interest rate decision. Retail and pharmaceutical sectors showed strong performance, with Zara's parent company Inditex jumping 6.3% after a positive sales update and Novo Nordisk rising after announcing a corporate restructuring. The market mood was also shaped by reports of potential U.S. pressure on the EU regarding tariffs on China and India over Russian oil purchases, adding a layer of geopolitical consideration for investors.

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>A significant drop in mortgage interest rates has spurred the largest weekly volume of mortgage applications in three years. According to the Mortgage Bankers Association, total application volume jumped 9.2% last week, with both home purchase and refinancing applications rising sharply. The average contract rate for a 30-year fixed-rate mortgage fell to 6.49%, its lowest level since October 2024, encouraging potential homebuyers and allowing recent purchasers to refinance. This spike in activity suggests a high level of pent-up demand in the housing market, sensitive to even modest rate decreases. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>Alcohol brands Strongbow and Jägermeister have removed social media advertisements after the UK's Advertising Standards Authority (ASA) ruled they were irresponsible. A Jägermeister ad was found to breach the code by implying alcohol was a key component of social success. A Strongbow ad, which featured a comedian being goaded by a talking can of cider to skip writing his wedding vows for a barbecue, was banned for suggesting alcohol could take priority over significant life events. Both companies accepted the watchdog's judgment and have taken down the respective posts.</p>

          <p>Cambodian Deputy Prime Minister Sun Chanthol has publicly rejected the characterization of China's Belt and Road Initiative (BRI) as a "debt trap" for developing nations. Speaking at a summit in Hong Kong, he asserted that the infrastructure strategy has been highly beneficial for his country's economic growth. He cited Chinese-funded roads, an airport, and an expressway as key projects that have positively impacted the Cambodian people. His comments align with Chinese President Xi Jinping's recent pledge to continue building an "open world economy" through such international partnerships.</p>

          <p>The universities of Kent and Greenwich are set to merge by the autumn of 2026, creating what is being described as the UK's first "super-university" with nearly 50,000 students. The new institution, proposed to be named the London and South East University Group, aims to create a stronger financial foundation to navigate the economic challenges facing the higher education sector. While university leaders insist the move is a strategic merger and not a takeover, the University and College Union has raised concerns about likely redundancies, arguing the merger is a response to Kent's near-insolvency.</p>

          <p>This opinion article argues that the United States is at risk of losing its status as the world's innovation leader due to cuts in federal research funding and political attacks on free inquiry. The authors contend that public investment in basic science has historically been the foundation for transformative technologies and companies, from Intel to Google. They warn that competitors like China are heavily investing in this area while the U.S. falls behind. The piece calls for a bipartisan renewal of support for research, small businesses, and academic freedom to ensure the nation's long-term economic dynamism.</p>

          <p>The first onshore wave power project in the United States has officially launched at the Port of Los Angeles. Developed by the Swedish company Eco Wave Power, the pilot project uses a series of steel floaters attached to a wharf to harness the ocean's movement, generating clean electricity around the clock. While the initial pilot will only power about 100 homes, the company aims to scale up the technology along the port's breakwater to eventually power 60,000 homes. This innovative approach keeps expensive equipment on land, making it easier to maintain and less disruptive to the marine environment.</p>

          <p>In this personal essay, the author recounts the alarming experience of discovering that a bat found in their backyard, which had been near their dog, tested positive for rabies. The incident transformed a once-anachronistic fear into a modern-day reality, underscoring the critical role of vaccinations in preventing a fatal disease. The author describes the reassuring and efficient response from veterinarians and public health officials, which contrasted sharply with the potential horror of the disease itself. The experience serves as a powerful, firsthand argument against vaccine complacency, highlighting how scientific progress has protected generations from once-common threats.</p>
