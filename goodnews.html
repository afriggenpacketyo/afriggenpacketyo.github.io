        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>The Congressional Budget Office (CBO), a nonpartisan agency that analyzes the budgetary impacts of bills, is facing criticism from Republicans after projecting that recent Republican legislation would increase federal deficits by $2.4 trillion over a decade. Republicans, including President Trump and House Speaker Mike Johnson, have questioned the CBO's estimates, alleging bias and a lack of understanding of economic growth. The CBO was established in 1974 to provide Congress with objective information about the budgetary impacts of proposed bills, acting as a counterbalance to the executive branch's Office of Management and Budget, and makes no policy recommendations.</p>

          <p>Apple's AI strategy is facing increased scrutiny as the company's initial foray into the field, Apple Intelligence, has been met with underwhelming reviews and setbacks. Despite advantages like a large installed base of iPhones and custom-designed chips, Apple has struggled to keep pace with rivals like OpenAI and Google in launching new generative AI models. Investors are urging Apple to make significant strides in AI, particularly as some executives suggest that the technology could eventually replace the iPhone. While Apple has reportedly reorganized its AI teams, it faces renewed competition and must demonstrate a clear vision for its AI future at the upcoming Worldwide Developers Conference.</p>

          <p>The Supreme Court has granted the Department of Government Efficiency (DOGE) access to Social Security data and allowed the team to shield records. As Elon Musk departs Washington, the team he assembled to identify waste and abuse in government has secured dual victories in the Supreme Court. This decision allows DOGE to continue its mission of streamlining government operations and reducing unnecessary spending. The move is seen as a significant win for the Trump administration's efforts to improve government efficiency.</p>

          <p>"We Are Guardians" is a documentary highlighting the efforts of Indigenous people to combat deforestation in the Amazon. The film juxtaposes the beauty of the rainforest with the devastation caused by illegal logging and mining, focusing on the "forest guardians" who confront loggers at great personal risk. It also features an activist working to increase Indigenous women's political representation and explores the perspectives of loggers and landowners caught in the complexities of the situation. While comprehensive in its scope, the documentary's style sometimes feels more like a highlighting of issues than an immersive journey.</p>

Growing up in West Germany, the author viewed Harvard as a symbol of academic excellence, later becoming a visiting scholar there. The author highlights Harvard's mission of bridging differences through academic inquiry and criticizes the Trump administration's attempts to eliminate visa programs that enable international scholars to study in the U.S. The piece argues that Trump's perception of Harvard bears little resemblance to the reality of its diverse and inclusive academic community.</p>
