          <p>This article delves into some surprising facts about Elon Musk, highlighting his early entrepreneurial ventures such as creating a video game at age 12 and founding Zip2 with his brother. It also touches on his foray into unconventional products like perfume and tequila, and his initial involvement with X.com, which later became PayPal. The article further explains Musk's influence on the character of Tony Stark in the Iron Man movies, and clarifies that Musk was not the original founder of Tesla but an early investor who propelled the company to global recognition. The piece concludes by mentioning Musk's vision for X as an 'everything app' similar to WeChat. Optimism about Musk's endeavors remains somewhat mixed given his controversial management of Twitter.</p>

          <h2>UK Saltmarshes Play Crucial Role in Climate Change Mitigation, Report Reveals</h2>
          <div class="timestamp">2025-05-30 02:10:22 EDT</div>
        </div>
        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>A new report from WWF emphasizes the vital role of UK saltmarshes as carbon sinks, effectively locking away greenhouse gases in mud layers. The report calls for these tidal habitats to be included in the official UK inventory of carbon emissions and removals. Researchers monitored greenhouse gas levels at a restored saltmarsh in North-West England, revealing that the plants absorb more carbon dioxide in the summer than they release in winter. With the UK having lost a significant portion of its saltmarshes, the report advocates for their restoration and protection to combat climate change and protect against coastal flooding. The recognition of these sites could provide more incentive to protect and restore more of these sites.</p>

          <p>Japan's parliament has initiated its first debate in 28 years regarding legislation that would allow married couples to choose separate surnames. Currently, Japanese law mandates that married couples share a single family name, traditionally leading women to adopt their husband's surname. While public support for a dual family-name system is growing, the ruling Liberal Democratic Party remains hesitant, citing concerns about family cohesion and traditional values. Three opposition parties have submitted bills proposing different approaches to implementing the change, but their passage during the current Diet session appears unlikely. Despite this, the renewed discussion signifies a potential shift in societal attitudes towards marriage and family identity in Japan.</p>
