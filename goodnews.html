          <p>Senators Tim Scott and Cynthia Lummis are set to introduce a regulatory framework for digital assets, aiming to clarify the classification of crypto as either a commodity or a security. The proposed bill seeks to allow crypto exchanges to register with the Commodity Futures Trading Commission (CFTC) and reduce the Securities and Exchange Commission's (SEC) oversight of digital currencies. Sens. Thom Tillis and Bill Hagerty are also supporting the legislation, which includes measures to prevent money laundering and sanctions evasion. The Senate Banking Committee's subcommittee on digital assets will hold a hearing on the bill. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>Federal Reserve Chair Jerome Powell emphasized the central bank's dedication to controlling inflation, stating that policymakers are likely to maintain their current stance until the impact of tariffs on prices becomes clearer.

These cautious remarks come amid increased criticism from President Trump, who has publicly pressured Powell to take a different approach.

          <p>The decision to provide former Chancellor Olaf Scholz with a state-paid office and a staff of eight has drawn criticism from opposition parties in Germany, who deem it excessive. Critics argue that the allocation is an unnecessary use of taxpayer money, especially considering Scholz's relatively short tenure. Traditionally, former German chancellors and presidents receive such offices to continue serving the state, but this practice has faced increased scrutiny after controversies involving past leaders. Government officials defend the decision by highlighting Scholz's expertise, particularly regarding the ongoing war in Ukraine, which began during his time in office.</p>

Rutte emphasized that the U.S. expects European and Canadian allies to increase their defense investments to align more closely with U.S. spending levels. This year's summit is taking place against a backdrop of global conflicts and questions about the U.S.'s dedication to the alliance.

Over time, summer camps expanded to include girls, working-class children, and various ethnic and religious groups. Today, summer camp is a $3.5 billion industry that has adapted to the changing needs of families.</p>

          <p>Men are often told they should read fiction to improve their empathy or become better people, but the real reason is the thrill of escaping one's own consciousness and surroundings. Reading allows one to occupy a place that is totally for oneself and unaccountable to other people‚Äôs expectations. Literature reminds us that everyone is unexceptional and everyone is exceptional. Fiction reminds you that you exist along a continuum of human experiences, and that your own everyday ennui is less of a dead end and more of a data point.</p>
