          <p>Bitcoin experienced a significant surge, climbing above $100,000 for the first time since February, driven by positive sentiment surrounding a newly announced trade agreement between the U.S. and the United Kingdom. President Trump's announcement of the trade deal, which outlined increased market access for American exports, fueled investor confidence in the cryptocurrency market. Antoni Trenchev from Nexo highlighted Bitcoin's resilience and safe-haven status amid market uncertainty and geopolitical tensions, citing the pro-crypto Trump administration and strong buying from spot-ETF investors as contributing factors. The article suggests that Bitcoin's performance will continue to be tested by global macroeconomic and geopolitical events.</p>

          <p>The European Union has established a task force to assess whether President Trump's tariffs on Chinese goods are causing a diversion of Chinese shipments to Europe. The task force, collaborating with EU member states, will analyze customs data and shipping records to identify any sudden changes in trade flows that could harm local producers. The EU is particularly focused on sectors with industrial overcapacity and a high risk of dumping, and is prepared to implement safeguard measures, including import quotas and duties, to protect its industries from the secondary effects of U.S. tariffs. The EU aims to prevent a flood of Chinese steel products into its market as a result of Trump's trade policies.</p>

          <p>President Trump announced a trade agreement with the United Kingdom, the first such deal since implementing "reciprocal" tariffs, though the final details are still being finalized. The agreement includes provisions for increased market access for American exports, reduction of non-tariff barriers, and commitments on intellectual property, labor, and the environment. A 10% tariff on UK imports will remain, but adjustments will be made for UK autos. The deal also includes a potential trading union for steel and aluminum, and Prime Minister Keir Starmer lauded the agreement as a boost for trade and job creation between the two nations.</p>

          <p>President Trump announced the framework of a trade deal with the United Kingdom, which could ease the burden of tariffs and provide a political win for Prime Minister Keir Starmer. While the details are still being finalized, the agreement includes increased access for U.S. products to the U.K. market, but a 10% tariff on U.K. imports will remain in place. Commerce Secretary Howard Lutnick stated the deal will generate $6 billion in revenue for the U.S., and that Rolls Royce engines will not be subject to tariffs, and a British airline will buy $10 billion in Boeing planes.</p>

          <p>Prime Minister Keir Starmer's efforts to build a strong relationship with President Trump have yielded a trade agreement with the United States, offering a much-needed political victory. The deal, which comes after Trump imposed tariffs on numerous trading partners, affirms the "special relationship" between Britain and the U.S. Starmer's approach of avoiding direct criticism of Trump and acting as a bridge between Europe and the United States has seemingly paid off, although the details of the agreement and its potential impact on British farmers remain to be seen.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>The US and the UK have reached a deal over tariffs on some goods being traded between the countries. US President Donald Trump's blanket 10% tariffs on imports from countries around the world remains in place and still applies to most UK goods entering the US. But the deal has reversed or cut tariffs on the certain goods which make up the UK's biggest exports, including cars, steel and aluminium. This isn't a trade deal. US President Donald Trump declared on social media this announcement would be a "major trade deal" - it's not that. He does not have the authority to sign the type of free-trade agreement India and the UK finalised earlier this week - this lies with Congress. Congress would need to approve a trade agreement, which would take longer than the 90-day pause in place on some of Trump's tariffs. What was announced today is only the bare bones of a narrow agreement. There will be months of negotiations and legal paperwork to follow.</p>

          <p>In an era characterized by loud egos and increasing unhappiness, the author advocates for cultivating a "quiet ego" as a countercultural strategy for well-being. Quiet ego involves virtues like charity, humility, self-awareness, and hope, which are associated with better mood balance, life satisfaction, and a sense of meaning. The author suggests questioning conventional wisdom that prioritizes self-interest and cultivating a detached self-awareness. He proposes asking questions like "What do others need that only I can provide?" and practicing affirmations like "I might be wrong" and "I am not my emotions.</p>
