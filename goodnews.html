        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>A Kyodo News survey indicates that nearly 60% of Japanese citizens anticipate a decrease in rice prices under the leadership of the new farm minister, Shinjiro Koizumi, who replaced Taku Eto after Eto made controversial remarks about receiving gifted rice. The survey also revealed that 44.7% of respondents believe rice prices should fall below 3,000 yen per 5 kilograms, a lower target than Prime Minister Shigeru Ishiba's pledge. Additionally, 42.2% felt that the removal of the previous farm minister should have occurred sooner, while the approval rating for Ishiba's Cabinet rose slightly to 31.7%.</p>

          <p>Prime Minister Shigeru Ishiba has committed to improving the treatment and working conditions of Japan's Self-Defense Forces (SDF) members, acknowledging the increasingly challenging security environment. During a meeting with young personnel in Kyoto Prefecture, Ishiba emphasized the government's commitment to appropriately compensating SDF members for their duties. This pledge follows the enactment of a revised law that includes enhanced allowances for SDF members and aims to address a recruitment shortage. The move also comes amid recent scandals that have affected public trust in the SDF, even as the government seeks to bolster the nation's defense capabilities.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>South Western Railway (SWR) has become the first train company to be renationalized under Labour, with the first nationalized service departing on time from Woking to Surbiton. The government has called this a "new dawn for rail" but has refrained from promising lower fares, focusing instead on service improvements and infrastructure investment. The trains are now the responsibility of the Department for Transport (DfT) Operator and will be integrated into Great British Railways (GBR), though GBR will not officially exist until MPs vote to create it. Transport Secretary Heidi Alexander stated that she will ensure customers get good value for money.</p>

          <p>The European Union is currently engaged in a trade dispute with China regarding electric vehicles, leading to a debate about whether Chinese investment in the sector can be a job creator or an industry killer. Chinese company Windrose Technology plans to build a ‚Ç¨175 million factory in northern France, reflecting a broader discussion about how to leverage China's expertise in the EV sector. Windrose Technology aims to produce 4,000 electric trucks annually in France starting in 2027 and is considering a U.S. plant, with plans to list on a U.S. stock exchange and a secondary listing in France.</p>

          <p>Following the first detection of West Nile virus in UK mosquitoes, a virologist at the University of Nottingham, Prof Jonathan Ball, urges calm, stating that while mosquito-borne diseases are likely to increase in range due to climate change, the public need not be overly concerned. The UK Health Security Agency (UKHSA) found fragments of the virus in wetland in Retford, Nottinghamshire, though there have been no reported human cases of locally-acquired West Nile Virus in the UK to date. Prof Ball explained that the virus primarily affects birds and mosquitoes, with occasional transmission to humans causing mild symptoms in most cases, but severe disease in a small percentage.</p>

          <p>A growing number of young adults in Europe are seeking to disconnect from their smartphones, with a British survey revealing that nearly half would prefer a world without the internet. One Dutch startup, The Offline Club, organizes events and retreats promoting real-time interactions without phones or laptops. Studies indicate that excessive smartphone use is linked to mental health issues, leading some countries to consider measures like digital curfews and raising the age limit for social media use. These efforts reflect a desire to balance the benefits of technology with the need for well-being and face-to-face connections.</p>
