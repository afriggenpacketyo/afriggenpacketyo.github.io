          <h2>Trump Announces Framework for UK Trade Deal, Citing Increased Market Access</h2>

          <p>President Trump announced the broad outline of a trade agreement with the United Kingdom, marking the first such deal since the implementation of 'reciprocal' tariffs in April. While specific details are still being finalized, Trump highlighted that the agreement aims to increase market access for American exports by billions of dollars and reduce non-tariff barriers. The deal maintains a 10% U.S. tariff on UK imports, adjusts tariffs on UK autos, and seeks to create a $5 billion opportunity for new U.S. agricultural exports. Experts have downplayed the impact of the deal, suggesting it is a small win with limited scope.</p>

          <p>The US and the UK have reached an agreement over tariffs on some goods traded between the countries, reducing or removing tariffs on cars, steel, and aluminum. While President Trump's 10% blanket tariffs remain in place, the deal cuts car tariffs to 10% for up to 100,000 UK cars annually and scraps tariffs on steel and aluminum imports. The BBC article notes that pharmaceuticals remain a key unknown, and there is no change to the UK's digital services tax on US firms. The agreement is not a comprehensive trade deal but a narrow agreement with further negotiations expected.</p>
