          <h2>Ford Suspends 2025 Financial Guidance Due to Tariff Impact</h2>
          <div class="timestamp">2025-05-05 16:25:03 EDT</div>
        </div>
        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Ford Motor has suspended its 2025 financial guidance due to an expected $2.5 billion impact from President Trump's tariffs, despite exceeding Wall Street's first-quarter expectations. The company anticipates offsetting $1 billion of these costs through remediation actions, but cites potential industry-wide supply chain disruptions and further tariff increases as reasons for the suspension. Ford's CFO, Sherry House, stated that the company's turnaround plan is working and that Ford is transforming into a higher growth, higher margin business. The tariff impact stems from 25% tariffs on imported vehicles and auto parts not compliant with the USMCA agreement, leading Ford to cease U.S. exports to China and adjust imports from China.</p>

          <p>Palantir has increased its revenue guidance following a significant surge in both commercial and government revenue, driven by increased adoption of its artificial intelligence software. CEO Alex Karp attributes the growth to a "tectonic shift" in AI adoption, noting a 71% increase in commercial revenues and a 45% jump in government segment sales. Palantir forecasts U.S. commercial revenues to exceed $1.178 billion this year, fueled by greater U.S. defense sector adoption of its tools. Karp also highlighted the growing demand for large language models and supporting software, describing it as a "stampede."</p>

          <p>The White House has condemned House Democrats for attempting to obstruct Republican plans to permanently rename the Gulf of Mexico as the Gulf of America. Democratic lawmakers have introduced amendments aimed at reversing Trump's decision to rename Mt. McKinley and limit oil and gas drilling in the Gulf region. One amendment also seeks to prevent retribution against news organizations that continue to use the former name. A White House spokeswoman asserted that Democrats are putting America last due to "Trump Derangement Syndrome," while a Democratic representative countered that the renaming is a "vanity project" that accomplishes nothing.</p>

          <p>Elon Musk's presence in West Lake Hills, Texas, has sparked conflict with neighbors due to the construction of a 16-foot chain-link fence and increased security measures at his $6 million mansion. Neighbors have complained about traffic, noise, and the presence of security personnel, leading to disputes over city ordinances and permits. Musk's team failed to obtain permits for the fence and gate, violating several city regulations. The Zoning and Planning Commission rejected his request for retroactive permission, potentially requiring him to remove the structures. Neighbors have expressed frustration with the disruption and perceived lack of consideration from Musk and his staff.</p>
