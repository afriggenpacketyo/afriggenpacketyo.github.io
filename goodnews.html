          <p>China's factory activity showed surprising growth in June according to the private Caixin/S&P Global manufacturing PMI, which rose to 50.4 from 48.3 in May. This result contrasts with the official government PMI that indicated a third consecutive month of contraction, highlighting a divergence between smaller, export-focused firms and larger state-owned enterprises. The expansion is partly attributed to exporters front-loading shipments to avoid potential U.S. tariffs, though analysts question if this momentum is sustainable. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>A team of Chinese scientists has discovered that betaine, a compound naturally produced in the kidneys during long-term exercise, may play a key role in slowing the aging process. Their research, published in the journal Cell, found that betaine helps prevent inflammation and the aging of organs by inhibiting a specific enzyme. These findings provide new insight into the molecular mechanisms behind the anti-aging benefits of physical activity and could inform future strategies to mimic these effects.</p>
