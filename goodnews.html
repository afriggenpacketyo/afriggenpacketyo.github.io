        </div>
        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>U.S. investors are increasingly acquiring ownership stakes in major European soccer clubs, attracted by soaring revenues that have grown over 750% since the Premier League's inception. This influx of American capital, now present in a majority of Premier League teams, has driven club valuations to record highs, such as Manchester United's recent £5 billion valuation. The trend is partly fueled by the relative affordability of European soccer teams compared to top-tier U.S. sports franchises. However, the popular multi-club ownership model faces growing regulatory scrutiny from governing bodies like UEFA, which could impact future investment strategies. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>The Chinese animated film 'Nobody' has become the highest-grossing 2D animated movie in China's box office history, surpassing Japanese hits like 'Suzume' and 'The Boy and the Heron.' Based on a 2023 online series, the film has earned over 1 billion yuan and is being celebrated for its unique aesthetic that incorporates traditional ink-wash painting techniques. The success of 'Nobody' marks a significant moment for China's domestic animation industry, challenging the long-standing box office dominance of Japanese anime. The film's supervisor highlighted its innovative use of ink to construct shots, creating a distinct visual style.</p>

          <div class="timestamp">2025-08-19 06:28:23 EDT</div>
        </div>
        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>New consumer research indicates that people are spending less at casual and fast-food restaurants, with a 6% drop in customers over the summer compared to last year. This decline is attributed to persistently high grocery prices, which are influencing broader spending habits. However, instead of switching to cheaper store-brand groceries, many shoppers are opting for smaller, branded treats from supermarkets as a more affordable indulgence than dining out. While restaurants have seen a decline, coffee shops have bucked the trend with a 3% increase in visits, suggesting consumers are still seeking small, cost-effective rewards.</p>

          <p>Air Canada's flight attendants have ended their four-day strike after their union, CUPE, reached a tentative agreement with the airline early Tuesday morning. The strike, which began Saturday, had disrupted travel for approximately 130,000 passengers daily during the peak summer season and led to over 2,500 flight cancellations. The union had previously defied two back-to-work orders from the Canada Industrial Relations Board, with union leaders risking fines and jail time to continue negotiations over pay and unpaid work on the ground. The breakthrough came after a late-night bargaining session assisted by a federal mediator.</p>

Despite this, the company maintained its full-year forecast, anticipating total sales growth of 2.8% and attributing the current sluggishness to a "deferral mindset" among homeowners amid a slow real estate market. The home improvement retailer noted some positive signs, including a 2.6% rise in big-ticket transactions over $1,000 and improving sales trends throughout the quarter, signaling some resilience in its business.

          <p>In response to increased flooding and drought caused by climate change, the Flanders region of Belgium is turning to nature-based solutions like wetland restoration. For centuries, the area's natural landscape was altered for agriculture, but now projects are underway to "depolder" land, giving rivers more space and creating flood zones that can absorb excess water. In the city of Mechelen, a local organization is restoring wetlands capable of holding vast amounts of water, while the city replaces paved surfaces with green spaces. These initiatives, part of a broader strategy, aim to mitigate flood risk in a densely populated and heavily urbanized region.</p>

          <p>Memphis International Airport is set to launch three new nonstop flight routes in September, offering service to Knoxville, Tennessee; Pensacola, Florida; and New York's JFK Airport. The new flights, operated by Allegiant Air, Breeze Airways, and Delta Air Lines respectively, are expected to boost passenger numbers at the airport, which has seen a slight decrease in traffic compared to the previous year. The Knoxville route is timed for the college football season, while the JFK flight will operate seasonally. These additions bring the total number of new routes announced by the airport in 2025 to ten, enhancing connectivity for Memphis-area travelers.</p>

          <p>In an effort to reverse declining sales and broaden its product selection, Best Buy has launched a third-party marketplace on its website and app. The new platform will feature items from around 500 vetted sellers, including tech accessories, seasonal decor, and furniture that complements its core electronics offerings. This move follows a trend set by other major retailers like Amazon and Walmart, allowing Best Buy to take a commission on sales without managing inventory. The company hopes the marketplace will fill gaps in its assortment, provide a new profit stream, and support its growing advertising business amid a challenging retail environment.

          <p>Cinematographer Jacques Jouffret discusses the visual strategy for the series "American Primeval," which aimed to reflect the harsh and untamed environment of 1857 Utah. To create a direct connection between the characters and the camera, Jouffret utilized a straightforward, mostly handheld approach with minimal equipment. The goal was not to create conventionally beautiful shots but to find beauty within the raw, visceral reality of the characters' struggle for survival. The series' visual style, including the use of Dutch angles, was designed to reinforce the unsettling and unstable conditions of the American frontier, where violence was constant and the future uncertain.</p>

He later became a major philanthropist, donating over $3 million to his alma mater, Howard University, making him the most generous benefactor to architecture programs at historically Black colleges.

          <p>In the Swedish city of Kiruna, a 113-year-old landmark church is being moved 5 kilometers to a new location to protect it from ground subsidence caused by over a century of iron ore mining. The massive 672-tonne red timber structure has been hoisted onto giant trailers for a two-day journey at a maximum speed of 500 meters per hour. This move is the most symbolic part of a wider city relocation project, paid for by the mining company, which is necessary because the old city center is at risk from ground fissures. The church's most precious artifacts, including a large altar painting, remain inside, carefully stabilized for the trip.</p>
