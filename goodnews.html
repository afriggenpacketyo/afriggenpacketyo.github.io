          <p>Federal Reserve Chair Jerome Powell is scheduled to deliver a highly anticipated speech at the Jackson Hole economic symposium, where markets expect signals about a potential September interest rate cut. The address comes amid significant political pressure from the Trump administration, raising questions about the central bank's independence. Analysts will be closely watching Powell's characterization of the labor market and inflation, as well as any discussion on the Fed's long-term policy framework. The speech is viewed as a critical moment that could shape near-term market sentiment and the Fed's future policy trajectory. (not investment advice)</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Amid rising national credit card debt and high interest rates, debt forgiveness programs offer a potential solution for some struggling consumers. This article outlines the typical qualifications for such programs, which involve negotiating with creditors to settle debts for less than the full amount. Generally, candidates must have substantial unsecured debt (often over $7,500), be facing verifiable financial hardship, and be delinquent or at risk of falling behind on payments. While this path can provide significant relief, it can also negatively impact credit scores. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>Tennis legend Serena Williams has publicly shared her experience of losing 31 pounds with the assistance of a GLP-1 medication. The 43-year-old athlete explained that after the birth of her second child, she struggled with health issues related to her weight, including joint pain, despite her active lifestyle. Williams stated her goal in speaking out is to help destigmatize the use of such medications for health purposes, clarifying that it was not a "shortcut" but a necessary step for her well-being. She emphasized that her decision was driven by health concerns rather than societal pressure.</p>

        </div>
        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>New research indicates a growing trend of U.S. adults ordering meals from children's menus at restaurants, with 44% of those surveyed admitting to doing so. The primary motivations cited are saving money and preferring smaller portion sizes, as kids' meals are typically less expensive. This consumer behavior comes as some restaurant chains report slowing sales, potentially due to economic pressures on low-income households. The trend suggests diners are actively seeking value and simplicity in response to rising costs, turning to options traditionally reserved for children.</p>

          <h2>Booming Data Center Industry Faces Shortage of Skilled Trade Workers</h2>

          <p>The rapid expansion of data centers, driven by AI and cloud computing, is creating a critical shortage of skilled trade workers such as electricians, plumbers, and HVAC technicians. As older workers retire, fewer young people are entering these fields, creating a labor gap that threatens the ability of these essential facilities to operate. The demand for these roles now puts data centers in direct competition with manufacturing and other industries for a shrinking pool of talent. Industry leaders are exploring technological solutions and aggressive recruitment to address the estimated 400,000 unfilled trade jobs in the U.S.</p>

          <h2>New Pharmaceutical Plant Highlights Challenges for Drugmakers Amid Tariff Threats</h2>

          <p>Fujifilm's new $3 billion biologics manufacturing plant in North Carolina illustrates the significant time and investment required for pharmaceutical companies to expand U.S. production. The five-year project timeline shows how difficult it would be for the industry to quickly pivot manufacturing onshore in response to President Trump's tariff threats. While many drugmakers were already increasing U.S. capacity due to tax incentives, the complexity of building and certifying new facilities makes them vulnerable to trade policy shifts. An updated trade framework with the EU may subject pharma imports to a more manageable 15% tariff.</p>

          <p>Sales of previously owned homes in the U.S. rose by 2% in July compared to June, exceeding analysts' expectations, according to the National Association of Realtors. This uptick in sales coincided with a 15.7% year-over-year increase in the number of homes for sale, the highest inventory level since May 2020. The additional supply is helping to ease pressure on prices, with the median home price showing only a slight 0.2% annual increase. The data suggests the housing market may be reaching an inflection point, with improved affordability and more choices for buyers. (not investment advice)</p>
