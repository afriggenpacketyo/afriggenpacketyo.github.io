          <p>Attorney General Lord Richard Hermer emphasized the Starmer government's commitment to international law as central to its foreign policy approach. In an interview, Hermer defended Starmer's strategy of maintaining a positive relationship with the U.S. even if it means sacrificing short-term political gains. He argued this approach has facilitated trade deals with the U.S., India, and the EU, highlighting the importance of trust and compliance in international relations. Hermer also addressed criticism of his past remarks, reaffirming the government's dedication to upholding both domestic and international law in the national interest. The attorney general's comments aim to clarify the government's position amidst diplomatic challenges, especially concerning the conflict between Israel and Iran.</p>

The memorial aims to reflect on the Queen's extraordinary life and service to the nation, with the location chosen for its visibility from Buckingham Palace. There is no set date for completion, and the final cost is yet to be determined, but the design seeks to balance traditional and modern elements.</p>

Judge Allison Burroughs issued an injunction, citing concerns that the administration's actions violated Harvard's free speech rights.

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>RBN Energy executive Rusty Braziel believes Iran is unlikely to close the Strait of Hormuz despite recent tensions, as such action would harm its own oil exports. Braziel noted that Iran has threatened to close the strait during major conflicts for over 20 years but has never followed through due to its economic dependence on the passage. He also warned that U.S. restrictions on ethane trade to China are creating issues for exporters, potentially damaging the U.S.'s reputation as a trustworthy energy supplier. Oil prices dropped on Monday, indicating that the market has concluded that Iran won't close the strait. (not investment advice)</p>
