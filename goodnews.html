        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>A top economist from China International Capital Corporation argues that China holds a significant "comparative advantage" in the global race to develop stablecoins. The reasoning is that the country's existing third-party payment platforms, like WeChat Pay and Alipay, already function in a similar manner to stablecoins and are supported by a mature regulatory framework. According to the analysis, this platform-based digital money is an extension of legal tender with strong safeguards, giving China a head start. (not investment advice)</p>

If adopted under the Washington Convention, the proposal would require export permits and proof of legal capture for species like the Japanese eel, starting in June 2027. The measure is intended to protect endangered eel populations from overfishing and illegal trade, reflecting growing conservation concerns.</p>
