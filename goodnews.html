          <p>Nvidia CEO Jensen Huang expressed increased optimism about quantum computing, stating that it is reaching an inflection point. During his keynote speech at Nvidia's GTC Paris developer conference, Huang noted that quantum computers are nearing the ability to solve real-world problems in the coming years. He also acknowledged the growing quantum computing community in Europe, highlighting his meeting with French quantum startup Pasqal. Quantum computers use quantum bits (qubits) to process large volumes of data, potentially leading to breakthroughs in medicine, science, and finance. The current progress indicates a promising future for quantum computing applications.</p>

          <p>The U.S. Army is set to celebrate its 250th anniversary with a festival and parade in Washington, D.C., on June 14, coinciding with President Trump's 79th birthday. The event is expected to feature approximately 6,600 soldiers, 150 vehicles, and over 50 aircraft. The festival will take place on the National Mall, followed by a parade along Constitution Avenue and a fireworks show. Army officials estimate the total cost to be between $25-45 million, with Secretary Dan Driscoll justifying the expense as an opportunity to boost recruitment. The parade will showcase the Army's history from the Revolutionary War to the present day.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>iFlytek, a Chinese voice recognition solution provider, admits that using domestically produced semiconductors could extend the development of artificial intelligence (AI) models by three months. Chairman Liu Qingfeng stated that this delay is due to the need for additional computing resources compared to using Nvidia chips. iFlytek has been using domestic chips like Huawei's Ascend 910B to mitigate the risk of losing access to imported chips, as the company is on the U.S. Entity List. Despite the delays, Liu noted that the training efficiency of the Ascend 910B has improved significantly when benchmarked against Nvidia's A800.</p>

          <p>England's recent defeat by Senegal has raised concerns among fans about the team's direction under coach Thomas Tuchel, who replaced Gareth Southgate after the Euro 2024 final. This loss marked the first time an African team has defeated England in 22 attempts. Midfielder Morgan Gibbs-White expressed disappointment, stating the team let the country down. Tuchel, who signed an 18-month contract, has had limited time to make significant changes, leading to questions about the team's identity and playing style. The defeat has prompted discussions about whether Tuchel will implement a new system or continue with the previous approach.</p>

          <p>Elon Musk has publicly stated that he regrets some of his recent posts criticizing President Donald Trump, admitting they went too far. This follows a public dispute between the two, sparked by Musk's criticism of Trump's tax bill, which he called a 'disgusting abomination.' Trump responded by declaring their relationship over and threatening to cancel Musk's government contracts. Musk's initial criticisms included unsubstantiated claims about Trump's involvement with Jeffrey Epstein and calls for his impeachment; however, he has since deleted most of these posts.</p>

          <p>The Montana Supreme Court has upheld a lower court's decision to strike down several state laws restricting abortion access, including a ban on abortions after 20 weeks of gestation. The court cited the state constitution's "right to be left alone," affirming access to abortions. This decision remains unaffected by the U.S. Supreme Court's 2022 ruling that overturned Roe v. Wade. The challenged laws included prohibitions against telehealth prescriptions for abortion medication, a 24-hour waiting period, and mandatory ultrasound options. A lawsuit has been filed challenging the voter-approved initiative that enshrined abortion rights in the Montana Constitution.</p>

This reverses the existing A + H pathway, which allows mainland-listed companies to add dual listings in Hong Kong.

          <p>South Korea's military has halted its loudspeaker propaganda broadcasts across the border to North Korea in an effort to 'restore trust' between the two countries. This decision comes after the election of new President Lee Jae-myung, who campaigned on improving inter-Korean relations. North Korea has historically viewed these broadcasts as an act of war and has threatened to retaliate. The broadcasts, which included news and information about democracy, had been paused for six years but resumed last year in response to North Korea's balloon campaign. Organizations advocating for North Korean human rights have criticized the suspension, while residents along the border have welcomed the move.</p>
