        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>A federal appeals court has ruled that the Justice Department cannot represent Donald Trump in his appeal of the $83 million defamation case brought by E. Jean Carroll. The court denied Trump's request for DOJ lawyers to argue on his behalf, meaning American taxpayers will not fund the appeal. Carroll was awarded damages after Trump defamed her in 2019 when denying her accusation of sexual assault. The DOJ had argued that Trump's alleged conduct fell within his presidential role, but the court disagreed. Oral arguments for the appeal are scheduled for June 24.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>President Donald Trump, during a press conference about the installation of new flagpoles at the White House, jokingly inquired about the immigration status of the construction workers. After discussing his administration's deportation efforts, Trump turned to the workers and asked if any were undocumented immigrants. The workers shook their heads, and Trump added, "If there were, we'll find out." He also remarked that their lives could be "destroyed" due to the press conference. These comments came as Trump instructed ICE officers to pursue a mass deportation program.</p>

        </div>
        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>As President Donald Trump imposes tariffs, companies are using "tariff engineering" to lower duty costs by altering product materials and classifications. This legal practice involves modifying items to fit into different "harmonized system codes." For example, some manufacturers bundled steel and aluminum to qualify for lower duties, but now remove them due to increased tariffs on those materials. Companies like Columbia Sportswear and Converse have also used strategic design choices to save on tariffs, such as adding pockets to shirts or fuzzy felt to sneaker soles. This practice allows businesses to navigate the complex tariff system and reduce their financial liabilities.</p>

Hashimoto stated that Nippon Steel aims to strengthen its U.S. unit's overseas operations. The company finalized a $14.1 billion deal to make U.S. Steel a wholly owned subsidiary, following Trump's approval and a National Security Agreement with the U.S. government.
