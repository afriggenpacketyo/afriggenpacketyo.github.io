          <p>CNN's Chief Medical Correspondent, Dr. Sanjay Gupta, discusses his new book, "It Doesn't Have to Hurt," which explores the complex nature of pain. He explains that the brain is the ultimate decider of pain, capable of creating sensations like phantom limb pain or misinterpreting signals, but it can also be trained through methods like meditation to minimize discomfort. The article also covers the body's natural opioid system, which can be activated by savoring pleasurable experiences, and introduces a new FDA-approved non-opioid pain medication inspired by a unique genetic trait found in a family of Pakistani circus performers. Gupta also notes that the data supporting cannabis for pain relief is not as compelling as commonly believed.</p>

          <p>Daniel Levy, the Premier League's longest-serving chairman, has stepped down from his role at Tottenham Hotspur after nearly 25 years. The decision was reportedly made by the club's ownership group, the Tavistock Group, amid a belief that new leadership is needed to achieve sustained sporting success. During his tenure, Levy oversaw the construction of a new billion-pound stadium and a Champions League final appearance, but the club won only two major trophies, leading to frequent fan protests. Peter Charrington will become the non-executive chairman in a new leadership structure aimed at bringing stability and empowering a new executive team.</p>

          <p>The Department of Transportation is officially withdrawing a proposed rule that would have mandated airlines to provide cash compensation to passengers for significant flight delays or cancellations within the carrier's control. The rule, introduced under the Biden administration, would have required payments up to $775 for long delays. Airline industry groups, who had opposed the measure, praised the decision, arguing the regulation would have driven up ticket prices and was an overreach of the department's authority. The move aligns with the current administration's broader deregulatory agenda, leaving rebooking and vouchers as the primary remedies for affected passengers.</p>

As part of the deal, Goldman Sachs will invest up to $1 billion to acquire a stake of up to 3.5% in T. Rowe Price through open market purchases. The partnership aims to develop and offer private market investment products to a broader base of retail investors, including individuals and retirement plan participants. This move is seen as a strategic effort by T.

          <p>Quantinuum, the quantum computing company majority-owned by Honeywell, has raised an additional $600 million in funding, doubling its valuation to approximately $10 billion.

Honeywell's leadership views the IPO as a key step to commercialize the business and unlock significant value from its long-term investment. Quantum computing promises to solve complex problems far beyond the capabilities of traditional computers, attracting major interest from the technology and financial services industries.

          <p>The U.S. government announced a significant investment in lenacapavir, a new HIV prevention drug that requires only two injections per year. The initiative aims to provide the antiretroviral medication to two million people in low- and middle-income countries by 2028, with a focus on preventing mother-to-child transmission. This move has been praised by the global health community as a potential game-changer in controlling the HIV epidemic, particularly after previous foreign aid cuts severely impacted prevention programs. The partnership involves the Global Fund and the drug's manufacturer, Gilead Sciences, and signals a renewed U.S. commitment to global HIV prevention efforts.</p>

The guest list reportedly includes Meta's Mark Zuckerberg, Apple's Tim Cook, Microsoft founder Bill Gates, and OpenAI's Sam Altman. Notably absent will be Tesla CEO Elon Musk, who confirmed he was invited but could not attend, though he is sending a representative. The dinner follows a public falling out between Trump and Musk earlier in the year, although the president recently predicted Musk would eventually return to the Republican fold. The event underscores the administration's ongoing efforts to cultivate relationships with key figures in the technology sector.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>A new bill, titled the "You Earn It, You Keep It Act," has been introduced by Democrats in Congress to permanently eliminate all federal income taxes on Social Security benefits. To offset the cost and bolster the program's finances, the legislation proposes expanding the Social Security payroll tax to apply to all annual earnings above $250,000. Currently, payroll taxes are only levied on income up to $176,100. Proponents argue this change would provide much-needed relief to seniors while ensuring the wealthiest Americans contribute more equitably. According to an analysis, the proposal would extend the Social Security trust funds' solvency for an additional 24 years. (not investment advice)</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>A recent federal appeals court ruling that President Trump unlawfully imposed sweeping country-based tariffs could result in tens of billions of dollars in refunds for American businesses. The court found that the president lacked the authority under the International Emergency Economic Powers Act (IEEPA) to implement the levies. If the decision is upheld by the Supreme Court, the government may have to return over $70 billion collected from these specific tariffs. However, the process for receiving refunds remains uncertain, as the administration could require businesses to apply individually rather than issuing automatic reimbursements, creating logistical challenges for both companies and the government.</p>

          <p>While electric vehicle sales are growing, Ford is seeing a significant bright spot with its large, gas-powered Expedition SUV, which reported its best sales month in 21 years. The company sold over 8,700 Expeditions in August, a 53.7% increase from the previous year, with higher-end models like the Platinum and King Ranch proving most popular. This strong performance indicates continued consumer demand for large, traditional internal combustion engine vehicles, particularly among families. The success of the redesigned three-row SUV provides a crucial profit engine for Ford as it navigates the transition to its electric "Model e" business segment.</p>
