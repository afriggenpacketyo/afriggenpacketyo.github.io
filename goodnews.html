        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>OpenAI's latest model, GPT-5, faced criticism for its consumer-facing interface, prompting the company to temporarily restore GPT-4 for chatbot users. However, the new model is achieving significant traction in the enterprise sector, which is OpenAI's primary focus for monetization. Startups and major companies like Box are adopting GPT-5 for its enhanced performance on complex tasks, faster setup, and more competitive pricing compared to rivals like Anthropic's Claude. This strategic pivot highlights the intense competition for corporate clients in the AI industry, even as companies like OpenAI operate at a considerable financial loss to secure market share.</p>

          <p>The Department of Homeland Security has reversed its decision to use expedited removal proceedings against Mirta Amarilis Co Tupul, a Guatemalan immigrant who has lived in the U.S. for nearly 30 years. Her lawyers filed a lawsuit arguing the attempt was illegal, as expedited removal is typically reserved for those in the country for less than two years. After a judge temporarily halted the deportation, the government agreed to move her to regular proceedings, where she can plead her case before a judge. The case has drawn attention to concerns that the administration is attempting to broaden its use of fast-track deportations.</p>

        </div>
        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>A Texas state judge has ordered the liquidation of Alex Jones's company, Infowars, by appointing a receiver to sell its assets. The proceeds will go toward paying the more than $1 billion in defamation judgments owed to the families of the Sandy Hook Elementary School shooting victims. The order allows the receiver to take control of the company and change the locks, potentially shutting down Jones's studio operations in the near future. This legal move follows a stalled bankruptcy auction and represents a significant step in the families' long effort to hold Jones accountable for his harmful conspiracy theories.</p>

This investment is notable given UnitedHealth's recent struggles, including a Justice Department investigation and a significant drop in its stock price this year. The move is characteristic of Buffett's value investing strategy of buying into fundamentally strong companies during periods of difficulty. Following the disclosure, UnitedHealth's stock saw a significant jump in after-hours trading, reflecting investor confidence in Berkshire's decision. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>Data analytics firm Palantir has experienced a dramatic surge of over 1,700% since its 2020 public listing, reaching a market valuation exceeding $430 billion. A significant driver of this growth has been its lucrative government contracts, particularly with the U.S. military, which accounted for 55% of its revenue last quarter. Despite its astronomical valuation, Palantir's revenue is a fraction of that of other tech giants with similar market caps, resulting in a forward price-to-earnings ratio above 280. This indicates that investors are paying a substantial premium based on high expectations for its future AI-powered software. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>The American Heart Association and the American College of Cardiology have released new guidelines for managing high blood pressure, their first update since 2017. The recommendations call for a more aggressive approach, suggesting medication if lifestyle changes fail to lower blood pressure in the 130-139 systolic range after three to six months. A significant change is the new recommendation to forgo alcohol entirely, a shift from previous advice that permitted moderate consumption, citing mounting evidence of its negative impact. The guidelines also place a greater emphasis on lowering blood pressure to reduce the risk of dementia.</p>

          <p>Interest rates for home equity lines of credit (HELOCs) and home equity loans have decreased slightly for the second consecutive week, maintaining their position as a relatively inexpensive borrowing option for homeowners. With home equity levels at a record high, many are considering applying, but the timing depends on the product. Since HELOCs have variable rates, existing borrowers will benefit from any future rate cuts, so there is little reason to wait. For fixed-rate home equity loans, however, waiting could allow borrowers to lock in a lower rate for the life of the loan. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>Intel's stock price increased by 7% following a report that the Trump administration is considering taking a direct equity stake in the semiconductor company. This potential investment would help fund the construction of new manufacturing facilities in the U.S., aligning with the administration's goal of increasing domestic high-tech production. Intel is a key player in this strategy as it is one of the few companies capable of manufacturing advanced chips on American soil. The move would represent another instance of the government taking a more direct role in key industries to advance national priorities. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>With interest rates on traditional savings accounts near zero, high-yield savings accounts offer a significantly more profitable alternative, with top rates currently between 4% and 4.50%. For a deposit of $50,000, an account with a 4.35% APY could generate over $2,100 in interest in one year, assuming rates remain stable. While these variable rates are expected to decline if the Federal Reserve cuts its benchmark rate, the immediate impact is likely to be modest. The article suggests that savers should act proactively to take advantage of the current high-rate environment. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>David Zervos, chief market strategist at Jefferies and a potential candidate to lead the Federal Reserve, has publicly advocated for aggressive interest rate cuts. He argued that despite recent inflation data, monetary policy remains restrictive and that a significant rate reduction could stimulate the labor market without fueling inflation. Zervos joins a growing list of potential successors to Jerome Powell who believe the central bank should act decisively to ease policy. His market-focused background differs from that of many traditional economists, and he stated that a Fed chair must be prepared to navigate political pressures. (not investment advice)</p>
