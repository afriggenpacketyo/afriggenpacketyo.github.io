          <h2>Republicans Propose Senior Tax Deduction as Alternative to Social Security Tax Elimination</h2>
          <div class="timestamp">2025-05-16 09:20:09 EDT</div>
        </div>
        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>House Republicans are proposing a temporary $4,000 tax deduction for adults aged 65 and over as part of their tax bill, which they are calling a 'bonus'. This is an alternative to President Trump's idea of eliminating taxes on Social Security benefits. The deduction, applicable from 2025 to 2028, would phase out for single filers earning above $75,000 and married couples filing jointly above $150,000. While not as generous as a tax credit, this deduction would reduce the amount of seniors' income subject to taxes, potentially cutting taxes by a little less than $500 per year for a median income retiree.

          <p>Epic Games has announced that Fortnite is now unavailable on iOS devices globally after Apple blocked their attempt to reinstate the game on the App Store. This action follows a judge's ruling that Apple cannot charge commissions on purchases made outside of iOS apps. Epic Games had submitted Fortnite to Apple's U.S. App Store a month after the ruling, but Apple's decision effectively keeps Fortnite offline for iOS users worldwide until the dispute is resolved. The article notes that CNBC has reached out to Apple for comment.</p>

In addition, David's Bridal has partnered with DoorDash to provide customers with the option of having dresses delivered in minutes. The company plans to open more Diamonds & Pearls stores and is shifting production out of China due to tariffs, focusing on factories in Myanmar, India, and Vietnam.</p>

          <p>Mike Novogratz describes the arduous four-year, $25 million journey to list crypto firm Galaxy Digital on the Nasdaq, citing regulatory hurdles and extensive scrutiny from the SEC. He characterized the process as "unfair, infuriating," highlighting the nine rounds of comments required from the SEC. Novogratz noted that Galaxy's auditing costs were significantly higher due to its crypto business but expects these fees to decrease following the Nasdaq listing. He emphasized that the scarcity of capital made the company tougher, funding it primarily through investment gains and trading. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>Saving money can be a challenge in an economy with persistent inflation, and a certificate of deposit (CD) can help. Depending on your CD type, terms and other details, there's a varying range of CD rates you can qualify for today. Short-term CDs (around six months to one year) have higher interest rates than longer terms right now. A practical approach could be to ladder your CDs, buying some one year, some two years, some three years, etc. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>Tech industry leaders like Sam Altman of OpenAI and Dario Amodei of Anthropic are predicting the imminent arrival of artificial general intelligence (A.G.I.), an AI that matches human-level intelligence. However, many scientists disagree, arguing that current technologies are insufficient and lack key elements like the ability to recognize irony or feel empathy. Skeptics emphasize that today's AI systems primarily predict the next likely word or pixel, differing significantly from human cognition. The debate highlights the challenges in defining human intelligence and the limitations of current benchmark tests in capturing the full scope of human capabilities.</p>
