          <p>The National Health Service (NHS) in England is planning to DNA test all newborn babies to assess their risk of developing hundreds of diseases. This initiative aims to revolutionize prevention and provide faster diagnoses by using genomics and AI. The scheme, part of a government drive towards predicting and preventing illness, will involve sequencing the complete DNA of newborns using blood samples from their umbilical cord. Health Secretary Wes Streeting believes this technology will enable personalized healthcare and reduce pressure on NHS services, ultimately helping people live longer, healthier lives.</p>

          <p>The UK Parliament has approved a bill to allow assisted dying in England and Wales, marking a significant social change. The bill will now proceed to the House of Lords, where it is expected to face further scrutiny and debate. The government anticipates a longer "commencement period" to ensure necessary preparations are made, potentially delaying the implementation of the law. Opinion polls indicate substantial public support for the change, and this bill is compared by many to the Abortion Act of 1967, the abolition of capital punishment, the decriminalisation of homosexuality and the introduction of gay marriage.</p>

The phenomenon known as "seichi junrei," or "holy pilgrimage," has become a popular trend among fans, visiting locations that inspired or were real-life settings for popular works.

          <p>Due to surging rice costs, Japanese restaurants and food companies are increasingly turning to noodles as a cost-effective alternative. Antworks Co., operator of pork rice bowl eateries, opened its first ramen noodle restaurant and plans to open more to diversify its operations. Yoshinoya Holdings Co. is also strengthening its ramen noodle business, as it views the beef bowl restaurant market as saturated. Rice prices have doubled from a year earlier, prompting consumers to seek alternatives like frozen udon noodles and Western-style breakfast foods.</p>
