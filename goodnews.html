          <p>The U.S. has announced a trade deal with South Korea, establishing a 15% tariff on most imports, a reduction from the threatened 25%. As part of the agreement, South Korea will facilitate a $350 billion investment fund for its companies entering the U.S. market and purchase $100 billion in American energy products. However, there appear to be differing interpretations between Washington and Seoul regarding the control and distribution of profits from the investment fund. The deal successfully protected South Korea's sensitive agricultural sectors but did not secure concessions on steel or semiconductor tariffs. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>The Billy Graham Evangelistic Association (BGEA) has established a $1.3 million legal defense fund to support Christians and churches in Europe facing legal challenges over their biblical beliefs. The fund was initiated with money from court settlements BGEA won in the U.K. after its events were canceled over activist complaints. Franklin Graham and his daughter, Cissie Graham Lynch, are also publicly advocating for religious freedom, warning that similar pressures to suppress Christian beliefs are growing in the United States. They emphasized that the initiative aims to provide both practical and symbolic support for believers facing legal and cultural hostility.</p>

          <p>As the Major League Baseball trade deadline approached, several contending teams made significant moves to bolster their pitching staffs. The Philadelphia Phillies acquired highly-sought closer Jhoan Durán from the Minnesota Twins, while the New York Mets added relievers Tyler Rogers and Ryan Helsley to fortify their bullpen for a tight division race. In another notable trade, the Cincinnati Reds acquired Gold Glove third baseman Ke’Bryan Hayes from the Pittsburgh Pirates. The activity signals a heated market for key players as teams position themselves for a postseason push, with other top names still potentially available before the deadline.</p>

          <p>Hotel tycoon Surinder Arora has submitted a competing proposal for the expansion of London's Heathrow Airport, challenging the plan put forth by the airport's owners. The Arora Group's plan features a shorter third runway, which they claim would avoid the costly and disruptive need to divert the M25 motorway. This alternative, named Heathrow West, is estimated to cost under £25 billion and could be operational by 2035, offering a potentially cheaper and less risky option. The submission introduces the first-ever competitive bid for the airport's expansion, a project that has been debated for years and faced numerous delays.</p>

          <p>Robinhood reported strong second-quarter financial results that surpassed Wall Street estimates, with revenue climbing 45% year-over-year to $989 million. The company's net income more than doubled, and it added 2.3 million funded customers, bringing its total to 26.5 million. Growth was driven by strong net deposits and higher equity and cryptocurrency valuations, with total platform assets nearly doubling to $279 billion. The positive performance reflects the company's aggressive expansion into wealth management and success in attracting new clients, although shares dipped slightly after it forecasted higher costs associated with its Bitstamp acquisition.

          <p>The U.S. Federal Reserve has decided to hold its key interest rate steady, resisting pressure from President Donald Trump to implement a cut. The decision came as new data showed the economy grew at a 3% annual rate in the second quarter, a rebound largely driven by a drop in imports due to new tariffs. Despite the steady job market, policymakers remain cautious about the uncertain effects of the administration's trade and tax policies on inflation and growth. The vote was not unanimous, with two members dissenting in favor of a rate cut, signaling a broadening debate within the Fed. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>Meta Platforms delivered a blowout second quarter, with revenue and earnings per share far exceeding analyst expectations. The social media giant's revenue climbed 22% year-over-year, driven by strong user engagement and a 9% increase in the average price per ad. The company's guidance for the third quarter also surpassed forecasts, and while it raised its outlook for full-year expenses to fund AI initiatives, the increase was within a range investors found acceptable. The article notes that these impressive results and the successful integration of AI into its platforms demonstrate the company's continued dominance and growth potential. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>Following the major earthquake off Russia's coast, this article explains the science behind tsunamis. Generated primarily by strong, shallow, underwater earthquakes that cause vertical shifts in the seafloor, tsunamis can travel across deep oceans at speeds comparable to a jet airplane. As they approach shallower coastal waters, their speed decreases but their wave height and power increase dramatically, making them incredibly destructive. While forecasting remains challenging, scientists use tide gauges and deep-ocean pressure sensors to predict their arrival and potential impact, emphasizing the importance of heeding evacuation warnings immediately.</p>

          <p>A scientific expedition using a human-occupied submersible has discovered surprisingly abundant and thriving communities of life at depths of over 9,000 meters in the Pacific Ocean. Researchers captured images of vast fields of tube worms, beds of clams, and bacterial mats, challenging previous assumptions about the scarcity of life in such extreme, high-pressure environments. These ecosystems are fueled not by sunlight but by chemicals like methane and hydrogen sulfide seeping from the ocean floor. The findings suggest these chemosynthetic communities are more widespread than previously thought, opening new avenues for studying adaptation to extreme conditions.</p>

          <p>High-resolution, near-infrared imaging has unveiled the stunningly intricate details of tattoos on a 2,500-year-old female mummy from the Pazyryk culture of Siberia. The scans revealed crisp, sophisticated designs of mythical creatures and animals that were previously difficult to see, showcasing the advanced artistry of this ancient nomadic people. The woman, who was about 50 years old, had decorations of leopards, a stag, and a griffin, which were likely stenciled and applied with a multi-pointed tool. Researchers collaborated with a historical tattooist to better understand the techniques and commitment involved in creating such elaborate body art.</p>

          <p>Entering his ninth NFL season, 30-year-old cornerback Ahkello Witherspoon has become a veteran leader, or "Yoda," in the Los Angeles Rams' young secondary. After playing for the 49ers and Steelers, Witherspoon joined the Rams last season and proved to be a key starter, earning a new one-year contract. The team's decision not to add new cornerbacks or safeties in the offseason is seen as a vote of confidence in the current group's potential. Witherspoon is embracing his role as a mentor, focusing on communication and aggression to help elevate a defense that he believes has special potential.</p>
