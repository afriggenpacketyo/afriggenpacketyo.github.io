          <h2>Self-Driving Cars Could Save Thousands of Lives Annually</h2>

          <p>According to a new study by Waymo, autonomous vehicles could drastically reduce traffic fatalities due to their ability to avoid human errors like distracted or impaired driving. The study compared the safety performance of Waymo's self-driving cars over 56.7 million miles to human driving, revealing significant reductions in airbag-deploying crashes, injury crashes, and pedestrian injuries. Extrapolating this data across all vehicle miles driven in the US suggests that widespread adoption of self-driving cars could save approximately 34,000 lives per year, although some caveats apply, such as the study's focus on warm, sunny locations. While public opinion has been turning against self-driving cars, the article argues that slowing down their development is costing lives.</p>

Buffett emphasized his decision to retain all his Berkshire shares as an economic decision, believing Abel's management will benefit the company.

          <p>This New York Times article suggests that President Trump's policies played a role in the Australian election, bolstering the re-election of Prime Minister Anthony Albanese. While Albanese avoided direct criticism of Trump, the global turmoil caused by his policies, particularly tariffs, influenced voters. The opposition leader, Peter Dutton, was even nicknamed "Temu Trump" for espousing some of Trump's ideas. Voters expressed concern over the rising cost of living and instability in their retirement accounts due to market reactions to Trump's policies, contributing to Albanese's landslide victory.</p>

Despite growing fears of an economic slowdown, the Fed is inclined to hold rates steady due to concerns about inflation. Strong April payroll data is expected to support the Fed's decision to prioritize price stability, although higher US duties on imports risk undermining progress on inflation.</p>
