          <p>President Donald Trump lauded Nippon Steel as a "great partner" for U.S. Steel, backing the Japanese company's investment into the American producer, despite previously opposing the acquisition. During a speech at a U.S. Steel plant in Pennsylvania, Trump said the deal would ensure U.S. Steel remains controlled by the USA and that all facilities will remain open. He also announced plans to raise tariffs on steel imports to 50% from the current 25%, citing national security concerns. While Nippon Steel seeks to make U.S. Steel a wholly-owned subsidiary, Trump emphasized the importance of a strong domestic steel industry for national security.</p>

          <p>Chinese tourists are driving a recent surge in inbound travel to Japan, with arrivals exceeding pre-pandemic levels. However, their travel habits are shifting from large group tours and shopping sprees to immersive experiences related to Japanese cuisine, culture, and scenery. The Japan National Tourism Organization is working to target this evolving market, particularly travelers in their 30s and 40s who prefer family trips. While visitor numbers from Hong Kong initially declined due to concerns about a manga predicting a disaster, they rebounded strongly in April.</p>

          <p>A U.S. Marine, Sergeant Major Jody Armentrout, restrained a man who allegedly tried to open an emergency exit door mid-flight from Tokyo to Houston. Armentrout noticed the man acting suspiciously and intervened when he grabbed the exit door. With the help of a passenger and flight attendants, Armentrout used zip ties to restrain the man. The flight was diverted to Seattle-Tacoma International Airport, where the man was taken for medical evaluation; a second unruly passenger was also removed from the flight after punching a bathroom door.</p>

          <p>China is modernizing its traditional mining industry by introducing driverless electric vehicles in Inner Mongolia's Yimin open-pit coal mine. A fleet of 100 photovoltaic-battery-powered, self-driving trucks is now in operation, addressing a shortage of drivers and improving safety. This initiative is part of China's push to digitally transform its coal industry and develop "intelligent coal mines." The Yimin mine aims to increase efficiency and reduce reliance on manual labor by using advanced technologies.</p>

          <p>China has completed its first overseas new-generation radio telescope in northern Thailand, bolstering a global scientific network that monitors deep space signals and tracks shifts in the Earth‚Äôs rotation and tectonic plates. The 13-metre radio antenna, jointly developed by the Shanghai Astronomical Observatory and the National Astronomical Research Institute of Thailand, was officially inaugurated in Chiang Mai on May 16. The project began with a memorandum of understanding in 2017. By April, it had completed a full 24-hour observation session ‚Äì including enhanced measurements of Earth‚Äôs rotation ‚Äì as part of a network of similar Chinese telescopes.</p>
