          <p>Scott Swift, the 73-year-old father of pop star Taylor Swift, recently underwent a quintuple bypass heart surgery and is now recovering well. A representative confirmed the procedure was not the result of a heart attack and that he is doing "fantastic" with his family by his side. The article notes this is not the first health challenge for the Swift family, referencing Andrea Swift's previous battles with cancer and a brain tumor. Taylor has previously spoken about how her family's health issues have shaped her perspective.</p>

          <p>Morgan Stanley announced second-quarter financial results that exceeded Wall Street predictions, driven by strong performance in its trading divisions. The bank reported earnings of $2.13 per share on revenue of $16.79 billion, surpassing the expected $1.96 per share and $16.07 billion in revenue. The institutional securities and wealth management segments both showed significant revenue growth, attributed to higher client activity and asset management fees. Despite the positive results, the company's stock experienced a slight dip following the announcement. (not investment advice)</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>President Donald Trump has downplayed the possibility of firing Federal Reserve Chair Jerome Powell, stating such a move is "highly unlikely" unless for reasons of fraud. This comment came shortly after reports that he had discussed the idea with Republican lawmakers, causing brief volatility in financial markets. Trump has frequently criticized Powell for not lowering interest rates, continuing his critique by calling him a "knucklehead." Despite the rhetoric, the statement appears to signal a temporary de-escalation of his pressure on the independent central bank.</p>
