          <div class="timestamp">2025-09-24 21:45:21 EDT</div>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Facing falling cranberry prices due to global competition and rising operational costs, Massachusetts cranberry farmers are increasingly participating in a state program to restore unproductive bogs into wetlands. This initiative, run by the Massachusetts Division of Ecological Restoration, provides financial incentives for farmers to convert their land, transforming it into natural swamps that offer ecological benefits like water filtration, carbon storage, and enhanced storm resilience. The program has successfully restored over 500 acres over the past 15 years, with an additional 500 acres planned, offering a sustainable alternative for farmers and ensuring the land's long-term environmental health. This approach allows farmers to preserve their legacy while opening restored areas for public enjoyment.</p>

          <p>Matthew McConaughey discusses his new film, "The Lost Bus," which dramatizes the harrowing experience of a school bus driver and teacher navigating California's deadly 2018 Camp Fire. The Oscar-winning actor revealed that his 93-year-old mother and 17-year-old son also appear in the film, a decision by director Paul Greengrass to enhance realism. The movie depicts the devastation that killed 85 people and displaced over 50,000, destroying most of Paradise, California. McConaughey praises the real-life heroes, emphasizing the film's universal message about confronting global dangers and the consequences of leaving action too late, making it a poignant reflection on climate change impacts.</p>

          <p>Orange County officials are cross-referencing voter rolls with pet registration data to ensure no animals are casting ballots, following charges against a woman for allegedly registering her dog and voting on its behalf in two elections. The Board of Supervisors directed this expanded review after Laura Lee Yourex was charged with multiple felonies related to her dog, Maya Jean Yourex, being registered to vote. While some supervisors express concern about voter roll integrity, others argue the incident is isolated and the focus should be on increasing human voter participation. The Registrar of Voters maintains that the county's voter rolls are well-maintained, with ongoing efforts to verify identities.</p>

          <p>Jimmy Kimmel Live! saw its broadcast audience jump to an estimated 6.26 million viewers upon the comedian's return to ABC, marking its highest ratings in years—nearly four times its season average. This significant surge occurred despite approximately a quarter of all ABC affiliate TV stations preempting the late-night show. Kimmel's temporary suspension followed controversial comments he made about the assassination of conservative activist Charlie Kirk, which drew strong criticism from FCC Chair Brendan Carr and led to major station owners like Nexstar and Sinclair continuing to preempt his program. In his comeback monologue, Kimmel addressed the controversy, stating he never intended to trivialize the tragedy.</p>

          <h2>Federal Judge Blocks Trump Administration's Immigration Cooperation Requirement for FEMA Grants</h2>

          <p>A federal judge has ruled that the Trump administration's policy requiring states to cooperate with immigration enforcement to receive certain Federal Emergency Management Agency (FEMA) grants is unconstitutional. This decision represents a significant legal defeat for the administration's broader strategy to penalize "sanctuary" cities and states by revoking federal funding. Twenty states, predominantly Democratic, had filed a lawsuit, contending that linking critical emergency preparedness and response funds to immigration assistance violated federal law and constitutional principles. Judge William Smith granted summary judgment, deeming the policy "arbitrary and capricious" and emphasizing the irreparable harm of withholding disaster relief. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>Parents report that their son, Mason, who has autism, began speaking just three days after starting leucovorin, an inexpensive generic drug primarily used to ease chemotherapy side effects. Dr. Richard Frye, a pediatric neurologist, is researching leucovorin's potential for autism, theorizing it bypasses a folic acid transport blockage in the brain that may contribute to the disorder. Despite only phase 2B studies, the FDA has begun approving leucovorin for autism, though more research is needed for optimal dosing and patient selection.

Donald stressed that for Europe, the event is about "pride, brotherhood, and responsibility" to legacy and inspiration.
