          <div class="timestamp">2025-07-30 06:00:28 EDT</div>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>China's National Development and Reform Commission has proposed new draft guidelines to tighten oversight of state-supported investment funds. The rules aim to curb redundant spending and prevent "homogeneous competition" by directing capital towards strategic sectors like advanced manufacturing and the digital economy. This initiative seeks to foster more efficient, long-term "patient capital" to support innovation and stabilize investments across economic cycles. The guidelines emphasize stronger top-down planning and better coordination between central and local government funds to avoid crowding out private investment. (not investment advice)</p>

        </div>
        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>The tradition of friends setting each other up on dates, once a primary way for couples to meet, is now largely overshadowed by online dating apps. While setups offer a layer of vetting and accountability, modern daters often prefer the vast choice and control provided by algorithms that connect them with people outside their immediate social circles. Experts note that as dating became a more individual pursuit of self-actualization, the role of community in matchmaking diminished. Despite growing frustration with app-based dating, a full-scale return to setups seems unlikely, though some are finding creative ways to bring a community feel back to dating.</p>

          <p>Two young and experienced NFL players, New York Jets running back Zach Evans, 24, and Washington Commanders offensive guard Nate Herbig, 27, have unexpectedly announced their retirements from the league. Evans, a former sixth-round draft pick by the Los Angeles Rams, revealed his decision on Monday. Herbig, who had a five-year career with multiple teams including the Philadelphia Eagles and Pittsburgh Steelers, announced his retirement a day later. The announcements come as NFL teams are in the midst of their training camps, highlighting a trend of players choosing to step away from the sport at a young age.</p>

          <p>In an unprecedented move, Cuba has leased farmland to a foreign company, Vietnam's Agri VMA, to boost its domestic rice production amid a severe agricultural crisis. The project in Los Palacios is showing encouraging results, with the first harvest yielding nearly four times the national average thanks to Vietnamese seeds and resources. This partnership aims to reduce Cuba's reliance on costly imports, which have been strained by U.S. sanctions and a lack of foreign currency. The Vietnamese company manages the land independently and directly hires Cuban workers, marking a significant shift in the country's state-controlled agricultural model.</p>

          <div class="timestamp">2025-07-30 05:39:59 EDT</div>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>The euro zone's economy grew by a slight 0.1% in the second quarter, a better-than-expected result compared to forecasts of no growth. This modest expansion follows a stronger 0.6% growth in the first quarter, which was partly boosted by companies front-running U.S. tariffs. Economists suggest the data indicates that the euro zone has so far been resilient to the shifts in U.S. trade policy and the associated uncertainty. The slowdown was anticipated as the initial effects of tariff-related stockpiling diminished, but the overall performance points to a degree of stability in the face of trade pressures.

          <p>The International Monetary Fund (IMF) has raised its 2025 growth forecast for China to 5.4%, a significant 0.8 percentage point increase and the largest upward revision for any economy in its latest report. The IMF attributed the improved outlook to stronger-than-expected economic activity in the first half of the year and a significant reduction in U.S.-China tariffs. A key factor in this resilience has been China's success in diversifying its export markets, with robust trade growth to regions like Southeast Asia and Europe offsetting a decline in shipments to the United States.

          <p>The Federal Reserve is widely expected to hold its benchmark interest rate steady this week, despite repeated and intense public pressure from President Trump for a rate cut. Investors see almost no chance of a change, although they are more optimistic about a potential cut in September. Fed Chair Jerome Powell has maintained that policy decisions are based on economic data, not political attacks, as he waits to see the full impact of the administration's new tariffs. While some Fed officials argue for a cut now, concerns about inflation remaining above the 2% target support a more cautious, wait-and-see approach. (not investment advice)</p>

        </div>
        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>The word "dude," now a ubiquitous term of casual address, has a surprisingly long history originating in late 19th-century New York City. It was first used to describe young, effeminate men who adopted an over-the-top, Anglophile fashion style, likely as a reference to "Yankee Doodle." The term later evolved to describe East Coast city dwellers visiting "dude ranches" in the West. In the mid-20th century, it was adopted by African American and Mexican American communities as a marker of solidarity before being popularized globally by California's surfer and skater culture, solidifying its place as a flexible and enduring part of the American lexicon.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>A comprehensive new report from the Center for Election Innovation & Research (CEIR) confirms that voting by non-U.S. citizens is not a widespread issue, occurring only in minuscule numbers. Despite increased resources devoted to rooting out ineligible voters following claims by former President Trump, state-level investigations have found very few instances of illegal voting. The research indicates that many allegations arise from misunderstandings of complex voter data or are politically motivated. Experts note that the severe penalties for noncitizens who vote, including deportation, serve as a powerful deterrent, and most documented cases are due to bureaucratic error rather than intentional fraud.</p>

        </div>
        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>New research on Great Tits, a European songbird, reveals that some avian pairs effectively "divorce" by ceasing to associate with each other after the breeding season ends. Using radio tags to track the birds' social interactions, scientists at the University of Oxford found that while many couples remain together through the winter, others drift apart. These "divorcing" birds associate less with their former partners as winter progresses, suggesting they are forming new social bonds ahead of the next breeding season. The study highlights the complex and significant role that social behavior plays in the lives of animals.</p>

Diaz's departure is part of a significant summer of transactions for Liverpool, who have generated substantial funds from player sales while also investing heavily in new talent.

Meta had previously rebuffed the code, arguing it introduced legal uncertainties and went beyond the scope of the landmark AI Act.

          <p>Australia's annual inflation rate dropped to 2.1% in the second quarter, its lowest level since March 2021 and falling below economists' expectations. This places inflation just within the Reserve Bank of Australia's (RBA) target range of 2-3%, increasing pressure on the central bank to cut interest rates at its next meeting. While the RBA has been cautious, citing a strong labor market, analysts believe the weaker inflation figures, coupled with a slowing global growth backdrop, provide sufficient evidence for a rate reduction. The data suggests that inflationary pressures are easing, although the RBA remains watchful. (not investment advice)</p>
