        </div>
        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>A significant heat wave is forecast to impact the eastern United States, bringing several days of record-high temperatures, and the National Weather Service has termed it "the first significant heat wave this season." Over 140 million Americans are expected to be under extreme heat alerts, with the total number affected, including heat advisories, rising to 200 million. Potential daily record highs are also forecast for parts of the Rockies and Plains, with temperatures well into the 90s reaching the mid-Atlantic and Northeast. Officials are urging residents to stay indoors, use air conditioning, and remain hydrated to avoid heat-related illnesses.</p>

          <h2>US Sunscreens May Be Less Effective Than Those Abroad, Experts Say</h2>
          <div class="timestamp">2025-06-21 10:00:11 EDT</div>
        </div>
        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>As a heatwave approaches the United States, experts are noting that US sunscreens may be less effective than those available in other countries, particularly in protecting against UVA rays. This is attributed to regulatory differences, as the FDA has not approved a new UV filter for sunscreen in over 20 years. While American sunscreens generally protect against UVB rays, those in countries like France, South Korea, and Japan have access to a wider range of UV-filtering ingredients. Despite this, dermatologists emphasize the importance of wearing sunscreen daily and recommend mineral sunscreens containing zinc oxide and titanium dioxide.</p>

          <p>Photographer Miora Rajaonary's project, "Sahy Rano," raises awareness of female genital schistosomiasis (FGS), a neglected tropical disease affecting millions of women and girls, mainly in Africa. The exhibit features portraits of eight women who posed for Rajaonary, sharing their experiences with the disease, which can cause infertility and increase the risk of HIV. The women wear traditional Malagasy face masks to emphasize their courage in breaking taboos and speaking publicly about the disease. The project aims to highlight the impact of FGS on women's sexual and reproductive health and the importance of access to clean water and healthcare.</p>

          <p>A federal appellate court has blocked a Louisiana law mandating the posting of the Ten Commandments in public school classrooms, citing its unconstitutionality. The ruling supports civil liberties groups who argued the law violates the separation of church and state and would isolate non-Christian students. While Louisiana plans to appeal the decision, the court's ruling reinforces the principle that public schools should be welcoming to all students, regardless of their faith. The case is expected to reach the U.S. Supreme Court, potentially testing the court's stance on religion and government.</p>
