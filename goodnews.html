          <div class="timestamp">2025-08-02 05:00:00 EDT</div>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>A noticeable trend has emerged in international diplomacy where world leaders are increasingly using praise and flattery to engage with President Trump. Examples include the UK Prime Minister presenting a rare second state visit invitation and Israel's Prime Minister nominating Trump for a Nobel Peace Prize. Analysts suggest this approach is a strategic shift from Trump's first term, as leaders now recognize his personal and decisive leadership style. This tactic aims to keep Trump on their side to achieve favorable outcomes, such as increased NATO defense spending and new trade agreements.</p>

          <p>An NPR comic explores the common social awkwardness many people feel when receiving a compliment. Social psychologist Erica Boothby and behavioral scientist Xuan Zhao delve into the science behind these reactions, explaining what our responses reveal about our self-perception. The article suggests that dismissing praise can negatively affect both the giver and the receiver. Ultimately, it makes a case for learning to graciously accept kind remarks as a way to improve social interactions and self-esteem.</p>

The tournament saw a major upset as defending champion Jessica Pegula was knocked out by Anastasia Sevastova, a 35-year-old who recently returned from maternity leave.</p>

          <p>Two major state-owned Chinese firms are investing a combined US$350 million to develop large-scale agriculture in Angola, aiming to enhance food security. SinoHydro Group will invest over US$100 million to create a grain base, with 60% of the output destined for China. In a separate deal, the conglomerate Citic will invest US$250 million to cultivate 100,000 hectares for soybean and corn production. This strategic move aligns with China's goal of securing food supplies through overseas agricultural development, leveraging Angola's vast tracts of arable land.</p>

        </div>
        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>A new study led by Chinese researchers has uncovered that the modern potato is the result of an ancient hybridization event involving a forerunner of the tomato. By analyzing the genomes of various potato species, scientists traced the crop's evolution back nine million years. They found that a tomato ancestor crossbred with a tuberless, potato-like plant, and this event was a key driver in the development of tubers. This pioneering research, published in the journal Cell, sheds new light on the origins of one of the world's most important staple foods.</p>

          <p>LAFC defeated Mexican club Pachuca 4-2 in a penalty shootout after a 1-1 draw in their Leagues Cup match, but the result leaves them on the brink of elimination. Dennis Bouanga scored early for LAFC before Elías Montiel equalized for Pachuca. Both teams were reduced to ten men after receiving red cards during the match. Despite the shootout victory, LAFC's total of three points from two games is likely insufficient for them to advance to the quarterfinals from their 18-team MLS group.</p>

          <p>The 9th U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals has upheld a lower court's order blocking the Trump administration from conducting "roving patrols" for immigration enforcement across seven Southern California counties. The ruling affirms that agents cannot stop individuals based solely on factors like race, language, or location without establishing reasonable suspicion. The court rejected the government's claim that the injunction would irreparably harm its enforcement efforts. This decision is a significant setback for the administration's deportation strategy and has been celebrated by civil rights groups as a victory for constitutional rights.</p>

          <p>As wildfires affect popular European holiday destinations like Greece and Turkey, travel experts are offering advice to concerned tourists. While the UK Foreign Office currently deems travel safe, the situation can change rapidly. Standard travel insurance should cover cancellations if official advice changes to "do not travel." However, if travelers choose to cancel on their own due to uneasiness, they are unlikely to be covered unless they purchased specific catastrophe coverage. Experts advise communicating directly with airlines and hotels and stress the importance of having travel insurance before going abroad.</p>

          <p>In response to widespread user fatigue, dating apps are introducing new formats to reignite interest in online matchmaking. Companies are moving away from endless swiping and messaging, with apps like Breeze setting up dates directly and others facilitating group dates. Major players are also adapting; Tinder has a "double date" feature and Hinge offers premium tiers for better matches. This evolution reflects a user base tired of ghosting and repetitive profiles, seeking more genuine and less time-consuming ways to connect in person.</p>
