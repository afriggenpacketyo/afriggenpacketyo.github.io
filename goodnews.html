          <p>A New York judge has ruled that critical DNA evidence, obtained using advanced whole genome sequencing technology, is admissible in the Gilgo Beach serial killer trial against Rex Heuermann. This landmark decision marks the first time this novel technology will be used as evidence in a New York court, potentially opening doors for the prosecution of numerous other cold cases. Prosecutors successfully argued for the technique's general acceptance within the scientific community, asserting it links hairs from six of the seven victims to Heuermann, his wife, and daughter. This significant legal development is seen as a major victory for the prosecution, allowing the high-profile trial to proceed with full momentum.</p>

          <p>The EU Commission has given its approval to significant trade agreements with the South American bloc Mercosur and with Mexico, with President Ursula von der Leyen hailing them as "milestones" in diversifying the EU's global trade ties. The Mercosur deal, which has been under negotiation since 1999 and stalled multiple times, now requires ratification from at least 15 of the EU's 27 member states. This agreement would see Mercosur nations progressively remove tariffs on 91% of EU imports, including cars and pharmaceuticals, while allowing more agricultural goods into the EU, a point that has historically faced opposition from some European agricultural sectors. Concurrently, the deal with Mexico strengthens trade relations with the EU's second-biggest trading partner in Latin America.</p>

          <h2>Netflix Hit "KPop Demon Hunters" Subverts Genre Stereotypes with Empowered Female Leads</h2>

        </div>
        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>The Netflix animated movie "KPop Demon Hunters" has become a global sensation, lauded for its refreshing approach to K-pop stereotypes by featuring a girl band, HUNTR/X, who are secretly demon hunters. The film gleefully deconstructs the typical idol image, portraying its characters as powerful, quirky, and relatable young women who embrace their imperfections while simultaneously saving the world. The article underscores the movie's musical innovation, notably casting behind-the-scenes talents like songwriter EJAE as character voices, rather than relying on established K-pop stars. This authentic portrayal, coupled with narratives of overcoming struggles and accepting one's identity, deeply resonates with diverse global audiences, driving the film's massive streaming success and cultural impact.</p>

          <p>BGO, a global real estate investment manager with $89 billion in assets, is transforming its investment strategy by leveraging advanced data science and artificial intelligence to focus intensely on local market fundamentals. Co-CEO John Carrafiell revealed that extensive backtesting of two decades of deals demonstrated that local market conditions, rather than broader national economic trends, were the paramount determinants of investment outperformance. The firm developed a sophisticated model incorporating thousands of diverse data points, including demographic and supply trends unique to each location, with AI significantly enhancing its data volume and velocity. This innovative approach has yielded substantial returns in unexpected areas like Las Vegas, Florida, and the Rust Belt, indicating a new, data-driven paradigm for commercial real estate investment.

          <p>German Foreign Minister Johann Wadephul visited India, focusing on the two nations' shared goal of doubling their trade volume and India's efforts to secure a free trade deal with the European Union. Indian Foreign Minister Subrahmanyam Jaishankar explicitly sought Germany's support in accelerating these complex negotiations, which are currently facing significant sticking points on issues such as reduced import duties on cars and dairy, as well as Indian commitments to stricter climate and labor standards. Both countries are keen to lower trade barriers, a sentiment underscored by recent U.S. tariffs on Indian imports. Wadephul's tour also encompassed various cultural and business engagements, signifying a broader commitment to cooperation despite the existing trade challenges.</p>

          <p>Mineralys Therapeutics, Inc. (MLYS) experienced a significant surge in its stock, reaching a new all-time high, following the announcement of positive Phase 3 trial results by AstraZeneca for its aldosterone synthase inhibitor (ASI), Baxdrostat. AstraZeneca's experimental drug demonstrated its effectiveness by significantly lowering systolic blood pressure in patients with hard-to-control hypertension, creating a wave of optimism that extended to Mineralys, which is also actively developing its own ASI, Lorundrostat. In a related development, Mineralys concurrently launched a $175 million follow-on offering to secure additional funds for the ongoing clinical development, research, manufacturing, and pre-commercialization activities of Lorundrostat. This strong market reaction highlights growing investor confidence in the therapeutic potential of aldosterone synthase inhibitors for managing high blood pressure. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>"Phantom energy," also known as vampire energy, describes the electricity consumed by electronic devices when they are plugged in but not actively in use, contributing to approximately 5% to 10% of total home energy consumption. This often-overlooked drain on power grids contributes to climate change by increasing demand for electricity, often sourced from power plants that release planet-warming emissions. Experts identify smart televisions and appliances with constant displays, like microwaves, as significant culprits, consuming substantial energy even in standby mode. Simple, actionable steps such as unplugging chargers once devices are fully charged or disabling unnecessary smart features can lead to significant reductions in both emissions and utility costs, fostering a collective shift towards more sustainable daily habits.</p>

          <p>A comprehensive fact-check investigation conducted by DW's data journalism team has effectively debunked President Trump's persistent claims that cities governed by Democrats inherently experience higher crime rates. While it is true that a majority of large U.S. cities are led by Democrats and urban areas generally report higher crime statistics, the article rigorously clarifies that such correlation does not establish causation. Citing explicit FBI warnings against simplistic city rankings and a robust study from Harvard, MIT, and Boston University spanning nearly three decades, the analysis definitively concludes that a mayor's political affiliation has no discernible impact on crime rates or policing effectiveness. Furthermore, national violent crime has seen a significant decrease of 4.5% in the past year and 49% over the last three decades, contradicting the public perception of rising crime.</p>

          <p>A Tennessee state representative has sponsored a resolution proposing a constitutional amendment that would permanently prohibit the state from ever levying or authorizing a property tax. This significant initiative, which Tennessee voters will have the opportunity to approve in November 2026, aims to safeguard property rights and firmly entrench Tennessee's consumption-based tax model, currently characterized by no state income tax and one of the nation's lowest state and local tax burdens. Proponents argue that this measure will substantially reduce financial burdens on homeowners, particularly benefiting rural communities and vulnerable populations like seniors on fixed incomes, while also protecting the state's economic stability. While the amendment does not impact local property taxes, it seeks to eliminate the state-level option, further solidifying Tennessee's reputation as an attractive, low-tax state.</p>

          <p>With homeowners holding an average of $213,000 in tappable equity, home equity borrowing options like HELOCs and home equity loans present notably more affordable interest rates compared to high-interest credit cards or personal loans. While both average around 8% currently, their overall affordability hinges on a detailed comparison of rates, repayment terms, and associated fees. HELOCs offer variable interest rates and a flexible draw period for accessing funds, whereas home equity loans provide fixed rates and predictable, consistent monthly payments over the loan's life. Experts advise potential borrowers to carefully consider current market conditions, including the high likelihood of a Federal Reserve rate cut in September, and their personal financial comfort when deciding between the short-term flexibility of a HELOC and the long-term predictability of a home equity loan.

While there has been no official mention of any new music, this announcement follows earlier fan speculation after the band registered a new limited liability partnership and offered concert tickets for a charity auction. The tour marks a significant and much-awaited return for the influential group, whose individual members have actively pursued various successful solo and side projects during their hiatus.</p>
