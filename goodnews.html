          <p>U.S. President Trump has announced that Israel and Hamas have agreed to the initial phase of a peace plan, which includes a ceasefire and the release of hostages in exchange for Palestinian prisoners. The Palestinian Authority has welcomed the proposal, expressing hope it will lead to a permanent political solution and an independent state. However, the deal faces internal opposition in Israel, with far-right Finance Minister Bezalel Smotrich vowing to vote against it, fearing it will halt the war against Hamas prematurely. Israeli President Isaac Herzog praised Trump's leadership in securing the agreement.</p>

          <p>China experienced a notable increase in consumer spending during its extended eight-day "super golden week" holiday, providing a positive signal for its economy. The country's transport systems handled a record 2.432 billion passenger trips, driven by tourism and family visits. According to tax data, daily average sales revenue in consumption-related industries grew by 4.5% year-on-year. Spending on services saw a significant 7.6% increase, outpacing the more modest 3.9% growth in goods sales, indicating a potential shift in consumer behavior.</p>

          <p>While the NFL MVP race often centers on established stars like Patrick Mahomes and Josh Allen, a new group of quarterbacks is emerging as potential first-time winners. Seattle's Sam Darnold has shown significant improvement, leading a high-powered offense and ranking highly in advanced metrics. Tampa Bay's Baker Mayfield is also on a redemption arc, leading his team with clutch performances despite a challenging offensive environment. Additionally, promising young talents like Washington's Jayden Daniels and New England's Drake Maye are developing into elite players who could enter the MVP conversation in the coming seasons.</p>

          <p>UK Prime Minister Sir Keir Starmer met with Indian Prime Minister Narendra Modi in Mumbai during his first official visit to India, aimed at expanding business and trade relations. The visit follows a landmark trade deal signed in July, which is expected to significantly boost the UK's GDP and bilateral trade. During the trip, Starmer announced that more UK universities will open campuses in India and that three Bollywood films will be produced in the UK, signaling deeper cultural and economic ties. The trade deal will see India lower its average tariff on UK products from 15% to 3%.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>The UK government has launched a review of what it calls "outdated" licensing rules in England and Wales, which could lead to extended opening hours for pubs and bars. The proposed reforms aim to cut red tape, make it easier for venues to serve food outdoors, and host more live music to boost local economies. Prime Minister Sir Keir Starmer stated the review is intended to support community hubs and drive economic growth. However, critics, including the charity Alcohol Change UK, have warned that relaxing alcohol regulations could lead to an increase in antisocial behavior and strain on emergency services.</p>

          <p>Shares of Hong Kong's Hang Seng Bank surged nearly 30% after its parent company, HSBC, announced a proposal to take the lender private in a deal valuing it at over $37 billion. HSBC, which already owns about 63% of Hang Seng, offered to buy the remaining shares at a 33% premium to the recent average price. The move is part of HSBC's strategy to strengthen its presence in Hong Kong and streamline its corporate structure, as parent-subsidiary dual listings can present governance challenges. The deal underscores HSBC's confidence in Hong Kong as a key financial hub connecting international markets with mainland China. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>Scotland's national football team is in a strong position to secure a World Cup play-off spot by the end of this weekend's qualifiers. Following a draw with Denmark and a win over Belarus, Scotland can reach 10 points by winning their upcoming home games against Greece and Belarus. If Scotland achieves this and Greece loses its next two matches, the Scots would be guaranteed at least a second-place finish in their group. This would secure a path to the play-offs as they aim to qualify for their first World Cup since 1998.</p>

          <p>The announced ceasefire and hostage agreement between Israel and Hamas represents a significant breakthrough in the two-year conflict, largely driven by direct pressure from U.S. President Trump. While this first phase involves releasing hostages and withdrawing some Israeli troops, it does not guarantee a permanent end to the war. Key unresolved issues include Hamas's disarmament and the future governance of Gaza, which remain major obstacles. Israeli Prime Minister Netanyahu faces political pressure from ultranationalist coalition partners who oppose any deal perceived as stopping short of total victory over Hamas.</p>

          <p>China has launched a pioneering thermal power station in the Gobi Desert that utilizes a dual-tower design to generate electricity, a world first. The plant in Gansu province uses nearly 27,000 mirrors to focus sunlight onto two 200-meter towers, which heat molten salt to store energy and produce steam for turbines. This configuration allows the plant to continue generating power even after sunset or on cloudy days. The dual-tower system is reportedly 25% more effective than a single-tower design and requires fewer mirrors, reducing construction costs and improving efficiency.</p>

In an interview, Kogan expressed sympathy for fans of clubs like Sheffield Wednesday, which has faced significant financial problems, including failing to pay player wages on time. The regulator's primary remit is to ensure the financial stability and security of clubs throughout the football pyramid. It will also be tasked with resolving the financial redistribution impasse between the Premier League and the English Football League.</p>
