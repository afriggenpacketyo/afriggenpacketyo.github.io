          <p>Tesla's stock experienced an 8% increase following the launch of its Model Y robotaxi service in Austin, Texas. The autonomous rides are currently available to a limited number of invited riders, including Tesla enthusiasts and shareholders. CEO Elon Musk announced a flat fee of $4.20 per ride, praising the Tesla AI software and chip design teams for their work. However, reports have surfaced of the robotaxis potentially violating traffic rules, such as traveling the wrong way down a road and braking abruptly in traffic. This article details the market reaction to Tesla's latest venture and raises questions about the robotaxis' real-world performance.</p>

          <p>Leading U.S. health insurers, including CVS Health, UnitedHealthcare, and Cigna, have voluntarily agreed to streamline and expedite prior authorizations, a process often criticized for causing delays and physician burnout. The changes aim to connect patients to care more quickly and reduce administrative burdens on providers. By the start of 2027, a common standard for electronic submissions will be established, with at least 80% of electronic approvals answered in real-time. Individual plans will also reduce the types of claims subject to prior authorization requests by 2026, potentially impacting 257 million Americans. This article reports on the health insurance industry's effort to improve the prior authorization process.</p>

          <p>Tech stocks, once considered a safe haven during market volatility, are experiencing a shift, with Apple no longer acting as the equities market's closest thing to a bond. While tech has rebounded strongly from the early 2025 tariff-triggered selloff, Apple has underperformed, raising questions about the sector's traditional role. Investors are now playing tech through broader market bets, with significant weighting to tech in S&P 500 index funds and ETFs. Experts suggest investors are diversifying with traditional defensive sectors like utilities and consumer staples, while others view market volatility as a buying opportunity for tech stocks, particularly those involved in AI.

          <p>Oil prices experienced a sharp decline after Iran launched a missile strike on a U.S. airbase in Qatar, with no casualties reported. U.S. crude oil and global benchmark Brent both fell significantly, reaching their lowest levels since Israel started bombing Iran. The market selloff indicates investors believe the conflict will de-escalate following President Trump's strike on Iran. Some analysts suggest Trump's strategy aims to achieve peace through strength, and further escalation from Iran is unlikely.

The Dodgers are considering various factors, including his base-stealing and batting order, as they manage his workload. The team is unsure if Ohtani will be fully stretched out like a traditional starter this season, but they remain committed to erring on the side of caution.
