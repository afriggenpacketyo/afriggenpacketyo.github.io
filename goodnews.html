          <p>The U.S. House of Representatives passed President Donald Trump's tax bill with a narrow 215-214 vote, marking a significant victory for Republicans. The bill, comprising over 1,000 pages of legislation and amendments, garnered support from most Republicans while facing unanimous opposition from Democrats, along with a few dissenting Republicans. The bill includes tax cuts paired with adjustments to the social safety net, and it now faces a complex path through the Senate, where it will be considered under budget reconciliation rules, requiring a simple majority for passage.</p>

          <p>ASML has developed High NA, a $400 million chipmaking machine that is transforming microchip manufacturing, which took nearly a decade to develop. The High NA machine is larger than a double-decker bus and comprised of four modules manufactured in different countries. It takes seven partially loaded Boeing 747s to ship one system to a customer. The world's first commercial installation occurred at Intel's Oregon chip fabrication plant in 2024, with only five machines shipped to date. High NA is the latest generation of ASML's Extreme Ultraviolet (EUV) machines, and it improves chip performance, speed, and yield, reducing cycle time by 60%.</p>

          <p>Lenovo Group, the world's largest PC maker, reported robust annual results driven by strong demand for AI products, with revenue up 21% to $69.1 billion and net income rising 37% to $1.4 billion. However, the company is grappling with unexpected tariffs imposed by the U.S. government, which have negatively impacted its most recent quarter. CEO Yang Yuanqing expressed surprise at the sudden implementation of the tariffs, describing the financial hit as significant and affecting profit growth. Investor concerns over escalating U.S.-China trade tensions led to a decline in Lenovo's Hong Kong-listed shares.</p>

          <p>Chinese President Xi Jinping has called on his French counterpart, Emmanuel Macron, to collaborate in safeguarding international trade rules, according to CCTV. The leaders spoke by phone, a year after Xi's visit to France.

However, tensions remain between the two largest economies, particularly following a U.S. ban on Huawei Technology‚Äôs AI chips.</p>

          <p>Airlines are facing challenges during the peak summer travel season due to delivery delays at Boeing and Airbus, leading to a shortage of commercial jets. Despite this capacity issue, EasyJet CEO Kenton Jarvis remains optimistic about the demand outlook, noting that bookings for the third and fourth quarters are ahead of last year. EasyJet reported a pre-tax loss for the first half of the year, but current bookings suggest it will meet full-year profit expectations. Shares of the company traded down 4% following the report.</p>

          <p>Bitcoin continued its rally, hitting a new record high above $111,000, driven by positive momentum, optimism around U.S. crypto regulation, and continued interest from institutional buyers. This price rise occurs despite a drop in U.S. stock markets, diverging from bitcoin's typical correlation with equity markets. Investors may be seeking alternative stores of value amid broader macro concerns, including Moody's recent downgrade of U.S. sovereign debt. Positive regulatory developments in the U.S. and support from figures like President Trump and JPMorgan CEO Jamie Dimon have also contributed to the market's bullish sentiment.

OpenAI's purchase of Ive's hardware company, co-founded by the designer of Apple's iconic products, marks its largest acquisition to date. The all-stock deal mirrors Facebook's acquisition of Instagram before its IPO, aiming to gain traction in a rapidly growing market.

          <p>The House passed changes to the federal deduction for state and local taxes (SALT) as part of President Trump's tax package. The bill increases the SALT cap to $40,000, phasing out over $500,000, and goes into effect in 2025. The SALT cap and income phaseout would increase annually by 1% from 2026 through 2033. However, the revised text would also reduce itemized deductions for certain taxpayers in the 37% income tax bracket, which could reduce the benefit of the higher SALT cap.</p>

          <p>Net migration to the UK fell by almost 50% in 2024, with 431,000 more people arriving than leaving, compared to 860,000 the previous year. The decrease was driven by declining numbers of people coming to work and study due to changes introduced by the previous Conservative government, and the departure of those who arrived on study visas after Covid-19 restrictions eased. The number of asylum seekers in hotels has also fallen, though it remains higher than when Labour came to power. The government aims to further reduce net migration through measures in the Immigration White Paper.</p>
