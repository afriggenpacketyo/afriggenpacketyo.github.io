          <p>The Trump administration is reportedly considering a list of 11 individuals to succeed Jerome Powell as the next Federal Reserve Chair. Among the candidates are newly named figures like Jefferies' David Zervos and BlackRock's Rick Rieder, alongside previously mentioned names such as Fed governors and former officials. Treasury Secretary Scott Bessent is said to be leading a "deliberate process" to interview all candidates and present a final list to the president. The extensive list and thorough process suggest a decision is not imminent, potentially delaying the appointment and its impact on monetary policy. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>President Trump is scheduled to hold a virtual meeting with Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy and various NATO leaders before his upcoming summit with Russian President Vladimir Putin. The meeting, convened by German Chancellor Friedrich Merz, is an effort by European allies to ensure their perspectives are considered amid fears of being sidelined in peace negotiations. European leaders and Ukraine are wary that a direct Trump-Putin discussion could result in concessions favorable to Moscow without their input. Zelenskyy has emphasized that any "talks about us, without us, will not work," underscoring the high stakes for Ukrainian sovereignty.</p>

        </div>
        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>An opinion article argues that the West misinterprets China's rise in green technology, labeling it "China Shock 2.0," when it should be seen as a constructive force. The authors contend that unlike past manufacturing disruptions, China's leadership in sectors like electric vehicles and solar power is building new global industries. China is effectively underwriting the world's green transition by dramatically driving down costs, such as halving the price of solar panels in just one year. The piece suggests that instead of reflexive protectionism, other nations should focus on investment to keep pace with this transformative shift.</p>

        </div>
        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>The world-famous Barbie doll was inspired by a German character named Lilli, who originated in a titillating comic strip in the Bild tabloid newspaper in 1952. Created to appeal to male readers, Lilli was a sensual, "sassy secretary" often interpreted as a high-class call girl. In 1955, she was turned into a plastic doll that was popular as a gag gift for men. Mattel co-founder Ruth Handler discovered the Lilli doll in Switzerland, bought the rights, and in 1959, launched a modified version named after her daughter, Barbara, creating the global icon known today.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>A drop in the average 30-year fixed-rate mortgage rate to 6.67% has triggered a significant 23% weekly jump in refinancing applications, reaching their highest level since last April. According to the Mortgage Bankers Association, homeowners are taking advantage of the lower rates to reduce their payments. However, the decline in rates did little to spur new home purchases, with applications for those mortgages rising by only 1%. The data also showed a notable 25% increase in demand for adjustable-rate mortgages (ARMs), as their rates became more attractive compared to fixed-rate loans. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>A research team from the University of Science and Technology of China has created the world's largest array of controllable atoms for quantum computing, a significant advance in the field. The scientists used an AI-driven system to arrange over 2,000 rubidium atoms, which serve as qubits, into precise patterns with remarkable speed. This achievement overcomes a major obstacle for atom-based quantum computers, which are considered a promising approach due to the stability and scalability of neutral atoms. The work, published in Physical Review Letters, was lauded by reviewers as a major leap forward for the technology.</p>

          <p>The new horror film "Weapons" uses the mysterious disappearance of 17 children to explore the societal suspicion directed at single, childless women. In the movie, the community immediately blames the children's unmarried teacher, Justine, played by Julia Garner, tapping into a long-standing cultural trope that frames such women as unstable threats. The article suggests the film critiques how society scapegoats those who deviate from traditional maternal norms, with Justine becoming the target of harassment and vigilante rage. Despite being a victim of public paranoia, her character emerges as the film's resilient heroine, determined to uncover the truth.</p>

          <p>The Las Vegas Sphere has sold over 120,000 tickets for its upcoming immersive screenings of "The Wizard of Oz," with sales expected to reach 200,000 before the first show. Sphere Entertainment CEO James Dolan called the project "groundbreaking," anticipating it will significantly boost visitor rates to the venue. The company used AI-powered technology to expand the classic 1939 film's frames to fit the massive screen, creating an experience enhanced with 4D elements like haptic seats and custom scents. Despite the high cost of the project, the strong demand signals a potential new revenue stream for the high-tech venue.</p>

          <p>GE Appliances has announced a major $3 billion, five-year investment to expand its U.S. operations, which will involve reshoring some production from China and Mexico. The plan is expected to create over 1,000 jobs across plants in Kentucky, Georgia, Alabama, Tennessee, and South Carolina. As part of the shift, production of certain gas ranges will move from Mexico to Georgia, while several refrigerator models and clothes washers currently made in China will be manufactured in Alabama and Kentucky, respectively. The company cited its long-term strategy of manufacturing closer to customers as the primary driver for the investment.</p>

          <p>Following a landmark antitrust ruling that found Google illegally monopolized the search market, AI startup Perplexity has made a $34.5 billion offer to buy the Chrome browser. The U.S. Department of Justice has proposed that Google be forced to sell Chrome as a remedy for its anti-competitive practices. Losing Chrome would be a major blow to Google, as the browser is a critical gateway for data collection that fuels its dominant advertising business. While other companies like OpenAI and Yahoo have expressed interest, Perplexity's unsolicited bid marks the first formal offer in a developing situation.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Scientists have identified a new species of ancient whale, named Janjucetus dullardi, from a well-preserved 26-million-year-old skull found on Victoria's Surf Coast in Australia. The dolphin-sized creature was a distant relative of modern baleen whales but was a "fearsome predator" with a mouth full of sharp, slicing teeth. The fossil was discovered by a local resident, Ross Dullard, for whom the species was named. This discovery adds to the understanding of early whale evolution, highlighting a period when this region was a cradle for some of the most unusual whales in history.</p>

          <h2>'King of the Hill' Revival Presents an Idealized, Fantasy-Like Vision of Community</h2>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>The revival of the animated series "King of the Hill" is reviewed as presenting a comforting but perhaps unrealistic vision of American suburban life. The show's focus on close-knit neighborly relations and strong social ties feels idealistic in an era of increasing social and political fragmentation. The article argues that by largely avoiding today's divisive culture wars, the show offers a "rosy coexistence" that now seems like a fantasy. While this gentle approach is appealing, it glosses over the real-world tensions that have reshaped many American communities since the show's original run.</p>
