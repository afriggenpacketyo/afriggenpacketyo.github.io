          <p>A US federal court has blocked President Donald Trump's sweeping tariffs, ruling that the emergency law invoked by the White House does not grant the president unilateral authority to impose tariffs on nearly every country. The court stated that the US Constitution grants Congress exclusive powers to regulate commerce with other nations. The Trump administration has lodged an appeal to this ruling, leading to uncertainty about the future of these tariffs. The court's decision caused major stock markets in Asia to rise and the US dollar to gain against safe-haven currencies, reflecting investor relief. (not investment advice)</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Toyota Motor Corp. reported a 10% year-over-year increase in global sales for April, reaching a record 876,864 vehicles, driven by growing demand before the potential impact of higher U.S. tariffs on imported cars. Global production also rose by 7.8% to 814,787 vehicles, marking an all-time high for April. While Toyota plans to absorb the tariff costs without passing them on to consumers, analysts anticipate pressure to do so if the higher levy remains long-term. The company expects a 34.9% drop in net profit for the full business year through March due to Trump's tariff measures and a stronger yen. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>A US federal court has ruled against President Trump's tariffs, stating that he does not have the authority to impose them without congressional approval. The court found the tariffs unlawful and permanently vacated them, leading to a surge in stock futures. This decision is seen as a significant blow to Trump's economic agenda and a potential deepening of the divide between the administration and the judiciary. The ruling raises questions about the mechanisms to lift the tariffs and creates uncertainty for governments and businesses globally.</p>

          <p>CBS has secured a court ruling allowing it to continue distributing "Wheel of Fortune" and "Jeopardy!" during its ongoing legal battle with Sony Pictures Television. The appellate court granted CBS's request to maintain a stay, enabling the network to continue its distribution duties during the appeal. Sony terminated its distribution deal with CBS in August, alleging unauthorized licensing deals and budget cuts. CBS maintains that Sony lacks the legal right to unilaterally sever ties, as the company took over distribution when it acquired syndication company King World Productions in 1999.</p>

          <p>Los Angeles is facing numerous challenges as it prepares to host the 2028 Summer Olympics, including recovery from recent fires, potential worker shortages, and a projected budget deficit.

Despite these challenges, Mayor Karen Bass and Olympics chairman Casey Wasserman remain confident that the Games will be a success and a needed boost for the city. They aim to use the Olympics to improve Los Angeles, drawing inspiration from the successful 1984 Olympics.</p>

Community organizations and legal offices note a surge in applications since the arrival of the Trump administration and the expansion of ICE operations.

          <p>A federal judge has temporarily blocked the Trump administration from terminating legal protections for hundreds of thousands of migrants who entered the United States through Biden-era programs. The order applies to Ukrainians, Afghans, military members, and their relatives, directing the government to restart processing applications for those renewing their status. Judge Indira Talwani stated that the administration's termination of these programs was likely unlawful and would cause chaos. This decision is a victory for civil and immigrant rights groups challenging the administration's efforts to strip legal status from various groups.</p>

CEO Jensen Huang noted that the Chinese market for AI chips is "effectively closed to U.S. industry" due to the H20 export ban. Despite political tensions, Nvidia's growth is driven by demand for its artificial intelligence chips, used in applications like OpenAI's ChatGPT. (not investment advice)</p>

The reservoirs, aimed for completion in 2036 and 2040, will provide resilience against future droughts, according to Dr. Glenn Watts. While the move streamlines the planning process, it could face local opposition and potentially increase household water bills, as well as take more than a decade to complete.</p>
