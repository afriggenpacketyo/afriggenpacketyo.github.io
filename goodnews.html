          <p>The United Kingdom has initiated an operation to evacuate critically ill and injured Palestinian children from Gaza, bringing them to the UK for treatment within the NHS. This government-coordinated effort, involving multiple departments, marks the first time the UK has evacuated children through its own scheme during the ongoing conflict. Foreign Secretary Yvette Cooper confirmed the departure of the initial group, which is understood to include 30 to 50 children, some accompanied by family members. This humanitarian action comes as Gaza's health system is severely strained and reports of malnutrition-related deaths continue.</p>

          <div class="timestamp">2025-09-13 21:25:32 EDT</div>
        </div>
        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>California lawmakers have passed Senate Bill 682, a measure to ban PFAS, commonly known as "forever chemicals," from cookware, cleaning products, and various other household items. This legislation, now awaiting Governor Gavin Newsom's signature, aims to mitigate significant environmental and public health threats linked to PFAS exposure, including cancer and organ damage. The move has generated debate, with environmental groups supporting the ban due to concerns about PFAS shedding from nonstick pans, while some celebrity chefs and industry alliances argue for the safety of current materials like PTFE when used correctly. If signed, manufacturers will have a grace period to comply with the new regulations, with cookware required to be compliant by 2030.</p>

          <p>Alibaba Group Holding has achieved a significant breakthrough in artificial intelligence with its new foundation model, Qwen3-Next-80B-A3B, which offers strong performance at a substantially smaller size. Developers report that this model operates ten times faster than its predecessor, Qwen3-32B, while reducing training costs by 90%. Industry experts, like Stability AI co-founder Emad Mostaque, noted the model's impressive performance against larger, more expensive models from the previous year. This innovation positions Alibaba as a leader in efficient AI development, contrasting sharply with the high training costs associated with models like Google's Gemini Ultra.</p>

          <p>A parent, Julie, recounts the traumatic experience of pushing her autistic daughter, Rosie, to attend school despite severe emotional distress and self-harm, ultimately leading to Rosie's emotionally based school avoidance (EBSA). This article highlights a growing issue in UK schools, where headteachers report a significant increase in EBSA, particularly post-Covid. The condition, characterized by extreme anxiety about school, is linked to sensory needs, social media pressures, and a lack of early intervention. Educational psychologists and school leaders advocate for a "support first" approach, emphasizing inclusion and mental health provision over punitive measures for absences.</p>

          <p>California lawmakers have passed a complex package of bills aimed at stabilizing the energy market while advancing climate goals, including a measure to allow 2,000 new oil wells annually in the San Joaquin Valley. This last-minute deal, brokered by state leaders, also tightens safety and regulatory requirements for offshore drilling, making it more difficult. The legislation extends the state's cap-and-trade program through 2045 and creates a pathway for California to join a regional electricity market. While proponents argue the measures address affordability concerns and support the transition to clean energy, some progressive Democrats criticized the oil expansion as a "regulatory giveaway" to industry.</p>

The land bridge will offer an alternative for moving natural gas liquids, while the $1.6 billion Rio Indo dam, set for completion by 2032, will supplement water for Lake Gatun.
