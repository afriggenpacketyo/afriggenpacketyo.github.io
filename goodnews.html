          <p>In an article published in the Communist Party's theoretical journal, Chinese President Xi Jinping has reaffirmed his country's commitment to globalization and free trade. He criticized the rise of unilateralism, protectionism, and sanctions, positioning China as a champion of an open international economic environment. Xi's statements, compiled from speeches since 2012, were released on the opening day of a major supply chain expo, emphasizing China's desire to uphold "genuine multilateralism." This stance contrasts with the more protectionist policies adopted by some Western nations, highlighting ongoing global economic tensions.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>A recent article in the People's Daily, the Communist Party's official newspaper, has urged China's local governments to utilize their legislative powers to foster economic development. The piece argues that tailored, local laws create a stable and predictable environment, allowing market entities to operate effectively within a legal framework. This approach marks a shift from relying on top-down directives to using legal systems to address economic challenges. The call for creative legislation reflects a strategy to empower cities and adapt to specific regional needs for long-term economic benefits.</p>

          <h2>Scientists Crossbreed Honduran and Floridian Corals to Restore Damaged Reefs</h2>
          <div class="timestamp">2025-07-15 20:58:18 EDT</div>
        </div>
        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>In a pioneering effort to save Florida's dwindling coral reefs, marine scientists are crossbreeding native Elkhorn coral with a hardier strain from Honduras. This project, nicknamed "Flonduran" coral, aims to introduce genetic diversity and resilience to Florida's reef system, which has been devastated by warming waters and disease. More than 95% of the state's Elkhorn coral, crucial for coastal protection, has been lost. The newly created hybrid corals have been planted on wild reefs for the first time, with hopes they can survive future marine heatwaves and help rebuild the vital ecosystem.</p>

          <p>Popular YouTube golf influencer Grant Horvat has turned down a sponsor's exemption to compete in the PGA Tour's Barracuda Championship. Horvat, who has nearly 1.4 million subscribers, explained his decision was due to the Tour's rules that would have prevented his crew from filming his rounds for his channel. He stated that documenting his experiences for his audience is central to his career and the reason he received the invitation in the first place. While expressing hope to participate in a Tour event in the future under different media rules, he chose to remain loyal to his content-creation model.</p>

          <p>The Los Angeles Chargers have revealed two new alternate uniforms for the upcoming NFL season, including a striking all-gold "Charger Power" set and a navy blue "Super Chargers" throwback. The gold uniform, a first for the team, has generated a wide range of reactions online, with comparisons to everything from mustard bottles to the Minions. The navy blue uniform is a modern take on the look the team wore from 1992 to 2006, a period that included their only Super Bowl appearance. The team hopes the new designs, particularly the gold, will appeal to a younger fan demographic.</p>

          <p>The Trump administration has announced a new trade agreement with Indonesia, which will see the U.S. impose a 19% tariff on Indonesian goods, a level lower than the previously threatened 32%. As part of the deal, President Trump stated that Indonesia has committed to significant purchases from the U.S., including $15 billion in energy, $4.5 billion in agricultural products, and 50 Boeing aircraft. The pact was finalized after a call between Trump and Indonesian President Prabowo Subianto. This agreement is one of several being negotiated as countries seek to avoid the administration's broader tariff plans. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>Brazil's top prosecutor has formally recommended that the Supreme Federal Court find former President Jair Bolsonaro guilty of attempting to orchestrate a coup after his 2022 election loss. The prosecutor's filing accuses Bolsonaro and seven others of forming an "armed criminal association" to "violently overthrow the democratic order." The charges stem from his unsubstantiated claims of voter fraud and the subsequent storming of government buildings by his supporters on January 8, 2023. If convicted, Bolsonaro could face up to 40 years in prison, marking a significant moment for Brazil's democratic institutions.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>A growing number of central banks, particularly in Africa and Latin America, are buying gold directly from local mines instead of on the international market. This strategy allows them to bolster their reserves using local currency, avoiding the need to spend foreign exchange reserves like the U.S. dollar. According to the World Gold Council, this approach is often cheaper and supports the domestic mining industry. With gold prices surging, nations like Ghana, Tanzania, and Colombia are using this method to strengthen their financial buffers against global economic and geopolitical risks, reflecting a broader trend of de-dollarization.</p>

A judge declared Torres factually innocent in 2022 after a review by the California Innocence Project and the D.A.'s Conviction Integrity Unit. Torres was convicted based on shaky witness testimony, despite having an alibi and wearing a cast that would have made firing a gun difficult. The settlement resolves his lawsuit against the Sheriff's Department for failing to disclose exculpatory evidence and highlights critical flaws in the original investigation.</p>

          <p>An independent review of the UK's National Health Service has recommended that physician associates (PAs) and anaesthesia associates (AAs) should have their titles changed to "assistants." The recommendation aims to reduce patient confusion and clarify the distinction between these roles and fully qualified doctors. The review, prompted by safety concerns and cases where patients mistook PAs for doctors, also suggests standardized uniforms and badges. It further states that associates should not be responsible for diagnosing patients. The BMA, the doctors' union, welcomed the changes but argued they should have gone further.</p>

          <p>The iconic Palm House at London's Royal Botanic Gardens, Kew, is set for a massive £50 million renovation that will require its closure for five years starting in 2027. The project will involve moving 1,300 plants, replacing 16,000 panes of glass, and repairing the historic ironwork, which has corroded in the building's humid environment. A key goal of the refurbishment is to make the Victorian-era glasshouse net-zero in emissions by replacing its gas boilers with modern heat pumps. Horticulturists have already begun the complex process of propagating and relocating the priceless tropical plant collection.</p>

          <p>The UK's Advertising Standards Authority (ASA) has banned an advert for Trip drinks for making unauthorized health claims, such as its ability to "help you feel calm" and reduce stress. The advert for the magnesium-infused beverage was found to be in breach of rules governing health claims for food and drink products. The ASA ruled that language like "crafted for calm" improperly implied the drink could treat anxiety, a prohibited claim. The company was also cited for an inaccurate "0g added sugar" claim and has been ordered not to run the ad again in its current form.</p>

The troops were federalized by the Trump administration to address protests over large-scale immigration raids, a move criticized by state and local leaders as an overreach of authority. While the administration cited a need to quell "lawlessness," the protests were largely peaceful and handled by local police.

          <p>Forty-six years after he was executed for treason, South Korea's former intelligence chief, Kim Jae-gyu, is being retried for the 1979 assassination of authoritarian President Park Chung-hee. Kim's family fought for the retrial, arguing he was a patriot who acted to prevent a bloodbath and restore democracy, not a traitor seeking power. The original trial, held under martial law, is now being scrutinized for potential procedural flaws and the use of torture to obtain confessions. The retrial re-examines a pivotal, polarizing moment in South Korean history, forcing a national reckoning with the legacies of both the assassin and the dictator he killed.</p>
