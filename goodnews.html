          <p>A federal judge ruled it unconstitutional for the Trump administration to mandate states' cooperation with immigration enforcement as a condition for receiving Federal Emergency Management Agency (FEMA) grants. This significant decision sided with 20 mostly Democratic states, including California and New York, which had sued, arguing the policy violated federal law and the Constitution. The ruling is a major legal setback for the administration's efforts to penalize "sanctuary" cities and states. The judge emphasized the irreparable harm states would suffer from losing critical disaster preparedness and response funds, highlighting the policy's arbitrary and capricious nature.</p>

          <p>Parents of Mason Connor, a child diagnosed with autism, reported significant speech improvements after he began taking leucovorin, an inexpensive drug typically used for chemotherapy side effects. Dr. Richard Frye, a pediatric neurologist, is actively researching leucovorin's potential for autism, theorizing it bypasses a folic acid transport blockage in the brain. The FDA is now considering approving leucovorin as a treatment for autism, despite limited large-scale trials, highlighting a major gap in drug development for repurposing old medications. This development offers considerable hope for many children with autism and their families.</p>

          <p>A 6.2-magnitude earthquake struck western and northern Venezuela on Wednesday, with its epicenter located near the oil town of Mene Grande at a depth of 7.8 kilometers. The powerful tremor, also felt in neighboring Colombia and the Caribbean islands of Aruba, Curacao, and Bonaire, caused buildings to shake and alarm in cities like Caracas and Maracaibo. Despite the strong magnitude, there were fortunately no immediate reports of casualties or serious damage. This article notes that such strong earthquakes are not common in Venezuela, emphasizing the unusual nature of the event for the region.</p>

          <p>The Shreveport Fire Department swiftly responded to a house fire in the Southern Trace neighborhood, which is believed to have been caused by a lightning strike. Fire units arrived within seven minutes, and a second alarm was called due to the home's substantial size and the neighborhood's history of previous fires, including another this year. Fortunately, no injuries were reported, as no one was home at the time of the incident. While the home sustained moderate to heavy damage, it is not considered a complete loss, thanks to the rapid response. The fire remains under investigation by local authorities to confirm its exact cause.</p>

          <p>CNBC's Jim Cramer announced he is becoming significantly more cautious about highly speculative stocks, citing growing market froth and recent comments from Federal Reserve Chair Jerome Powell. Powell indicated that equity prices are "fairly highly valued" and that weakness in the labor market is now outweighing concerns about stubborn inflation. Cramer, who previously supported many speculative names, now advises investors to critically assess if these stocks have overshot their fundamental worth. He encouraged considering individual risk tolerance but did not completely deter from all speculative investments, signaling a strategic adjustment in his market outlook. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>European Ryder Cup captain Luke Donald suggested his team is "fuelled by something money can’t buy," in what appeared to be a subtle critique of their American rivals. For the first time, all 12 U.S. team members and their captain are receiving $500,000 stipends, with a portion designated for charity, while European players remain unpaid. Donald emphasized pride, national representation, and the legacy of past players as Europe's primary motivators. American players, including Collin Morikawa, defended the payments, citing opportunities to support their teams and communities.

          <p>A 23-year-old Royal Bank of Canada (RBC) employee, Ibrahim El-Hakim, has been charged with fraud, unauthorized computer use, identity theft, and trafficking identity information for allegedly accessing Prime Minister Mark Carney's account and others. RBC independently identified the unauthorized access and cooperated closely with law enforcement, leading to El-Hakim's arrest. Police stated there was no threat to Carney's safety or national security. An affidavit suggests El-Hakim's actions might be linked to organized crime, as he was allegedly paid to create fake bank profiles and obtain lines of credit, highlighting a significant internal security breach.</p>
