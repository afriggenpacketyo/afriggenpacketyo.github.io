          <p>Trump Media & Technology Group, the company behind Truth Social, Truth+, and Truth.Fi, has announced that its board approved a stock buyback of up to $400 million, causing the stock to rise about 3% premarket. The Florida-based company, trading under the ticker DJT, may repurchase both common stock and warrants through open market transactions, with all repurchased shares to be retired. CEO Devin Nunes stated that the company's $3 billion balance sheet provides the flexibility to support shareholder returns and explore strategic opportunities. Donald Trump, indirectly owning over 114 million shares through a revocable trust, remains the largest shareholder. The company's financial position allows for this move to potentially increase shareholder value. Optimism surrounding the company's performance is reflected in the market's initial positive reaction.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>With the average credit card balance rising, experts clarify the rules regarding inheriting credit card debt. Generally, individuals are not responsible for a deceased loved one's credit card debt unless they were a co-signer, a joint account holder, or a spouse in a community property state where the debt was incurred during the marriage. The deceased's estate is typically responsible for settling debts before assets are passed to heirs; if the estate is insolvent, the debt may go unpaid. Experts advise notifying credit card companies and credit bureaus upon a death and consulting with an estate attorney before responding to debt collectors. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>Uranium, discovered in 1789, is a naturally occurring radioactive element found in trace amounts in the environment. It has a silver-white-gray finish and is denser than other heavy metals. Uranium is used in both enriched and depleted forms, with enriched uranium serving as fuel for nuclear power plants and weapons, while depleted uranium is used for radiation shielding. Exposure to high concentrations of uranium can be life-threatening, causing cancer and organ damage, and it can enter the environment through industrial runoff and mining operations. The majority of the world's uranium production comes from Kazakhstan, Canada, and Australia.</p>

Strategies for securing good rates include looking at online banks and considering short-term CDs, which currently offer higher interest rates than longer terms due to the inverted yield curve.
