          <p>Okinawa marked the 80th anniversary of the end of the Battle of Okinawa, a fierce World War II ground battle between Japan and the United States. The ceremony, attended by Prime Minister Shigeru Ishiba and Okinawa Gov. Denny Tamaki, included the addition of 342 names to the list of war dead, bringing the total to 242,567 people. Tamaki emphasized the importance of preserving the lessons of the battle and passing them on to future generations as the spirit of Okinawa. Ishiba pledged to work towards a peaceful and prosperous Okinawa, acknowledging the prefecture's disproportionate burden in hosting U.S. military bases. The event highlighted the ongoing local discontent over the U.S. military presence and the need for continued efforts towards peace and stability in the region.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>NHS Lothian is considering establishing a ketamine clinic to treat severe depression, offering an alternative to electroconvulsive therapy (ECT). This move follows the opening of a private clinic in Lanarkshire that provides ketamine-assisted therapy for treatment-resistant depression. Ketamine, known for its recreational use, is being explored for its potential to make patients more receptive to psychotherapy, as reported by patients who have tried it. While esketamine nasal spray is approved for treatment-resistant depression in Scotland, intravenous ketamine is not yet routinely available, raising hopes for broader NHS access and partnerships. The article presents the perspectives of psychiatrists and patients on the potential benefits and risks of using ketamine as a treatment option.</p>

          <p>Despite the U.S. joining the war between Israel and Iran, global markets have largely shrugged off the escalation. The MSCI World index experienced only a slight decline, and safe-haven assets traded mixed, suggesting investors view the conflict as contained. Analysts believe the market sees the attack on Iran as a relief, diminishing the nuclear threat in the region. However, traders are closely monitoring potential countermeasures from Iran following the U.S. strikes on its nuclear facilities. The overall sentiment suggests a belief that the conflict will not significantly destabilize global markets.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>The upcoming NATO summit in The Hague is expected to focus on increasing defense spending, a key demand of U.S. President Donald Trump. Secretary-General Mark Rutte's persuasive efforts, particularly with Germany, have made this goal potentially acceptable to most NATO countries. The summit aims to give Trump a win and rebalance the alliance, but concerns remain about potential resistance from some European nations. The article also highlights the lack of ambition regarding Ukraine's NATO aspirations and the potential for a disappointing summit for the country. The main goal of the summit is to deter Russia and ensure the safety of European and NATO citizens.</p>

          <h2>New York City to Use Ranked Choice Voting in Mayoral Primary</h2>
          <div class="timestamp">2025-06-23 00:04:00 EDT</div>
        </div>
        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>New York City will use ranked choice voting in its Democratic mayoral primary election, a system where voters rank multiple candidates in order of preference. If no candidate receives a majority of first-choice votes, the candidate with the fewest votes is eliminated, and their votes are redistributed to the voters' second choices. This process continues until a candidate secures a majority, potentially leading to a different outcome than traditional elections. While proponents argue it prevents wasted votes and ensures broader support for the winner, critics raise concerns about complexity, transparency, and potential for unexpected results. The article explains the mechanics of ranked choice voting and its potential impact on the election.</p>

          <p>The Vera C. Rubin Observatory in Chile has unveiled its first images, showcasing its ability to peer into the universe with unprecedented detail. The images, including vast gas and dust clouds in a star-forming region, demonstrate the power of the observatory's digital camera. The telescope aims to transform our understanding of the universe by detecting killer asteroids, mapping the Milky Way, and answering questions about dark matter. This marks the beginning of a 10-year survey of the southern night sky, promising to increase the number of known objects in our solar system tenfold. The design and precision of the observatory are highlighted, emphasizing its ability to capture faint galaxies and supernova explosions.</p>
