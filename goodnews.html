        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>A federal judge dismissed Justin Baldoni's $400 million lawsuit against Blake Lively, Ryan Reynolds, and Lively's publicist, Leslie Sloane. Baldoni accused them of civil extortion and defamation after Lively alleged sexual harassment and retaliation against him, accusations which Baldoni denied. A similar defamation lawsuit against The New York Times was also dismissed, though Baldoni and his company can amend some claims by June 23. Lively's lawyers hailed the decision as a victory, calling Baldoni's lawsuit a sham, while representatives for Baldoni did not immediately respond to requests for comment.</p>

          <p>The FDA has approved Merck's Enflonsia, a shot to protect infants from RSV, setting up competition with Sanofi and AstraZeneca's Beyfortus. Merck plans to begin taking orders in July and deliver shipments before the RSV season starts, offering doctors another option to combat the virus, which causes significant infant mortality and hospitalizations. Enflonsia can be administered regardless of infant weight, potentially simplifying dosing compared to Beyfortus. Sanofi plans to increase Beyfortus supply after shortages last year, and the CDC will soon provide recommendations for RSV shots and other immunizations.</p>

          <p>Canada has pledged to meet NATO's 2% defense spending target sooner than initially planned, announcing a military buildup including submarines, aircraft, and ships. Prime Minister Mark Carney stated that this action is necessary to counter threats from hostile governments, terrorist entities, and cyber criminals, acknowledging Canada's over-reliance on the U.S. for defense. The new strategy involves increased investment in soldiers and equipment, expanding military capabilities, strengthening the domestic defense industry, and diversifying defense partnerships, with a cash increase of C$9.3bn for this fiscal year.</p>

          <p>The clean energy transition is heavily reliant on critical minerals like lithium, cobalt, and copper, essential for technologies such as solar panels, batteries, and electric motors. Demand for these minerals is expected to increase significantly by 2040, potentially leading to supply chain vulnerabilities. The US is a major consumer but not a significant producer of these minerals, prompting efforts to increase domestic production and secure international supplies. Scientists are also exploring alternative materials to reduce reliance on these critical elements.</p>
