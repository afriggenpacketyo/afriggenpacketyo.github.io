          <p>Social Security recipients will continue to receive their monthly benefit checks during the U.S. government shutdown, as the program is funded through mandatory spending that does not require annual congressional approval. However, the Social Security Administration's operational budget is affected, which could disrupt customer service functions. According to the agency's contingency plan, services such as benefit verifications, earnings record corrections, and the issuance of replacement Medicare cards would be halted. The shutdown might also delay the annual Cost-of-Living Adjustment (COLA) announcement, which is dependent on inflation data from the Labor Department.</p>

          <p>Warren Buffett's Berkshire Hathaway has agreed to purchase OxyChem, the petrochemical subsidiary of Occidental Petroleum, for $9.7 billion in an all-cash transaction. This marks Berkshire's largest acquisition since 2022 and comes as the conglomerate holds a near-record cash reserve of $344 billion. Occidental plans to use $6.5 billion of the proceeds to reduce its debt, a move its CEO, Vicki Hollub, stated will allow the company to resume its stock buyback program. Berkshire Hathaway, already a major shareholder in Occidental with a 28.2% stake, expects the deal to close in the fourth quarter.</p>

          <p>Germany celebrates German Unity Day on October 3rd, marking the formal reunification of East and West Germany in 1990, following the fall of the Berlin Wall in 1989. The date was chosen over November 9th to avoid coinciding with the anniversary of the 1938 Nazi pogroms. Despite 35 years of unity, recent polls indicate that significant social and economic disparities persist between the former East and West, with only 35% of Germans believing the two have largely grown together. Celebrations are typically subdued, with a main official festival hosted annually by a different federal state.</p>

          <p>A research team from Purdue University believes there is "very strong" evidence that a visual anomaly in a lagoon on the remote island of Nikumaroro is the wreckage of Amelia Earhart's lost aircraft. Earhart and navigator Fred Noonan disappeared in 1937 during an attempt to circumnavigate the globe. The object, visible in satellite imagery dating back to 1938, will be investigated by an expedition in November using sonar, magnetometers, and eventually dredging. If confirmed, the university hopes to recover the plane, which was originally funded by the Purdue Research Foundation and was intended to be returned after her flight.</p>

          <p>Vlad Tenev, CEO of Robinhood, has described the tokenization of real-world assets as an unstoppable "freight train" that will eventually encompass the entire financial system. Speaking at a conference, Tenev predicted that most major markets will establish a regulatory framework for tokenized assets like stocks, bonds, and real estate within the next five years. He highlighted Robinhood's own move to offer tokenized U.S. stocks to EU customers as a key development. Tenev believes this digital representation of assets on a blockchain will become the default method for trading, merging the worlds of cryptocurrency and traditional finance.</p>

          <p>England's women's cricket captain, Nat Sciver-Brunt, states her team is in a much better state mentally and physically heading into the World Cup compared to their Ashes defeat earlier in the year. After a poor performance against Australia led to a change in captaincy and coaching, the team has been rebuilding its confidence. Sciver-Brunt emphasized that the squad feels relaxed and well-prepared for their opening match against South Africa. The team is aiming for its first major trophy since their 2017 World Cup victory, hoping to move past a difficult period that included an early exit from the T20 World Cup.</p>

          <p>Following her death at age 91, Jane Goodall is being remembered not just for her groundbreaking research on chimpanzees but also for her radical advocacy for animal rights. Her work, which began in the 1960s, helped establish that animals possess complex social lives and interior worlds. Uniquely for a scientist of her stature, she translated these findings into a moral imperative, vocally opposing factory farming and invasive animal experimentation. This stance often placed her at odds with the mainstream scientific community, but she used her fame to champion veganism and support organizations seeking legal rights for nonhuman animals.</p>

          <h2>Tesla Reports 7% Rise in Q3 Deliveries Ahead of Expiring EV Tax Credit</h2>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Tesla announced a 7% year-over-year increase in vehicle deliveries for the third quarter of 2025, reaching 497,099 units. This growth was partly driven by a rush of U.S. buyers aiming to secure a federal EV tax credit that expired at the end of September. The positive sales in the U.S. helped offset a continuing slump in Europe, where the company faces increased competition and consumer backlash against CEO Elon Musk. Despite the rise in deliveries, vehicle production for the quarter saw a slight decline compared to the previous year, with 447,450 vehicles produced.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>A new study of data from the Cassini space probe has revealed that the hidden ocean on Saturn's moon Enceladus contains complex organic molecules, strengthening the case that it could host life. Scientists analyzed ice particles ejected from geysers on the moon's south pole, which were collected directly by the spacecraft. This confirms the molecules are present within the subsurface ocean and not just a product of long-term space exposure. While this discovery confirms Enceladus is habitable, researchers emphasize it does not prove it is inhabited, highlighting the need for a future mission to land on the moon.</p>

        </div>
        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Amid a high-interest-rate environment, home equity loans and HELOCs are presented as more affordable borrowing options for homeowners compared to personal loans or credit cards. As of early October, average rates for home equity loans range from 8.19% to 8.34%, while the average HELOC rate is 7.88%. These financial products allow homeowners to borrow against their home's equity, which currently averages over $300,000 in the U.S. The article notes that while these options offer lower rates and potential tax benefits, they use the home as collateral, posing a risk of foreclosure.
