        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>The Senate Finance Committee's version of the "big, beautiful bill" has set the stage for a potential clash with the House, as several Senate Republicans are raising concerns about the legislation. Key sticking points include the state and local tax (SALT) deduction cap, Medicaid provisions, and the debt limit increase. While the Senate bill keeps the SALT cap at $10,000, the House bill offers deductions up to $40,000 for those making less than $500,000 annually. The Senate legislation would also lower healthcare provider taxes in states that expanded Medicaid, potentially increasing the burden on those states. (not investment advice) The legislative process could be difficult, given the narrow margins in both chambers. The current environment appears to be relatively stable, but the possibility of increased conflict is present. The current state of affairs indicates a need for careful negotiation and compromise to ensure the bill's passage.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Japan, known for its pacifist constitution, is increasing its focus on arms exports, driven by security concerns and a desire to deepen ties with allies. Prime Minister Shigeru Ishiba has signaled a sharper focus on the defense sector, aiming to improve interoperability with allies and develop Japan's defense industrial base. By exporting arms, Japan can standardize maintenance processes and create joint training opportunities, strengthening cooperation with Western countries. The move also aims to revitalize the domestic defense industry, which has suffered from limited demand and reliance on U.S. weapons purchases. Japan's shift reflects a broader trend of rising global defense spending and a need to ensure its own security in a changing geopolitical landscape. This development suggests a move towards a more assertive role in international security.</p>

          <p>The city of Xian in western China has seen a rise in tourism, leading to a growth in "emergent" jobs such as hanfu stylists. As the government promotes traditional culture, more tourists are visiting the city to experience hanfu, traditional Chinese clothing. This has created a cottage industry employing costumiers, make-up artists, and photographers. In the past year, roughly 306 million trips were made to the city, generating tourism income of 376 billion yuan. The emergence of these new job opportunities is a positive sign for youth employment in China. The trend of embracing traditional culture is helping to drive economic growth and create new career paths.</p>

Arias' translation was commissioned by the U.S. State Department in 1945 to strengthen partnerships with Latin American countries.

Zhang's advice is based on his experience as the founder of Sohu.com, one of China's first internet companies.
