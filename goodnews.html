          <p>According to a CNBC study, North Carolina has been ranked as America's premier state for business, attributed to its robust economy, highly-rated workforce, and business-friendly regulations. The state has successfully attracted major investments from companies like JetZero and Amazon, bolstering its GDP and creating tens of thousands of jobs. However, this top ranking is contrasted by significant challenges, including a low quality of life score, minimal worker protections, and potential economic risks from federal policy shifts and the aftermath of Hurricane Helene.</p>

          <p>Delta Air Lines has reinstated its 2025 profit outlook, signaling a stronger-than-expected summer travel season and causing its stock to jump by 11%. CEO Ed Bastian stated that while booking levels are lower than initially forecast at the year's start, they have stabilized as consumers delay travel planning. The airline's updated full-year earnings projection is now $5.25 to $6.25 per share, reflecting adjustments for earlier demand drops and a more confident outlook on corporate and premium travel.

          <p>Following a comment by U.S. President Donald Trump praising the Liberian President's "good English," this article details the unique historical connections between Liberia and the United States. Founded in 1822 by freed African-American slaves, English is Liberia's official language, and the nation's culture, flag, and capital city of Monrovia all reflect a strong American influence. This context explains the linguistic and cultural familiarity that might have been observed by President Trump, highlighting a shared heritage that is not widely known.</p>

          <p>The UK's National Crime Agency has arrested four individuals in connection with the disruptive cyberattacks on retailers M&S and the Co-op. The suspects, including a 20-year-old woman and three teenage males, were apprehended on suspicion of blackmail, money laundering, and organized crime offenses. These hacks have caused severe operational issues, with M&S estimating a £300 million loss in profits and expecting disruptions to continue for months. The arrests mark a significant development in the investigation into the attacks, which also targeted the luxury retailer Harrods.</p>
