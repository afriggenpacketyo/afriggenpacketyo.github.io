          <p>China is leading the world in converting decommissioned coal mines into solar power projects, according to Global Energy Monitor. This trend aims to advance clean energy while potentially reducing a surplus of solar panels produced by Chinese manufacturers. Currently, 90 former coal mines in mainland China operate as solar-power facilities, with plans for additional projects. The initiative offers a chance to combine land restoration, local job creation, and clean energy deployment, serving as a symbolic move towards a just energy transition.</p>

          <p>Goliath, a Gal√°pagos tortoise at Zoo Miami, celebrated his 135th birthday and first Father's Day after successfully breeding with Sweet Pea. The hatchling, born after a four-month incubation, is the first of its kind at the zoo. In the wild, Gal√°pagos tortoise hatchlings are independent from birth, so Goliath and Sweet Pea have limited interaction with their offspring. The zoo has applied to the Guinness Book of World Records, hoping to recognize Goliath as the oldest first-time father in history.</p>

          <p>Texas has ceased providing new funding for the construction of a U.S.-Mexico border wall, reallocating resources to other border security measures. The decision follows President Trump's increased efforts to curb immigration, allowing the state to adjust its focus. Completed sections of the wall total 65 miles, with remaining funds allocated for ongoing projects through 2026. The shift reflects changing priorities and a decrease in migrant crossings, sparking mixed reactions from community members and officials.</p>

          <p>New York City's mayoral primary election will use ranked-choice voting, allowing voters to rank their top five candidates. If no candidate receives over 50% of first-choice votes, the candidate with the fewest votes is eliminated, and subsequent rounds count voters' next choices. This system has led to unique alliances, with some candidates cross-endorsing each other to prevent a specific candidate from winning. Results will be delayed due to the complexity of tabulating ranked-choice ballots, with preliminary totals expected after the polls close and fuller results reported a week later.</p>
