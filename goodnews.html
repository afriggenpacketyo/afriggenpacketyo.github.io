          <p>A U.S. federal judge has dismissed a $15 billion defamation lawsuit filed by Donald Trump against The New York Times, citing procedural issues with the complaint. Judge Steven Merryday criticized the 85-page filing as overly long and filled with language more suited for a political rally than a legal document. While the judge did not rule on the case's legal merits, he has given Trump's lawyers 28 days to submit a revised, more professional complaint that adheres to court standards. The newspaper welcomed the ruling, characterizing the original lawsuit as a political document intended to stifle independent reporting.</p>

          <p>In a recent interview, supermodel David Gandy reflected on his 25-year career and expressed serious concerns about the impact of artificial intelligence on the fashion industry. He is among 2,000 models calling for government regulation to protect image rights as AI-generated models become more common in campaigns. Gandy fears this trend could make human models, photographers, and makeup artists redundant, while also negatively impacting the mental health of young people viewing unrealistic, non-human images. The long-time face of Dolce & Gabbana also discussed his desire for privacy and his life as a father away from the public eye.</p>

          <p>Sculptor Martin Jennings has been selected to create the statue of Queen Elizabeth II for her national memorial in London's St James's Park. Jennings, known for his depictions of King Charles III and the Queen Mother, expressed his desire to capture the late monarch's "grandeur and dignity" and her steadfast devotion to duty. While the final design is not yet defined and will require Royal Family approval, he intends to consult public sentiment to create a fitting representation. The memorial project, which includes landscaped gardens and a new bridge, is set to be fully unveiled in 2026.</p>

          <p>A recent wave of multi-billion-pound investments in the UK by US tech giants like Microsoft and Google is fueling optimism about the country's potential as an AI superpower. Nvidia CEO Jensen Huang voiced strong confidence in the UK's tech sector, contrasting with a more pessimistic domestic mood. However, the influx of US capital has also sparked debate, with figures like Sir Nick Clegg suggesting the UK is merely taking "crumbs from the Silicon Valley table." The trend indicates a soft alignment with the US approach to AI regulation and raises questions about whether the UK will become a tech laboratory for American firms or can grow its own champion companies.

          <p>Oscar-winning actor Cillian Murphy has reflected on his long-running role as Tommy Shelby in "Peaky Blinders," calling it a "defining" privilege to have grown with the character. While promoting his new film "Steve," Murphy confirmed a "Peaky Blinders" movie is coming to Netflix but kept plot details confidential to maintain the surprise for fans. He emphasized that he is personally nothing like the "psychopathic gangster" he portrayed for six seasons. Murphy attributed the show's enduring success to its "magic" combination of strong writing and its emergence at a specific cultural moment.</p>

          <p>Nearly 200 participants in the "We Are America" march arrived in Washington, D.C., after a 14-day, 160-mile walk from Philadelphia to advocate for democratic principles. The marchers, a diverse group of all ages, aimed to build a movement to hold leaders accountable amid concerns over recent actions by the Trump administration. Along their route through multiple states, they were hosted by local communities in churches and homes. Upon arrival, they were greeted by supporters and members of Congress, to whom they presented a version of the U.S. Constitution created by children, symbolizing their commitment to defending its values.</p>

          <p>The "Pupusas and Punchlines" comedy show, held at the Salvadoran restaurant Jaragua in Los Angeles, provides a vital platform for Latinx comedians in a competitive scene. Created by producer Justin Alexio, the weekly event allows performers to connect with an audience over shared cultural experiences while enjoying a meal, a combination Alexio says is central to Latin culture. The show has grown from a monthly event to a sold-out weekly fixture, helping to launch the careers of underrepresented comics. Performers say the welcoming, neighborhood atmosphere allows them to tackle topics like immigration and identity that might not resonate in more mainstream comedy clubs.</p>

          <p>Canada's women's rugby team has ended New Zealand's 11-year undefeated streak at the World Cup, securing a historic semi-final victory in Bristol. The six-time champion Black Ferns had not lost a knockout game in the tournament since 1991. Canada dominated the first half, scoring three tries to build a 24-7 lead, and successfully held off a second-half response from the champions. The win is particularly notable as the Canadian team, which is not fully professional, had to crowdfund over half a million dollars just to participate in the tournament, making their journey to the final a "fairytale" achievement.</p>

          <p>President Donald Trump and Chinese leader Xi Jinping have made significant progress toward a deal that would allow TikTok to continue operating in the United States, according to a White House official. Following a phone call, Trump posted on social media that the conversation was "very productive" and that he appreciated the "TikTok approval." However, a readout from Chinese state media did not confirm a final agreement, leaving the deal's status unclear. The potential deal would restructure the popular video app to address U.S. national security concerns over its Chinese parent company, ByteDance, and its access to American user data.</p>

          <p>The UK's Liberal Democrat party has announced a new policy proposal to open police counters in public venues like supermarkets, shopping centers, and libraries across England and Wales. The party argues this move would enhance public confidence in policing and make it easier for citizens to report crimes. The Lib Dems suggest the initiative could be funded by abolishing the elected Police and Crime Commissioner (PCC) roles, a move they claim would save over £100 million. The policy was unveiled at the start of the party's annual conference as it seeks to appeal to voters concerned about community safety and police visibility.</p>

CEO Brian Armstrong confirmed on social media that Durant's account recovery was complete. The issue had become public knowledge after Durant and his agent discussed the predicament at a recent conference, noting that the rising value of Bitcoin had ironically benefited them during the lockout. Durant originally purchased the cryptocurrency in 2016 when its price was a fraction of its current value. The high-profile case has drawn renewed attention to Coinbase's customer service challenges.
