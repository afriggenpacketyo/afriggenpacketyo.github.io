          <p>The article reflects on Saturday Night Live's 50th season, highlighting its continued relevance and creative success. Despite constant speculation about its demise, SNL remains a powerful comedy brand, finishing the season as the top broadcast entertainment program among viewers aged 18 to 49, with an average of 8.2 million viewers per week across all platforms. The article considers the future of Weekend Update and the show's ability to lampoon modern politics, suggesting that SNL should focus on finding new angles rather than trying to nail the political moment every week. The show's massive celebration of its 50th anniversary reminded audiences of its cultural significance in a world where comedy brands are increasingly built on podcasts and social media.</p>

          <p>The article recounts the story of Nike's decision to bet on Michael Jordan 40 years ago, a move that revolutionized the sneaker industry. Howard White, a Nike veteran, recalls the meeting with Jordan and his parents, where Nike offered Jordan $2.5 million to wear their shoes, triple what anyone else in the league was making. The Air Jordan shoe generated $126 million in sales in its first year, far exceeding Nike's expectations. The Jordan Brand, now a standalone division within Nike, generates approximately $7 billion annually, with Jordan still involved in the brand's operation.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>This article explores the ancient Hawaiian tradition of lei making, highlighting its cultural significance and the challenges it faces. Leis are given for nearly every occasion as an expression of aloha and love. However, suburban sprawl and climate change have reduced flower farms, leading to 90% of flowers being imported. Lei makers are adapting by using alternative materials like unripe fruit and wood beads to create "forever leis", but this breaks from tradition. The article also touches on the Annual Lei Day Celebration, where master lei makers compete for the best in show.</p>

The siblings can stay together in individual houses around a central garden, where they're cared for by trained foster parents whose only job will be to look after them.</p>
