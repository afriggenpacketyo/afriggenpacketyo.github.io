        </div>
        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Reform UK leader Nigel Farage stated he has forgiven Zia Yusuf after Yusuf criticized MP Sarah Pochin's call for a burka ban and initially resigned as chairman. Yusuf expressed regret for his social media post, attributing it to exhaustion, and will now lead the party's Doge unit. Farage emphasized that Yusuf had "lost his rag" but quickly regretted his actions, leading to forgiveness. Yusuf, who has donated over ¬£200,000 to Reform UK, will continue working with the party after receiving supportive messages from voters and members, thus solidifying his continued involvement in the party despite recent tensions. The burka ban remains a contentious issue within the party, highlighting internal disagreements on policy matters, and the situation underscores the challenges of maintaining party unity amid diverse viewpoints. The forgiveness granted to Yusuf signals a desire to move past the incident and maintain stability within the party leadership, and the incident underscores the challenges of navigating sensitive cultural issues within a political organization. </p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>In Riverton, Wyoming, residents are building a new community hospital after their previous hospital, under private equity ownership, reduced services and raised prices. Led by Roger Gose, the community formed a nonprofit and secured funding from the USDA to create a hospital offering comprehensive services. This initiative challenges the conventional wisdom that rural hospitals must rely on private equity, which often leads to cost-cutting and reduced access to care. The success of Riverton's project highlights the importance of local decision-making and community investment in healthcare.</p>

This decision caused significant backlash, especially during local elections and by-elections.
