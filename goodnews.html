          <p>The National Health Service (NHS) in England is planning to implement DNA testing for all newborn babies to evaluate their risk of developing hundreds of diseases. This initiative follows an announcement in October regarding a study analyzing the genetic code of up to 100,000 babies. Health Secretary Wes Streeting stated that this gene technology would enable the health service to proactively address illnesses rather than react to them, with the goal of revolutionizing prevention and providing faster diagnoses. The scheme is part of a broader government effort to predict and prevent illness, including a ¬£650 million investment in DNA research for all patients by 2030. </p>

          <p>Chinese electronics brand Xiaomi is planning a comeback in Europe, intending to open 500 new retail stores outside of China this year, with a long-term goal of 10,000 stores overseas in the next five years. This decision follows the closure of all Xiaomi stores in France in 2022 due to a shift in retail strategy, as the company adjusts to French purchasing behavior. Alexandre Martins, a Parisian, recalls when Xiaomi's old stores in Paris weren't as popular due to perceptions of lower quality, but now Xiaomi is aiming to improve its image and presence in developed markets through slick advertising and sports sponsorships. The company stated that the closure of French stores in 2022 was a strategic adjustment to align with the purchasing habits of French consumers.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>The UK Parliament has backed a bill to allow assisted dying in England and Wales, marking a significant social change. This decision follows a recent vote to change abortion legislation, indicating a socially liberal shift in Westminster. While the bill has passed the Commons, it still needs to go through the House of Lords, where it is expected to face scrutiny, and the government anticipates a longer "commencement period" to make necessary preparations. An impact assessment suggests that hundreds of people may seek assisted death in the early years, potentially rising to around 4,000 annually after a decade.</p>

          <p>Several towns and cities in eastern German states are offering free stays to encourage people to relocate to the region and combat depopulation. The "trial living" scheme in Guben, located on Germany's eastern border with Poland, allows individuals to stay for up to four weeks without charge. Anika Franze, who now manages the project, moved to Guben from Berlin due to affordable housing and a quieter lifestyle, and she notes that six participants from last year's scheme have moved to the city permanently. These initiatives aim to address demographic changes, including declining birth rates and emigration of young people, which have led to an aging population in eastern Germany.</p>

          <p>The British and Irish Lions began their 2025 tour with a defeat against Argentina, highlighting issues with cohesion within the newly formed side. Despite creating opportunities through sharp passages, the Lions struggled with execution, including offloads that went to ground and passes that were off the mark. Head coach Andy Farrell expressed his disappointment, stating that the team compounded too many errors, preventing them from establishing the desired pace. The Lions attack displayed ambition in its shape and creation of chances, but the execution was lacking, which will need to be addressed before heading to Australia.</p>

The Times, however, warns of an "uphill battle" for the bill to become law due to opposition in the House of Lords. The Daily Mail suggests the battle is "far from over," and the i Weekend highlights the NHS's role in determining how the process will work, as the toxins must be self-administered under the current proposals.</p>

Critics argue that assault weapons bans do little to curb mass shootings and only punish people with such rifles, while others claim that the U.S. Supreme Court would eventually deem it unconstitutional.</p>

          <p>As rice prices surge to record highs, cost-sensitive consumers are avoiding rice, prompting restaurant chains and food companies in Japan to switch to noodles. Antworks Co., operator of Densetsu no Sutadonya eateries, opened its first ramen noodle restaurant in Tokyo in May and plans to open three more to diversify its operations. A spokesperson noted that rice prices are more than three times higher than several years ago, making ramen noodle dishes a more cost-effective option. Other companies, like Yoshinoya Holdings, are also strengthening their ramen noodle businesses to balance ingredient costs.</p>

          <p>Mahmoud Khalil, a Columbia University activist, was released from ICE detention in Louisiana after a federal judge compelled the Trump administration to let him leave detention as his immigration case proceeds. Khalil described his release as bittersweet, noting that justice was "very long overdue" and he left over one thousand people behind him in a place where they shouldn‚Äôt have been. He said that his 104 days in detention had changed him and his politics, and that the moment you enter this facility, your rights leave you behind. The Trump administration has labeled Khalil a national security threat and invoked rarely used powers of the secretary of state under immigration law to seek his removal.</p>
