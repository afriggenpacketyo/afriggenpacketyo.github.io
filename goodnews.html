          <p>This article recounts the story of Karla Flores, an 18-year-old diagnosed with a chordoma on her brain stem, who was later found to have a second tumor on her spine during an MRI. Dr. Mohammed Labib at the University of Maryland Medical Center devised a novel surgical approach, reaching the spinal tumor through Flores' eye socket, a procedure he called the "third nostril" approach. The surgery involved removing part of her cheekbone and eye socket to access the tumor, which was then successfully removed, followed by reconstructive surgery and radiation treatment. Flores is now cancer-free and hopes to become a manicurist, highlighting the success of the innovative procedure and her resilience.</p>

          <p>This Fox News opinion piece by Doug Schoen, a Harvard alumnus, discusses the ongoing tensions between the Trump administration and Harvard University, particularly regarding antisemitism and free speech issues. Schoen acknowledges the legitimacy of some of Trump's demands for reform at Harvard, particularly regarding its handling of antisemitism and its DEI policies. However, he cautions against blanket bans and across-the-board cuts, arguing for a more targeted approach that can force necessary changes without harming the university's scientific prowess. Schoen concludes that Trump's actions have spurred Harvard to take steps towards change, highlighting the need for universities to adhere to their own codes of conduct.</p>

          <p>Wang Shuguo, president of Fuyao University of Science and Technology, argued that China's doctoral education system overemphasizes the number of published papers, hindering groundbreaking research. He questioned whether DeepSeek, a successful AI startup, would have emerged if its founder had pursued a PhD, suggesting that China's latest technological breakthroughs are driven by companies led by individuals without PhDs. Wang's comments highlight the need for academic reform to encourage innovation and talent development outside traditional university laboratories.

          <p>This article explores the evolution of the Mission: Impossible franchise, contrasting its early, director-driven stand-alone stories with the more recent emphasis on continuity and interconnectedness. The first four films, directed by Brian De Palma, John Woo, J.J. Abrams, and Brad Bird, were marked by their distinct authorial styles and a lack of overarching narrative. However, later installments, including Mission: Impossible‚ÄîThe Final Reckoning, have adopted a stricter canon, linking characters and plot devices from previous films. The author argues that the franchise's initial inconsistency and willingness to prioritize creative sensibilities over commercial brand-building were key to its appeal.</p>

          <p>Consumers are taking a more frugal approach to summer vacations this year due to economic concerns, according to a report by Deloitte. While more people plan to travel compared to last year, travel budgets have been scaled back amid recession fears and trade tensions. Travel costs have declined, with lower hotel room rates, rental car costs, and airfares, but people are spending more due to inflation. As a result, travelers are cutting back on in-destination spending, staying with family and friends, and driving instead of flying to save money.</p>

          <p>This article features an interview with Emelie Vanasse, one of the first women to serve as an Army infantry officer and a graduate of Ranger School, discussing the debate on women in combat. Vanasse recounts her experiences in Ranger School, emphasizing that the standards were never lowered for her and that she performed the same tasks as the men. She challenges the notion that women are less lethal than men, arguing that lethality involves more than just physical fitness. Vanasse expresses frustration with Defense Secretary Pete Hegseth's views on women in combat, highlighting the accomplishments of women who have served before.</p>

          <h2>Wolf Population Growth in California Sparks Rancher Concerns</h2>

          <p>The California Department of Fish and Wildlife has confirmed three new wolf packs in the state's far north, bringing the total to ten, marking a continued resurgence for the protected canids. While conservationists welcome the growth, ranchers are concerned about the increasing number of cattle attacks by wolves. Shasta County has joined other counties in declaring a state of emergency due to wolves, calling for assistance and regulatory changes. The state is taking steps to address ranchers' concerns, including releasing a map showing the approximate location of GPS-collared wolves and exploring the possibility of allowing harsher methods to haze the animals.</p>

          <h2>California Reviews Parole Denials Due to Faulty Drug Tests</h2>
          <div class="timestamp">2025-05-31 06:00:00 EDT</div>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>The California Department of Corrections and Rehabilitation is reviewing hundreds of state parole hearings to determine if any inmates were denied parole due to faulty drug tests. Nearly 6,000 drug tests in California prisons are believed to have yielded false positives between April and July last year. Attorneys for the Board of Parole are conducting a review of inmate files to determine if any of them need to appear before the parole board again to be reconsidered. If inmates were denied parole because of the faulty tests, they could be owed a new hearing before the parole board.</p>
