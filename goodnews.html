          <p>French President Emmanuel Macron's office has downplayed an incident where his wife, Brigitte Macron, appeared to push his face away upon their arrival in Hanoi, Vietnam. Video footage showed Brigitte placing her hands on Emmanuel's face and pushing it, causing a startled reaction from the president. Macron's office initially denied the authenticity of the video before confirming it as genuine and a close associate described the incident as a harmless "squabble." Another member of Macron's entourage suggested it was a moment of levity before the start of a week-long Southeast Asian tour, where Macron aims to position France as an alternative to the United States and China.</p>

          <p>Five years after anti-police protests swept the United States, initiatives aimed at improving the mental health of law enforcement officers are gaining traction. The killing of George Floyd in 2020 served as a catalyst, bringing the issue of officer wellness to the forefront. Departments are creating dedicated wellness units, and states are mandating and funding wellness programs for first responders. Research indicates that police officers face significantly higher rates of depression, burnout, PTSD, and substance abuse compared to the general public, with the average officer experiencing 188 traumatic events during their career.</p>

          <p>The article explores how personal finance decisions, such as pensions, investments, and banking, contribute to fossil fuel projects and examines sustainable alternatives. Analysis suggests switching to a sustainable pension provider can be far more effective than other individual actions in reducing a person's carbon footprint. The world's largest banks have committed trillions to the fossil fuel industry since the Paris Agreement. While green finance options are growing, a lack of standards and regulation remains a challenge, underscoring the need for greater transparency and regulation in the financial sector (not investment advice).</p>

The potential ban stems from the Trump administration's move to revoke Harvard's certification for its Student and Exchange Visitor Program.

          <p>The article discusses the potential for overdiagnosis in modern medicine, where advanced technologies and an eagerness to diagnose can lead to unnecessary medical labels. Dr. Suzanne O‚ÄôSullivan, author of "The Age of Diagnosis," argues that this obsession with diagnosis can create new fears and constraints for patients. She advocates for "slow medicine," where doctors and patients develop relationships, monitor symptoms, and carefully consider a diagnosis before assigning a label.
