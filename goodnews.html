          <p>Hurricane Erin, the first of the 2025 Atlantic season, intensified into a powerful Category 5 storm before slightly weakening to a Category 4. The storm is undergoing an "eyewall replacement cycle," a process that can cause temporary fluctuations in intensity but may lead to re-strengthening. While its outer bands are affecting the northern Leeward Islands with heavy rain, current forecasts predict Erin's center will remain at sea, passing north of Puerto Rico and staying offshore from the U.S. East Coast. Officials have issued tropical storm watches for several islands, warning of potential flash flooding and dangerous surf conditions.</p>

          <div class="timestamp">2025-08-16 22:00:14 EDT</div>
        </div>
        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Chinese researchers have proposed a design for a hypersonic drone carrier featuring a single, centrally mounted wing that can rotate up to 90 degrees. This innovative "scissor wing" concept, once explored by NASA, allows the aircraft to optimize its aerodynamics for different speeds. The wing remains perpendicular for efficient low-speed takeoff and subsonic flight, pivots to 45 degrees to mitigate shock waves at transonic speeds, and aligns parallel to the fuselage at Mach 5, turning the entire vehicle into a high-performance "waverider." This adaptability aims to solve the long-standing challenge of balancing low-speed lift with high-speed drag in aircraft design.</p>

          <h2>Couples Therapist Explains Five Common Psychological Triggers for Infidelity</h2>

        </div>
        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>A couples therapist outlines five common psychological reasons why individuals, even those in committed relationships, risk having an affair. These triggers include a lifelong pressure to always be "good," leading to a mid-life rebellion, and the burden of perfectionism, which can make an affair feel like a release from unrealistic standards. Other factors identified are having poor boundaries developed in childhood, being in an abusive or emotionally neglectful marriage, and experiencing a recent significant loss, which can prompt a re-evaluation of life priorities and make one more susceptible to outside relationships.</p>

          <p>A derelict Napoleonic fort on Thorne Island, off the coast of Pembrokeshire, Wales, has been transformed into a luxury party venue and is now on the market for £3 million. Purchaser Mike Conner bought the abandoned 19th-century fortress in 2017 for £555,000 and spent nearly five years and a significant investment to make it habitable. The once-overgrown listed building, which had no running water or electricity, now features 40 beds and its own nightclub. The challenging renovation required materials to be brought in by helicopter and workers to live on-site in rustic conditions.</p>

        </div>
        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>With food prices rising, parents in the UK are using meticulous planning and creative cooking to manage the increased cost of feeding children during the six-week summer holidays. Some parents recommend stocking up on reduced "yellow-sticker" items for the freezer and batch cooking to make meals last longer. Other strategies include organizing the fridge to use items with the nearest expiration dates first and pre-portioning daily snacks into bags to prevent them from being eaten all at once. These tactics help families stretch their budgets, especially those who rely on subsidized school meals during term time.</p>

          <p>In response to limited space, the historic Hollywood Forever Cemetery has constructed a new five-story vertical mausoleum, adding a modern architectural landmark to Los Angeles. The Gower Mausoleum provides permanent housing for approximately 13,000 people and towers over the final resting places of classic Hollywood stars. Designed with marble, natural light, and views of the city, the structure aims to offer a peaceful environment for visitors. This vertical expansion reflects the cemetery's evolving role as a cultural venue that hosts movie nights and festivals, making it a space for both the living and the deceased.</p>

          <p>A group of GCSE students in the UK have opened time capsule letters they wrote to their future selves as 11-year-olds in March 2021, just as they returned to school after a lengthy COVID-19 lockdown. The letters reveal their younger selves' hopes, fears, and questions about a future shaped by the pandemic, from wondering if face masks would still be needed to asking about girlfriends. The exercise, organized by a teacher to instill motivation during a difficult time, provided a moment of reflection for the students on their personal growth and perseverance through a uniquely disrupted secondary school education.</p>

          <p>A new wave of Chinese restaurant chains is expanding globally, using Singapore as a key launchpad to introduce authentic regional cuisines to a wider audience. Brands like Luckin Coffee and Nong Geng Ji are moving beyond stereotypical dishes like chow mein, instead showcasing the diverse flavors of provinces like Hunan and Zhejiang. This culinary expansion is driven by intense competition in China's domestic market and a growing diaspora demanding genuine Chinese food. These businesses aim to correct outdated perceptions of Chinese cuisine and use food as a form of cultural diplomacy.</p>

          <p>A new collection titled "Sunset Boulevard" documents the music Elvis Presley recorded in Los Angeles between 1972 and 1975, capturing his last significant burst of creativity. The set includes hits like "Burning Love" and soulful ballads such as "Separate Ways," recorded as his marriage was ending. This period also saw Presley miss out on a co-starring role in "A Star Is Born" with Barbra Streisand, a disappointment that some, like his friend Jerry Schilling, believe marked a turning point that preceded his career decline and death in 1977. The recordings showcase his evolution as an expressive ballad singer in his later years.</p>

          <p>Samsung has increased its share of the U.S. smartphone market from 23% to 31% in the second quarter, narrowing the gap with market leader Apple, whose share fell from 56% to 49%. This shift is partly attributed to the growing popularity of Samsung's innovative foldable phones, such as the Z Fold 7, and its strategy of offering a wide range of devices at various price points. While Apple still dominates the U.S. market, the renewed competition signals a potential shift in consumer preferences toward new form factors, with analysts expecting Apple to release its own foldable iPhone by 2026.
