          <p>Sovereignty, the winner of the 151st Kentucky Derby, will not compete in the Preakness Stakes, as announced by trainer Bill Mott, who cited the horse's long-term interests. The decision marks the seventh consecutive year without a Triple Crown winner. Mott indicated that Sovereignty will instead focus on the Belmont Stakes at Saratoga Race Course on June 7, sparking debate about the spacing of the Triple Crown races. Prominent owner Mike Repole proposed moving the Belmont to second in the order to allow more recovery time for the horses. Relevant context includes the demanding schedule of the Triple Crown and concerns about horse welfare.</p>

          <p>Canadian Prime Minister Mark Carney met with President Trump at the White House, emphasizing that Canada would not become the 51st state, while trying to avoid public conflict. Despite Trump's pre-meeting criticisms of Canada on social media, he struck a conciliatory tone during their meeting, praising Carney's electoral victory, though he won on an anti-Trump platform. The leaders discussed trade and security issues, but no major breakthroughs were expected, as the relationship between the two countries has been strained since Trump's re-election. The article contextualizes this meeting with ongoing trade disputes and Trump's previous remarks about annexing Canada.</p>

          <p>MrDeepFakes, a notorious AI-generated pornography site, has shut down after losing a key service provider, resulting in data loss that made continued operation impossible. The site was known for allowing users to upload nonconsensual, digitally altered, explicit sexual content, often targeting celebrities and, despite purported bans, private individuals. The motivations behind these deepfakes included sexual gratification and the degradation of targets. The US House recently voted in support of the TAKE IT DOWN Act, which establishes penalties for publishing intimate visual depictions without consent and requires websites to scrub such content promptly.</p>

          <p>Sir David Attenborough is launching a new cinema-length film, Ocean, which he believes could play a decisive role in saving biodiversity and protecting the planet from climate change. The film documents the decline in life in the world's oceans during Sir David's lifetime, highlighting the damage caused by bottom trawling. However, Sir David remains optimistic due to the ocean's ability to recover quickly, citing the recovery of whale populations as an example. The film urges leaders to take action on promises to protect a third of the world's oceans, which could transform the ecosystem and help trap more carbon dioxide.</p>
