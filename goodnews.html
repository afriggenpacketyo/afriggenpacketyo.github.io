          <p>California lawmakers have introduced legislation to ban law enforcement officers from wearing face coverings during public interactions, requiring them to wear identifying information. The bill, known as the No Secret Police Act, seeks to ensure transparency and accountability. Exemptions would be made for SWAT teams and officers wearing medical masks during natural disasters, with clear riot gear being permitted. The proposal follows protests in Los Angeles related to immigration policies, aiming to protect both law enforcement and the public from potential impersonators.</p>

          <p>U.S. Steel shares experienced a significant increase after President Trump approved its merger with Japan's Nippon Steel, subject to a national security agreement. The agreement includes a golden share for the U.S. government, granting the president "total control" over key decisions, such as relocating the company's headquarters or transferring production outside the U.S. The deal is described as a "partnership" by Trump, but U.S. Steel will become a wholly owned subsidiary of Nippon Steel North America.
