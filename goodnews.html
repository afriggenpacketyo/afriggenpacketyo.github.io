          <p>Villanova University reported that a warning of an active shooter on its Pennsylvania campus was a "cruel hoax," which had triggered a major law enforcement response and a campus lockdown. University President Rev. Peter Donohue expressed relief that no one was harmed but noted the incident had severely shaken the community. Pennsylvania Governor Josh Shapiro condemned the act of "swatting," stating that state and federal authorities, including the FBI, will investigate to find and prosecute those responsible for the fake threat.</p>

Pitcher Clayton Kershaw secured his eighth win of the season, allowing three runs over five and two-thirds innings.

          <p>China is amending its 1998 pricing law to address "involution," a term for destructive, cutthroat competition that has led to severe price wars in industries like solar panel manufacturing. The revision, drafted by top economic planning and market regulation agencies, aims to prevent companies from selling products below cost and stabilize markets plagued by oversupply. Business leaders, such as those in the photovoltaic sector, have expressed support for the new regulations, hoping they will curb unsustainable business practices and foster a more stable economic environment.</p>

          <p>Crystal Palace achieved a historic 1-0 victory over Fredrikstad in the Uefa Conference League play-off, marking the club's first-ever win in a European competition. The celebratory mood was bittersweet, however, as star midfielder Eberechi Eze was absent from the squad ahead of an expected transfer to Arsenal. While fans celebrated the on-pitch milestone, manager Oliver Glasner and chairman Steve Parish acknowledged the need to sign replacements before the transfer window closes, expressing frustration over the timing of Eze's departure.</p>

          <p>The Colorado Rapids MLS team is allowing fans to exchange jerseys of their recently traded star, Djordje Mihailović, for a new one featuring his replacement, Paxten Aaronson, or another player. The unusual move comes after Mihailović, who had become a key player, requested a trade to Toronto FC for personal reasons, surprising the club and its supporters. The jersey swap program is a gesture of goodwill to fans as the team welcomes Aaronson, a promising attacking midfielder acquired in a club-record deal from Eintracht Frankfurt.</p>

          <p>Workday, a provider of finance and HR software, reported quarterly earnings and revenue that surpassed analyst expectations. However, the company's stock dipped in after-hours trading as it provided guidance in line with estimates and warned of emerging pressures. CEO Carl Eschenbach noted challenges in its state and local government business due to funding slowdowns and in higher education, which faces uncertainty related to potential federal policy changes. The company also announced its acquisition of Paradox, a conversational AI recruiting software company. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>Hurricane Erin, a Category 2 storm, has started moving northeastward into the Atlantic, away from the North Carolina coastline. While a direct U.S. landfall is not expected, the storm has already brought tropical storm conditions to the Outer Banks, where storm surge warnings and some evacuation orders remain active. The National Hurricane Center is cautioning that Erin will continue to produce life-threatening surf and dangerous rip currents along most of the U.S. East Coast for several days, urging beachgoers to exercise extreme caution and heed local warnings.</p>

        </div>
        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Wealthy investors are increasingly using a strategy known as a 351 conversion to defer capital gains taxes on highly appreciated assets. This method involves exchanging a diversified portfolio of stocks for shares in a new exchange-traded fund (ETF) before it launches, thereby avoiding an immediate tax bill. While the strategy offers significant tax advantages, it is subject to strict diversification rules and often requires a high minimum investment, typically around $1 million. Financial advisors note that while beneficial, the process can be restrictive as it locks capital into the specific ETF. (not investment advice)</p>

In a recent interview, the veteran actress, who has been working since childhood, contrasted the financial success of the Minecraft film with her recent projects, like the critically acclaimed but more modestly earning "Civil War." Dunst's highest-grossing film remains 2007's "Spider-Man 3," and her comment highlights the financial realities many actors face, even with successful and respected careers in independent and prestige cinema.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Recent market behavior indicates a shift in how investors are viewing potential Federal Reserve interest rate cuts, with implications varying between tech and cyclical stocks. While lower rates traditionally boost high-growth tech valuations, recent trading shows investors rotating into value-oriented, cyclical names like Home Depot, which benefit more directly from lower borrowing costs through near-term earnings improvements. Conversely, momentum stocks tied to secular trends like AI have seen profit-taking, as their growth is less dependent on immediate rate changes, suggesting the market is currently prioritizing tangible earnings revisions over theoretical valuation models.
