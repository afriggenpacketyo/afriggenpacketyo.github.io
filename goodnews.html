This represents a notable change from her previously more assertive language, suggesting a strategic move to navigate an increasingly unstable and complex geopolitical landscape by encouraging strategic independence and responsibility from both powers.</p>

          <p>The Financial Industry Regulatory Authority (FINRA) has approved a proposal to remove the long-standing $25,000 minimum equity rule required for individuals classified as pattern day traders. If approved by the SEC, the change would replace the fixed threshold with a more flexible intraday margin rule, making active trading more accessible to retail investors with smaller accounts. This regulatory overhaul acknowledges the significant technological shifts in market access since the rule was first established during the dot-com bubble in 2001. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>Following a recent 25-basis-point interest rate cut by the Federal Reserve, average 30-year mortgage rates have fallen to a three-year low of 6.13%. For a homeowner with a $250,000 mortgage, this translates to a monthly principal and interest payment of approximately $1,520, a saving of about $150 per month compared to rates seen earlier in the year. This reduction in borrowing costs has spurred a jump in mortgage applications from both new buyers and existing homeowners looking to refinance their loans. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>Some parents are reporting significant speech improvements in their nonverbal children with autism after using leucovorin, a generic drug typically prescribed to alleviate chemotherapy side effects. The treatment is based on the theory that some children have a cerebral folate deficiency, which this drug helps bypass to deliver essential B vitamins to the brain. While several small clinical trials have shown positive effects on speech, researchers stress that more funding and larger studies are needed before it can be considered an FDA-approved treatment for autism.</p>

          <p>Following a meeting with Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy, U.S. President Donald Trump has dramatically shifted his stance on the Russia-Ukraine war. In a social media post, Trump stated that Ukraine is in a position to "WIN all of Ukraine back in its original form," a stark reversal from his previous suggestions that Kyiv would need to cede territory for peace. Zelenskyy praised the meeting as productive and welcomed the change, while the Kremlin dismissed Trump's assessment, retorting that Russia is a "real bear," not a "paper tiger."</p>

Among the hopefuls are former Yankees first baseman Mark Teixeira, former NFL kicker Jay Feely, and former college football coach Derek Dooley, all running as Republicans. While name recognition can be an advantage, a successful sports career does not guarantee victory, as demonstrated by several recent high-profile losses by former athletes in congressional and Senate races.</p>

          <p>For the Jewish New Year, families are redefining holiday feasts by adding modern flair to traditional recipes passed down through generations. Comedian and author Robin Weiss is popularizing new takes on kugel, a classic Jewish casserole, with her "Kugelahs Kugbook," which she uses to honor the memory of her late grandmother, a Holocaust survivor. This trend of culinary evolution is seen alongside a renewed interest in historic Jewish cookbooks, as people seek to connect with their heritage while adapting traditions for contemporary gatherings.</p>

This renewed competition has intensified with China's accelerated space program, which plans to land its own astronauts on the moon by 2030.</p>

          <p>A federal judge has dismissed a class-action lawsuit against The Hershey Company that claimed its Reese's Halloween candies were deceptively packaged. The plaintiffs argued that the wrappers depicted detailed, spooky faces on candies like pumpkins and ghosts, while the actual unwrapped chocolates were largely featureless. The judge ruled that while consumers may have been disappointed, they failed to show concrete economic harm, as the candies were not rendered worthless and still provided the expected taste and function of a chocolate treat.</p>
