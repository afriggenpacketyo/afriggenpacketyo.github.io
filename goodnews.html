          <p>Eric Flores, an Army veteran and former federal prosecutor, has launched his Republican campaign for Texas' 34th Congressional District, a key battleground the GOP aims to flip in 2026. The district, which includes Brownsville and parts of McAllen, has been trending Republican, with President Trump winning it by nearly five points after President Biden had carried it by fifteen. Flores is positioning himself as a fighter aligned with President Trump, aiming to unseat incumbent Democrat Vicente Gonzalez. Gonzalez won his last election by a narrow 2.5-point margin, making the district a prime target for the National Republican Congressional Committee.</p>

          <p>State-owned China National Nuclear Corporation (CNNC) has set a new national record by discovering a significant uranium deposit at an unprecedented depth. This achievement highlights China's advancing capabilities in deep-earth resource exploration technology. The deposit is of a type that is typically larger and more cost-effective to mine, which is crucial for a nation heavily reliant on uranium imports for its nuclear power and weapons programs. Last year, China produced 1,700 tonnes of uranium while importing 13,000 tonnes, underscoring the strategic importance of this domestic discovery for its energy and defense sectors.</p>

          <h2>The Ether Machine Aims to Become a Public Treasury for Ether with a Yield-Generating Focus</h2>

          <p>A new company, The Ether Machine, is set to trade on the Nasdaq with the goal of becoming the largest public vehicle for institutional investment in ether. Backed by major crypto investors like Pantera Capital, it plans to replicate MicroStrategy's bitcoin accumulation strategy but for Ethereum's native currency. The company will differentiate itself by focusing on generating yield through staking, a process that contributes to the network's security, rather than simply holding the asset. This move comes as ether gains prominence, partly due to new regulatory clarity and institutional interest in tokenization on the Ethereum network. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>Workplace strategist Mita Mallick recounts how blunt, critical feedback from a former boss was the catalyst for overcoming her professional shyness. Early in her career, her manager told her she was a "wallflower" and that "no one knows what you do here," which devastated her but also spurred her to action. Although she found the delivery unkind, she recognized it as necessary feedback that she needed to hear to achieve her leadership ambitions. Mallick emphasizes that she spent years practicing public speaking like a sport, ultimately transforming from someone who felt invisible in meetings to a confident keynote speaker.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Experts argue that parents who don't involve their children in household chores may be hindering their development. Engaging in tasks like cleaning and cooking helps children build crucial skills such as motor control, responsibility, confidence, and executive function. The article notes that many parents unwittingly discourage their children's natural desire to help by prioritizing efficiency or micromanaging, causing kids to lose enthusiasm. Researchers suggest that chores serve as 'social glue,' integrating children into the family and giving them a sense of purpose and competence, which is more beneficial than incentives like allowance or chore charts.</p>

It highlights fascinating facts, such as the ocean producing about half of the world's oxygen and being the source of key medicines, including a painkiller derived from sea snails. The comic emphasizes how little of the deep sea is actually known to science, with humans having seen less than 0.001% of the deep ocean floor. Through illustrations, it aims to convey the immense value of marine research and inspire curiosity about the vast, mysterious ecosystems dwelling in the planet's oceans.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>In an inflationary economy, Certificates of Deposit (CDs) offer a secure way for savers to earn returns that can outpace inflation, with the added benefit of FDIC or NCUA insurance. While national average yields for CDs are modest, online banks are providing significantly higher rates, with some one-year terms exceeding 4.30% APY. The article notes an inverted yield curve, where short-term CDs currently offer better rates than long-term ones, a phenomenon present since late 2022. It suggests strategies like laddering CDs to take advantage of the current high short-term rates while managing long-term savings goals. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>This article provides a snapshot of current mortgage and mortgage refinance interest rates for consumers navigating a challenging housing market. As of mid-July 2025, the average 30-year mortgage rate is around 6.75%, while a 15-year loan averages 5.95%. The report suggests that while rates are higher than in previous years, there may be relief if the Federal Reserve pauses its rate hikes. To secure the best possible rate, consumers are advised to strengthen their credit profiles, aim for scores in the mid-to-high 700s, and shop around to compare offers from different lenders for both new purchases and refinancing.

The landscaper, Michael Brown, was charged with breaking and entering and other offenses after first claiming to be the homeowner's grandson. The homeowners' son stated that Brown took advantage of his parents' trust and has definitively lost them as a client, highlighting the risks of granting service providers access to one's home.</p>

          <p>A new study has quantified the immense success of global emergency vaccine stockpiles, concluding they have reduced cases and deaths from outbreaks by 60%. These stockpiles for diseases like cholera, Ebola, and meningitis have averted an estimated 6 million cases and 300,000 deaths over two decades, yielding over $32 billion in economic benefits. The research highlights the critical importance of having vaccines ready for rapid deployment to contain outbreaks before they escalate. The findings come at a crucial time, as a significant drop in global health funding forces organizations like Gavi to make difficult decisions about future priorities.</p>
