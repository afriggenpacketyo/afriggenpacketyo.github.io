          <p>The 2026 U.S. Senate race in North Carolina is taking shape, with Republican National Committee Chairman Michael Whatley and former Democratic Governor Roy Cooper both planning to run. Their expected entries follow Lara Trump's announcement that she will not seek the seat, clearing a path for Whatley, who reportedly has the White House's endorsement. The contest is for the seat being vacated by Republican Senator Thom Tillis and is anticipated to be one of the most competitive and closely watched races of the election cycle.</p>

          <p>Chuck Mangione, the acclaimed jazz flugelhorn player and bandleader, has passed away at the age of 84. He was best known for his instrumental hit "Feels So Good," which became an unlikely pop culture phenomenon, reaching No. 4 on the Billboard Hot 100 in 1978. Throughout his career, Mangione won two Grammy Awards and was celebrated for his smooth, accessible jazz compositions that brought the genre to a wider audience. He also gained later fame with a recurring voice role as a fictionalized version of himself on the animated show "King of the Hill."</p>

          <p>Following a Supreme Court victory that curtailed the Biden administration's clean water regulations, Senator Joni Ernst is introducing new legislation to permanently prevent what she calls federal overreach. The proposed "CLEAR Waters Act" aims to codify a narrower definition of "Waters of the United States" (WOTUS), exempting features like farm ponds and temporary drainage channels from federal oversight. This move seeks to provide certainty for farmers and landowners who have faced regulatory whiplash between administrations, ending the broad "significant nexus" test that expanded the EPA's jurisdiction.

          <p>A federal appeals court has ruled that California's law requiring background checks for all ammunition purchases is unconstitutional. In a 2-1 decision, the Ninth Circuit Court of Appeals affirmed that the law infringes on the Second Amendment right to keep and bear arms. The court determined that the state failed to demonstrate the law aligns with the nation's historical tradition of firearm regulation, a standard set by a 2022 Supreme Court ruling. The law, which took effect in 2019, was the first of its kind in the United States.</p>

          <p>Terry Bollea, known worldwide as wrestling superstar Hulk Hogan, has died at the age of 71. Hogan was a transformative figure in professional wrestling, leading its surge into a global mainstream phenomenon in the 1980s with his "Hulkamania" persona. He later reinvented himself as the villainous "Hollywood Hogan," again changing the industry's landscape. Beyond the ring, he was a major pop culture icon, though his career was also marked by controversies, including a sex tape lawsuit and the release of a recording where he used racist slurs, for which he later apologized.</p>

          <p>The demand for workers with artificial intelligence skills is rapidly increasing, with AI-related job postings growing at an average annual rate of nearly 29% over the last 15 years. A recent Brookings Institution report shows that as more companies integrate AI into their operations, they are creating new roles ranging from specialized AI engineers to AI-proficient software developers. These jobs are often associated with higher salaries, paying an average of 28% more than similar roles without an AI skill requirement. While still a small fraction of the overall labor market, the growth is expanding beyond traditional tech hubs.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>When deciding where to place a significant sum like $25,000, savers face a choice between the guaranteed return of a certificate of deposit (CD) and the flexibility of a high-yield savings account. Based on current rates, a 6-month CD could earn slightly more interest than a savings account over the same period. The primary advantage of the CD is its fixed rate, which locks in the return and protects against potential interest rate cuts. The best choice depends on an individual's need for liquidity versus their desire for a guaranteed yield. (not investment advice)</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>According to endocrinologists, a critical habit for individuals with high A1C levels to break is the frequent consumption of fast food. Experts explain that fast food is often ultra-processed, high in simple carbohydrates and saturated fats, and low in fiber, all of which can worsen insulin resistance and cause blood sugar spikes. This makes it significantly harder to manage blood glucose and lower A1C, a key marker for prediabetes and type 2 diabetes. Instead, doctors recommend a diet focused on non-starchy vegetables, lean proteins, and healthy fats.</p>

          <p>The power of the U.S. passport has continued to decline, dropping to 10th place in the annual Henley Passport Index, which ranks passports based on visa-free access to other countries. This marks a significant fall from its top-ranked position in 2014. The report suggests the U.S. is falling behind due to a lack of proactive diplomatic efforts to secure new visa-waiver agreements, while other nations have been more engaged.
