          <p>Mitch Brown, a former West Coast Eagles player, has made history by becoming the first openly gay or bisexual man in the Australian Football League's 129-year history. Brown revealed that hiding his sexuality significantly influenced his decision to retire and hopes his public announcement will foster a safer environment for others. He described a "hyper-masculinity" within the AFL, recalling homophobic comments and a culture where expressing such feelings was not safe. This announcement follows recent high-profile homophobic incidents in the league, prompting calls for more positive male role models and greater empathy for all players.</p>

          <p>European markets are anticipating a higher open on Wednesday, as traders eagerly await the quarterly earnings report from chipmaker Nvidia, a crucial bellwether for the global technology and artificial intelligence sectors. Nvidia, with its substantial weighting in the S&P 500, significantly influences U.S. market performance. France's CAC 40 index is projected to rebound after a recent 1.6% decline, which was partly attributed to concerns over political instability and the 2026 budget. Despite recent dips, the pan-European Stoxx 600 has experienced a relatively strong month, while U.S. futures also showed slight gains, with investors largely overlooking recent political developments.

          <p>China has successfully tested a new passive residual heat removal system designed to enhance the meltdown-proof capabilities of its next-generation, radioactive waste-recycling fast nuclear reactors. This breakthrough, announced by the China Institute of Atomic Energy, is a significant step in developing fourth-generation nuclear plants with a closed-loop fuel cycle. Unlike conventional reactors, fast reactors use high-energy neutrons, making them more fuel-efficient and capable of breeding new fissile material from spent fuel. The integral fast reactors use liquid metal coolants and reprocess spent fuel within the same facility, aiming for improved safety and sustainability in nuclear energy.</p>

          <h2>China's Industrial Profit Declines Ease in July Amid Government Efforts to Curb Price Wars</h2>
          <div class="timestamp">2025-08-27 01:43:36 EDT</div>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>China's industrial profits saw a narrowed decline of 1.5% year-on-year in July, a significant recovery from previous months, signaling the positive impact of Beijing's campaign against intense price wars. Profits in the mining industry continued to fall, but manufacturing and utilities sectors showed improvement. A statistician from the National Bureau of Statistics attributed this to policies aimed at stabilizing consumer price levels and improving corporate profitability. Economists note the early effects of "anti-involution" efforts, a term for combating excessive competition. However, factory-gate deflation persists, and analysts believe a sharp rebound in producer prices is unlikely despite government stimulus. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>Britain's Jacob Fearnley, 24, achieved his first US Open main-draw victory, overcoming nerves and a heckler to defeat Spanish veteran Roberto Bautista Agut in a four-set battle. Despite struggling with his serve and committing 16 double faults in the early sets, Fearnley demonstrated resilience to close out the longest match of his career. His rapid ascent in rankings over the past 15 months has seen him crack the top 50, despite his relative inexperience at the Grand Slam level. Fearnley will now face German third seed Alexander Zverev in the second round, a rematch from earlier this year.</p>

The 123-meter vehicle demonstrated satellite deployment for the first time, ejecting eight dummy Starlink units, and successfully tested upgraded heat shield tiles during reentry. While significant progress was made, challenges remain in developing a rapidly reusable heat shield and mastering orbital refueling with super-cooled propellant, both essential for deep-space missions. This achievement brings Starship closer to proving its capabilities for complex maneuvers and durability required for future space endeavors.</p>

          <p>US Ryder Cup captain Keegan Bradley faces a "ridiculous" and "controversial" decision as he prepares to announce his six wildcard picks for the team facing Europe. Bradley, who is still an active player and finished 11th in qualifying, is considering selecting himself, a move unprecedented in 62 years. His deep passion for the American cause is evident, but the potential for a playing captain raises questions about the team's best chance for victory. With the announcement scheduled for Wednesday, Bradley has hinted that some players expecting a spot might be disappointed, as he prioritizes the team's betterment.</p>

This performance marked his fifth consecutive win and capped a strong August with a 1.88 ERA.

Items selected by competition-winning children, with Princess Diana's help, included a Kylie Minogue CD, a solar-powered calculator, a pocket TV, and a passport. Despite some damage, the objects are largely intact, providing a unique historical snapshot. This echoes an earlier time capsule burial by Princess Alexandra in 1872, which remains undiscovered.</p>

          <p>A report from SAP Concur indicates a decline in leisure travel to the United States this year, while business travel remains stable and even saw a slight increase. The U.S. was the top global destination for business travelers in the first half of 2025, accounting for 15% of all business air travel bookings, significantly more than Germany or the UK. Business travel between Canada and the U.S. also held steady.

          <p>As the 2026 midterm elections approach, key Senate contests are taking shape, with Democrats aiming to flip four seats to gain a majority against 53 Republican incumbents. The electoral map presents challenges for Democrats, as many Republican senators are from states won by President Trump in 2024. However, the retirement of three Democratic senators creates potential openings for the GOP. Competitive races are highlighted in North Carolina, where former Governor Roy Cooper faces Republican National Committee Chairman Michael Whatley, and Georgia, where Senator Jon Ossoff is seen as vulnerable. Other states like New Hampshire, Michigan, Maine, Texas, Ohio, Minnesota, Iowa, and Nebraska also feature significant battles.</p>

The enterprise, led by David Ahl, directed "boosters" to steal high-value items like electrical components, which Ahl then resold through his electronics storefront. The investigation, involving multiple law enforcement agencies, has seized $3.7 million in stolen property and over $800,000 in illicit money. This case highlights the effectiveness of a new law allowing consolidation of multi-county retail crime charges, making prosecution more efficient.</p>
