          <p>Washington, D.C., is preparing for a large military parade honoring the 250th birthday of the U.S. Army and President Donald Trump's 79th birthday. Security measures include 18 miles of anti-scale fencing, 175 magnetometers, and multiple drones to monitor the event. Officials anticipate a large turnout, with potential for counter-protests, including a mass march to the White House. The parade has been designated a National Special Security Event, involving coordination among D.C. officials, the FBI, Capitol Police, and the National Guard, with the Secret Service in the lead.</p>

          <p>New government guidance in England permits teachers to use artificial intelligence (AI) to automate routine tasks like marking and writing letters to parents, aiming to free up time for face-to-face teaching. The Department for Education emphasizes transparency and checking AI results, limiting its use to low-stakes assignments. While AI offers opportunities for efficiency, concerns remain about data breaches and marking errors, with teachers advised to avoid fully outsourcing tasks. The guidance represents a significant step in integrating AI into education, balancing its potential benefits with necessary safeguards.</p>
