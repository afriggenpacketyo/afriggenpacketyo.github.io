          <p>Chinese President Xi Jinping officially commenced the Shanghai Cooperation Organization (SCO) summit, hosting leaders such as Russian President Vladimir Putin and Indian Prime Minister Narendra Modi. Established in 2001 as a Eurasian security alliance, the SCO has evolved to include ten member states, now encompassing Belarus, India, Iran, and Pakistan. Its mandate has broadened beyond security to incorporate trade and economic cooperation, positioning itself as a significant Asian counterbalance to Western influence. During the summit, leaders anticipate signing a joint declaration aimed at bolstering security, economic, and cultural ties among the diverse member nations. This gathering underscores the bloc's increasing role in shaping regional dynamics and fostering multilateral engagement, reflecting a strategic effort to enhance stability and collective development across Eurasia.</p>

          <p>Novak Djokovic experienced an early neck injury scare during his US Open fourth-round match against qualifier Jan-Lennard Struff, but swiftly recovered to secure a commanding 6-3, 6-3, 6-2 victory. This triumph allowed the 38-year-old Serbian to make history as the oldest man to reach the quarter-finals at all four Grand Slams in a single season. The 24-time Grand Slam champion's win further extends his all-time record for Grand Slam quarter-final appearances to 64, maintaining his quest for a monumental 25th major title. Despite the brief physical concern, Djokovic's dominant performance against the unseeded Struff sets the stage for a highly anticipated quarter-final encounter with the No. 4 seed, Taylor Fritz.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>China's manufacturing sector unexpectedly returned to growth in August, marking its fastest expansion in five months, according to a private survey. The RatingDog purchasing managers' index (PMI) registered 50.5, significantly surpassing economists' Reuters-polled estimate of 49.7. This rebound from July's 49.5 indicates renewed vigor in factory activity, driven by an increase in new orders and a recovery in export business, partly attributed to a trade-war truce with the U.S. Conversely, China's official manufacturing PMI, released by the statistics bureau, showed a contraction for the fifth consecutive month, albeit edging up slightly to 49.4 in August from 49.3 in July, highlighting a divergence in economic indicators.

          <p>Asia-Pacific markets exhibited a mixed performance on Monday as investors analyzed China's August manufacturing data. The private RatingDog Purchasing Managers' Index (PMI) indicated an expansion at 50.5, a notable improvement from the previous month's contraction of 49.5. This contrasted with the country's official manufacturing PMI, which remained in contraction at 49.4. Additionally, investors considered developments in India-China relations, following an agreement between leaders at the Shanghai Cooperation Organization summit to view each other as development partners. While Hong Kong's Hang Seng index rose, Japan's Nikkei 225 declined, and Australia's S&P/ASX 200 retreated, reflecting diverse regional reactions to economic and geopolitical factors.

          <p>A federal judge on Sunday issued an order blocking the Trump administration from deporting any unaccompanied migrant children to Guatemala without a prior deportation order. This ruling came just hours after lawyers alerted the court to a rapid government effort to deport hundreds of children, with planes already prepared for departure from Texas. U.S. District Court Judge Sparkle Sooknanan initially issued a temporary restraining order for ten children, then broadened it to all unaccompanied Guatemalan minors in U.S. custody without a deportation order. The Justice Department confirmed that 76 children were slated for deportation that day, with one plane reportedly having taken off and returned, highlighting the urgency and legal complexities of the situation.</p>

          <p>Alibaba Group Holdings' Hong Kong shares surged by nearly 19% after the company reported better-than-expected net income for its June quarter, driven by accelerated sales in its cloud-computing unit and a resurgence in its e-commerce business. Despite missing revenue estimates, Alibaba's net income increased by 78% year-on-year, partly due to gains from equity investments and the disposal of Trendyol. The cloud computing division was a significant highlight, with revenue growing 26% year-on-year, fueled by robust AI demand. This growth, coupled with the company's aggressive investments in AI models and services, positions Alibaba as a major player in the global AI landscape, reassuring investors about its strategic direction.

          <p>A growing number of young Chinese entrepreneurs are redirecting their ambitions towards Southeast Asia, seeking new economic opportunities rather than the more traditional paths to the United States or Europe. This article highlights the trend through the example of Kent Cai, an entrepreneur from Zhejiang province, who relocated to Malaysia to pursue a PhD. Cai believes that Southeast Asia presents significantly better chances for accessing venture capital and that his status as a PhD student there makes it easier to capture investors' attention. This emerging pattern signifies a strategic reorientation among some young Chinese professionals, drawn by the prospect of more accessible funding and potentially less competitive markets in the rapidly developing regional economies.</p>

          <p>Two high school seniors from St. Mary's Academy in New Orleans, Calcea Johnson and Ne'Kiya Jackson, have made a remarkable mathematical breakthrough by independently developing new trigonometric proofs for the Pythagorean Theorem. This achievement is particularly significant because, for 2,000 years, a trigonometric proof for the theorem was widely considered impossible, with only one other documented instance by Jason Zimba in 2009. Their work, initially a bonus question for a school contest, was presented at an American Mathematical Society conference and has since gained global recognition. Despite their modesty, their ingenuity highlights the school's philosophy of boundless possibilities and challenges stereotypes about young African American women in STEM.</p>
