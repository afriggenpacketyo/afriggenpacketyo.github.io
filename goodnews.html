          <p>Design software vendor Figma saw its shares climb another 6% on Friday, extending a colossal debut where the stock more than tripled, achieving a 250% gain on its first day of trading. This successful public offering marks a significant moment for the tech sector after an extended IPO drought, following other recent debuts like CoreWeave and Hinge Health. Figma, founded in 2012, almost had a very different story when a $20 billion acquisition by Adobe fell through in 2023 due to concerns from UK regulators about competition. The company's strong market performance underscores significant investor confidence in its innovative design software.</p>

          <p>Chevron reported second-quarter earnings that surpassed Wall Street estimates, despite a significant 44% decline in net income compared to the previous year due to lower crude prices. The oil major booked a record second-quarter output, which helped mitigate the impact of falling oil prices. Chevron completed its $53 billion acquisition of Hess Corporation in July, overcoming a dispute with Exxon Mobil, and expects this deal to begin boosting earnings by the fourth quarter while also aiming for $1 billion in annual cost reductions. The company continues to return substantial capital to shareholders through buybacks and dividends.</p>

          <p>Chinese scientists have successfully doubled the service life of high-temperature, high-pressure artillery gun barrels by refining a sophisticated chromium plating technique that remarkably dates back over 2,000 years. This upgraded method, inspired by the exceptional anti-corrosion properties found on ancient Terracotta Army bronze swords, offers a cutting-edge solution to modern artillery's persistent challenge of barrel erosion. The new approach effectively combats wear, microcracking, and degradation caused by the extreme conditions inside the barrel during firing, including temperatures exceeding 3,000 degrees Celsius. This technological advancement demonstrates a remarkable fusion of ancient wisdom and contemporary engineering for enhanced military applications.</p>

          <p>Exxon Mobil reported second-quarter earnings that surpassed Wall Street estimates, despite a significant 23% decline in net income compared to the previous year, primarily due to lower global oil prices. The oil major achieved its highest production output for a second quarter in over 25 years, driven by record production in the Permian Basin and Guyana, which helped soften the impact of reduced prices. Exxon's refining business also saw a substantial increase in earnings. The company continues to return significant capital to shareholders through dividends and share repurchases, remaining on track to buy back $20 billion in shares this year.</p>

          <p>Hasan Piker, a prominent progressive political commentator online, discussed his appeal to young men, being dubbed a "himbo gateway drug to leftist thought," and the dynamics of "bro culture." Piker challenged the notion that masculinity or certain hobbies are inherently conservative, arguing that right-wing actors often brand apolitical spaces as such. He asserted that the Democratic Party's problems stem from a lack of effective policy, not the absence of a "Joe Rogan of the left," citing New York mayoral candidate Zohran Mamdani's success through clear policy platforms. Piker also observed a growing ideological investment in far-right and fascist ideas among young conservatives.</p>

          <p>Amazon's stock fell 7% despite beating most second-quarter earnings metrics, primarily due to weaker-than-expected profit guidance and concerns over cloud growth. The company revealed significant capital expenditures, potentially reaching $118 billion this year, largely driven by investments in AI infrastructure, a trend also seen with competitors like Meta and Google. While Amazon Web Services (AWS) remains the cloud market leader, its 18% growth trailed rivals, prompting CEO Andy Jassy to defend AWS's position and security. The article notes that tariffs haven't yet dented consumer demand, with online store sales exceeding projections, suggesting Amazon has effectively navigated trade policy challenges so far.</p>

Dalio, who founded Bridgewater in 1975 and previously stepped down as CEO and chairman, will continue to be a significant investor in the firm's strategies and a mentor. The final divestment was facilitated by raising capital from existing investors and employees. Bridgewater's Pure Alpha fund saw a 17% gain and its All Weather fund an 8% rise in the first half of 2025, demonstrating strong performance under its new leadership. (not investment advice)</p>
