          <p>Oil prices fell sharply after Iran launched a missile strike on a U.S. airbase in Qatar, with no reported casualties, raising hopes of de-escalation in the Middle East. U.S. crude oil closed at $68.51 per barrel, a 7.22% decrease, while global benchmark Brent shed 7.18% to settle at $71.48. President Trump thanked Iran for giving early notice about the strike, which allowed for no lives to be lost, and called on the Islamic Republic to move toward peace. The market sell-off suggests investors believe the conflict will de-escalate, with some analysts suggesting Trump has successfully escalated to de-escalate.</p>

          <p>A group of Democratic senators and Hamilton producer Jeffrey Seller are hosting a Pride celebration at the Kennedy Center, though the Kennedy Center itself is not involved in programming the event. Senators John Hickenlooper, Elizabeth Warren, Jacky Rosen, Brian Schatz, and Tammy Baldwin have rented space for the event, called Love Is Love, which will include songs celebrating gay culture. Seller, who canceled a Hamilton production at the Kennedy Center in 2026 after President Trump took over the center, said the event is "our way of reoccupying the Kennedy Center." The White House has proposed a major increase to the Kennedy Center's federal funding.</p>

New Tottenham manager Thomas Frank was also interested in Mbeumo, along with other Champions League clubs. Brentford is expected to want at least the same fee as Wolves received for Matheus Cunha before agreeing to sell Mbeumo.</p>

          <p>Major U.S. health insurers, including CVS Health, UnitedHealthcare, and Cigna, have voluntarily agreed to speed up and reduce prior authorizations, a process often criticized for causing care delays and physician burnout. The changes aim to connect patients to care more quickly and reduce the administrative burden on providers, with insurers committing to a series of actions to implement the changes across markets. By the start of 2027, a common standard for submitting electronic prior authorization requests will be established, with at least 80% of electronic approvals answered in real time. Individual plans will also reduce the types of claims subject to prior authorization requests by 2026.</p>
