          <div class="timestamp">2025-07-22 21:10:54 EDT</div>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>The United States has announced a significant trade deal with Japan, establishing a 15% tariff on Japanese exports. President Trump described the agreement as "massive," claiming it includes a $550 billion investment from Japan into the U.S. and will open Japanese markets to American goods like cars, trucks, and agricultural products. Japanese officials signaled their satisfaction with the outcome, which reportedly lowers the U.S. tariff on Japanese automobiles from 25% to 15%. The deal is seen as a potential political victory for Japanese Prime Minister Shigeru Ishiba, whose coalition recently faced electoral setbacks. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>Shares of major Japanese automakers, including Toyota, Honda, and Nissan, experienced a significant surge following reports of a new U.S.-Japan trade deal. The rally was fueled by news that the U.S. will lower its tariffs on imported Japanese vehicles from 25% to 15%. This development is crucial for Japan's economy, as automotive exports to the United States constitute a substantial portion of its total shipments. The market's positive reaction underscores the relief felt by investors after a period of uncertainty over potential trade restrictions. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>England's Lionesses have secured a place in their third consecutive major tournament final by reaching the Euro 2025 championship match after a series of dramatic victories. Their journey was marked by significant challenges, including pre-tournament retirements, an opening-game loss, and a comeback from a 2-0 deficit in the quarter-finals. The team's resilience was on full display in a chaotic semi-final, where they scored a late equalizer and an extra-time winner to defeat Italy. Manager Sarina Wiegman praised the team's incredible spirit and ability to overcome adversity throughout the tournament.</p>

          <p>The Trump administration has announced new trade agreements with the Philippines and Indonesia, establishing a 19% tariff rate on goods imported into the U.S. from both nations. Following a meeting with Philippine President Ferdinand Marcos Jr., President Trump stated that the Philippines would become an "OPEN MARKET" with zero tariffs on U.S. goods. A similar deal with Indonesia will see it eliminate tariffs on 99% of its trade with the U.S. in exchange for the 19% tariff on its exports. The agreements come ahead of an August 1 deadline set by the administration for countries to finalize trade deals or face higher tariff rates. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>A shipwreck discovered on the Scottish island of Sanday has been identified as the Earl of Chatham, a vessel with a rich history dating back nearly 250 years. Researchers used a combination of dendrochronology and archival records to determine the ship was originally HMS Hind, a Royal Navy frigate that served in the American War of Independence. After its military service, the ship was sold and repurposed as a whaling vessel, hunting in the Arctic before it was wrecked in a storm off Sanday in 1788. The discovery was driven by a community-led effort, with local residents helping to recover and research the historic timbers.</p>
