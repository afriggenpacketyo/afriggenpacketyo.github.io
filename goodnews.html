          <p>Yosemite National Park's Tioga Road will reopen on Memorial Day, providing access to the park's eastern entrance. The road has been closed since November due to ice and snow, and preparing it for reopening involves significant effort. Visitors planning to enter Yosemite during peak hours will need a reservation, and limited services are expected along Tioga Road. The park may also face staffing shortages due to cuts at the National Park Service, urging visitors to be patient and courteous to staff.</p>

        </div>
        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>A recent study indicates that dog owners who dwell on work-related stress may inadvertently pass their anxiety onto their dogs. The research found a correlation between owners exhibiting "work-related rumination" and their dogs displaying more stress-related behaviors, such as whining and pacing. This "crossover" effect suggests that dogs are sensitive to their owners' moods and changes in care routines. The study emphasizes the importance of employed dog owners separating work from home life to protect their pets' well-being.</p>

          <p>Juan Soto's two-run double in the fourth inning proved decisive as the New York Mets defeated the Los Angeles Dodgers 5-2.

David Peterson, the Mets' starter, delivered a strong performance, pitching 7 ‚Öî innings and recording seven strikeouts.</p>
