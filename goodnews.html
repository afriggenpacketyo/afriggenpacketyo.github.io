          <p>President Trump and Chinese President Xi Jinping spoke by phone, focusing exclusively on trade, and Trump stated that Xi invited him to visit China. Trump described the call as resulting in a very positive conclusion for both countries, with U.S. and Chinese negotiating teams expected to meet shortly at a location to be determined. This conversation marks a significant development amidst the ongoing tariff standoff between the U.S. and China. Prior to the call, Trump had acknowledged the difficulty of making a deal with Xi, while Chinese leaders expressed concerns about U.S. restrictions on tech exports and student visas. The discussion suggests a potential resumption of trade talks aimed at resolving the trade war. Optimism around the call could signal a move toward de-escalation of trade tensions. </p>

          <p>Circle Internet Group's stock experienced a substantial surge, climbing as high as 235% after its IPO on the New York Stock Exchange, with shares opening at $69.50 following an IPO price of $31. The company, which issues the USDC stablecoin, raised nearly $1.1 billion in the offering, marking its second attempt at going public after a previous merger collapsed due to regulatory challenges. CEO Jeremy Allaire emphasized the importance of regulatory compliance and collaboration with governments for mainstream adoption of crypto. The stablecoin sector is gaining political favor and analysts predict it could grow tenfold in the next five years, potentially creating a trillion-dollar market. This performance reflects the crypto industry's renewed strength and investor confidence in Circle's position within the stablecoin market. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>Zia Yusuf has resigned as chairman of Reform UK, stating that he no longer believes working to get a Reform government elected is a good use of his time. This follows Yusuf's criticism of Reform MP Sarah Pochin for calling on Sir Keir Starmer to ban the burka. Yusuf, a former Conservative Party member, became Reform UK's chairman shortly after last year's general election. He described himself as a "proud British Muslim patriot" and had donated ¬£200,000 to the party during the election campaign. His departure marks a significant shift within the party's leadership.</p>

          <p>Despite lacking European football next season, Manchester United is pursuing transfers, including a ¬£62.5m deal for Matheus Cunha and a ¬£45m bid for Bryan Mbeumo. This activity contrasts with concerns about the club's finances, raised by part-owner Sir Jim Ratcliffe. The club's failure to qualify for the Champions League has denied them significant revenue. Football finance expert Kieran Maguire estimates the club can still afford ¬£150m in new signings without breaching profit and sustainability rules. This suggests a strategic approach to balancing squad improvements with financial prudence. (not investment advice)</p>

          <h2>Federal Court Proposes Solution to Trump's Power Grab</h2>

          <p>A federal appeals court is proposing an innovative solution to President Trump's neutralization of federal agencies that protect civil servants from being fired for political reasons. The Merit Systems Protection Board (MSPB), which hears civil servants‚Äô claims, lacks the quorum needed to operate due to Trump's actions. The court suggests that if the MSPB cannot fulfill its role, federal courts should step in and hear cases brought by illegally fired civil servants. The decision aims to close a legal loophole that has left federal civil servants unprotected. The decision is an attempt to protect civil service jobs.</p>
