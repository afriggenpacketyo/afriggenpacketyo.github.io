          <p>Verizon has announced the appointment of Dan Schulman, the former CEO of PayPal, as its new chief executive, succeeding Hans Vestberg.

The leadership change comes as Verizon aims to enhance its customer focus and financial growth, particularly following its acquisition of Frontier Communications. Vestberg will remain on the board and serve as a special advisor to ensure a smooth transition during this critical period for the telecommunications company.</p>

          <p>During the Sanderson Farms Championship, PGA Tour golfer Vince Whaley encountered a tense moment when he had to play a shot from a watery area under the watchful eye of a six-foot alligator. The reptile remained stationary about 20 feet away as Whaley, trusting his caddie to monitor the animal, successfully executed the shot and saved par on the hole. The incident provided a moment of unexpected drama at the tournament in Jackson, Mississippi. Whaley later joked that his plan, had the alligator moved closer, was simply to get out of the water as quickly as possible.</p>

          <p>Costco will now offer the popular weight-loss drugs Ozempic and Wegovy at its pharmacies across the United States, in collaboration with manufacturer Novo Nordisk. A one-month supply will be priced at $499, which is significantly lower than the typical retail prices that can exceed $1,300. The move aims to make these semaglutide-based medications, which suppress appetite and are prescribed for Type 2 diabetes and weight management, more accessible and affordable. Customers will still need a valid prescription to purchase the drugs at the discounted warehouse club.</p>

          <p>One year into CEO Elliott Hill's turnaround strategy, Nike has implemented significant price increases across its product lines, with footwear prices rising 17% and apparel 14% since last year. This strategy is part of an effort to restore the brand's premium positioning and combat margin pressures from factors like rising tariffs on goods made in Asia. The company is leaning on its pricing power in core categories while managing a complex supply chain and navigating a challenging retail environment. Analysts note the targeted price hikes aim to balance profitability with consumer demand.</p>

          <h2>Argentina Adjusts Sorghum Export Rules to Solidify Trade with China</h2>

          <p>Argentina has implemented stricter quality standards for its sorghum exports in a strategic move to strengthen its trade relationship with China, its primary buyer for the grain. The new regulations set minimum weights and limit impurities, aligning Argentine standards with Chinese import requirements to prevent cargo rejections. This decision could create new friction with the United States, which was the main sorghum supplier to China before tariffs disrupted global trade flows. The measure underscores Argentina's focus on securing its position in key international agricultural markets.</p>

          <div class="timestamp">2025-10-06 11:08:04 EDT</div>
        </div>
        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Despite a widespread corporate push for returning to the office, work-from-home rates have remained stable as employees engage in passive resistance against strict mandates. Stanford research shows a growing gap between company policies and employee compliance, with workers adopting practices like "coffee badging"—showing up just long enough to be seen—and "micro-shifting" their work hours. Middle managers are often reluctant to enforce unpopular rules, and many workers prioritize flexibility, sometimes quitting for more accommodating roles. This trend illustrates a persistent shift in work culture and employee expectations.</p>

          <p>Home lending experts forecast that mortgage interest rates are likely to remain relatively stable throughout October, despite an expected rate cut from the Federal Reserve later in the month. Mortgage rates often move in anticipation of Fed actions, and the market may have already priced in the next cut. The current government shutdown is delaying the release of key economic data, such as jobs reports, creating a cloudy outlook. While rates are below the highs seen earlier in the year, prospective homebuyers should not expect significant drops in the immediate future (not investment advice).</p>

          <p>Space company Firefly Aerospace announced it is acquiring SciTec, a defense technology contractor, for $855 million in a cash-and-stock deal. The acquisition is a strategic move by Firefly to bolster its national security capabilities by integrating SciTec's software for missile warning, tracking, and defense systems. This deal follows a recent rocket explosion during a ground test that caused Firefly's stock to dip, but the company continues to build its portfolio of government and defense contracts. SciTec will operate as a subsidiary of Firefly once the transaction closes.</p>

        </div>
        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Financial experts advise that recent tax legislation signed by President Trump will impact charitable giving strategies, particularly for 2025 and beyond. Starting in 2026, a new tax break will be available for non-itemizers, making it potentially advantageous for some to delay smaller year-end donations until January. Conversely, higher earners may face a reduced benefit from their charitable deductions in 2026 due to a new deduction floor and a cap for the top tax bracket. This could incentivize accelerating large donations into 2025 using tools like donor-advised funds (not investment advice).</p>

The peak shopping period is expected to be Cyber Week, from Thanksgiving to Cyber Monday, which will drive a significant portion of total sales.
