          <p>A high school football player who suffered from debilitating headaches and dizziness for months following a concussion was diagnosed with a rare brain condition. After the injury, Logan Coleridge's symptoms persisted despite therapy, prompting a specialist to order an MRI that revealed an arteriovenous malformation (AVM), a dangerous tangle of blood vessels. He underwent successful surgery to remove the AVM, which was likely the true cause of his long-standing symptoms. Now recovered, his family is advocating for earlier and more thorough diagnostic testing for persistent post-concussion issues.</p>

The technology uses a network of wireless sensors and weather algorithms to control building systems more precisely, preventing common issues like overheating and reducing unnecessary carbon emissions. The company has installed its platform in over 10,000 buildings, attracting major real estate clients and recently securing $55 million in Series B funding.

          <p>A growing number of concertgoers, particularly younger generations, are using "buy now, pay later" (BNPL) services to afford increasingly expensive event tickets. A LendingTree survey found that 37% of Gen Z and 35% of millennials have used these loans for concerts, a trend fueled by "funflation." While BNPL offers interest-free installment options, financial analysts caution that these plans may lack the consumer protections of credit cards and can carry hefty late fees. Instead of relying on debt, experts recommend proactively budgeting and creating dedicated savings funds for entertainment expenses. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>Sandra Grimes, a veteran CIA analyst who played a pivotal role in identifying one of the most damaging spies in U.S. history, has passed away at 79. In the early 1990s, Grimes postponed her retirement to help investigate why numerous CIA assets in the Soviet Union were being compromised and executed. Her meticulous investigation led directly to Aldrich Ames, a fellow CIA officer who had sold secrets for millions of dollars. Grimes's work was instrumental in his 1994 arrest, ending a devastating chapter of espionage that severely harmed U.S. national security.</p>

          <p>San Francisco startup Marathon Fusion has proposed a modern form of alchemy: transmuting other elements into gold using the byproducts of nuclear fusion. The concept, which is currently theoretical, suggests that neutrons from a fusion reactor could change mercury atoms into gold, creating a valuable revenue stream to subsidize the high cost of developing clean fusion energy. While scientists have created minuscule amounts of gold in labs before at prohibitive costs, Marathon's idea is gaining some interest from physicists. The primary obstacle remains the lack of commercially viable fusion reactors, a technology still believed to be years away.</p>

          <p>Activist investment firm Carronade Capital is urging satellite communications company Viasat to spin off its Defense and Advanced Technologies (DAT) division. Carronade argues that Viasat's stock is undervalued because the market incorrectly views it as a legacy satellite company threatened by competitors like Starlink. The firm believes the high-growth, high-margin DAT business is a "hidden gem" whose true value is obscured by the company's declining consumer broadband segment. Separating the businesses, Carronade contends, could unlock significant shareholder value by allowing the market to properly assess each unit independently. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>The leaders of Armenia and Azerbaijan signed a historic peace agreement at the White House, officially ending decades of conflict over the Nagorno-Karabakh region. Brokered by the United States under the Trump administration, the deal establishes normalized relations and reopens key transportation routes. A significant part of the agreement is the creation of a transit corridor linking Azerbaijan to its Nakhchivan exclave, which will be named the "Trump Route for International Peace and Prosperity." The deal marks a major diplomatic achievement and signals a shift in geopolitical influence in the South Caucasus region, diminishing Russia's traditional role.</p>

          <p>OpenAI's newly launched GPT-5 model has garnered mixed reviews from experts in China, a key market in the global artificial intelligence race. While OpenAI promoted GPT-5 as its most powerful model yet, with advanced capabilities and a built-in "thinking" function, some Chinese analysts described it as an incremental improvement rather than a revolutionary breakthrough. The reaction highlights the heightened competition and high expectations within China's tech industry, which is rapidly developing its own advanced AI models. The reception suggests that Chinese firms are increasingly confident in their ability to compete with their U.S. counterparts.</p>

          <p>A recent analysis explores the Social Security benefits received by upper-class retirees, finding a significant gap compared to the average recipient. While a typical 75-year-old receives about $2,065 monthly, an individual in the 90th percentile is estimated to get around $3,283 per month. However, the article emphasizes that even this higher amount is often insufficient to cover all expenses for those with a higher cost of living. Financial experts stress that Social Security should be viewed as a supplemental income source, highlighting the necessity of other retirement savings like 401(k)s and IRAs for financial security.

The article notes the company's solid revenue growth and stable EBIT margins, contrasting it with speculative, unprofitable "story stocks." Furthermore, it points to significant insider ownership, valued at $3.6 billion, and reasonable CEO compensation as positive signs of good governance and alignment with shareholder interests.

A new state-owned enterprise has been established to oversee the construction, which will link Hotan in Xinjiang with Shigatse in Tibet, creating a 2,000-kilometer route. The railway is a key component of a larger plan to establish a 5,000-kilometer rail network centered on Lhasa by 2035.

          <p>To avoid high international cell phone bills, travelers have several options beyond paying daily carrier fees, which can quickly add up. Experts suggest that frequent travelers might benefit from switching to a provider like T-Mobile, some of whose plans include basic international roaming. For heavy data users, purchasing a local or international eSIM is often a cheaper and more flexible alternative. The most straightforward method is to rely on free Wi-Fi whenever possible, which can be made more effective by pre-downloading maps and guidebooks for offline use before leaving home.</p>

          <p>Stargazers hoping to catch the peak of the annual Perseids meteor shower next week may be disappointed, as a full moon is expected to interfere with the view. The bright moonlight will likely wash out many of the fainter meteors, though NASA notes that a few bright "fireballs" might still be visible in the predawn hours. The Perseids, which originate from debris left by the Swift-Tuttle comet, are popular because they occur during the summer in the Northern Hemisphere. Astronomers advise finding a dark location away from city lights and looking north for the best chance to see the celestial event.</p>

          <p>A clinical trial published in Nature Medicine has demonstrated the significant health benefits of a minimally processed diet compared to an ultraprocessed one. Researchers split volunteers into two groups, with one eating whole foods and the other eating ultraprocessed meals that were designed to be nutritionally similar. The whole-food diet group experienced greater fat loss, lower blood pressure, and better blood sugar control. This occurred even though both diets were designed to be equally satisfying and followed government health guidelines, suggesting that the level of processing itself is a key factor in health outcomes.</p>

          <p>In a sign of easing tensions, North Korea has reportedly started dismantling some of its propaganda loudspeakers along the border with South Korea.

The reciprocal actions mark a shift from the hard-line approach of the previous South Korean government and reflect the new administration's efforts to reopen dialogue. The cross-border loudspeaker campaigns have been a recurring feature during periods of heightened animosity between the two nations, which technically remain at war.</p>

Proponents tout the economic benefits and job creation, while engineers express confidence that risks from seismic activity and high winds can be managed with modern technology.
