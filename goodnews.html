          <p>China's retail sales growth slowed to 5.1% in April, missing analysts' estimates and indicating that consumption remains a concern for the country's economy. Despite the slowdown in retail sales, industrial output grew by 6.1%, exceeding expectations. Fixed-asset investment also saw growth, though slightly below forecasts, with the real estate sector experiencing a significant decline. These economic data points come against the backdrop of ongoing trade tensions between China and the U.S., despite recent agreements to roll back tariffs temporarily. (not investment advice)</p>

The Politburo affirmed the need to bolster domestic consumption amid uncertainty in global trade. This data reflects China's ability to weather economic pressures despite ongoing trade disputes.</p>
