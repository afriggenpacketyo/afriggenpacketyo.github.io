        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>The U.S. Postal Service operates a Remote Encoding Center in Salt Lake City, Utah, dedicated to deciphering poorly handwritten addresses on mail. When automated systems fail to read an address, images are sent to this facility where data conversion operators, or keyers, work around the clock to manually decode them. These experts process approximately 75,000 images of mail daily, with an individual keyer handling about 900 pieces per hour. This specialized center ensures that even mail with the most challenging penmanship has a chance to reach its intended destination, preventing it from being returned to the sender.</p>

          <p>Tampa Bay Buccaneers defensive tackle Desmond Watson, recognized as the heaviest player in NFL history, has been placed on the non-football injury list to begin training camp. Coach Todd Bowles stated the decision was made due to Watson's weight, and the team is working with him to improve his health and fitness for the field. Watson, an undrafted rookie from Florida, reportedly weighed 464 pounds at his pro day. The team has not set a specific weight target or a timetable for his return, but emphasized they are supporting him through the process with a team nutritionist.</p>

        </div>
        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>President Trump has signed an executive order aimed at creating new rules for name, image, and likeness (NIL) deals and revenue-sharing in college sports. The order seeks to ban "pay-for-play" payments from third parties while preserving athletes' rights to brand endorsements. It also mandates that revenue-sharing agreements must not reduce scholarship opportunities in women's and non-revenue sports, and directs larger athletic departments to increase such scholarships. The order directs the National Labor Relations Board to clarify the employment status of college athletes, aiming to bring structure to what the White House calls an "out-of-control" system.</p>

          <p>The Roman Catholic Archdiocese of Los Angeles has initiated a Family Assistance Program to deliver food, groceries, and medicine to immigrant families living in fear due to ongoing ICE enforcement raids. The program leverages existing parish networks to support vulnerable community members who are afraid to leave their homes. Archbishop José Gomez stated the effort is for "good, hard-working men and women" who are now hesitant to go to work or appear in public. The initiative has already received significant donations, including $50,000 from businessman Rick Caruso, to help provide essential relief.</p>

          <p>Even with the 2024 election cycle concluded, potential Democratic candidates for the 2028 presidential race are already making strategic media appearances. Figures like Rahm Emanuel, Pete Buttigieg, Gavin Newsom, and Andy Beshear are engaging with non-traditional outlets, including podcasts popular with younger and more ideologically diverse audiences. This shift in media strategy is seen as a response to the party's 2024 loss, with a focus on reaching new voters and adopting a more moderate tone on cultural issues. The early moves signal the beginning of a course correction as the party seeks to redefine its message and leadership for the future.</p>

          <h2>Jim Cramer Argues Big Tech Is Underspending on Artificial Intelligence</h2>

          <p>CNBC's Jim Cramer asserted that major technology companies like Meta, Amazon, Alphabet, and Microsoft are not overspending on AI but are, in fact, underspending. He argues that the race for AI dominance is a "winner-take-all" situation, and increased investment is necessary to secure a leading position. Citing Alphabet's strong quarterly earnings and increased capital expenditures for its cloud and AI services, Cramer suggests the spending is justified and crucial for future growth. He believes the company with the most accurate AI chatbot will achieve a near-monopoly, similar to Google's success with its search engine. (not investment advice)</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>As the U.S. Food and Drug Administration moves to ban artificial food colorings like Red Dye No. 3, technology and food science companies are innovating to create natural alternatives. Firms like Fermentalg are using microalgae to produce stable, vibrant blue pigments, while others source colors from specially grown carrots and potatoes. The shift comes in response to growing health concerns and regulatory pressure to make food products healthier. While challenges remain in matching the vividness and shelf-life of synthetic dyes, major food giants have pledged to phase out artificial colors by 2026.</p>

          <p>Los Angeles Rams wide receiver Puka Nacua, who is in the third year of his modest rookie contract, is positioned for a lucrative contract extension next offseason. Following his record-setting rookie year and strong performance last season, Nacua has become a key player for the team. His potential payday is highlighted by recent massive extensions signed by other young star receivers, such as Garrett Wilson's $90 million guaranteed deal. Currently earning just over $1 million this season, Nacua's continued high-level production could secure him a nine-figure contract, reflecting his rapid rise to NFL stardom.</p>
