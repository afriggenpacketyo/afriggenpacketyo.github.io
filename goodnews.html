          <p>Japan's governing Liberal Democratic Party (LDP) has elected Sanae Takaichi, a 64-year-old conservative, as its new leader, making her the likely first female prime minister of the country. A protégé of former Prime Minister Shinzo Abe, Takaichi is known for her hard-line conservative views and hawkish stance on China. Her election is seen as an attempt by the LDP to regain public support after recent election losses and to appeal to its conservative base. Takaichi will face immediate challenges, including navigating relations with the U.S. and addressing domestic economic issues.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>An analysis of the first-ever rock samples returned from the far side of the moon reveals a significant temperature difference between the moon's two hemispheres. A team of scientists in China and Britain studied samples from the Chang'e-6 mission and found that minerals from the far side likely formed in lava that was about 100 degrees Celsius cooler than on the near side. This discovery of thermal asymmetry provides new insights into the moon's formation and evolution. It helps explain the long-observed stark contrasts in topography and volcanic activity between the two sides of Earth's natural satellite.</p>

        </div>
        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>This opinion article argues that conservative criticism of Bad Bunny's selection as the Super Bowl halftime performer is misguided and based on a misunderstanding of American geography and identity. The author points out that as a Puerto Rican, Bad Bunny is a U.S. citizen, and his use of Spanish should not be seen as unpatriotic, citing a history of non-American performers at the event. The piece suggests that such backlash is a form of fear-mongering and that embracing bilingualism and cultural diversity is a strength, not a weakness. The NFL's choice is presented as a commercial decision reflecting global trends.</p>

          <p>Michele Mulroney has been elected the new president of the Writers Guild of America West, entering the role as the industry faces significant challenges like studio consolidation and the rise of artificial intelligence. Her immediate goals include building on the guild's previous gains in AI protections and addressing the financial strain on the WGA's health plan, which she attributes to a contraction in production. As the union prepares for contract negotiations next year, Mulroney aims to secure more funding from studios for healthcare. She also plans to continue lobbying for tax incentives to keep film and television production in the U.S.</p>

        </div>
        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>A new study by Italian researchers proposes that the iconic bronze statue of the winged Lion of St. Mark in Venice may have originated as a tomb guardian from Tang dynasty China. The theory is based on stylistic similarities between the statue and Chinese "zhenmushou" mythical beasts, as well as lead isotope analysis matching the bronze to ore sources in China's Lower Yangtze River basin. The researchers speculate the 2.8-tonne statue could have been transported to Venice by the family of explorer Marco Polo before being altered. However, this claim is being disputed by some scholars in China.</p>

          <p>Renowned mountain athlete Kilian Jornet has completed "States of Elevation," a personal endurance project where he summited the 73 highest mountains in the contiguous United States in just 31 days. The journey involved cycling over 3,000 miles between mountain ranges and running up each peak, all under his own power. Jornet, considered one of the greatest mountain athletes ever, chose routes based on aesthetics and challenge rather than pure efficiency, such as traversing long, technical ridgelines. The project was not just a physical feat but also an artistic exploration of the American wilderness and a way to connect with its landscapes.</p>

          <p>With Sunderland returning to the Premier League, former manager Peter Reid looks back on "Premier Passions," the 1998 BBC documentary that gave an unprecedented inside look at the club's 1996-97 season. The series famously captured Reid's expletive-filled halftime team talks and documented a historic period as the club prepared to leave its old Roker Park stadium. Reid reflects that while his aggressive management style might not be acceptable today, it was part of the era. The documentary is remembered for capturing the changing commercial landscape of football and providing a raw, transparent look at the pressures of top-flight management.</p>

          <p>The first supermoon of 2025, known as the Harvest Moon, will be visible on the night of October 7th. This full moon will appear larger and brighter than usual because its orbit brings it to one of its closest points to Earth for the year. It is also the full moon that falls closest to the autumn equinox, traditionally providing extra light for farmers harvesting crops. This event will kick off a series of three consecutive supermoons, with the next two occurring in November and December. The article also explains the "moon illusion," which makes the moon appear even larger when it is near the horizon.</p>
