        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>The recently passed tax bill introduces 'Trump Accounts,' offering a $1,000 baby bonus, similar to a 529 college savings plan. These accounts provide tax-deferred earnings growth, with qualified withdrawals taxed at the long-term capital-gains rate. While offering tax incentives, they face competition from existing options like custodial brokerage accounts and 529 plans, which may offer more flexibility or higher contribution limits. Financial advisors suggest that 529 plans may be superior for parents focused on higher education expenses due to federal tax-free growth and the ability to roll unused funds into a Roth IRA.

          <p>Nike is set to raise prices on some trainers and clothing in the U.S. starting in early June, following a similar warning from Adidas about potential price hikes due to tariffs. While Nike did not explicitly cite U.S. tariffs as the reason, the company stated that it regularly makes 'price adjustments'. The increases will affect most Nike shoes costing over $100, as well as clothing and equipment, with exemptions for certain products like Air Force 1 trainers and children's items. This move comes as retailers worry that higher prices could impact customer demand in the U.S. market.</p>

        </div>

          <p>The House has passed a bill that includes changes to the federal deduction for state and local taxes (SALT), raising the cap to $40,000, up from the current $10,000 limit. This provision, part of President Trump's tax package, benefits filers in high-tax states like New York, New Jersey, and California who itemize deductions. The SALT cap and income phaseout would increase annually by 1% from 2026 through 2033, according to the text. However, the proposal may face challenges in the Senate, and it also reduces itemized deductions for certain taxpayers in the 37% income tax bracket, which could lower the benefit of the higher SALT cap.

        </div>
        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>A recent pause on the steepest tariffs on Chinese goods has led importers to increase orders from Asia, though not enough to eliminate the risk of retail shortages, according to a CNBC survey. While the tariff de-escalation deal is a positive step, retailers say the remaining import taxes are still too high to complete full orders. This situation is expected to result in lower inventory, fewer product selections, and potentially higher prices for consumers. Experts suggest that the supply chain is experiencing mixed signals, with uncertainty remaining in business decisions and potential recession risks amid ongoing trade pressures.</p>

          <p>The Trump administration's revocation of Biden-era rules on AI chip access signals a more targeted approach to curbing China's technological development. Unlike the previous 'AI Diffusion Rule,' the new guidance prohibits the use of advanced Chinese chips, a move viewed by Beijing as a challenge to its long-term development goals. This shift could introduce greater uncertainties into ongoing trade talks between the U.S. and China. Analysts suggest that while the U.S. is tailoring its attack specifically against China, it could renew tensions on the technology front.</p>

          <p>While gold has surged in price in 2024 and 2025, it may still be a sensible investment for seniors seeking portfolio protection rather than aggressive growth. Gold is known for its stability and ability to hedge against volatility, making it attractive for retirees. However, it doesn't produce income like dividends or interest, and there's a risk of price pullback after the recent rally. Alternatives include fractional gold investing and gold ETFs, allowing for lower-cost entry. (not investment advice)</p>
