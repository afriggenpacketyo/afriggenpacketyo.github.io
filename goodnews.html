        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>A potential U.S. government shutdown is unlikely to significantly disrupt the mortgage market for most homebuyers, according to housing experts. While conventional loans from private lenders should proceed normally, applicants for government-backed loans through agencies like the FHA, VA, or USDA may experience minor processing delays. Another potential issue could be securing flood insurance through the FEMA-administered program, which cannot issue new policies during a shutdown, possibly affecting closings in high-risk areas.</p>

          <p>The explosive growth of artificial intelligence is creating a new and valuable commercial real estate asset class known as "powered land." This refers to land that is pre-approved and equipped with the massive power infrastructure required to support large-scale data centers. Real estate investment firms like Hines are now focusing on securing power rights and permits, transforming this preparatory work into a tradable asset. With demand for data centers projected to require nearly 2 billion square feet of such land globally in the next five years, securing power is becoming more critical than constructing buildings.</p>

Teen accounts will also be prevented from following or interacting with accounts that regularly post inappropriate content, and parents will have the option to enable an even more restrictive "Limited Content" setting.</p>

          <h2>United Kingdom Hosts Conference on Post-War Reconstruction of Gaza</h2>

          <p>The United Kingdom is hosting a three-day conference focused on the reconstruction of Gaza, aiming to establish a key role in the post-conflict peace process. The event brings together representatives from business, civil society, and governments, including Germany, Saudi Arabia, and the Palestinian Authority, to coordinate planning efforts. However, the UK's vision of a Palestinian-led recovery may conflict with the U.S. plan for a temporary, internationally overseen governing committee. Experts suggest that for any long-term success, reconstruction efforts will require UN oversight and the difficult inclusion of both Israeli and Hamas representatives.</p>

          <p>Citigroup reported third-quarter earnings that surpassed Wall Street expectations, with every business division achieving record revenue. The bank's net income rose 15% to $3.8 billion, driven by strong performance in its services, banking, and markets segments. CEO Jane Fraser credited the positive results to the execution of the company's strategy and investments in innovation, including digital assets and AI. Despite the strong performance, expenses rose due to costs associated with the sale of its Mexico business, Banamex, but the bank's stock has still outperformed the S&P 500 this year.

          <p>The U.S. Supreme Court has rejected an appeal from conspiracy theorist Alex Jones, leaving in place a $1.4 billion defamation judgment against him for falsely claiming the 2012 Sandy Hook Elementary School shooting was a hoax. The massive sum was awarded by a Connecticut jury to compensate victims' families for the harassment and emotional distress they endured due to his lies. Jones had argued the verdict violated his free speech rights, but the high court's decision effectively finalizes his financial liability in the case.</p>

        </div>
        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>As U.S. mortgage rates decline from recent highs, experts predict a more competitive housing market that could drive up home prices. Lower rates increase buyers' purchasing power and are likely to draw many who were waiting on the sidelines back into the market. This surge in demand, coupled with still-limited housing inventory, is expected to lead to more bidding wars. While lenders are seeing an uptick in both purchase and refinance applications, this increased activity may also lead to slower processing times for loan approvals and closings.

          <p>Retired England bowler Stuart Broad has claimed that Australia's current team is their "worst" since 2010, the last time England won an Ashes series down under. Broad's comments come in response to predictions of a heavy England defeat and are based on what he sees as question marks over Australia's lineup and the fitness of their captain, Pat Cummins. While acknowledging the difficulty of winning in Australia, he suggests that the current English squad is their best since 2010, setting the stage for a potentially highly competitive and contentious series.</p>

          <p>A new study highlights a significant values gap between Gen Z and hiring managers, potentially contributing to hiring difficulties. Research shows that Gen Z prioritizes self-care, authenticity, and helping others, whereas employers are primarily looking for candidates who value achievement, learning, and hard work. This disconnect means only 2% of Gen Z job seekers share the top priorities of their potential bosses. The article advises young workers to be honest about their financial goals to decide whether they should adapt to employer expectations or seek careers that align more closely with their personal values.</p>
