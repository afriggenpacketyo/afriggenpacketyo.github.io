          <h2>Study Predicts Increased Ice Jams in China's Yellow River Due to Climate Change</h2>
          <div class="timestamp">2025-06-16 02:00:11 EDT</div>
        </div>
        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>A new study indicates that ice jams in the Yellow River estuary will become more frequent by the end of the century due to global warming, affecting coastal cities in eastern Shandong province. Warmer weather causes upstream ice to break apart and drift downstream, where it can refreeze and accumulate in colder areas, forming ice jams. These jams can cause destructive flooding, damaging communities, wildlife, and infrastructure; integrating historical records with climate projections reveals a shift in ice jam flood hotspots downstream. The Yellow River, while considered the cradle of Chinese civilization, is also known as ‚ÄúChina‚Äôs Sorrow‚Äù because of its history of devastating floods. </p>

          <p>Taiwan has placed China's Huawei and SMIC on its trade blacklist, further aligning its policies with the United States amidst growing tensions with Beijing. Both companies have been added to Taiwan's "Strategic High-Tech Commodities Entity List," requiring domestic firms to obtain licenses before shipping products to them. Taiwan's International Trade Administration stated that the blacklisting is due to their involvement in arms proliferation activities and national security concerns. This move reinforces existing U.S. export restrictions and aims to tighten loopholes, potentially raising penalties for future breaches. </p>

          <p>Premier Li Qiang has indicated that China will escalate policy support to bolster the property sector amid lingering concerns about its impact on growth and consumption. A State Council meeting emphasized the need to optimize existing policies and enhance systematic synergy to stabilize expectations, stimulate demand, and mitigate risks. The meeting highlighted a thorough stocktake of ongoing projects and land supplies, with urban-renewal projects set to receive more land and financing aid. The ultimate goal is to halt the decline and stabilize the property sector, which has been a drag on the overall economy. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>Japan has requested that eight countries and regions block its residents from accessing licensed online casino websites, aiming to curb illegal gambling. It is a crime in Japan to gamble with overseas-based betting sites, prompting the government to urge the operators to cut off access to their sites. Japan has engaged with Canada, Costa Rica, Georgia, Malta, Anjouan Island in the Comoros, Curacao of the Netherlands and the Isle of Man and Gibraltar, both British territories. The government plans to reiterate its request after a bill is passed to tighten regulations on illegal online gambling.</p>
