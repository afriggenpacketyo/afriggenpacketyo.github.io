          <p>United Airlines is partnering with JetBlue Airways in a new venture called Blue Sky, marking United's return to New York's JFK International Airport. This partnership will allow both airlines to sell seats on each other's sites, enabling JetBlue customers to earn frequent flyer miles on United and vice versa, also including reciprocal loyalty benefits. United CEO Scott Kirby noted that this collaboration will give the airlines the largest presence in Boston and extend United's reach in Florida and the Caribbean, enhancing competitiveness for both carriers. The deal is subject to regulatory review, and financial details were not disclosed. The initial phases of the partnership are expected to commence in the fall.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>The U.S. Court of International Trade has blocked reciprocal tariffs imposed by President Trump, stating that the International Emergency Economic Powers Act does not authorize a president to levy universal duties on imports. The ruling, which the Trump administration is appealing, caused Dow futures to jump 500 points and could significantly impact ongoing trade negotiations. The court panel ordered a permanent halt to the tariffs and barred future modifications, giving the Trump administration 10 days to implement the changes. White House spokesperson Kush Desai criticized the ruling, asserting that foreign countries' nonreciprocal treatment has created a national emergency.</p>

          <p>Stock market futures jumped following a federal court's decision to freeze most of the tariffs imposed by the Trump administration on U.S. trading partners. The U.S. Court of International Trade ruled that President Trump had overstepped his legal authority in assessing a 10% levy, also blocking duties on China, Mexico, and Canada. Overseas markets also experienced gains, with Germany's DAX and Japan's Nikkei 225 index surging following the ruling. Analysts suggest that if the Trump administration loses its appeal, it could reduce downside risks to the economy and upside risks to inflation (not investment advice).</p>

          <p>England could face drinking water shortages within a decade without new reservoirs, prompting the government to expedite planning for two reservoir projects.

Water Minister Emma Hardy emphasized the urgency, stating that the reservoirs are crucial to avoid water shortages by the mid-2030s.

          <p>A federal trade court has ruled President Trump's sweeping tariffs regime illegal, potentially blocking his controversial global trade policy. The ruling came after lawsuits argued that Trump exceeded his authority by treating trade policy as a matter of presidential whim.

The Trump administration has already filed an appeal, with White House officials calling the court "unelected."</p>

          <p>OPEC+ members are considering increasing oil production by 411,000 barrels per day in July, continuing the unwinding of voluntary production cuts. Eight oil-producing nations, including Russia and Saudi Arabia, are set to review market conditions and finalize output steps on May 31. This potential increase aligns with the typical summer increase in crude demand due to higher consumption of jet fuel and gasoline, as well as increased crude burn for electricity production in the Middle East. This could support oil prices amid market uncertainty triggered by U.S. tariffs.</p>

While the UK has a deal with the US to reduce car tariffs to 10% and eliminate steel and aluminum tariffs, this agreement has not yet been implemented. The ruling does prevent Trump from imposing blanket tariffs on other UK goods, but the White House intends to appeal the decision.</p>

She notes that in America, there is a hesitation to instruct other people's children, but historical precedent and cultural norms in other parts of the world support the idea that strangers can play a valuable role in guiding children's behavior. The article argues that this approach can help children learn social conventions and respect the needs of others, while also easing the pressure on parents.</p>
