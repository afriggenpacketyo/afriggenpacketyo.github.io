          <p>This article revisits the legendary "scorpion kick" save by Colombian goalkeeper René Higuita during a friendly match against England at Wembley 30 years ago. The audacious move, where Higuita cleared the ball by flicking his heels over his head, cemented his legacy as one of football's most eccentric and revolutionary players. Known as 'El Loco' (The Madman), his career was marked by a flamboyant style that included dribbling far from his goal and taking penalties. The piece also delves into his complex life, including his time in prison and his pioneering role in redefining the goalkeeper position.</p>

          <p>The Durham City Council has unanimously passed a resolution declaring the city a "Fourth Amendment Workplace," aiming to protect city workers, including undocumented immigrants, from federal immigration enforcement actions. The measure instructs city staff to uphold protections against unreasonable searches and seizures and to report any barriers to doing so, reflecting concerns about ICE raids creating fear in the community. This move follows a similar resolution by Carrboro, North Carolina, and comes amid ongoing debate over cooperation between local law enforcement and federal immigration authorities. The resolution emphasizes building trust with all residents to ensure public safety and engagement.</p>

          <p>A U.S. District Judge in San Francisco has issued a ruling that prevents the Trump administration from terminating Temporary Protected Status (TPS) for over one million people from Haiti and Venezuela. The judge found that the Homeland Security Secretary's decision to revoke the protections was "arbitrary and capricious," as it would force individuals back to dangerously unstable home countries. This legal victory provides a reprieve for hundreds of thousands of people who were facing the loss of their legal right to live and work in the United States. The Department of Homeland Security criticized the ruling, stating it would explore all legal options to end the program.</p>

          <p>An intense "talent war" has erupted in the artificial intelligence sector, with major tech companies like Meta, Google, and Microsoft offering multi-million dollar salaries and bonuses to attract a small pool of top AI researchers and engineers. The high demand is driven by the massive, billion-dollar investments required to build and train advanced AI models, making top talent a comparatively small but crucial expense. This fierce competition for specialists is inflating wages to unprecedented levels, creating challenges for startups and traditional industries that cannot compete with the compensation offered by Big Tech.

          <p>Lord Mandelson, the UK's ambassador to the United States, is set to deliver a speech praising President Donald Trump as a "risk taker" whose political instincts correctly identified widespread economic and social anxieties in Western societies. In the address, Mandelson will draw parallels between the mandates for national renewal that brought both Trump and UK Prime Minister Keir Starmer to power. The speech is seen as a strategic diplomatic move to strengthen the UK-US relationship under the unpredictable Trump presidency and to counter the rising influence of Nigel Farage's Reform UK party, which aligns closely with Trump's agenda.</p>

          <p>China is leveraging its party-to-party diplomatic channels, highlighted by President Xi Jinping's recent meetings with leaders from the world's other four ruling communist parties. This form of outreach, managed by the Communist Party's International Department, operates in parallel with traditional state-level foreign relations and is a key component of Beijing's diplomatic strategy. While China is not promoting a global communist movement like the former Soviet Union, these interactions serve to strengthen ties with ideologically aligned nations and expand its influence. The International Department has connections with over 600 political parties worldwide, playing an increasingly active diplomatic role.</p>

          <div class="timestamp">2025-09-05 22:00:14 EDT</div>
        </div>
        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>The recent strengthening of China's yuan is being attributed more to deliberate guidance from the People's Bank of China than to organic market forces, as the US dollar has remained relatively stable. Analysts suggest that the central bank is actively pushing up the currency's value. However, this rally is expected to be carefully managed, as Beijing likely wants to avoid making its exports less competitive, especially amid ongoing trade tensions with the United States. The move reflects China's strategy of using its central bank to guide its currency's performance in line with its broader economic objectives. (not investment advice)</p>
