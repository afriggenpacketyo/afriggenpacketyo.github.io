          <p>Chinese Foreign Minister Wang Yi emphasized that China-South Korea relations stand at a critical juncture for improvement, advocating for stability and continuity in Beijing's diplomatic approach. He urged both nations to prioritize friendship, expand shared interests, and judiciously handle sensitive issues to ensure the steady progress of their bilateral ties. The visiting South Korean delegation, led by former National Assembly speaker Park Byeong-seug, reciprocated this view, signaling Seoul's readiness to revitalize the strategic cooperative partnership through enhanced high-level exchanges and practical collaboration. This diplomatic push aims to reset relations following previous tensions, ensuring a more robust and mutually beneficial future for the two nations.</p>

          <p>Keurig Dr Pepper has announced a significant acquisition, planning to take over Dutch coffee and tea company JDE Peet's in a transaction valued at approximately $18 billion. Shareholders of JDE Peet's will receive 31.85 euros per share in cash, representing a substantial 33% premium over its recent stock price average. A key strategic outcome of this deal is Keurig Dr Pepper's intention to split its beverage and coffee units into two distinct, U.S.-listed entities, effectively reversing its 2018 merger between Keurig and Dr Pepper Snapple. This major restructuring aims to streamline operations, enhance market focus, and potentially unlock greater value for the company's various business segments. (not investment advice)</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Asian stock markets experienced a significant climb on Monday, with Hong Kong's Hang Seng Index surging over 2% to approach a four-year high, largely propelled by a robust tech sector rally. This positive momentum followed Federal Reserve Chair Jerome Powell's dovish signals at Jackson Hole, hinting at potential monetary policy easing and interest rate cuts as early as next month. Additionally, Chinese property stocks saw strong gains after Shanghai relaxed home-buying restrictions, contributing to the overall market uplift. Analysts suggest maturing time deposits could shift into equities, sustaining this momentum and potentially triggering capital rotation from the U.S. to China. (not investment advice)</p>

This visit follows recent U.S.-Russia peace talks in Alaska that were widely criticized for excluding Ukraine and failing to produce concrete outcomes. Klingbeil explicitly urged Russian President Putin to demonstrate a sincere interest in peace and underscored the absolute necessity of Ukraine's direct involvement in all peace negotiations.</p>

          <p>Singapore's inflation rate eased significantly in July, reaching a cooler-than-expected 0.6%, which marks its lowest point since January 2021 and falls below economists' projections. Core inflation also dipped to 0.5%, primarily due to falling prices in retail, other goods, electricity, and gas sectors. The Monetary Authority of Singapore (MAS) forecasts that inflation will remain moderate in the near term, attributing this to easing global crude oil prices and stable food commodity costs. Despite robust GDP growth earlier in the year, the MAS anticipates a moderation in economic growth during the second half, influenced by a "downshift" in the global trade environment and escalating trade tensions.
