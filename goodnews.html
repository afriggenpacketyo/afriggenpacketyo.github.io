          <p>The National Hockey League will allow its players to participate in the 2026 Winter Olympics in Milan, ending a 12-year absence from the international event. NHL Commissioner Gary Bettman stated that the decision was made after weighing the benefits of the global platform against the disruption to the league's season. A new agreement with the IOC addresses previous concerns regarding commercial rights and player accommodations. The return was largely driven by the players' strong desire to represent their countries in a best-on-best tournament format.</p>

          <p>Microsoft CEO Satya Nadella suggests that the recent wave of AI investment, including his company's $30 billion commitment, could boost the UK's economy by as much as 10% within the next five years. He compared the potential economic impact to that of the personal computer's adoption in the 1990s, emphasizing that the ultimate goal of AI development is to drive GDP growth. This optimistic forecast is part of a broader US-UK "Tech Prosperity Deal" aimed at strengthening collaboration on advanced technologies. Nadella acknowledged the high energy consumption of AI but argued its benefits outweigh the costs.</p>

          <p>High winds in Washington state are causing ash from the 1980 eruption of Mount St. Helens to become resuspended in the atmosphere, leading to hazy conditions and reduced air quality. The U.S. Geological Survey (USGS) has clarified that this phenomenon is not due to any new volcanic activity but is a result of dry, loose ash being lifted by the wind. The volcano's alert level remains at "Normal." However, officials have warned that the airborne ash is considered hazardous and could pose a risk to aircraft and public health.</p>

          <p>The average interest rate for a 30-year fixed mortgage has dropped to its lowest point since late 2022, reaching 6.13% on Tuesday. This sharp decline is attributed to investor anticipation of an impending rate cut by the Federal Reserve. Analysts note that this trend mirrors past cycles where markets price in a Fed decision before it occurs. However, some experts caution that long-term rates may not be significantly impacted by the expected cut and could potentially rise again after the official announcement. (not investment advice)</p>
