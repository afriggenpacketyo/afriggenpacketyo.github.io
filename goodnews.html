          <p>A woman whose body was found on a Dutch beach in 2004 has finally been identified as 35-year-old German citizen Eva Maria Pommer, 21 years later. Her identity was confirmed following a crucial tip-off received through Operation Identify Me, an international police campaign to name unidentified female victims. Ms. Pommer's case, known as "the woman with the German keys," had remained a mystery despite unusual clothing and a key linking her to Germany. Police continue to investigate the unexplained cause of death, but this identification offers hope for other cold cases.</p>

          <h2>Scientists Discover Salt-Laced Ice Can Generate Electricity Through Bending</h2>
          <div class="timestamp">2025-10-10 00:00:09 EDT</div>
        </div>
        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Scientists from China and Spain have made a breakthrough, discovering that adding salt to ice enables it to generate electricity when bent. This finding opens new possibilities for harnessing clean power, particularly in cold environments. The team found that salt-doped ice produced an electrical response comparable to high-performing ceramic materials. This innovative approach leverages flexoelectricity, where an electrical charge is generated under non-uniform strain, potentially leading to low-cost energy sources.</p>

          <p>A judge has dismissed Drake's defamation lawsuit against Universal Music Group concerning Kendrick Lamar's song "Not Like Us." The ruling determined that Lamar's lyrics, which included serious accusations against Drake, were "nonactionable opinion" within the context of a heated rap battle. Drake had accused UMG of defamation for allowing the song's publication and promotion, arguing it spread a "false and malicious narrative." Despite Drake's intent to appeal, UMG expressed satisfaction with the outcome, affirming support for artistic creative expression in such high-profile disputes.</p>

          <p>The New York Giants secured a decisive 34-17 victory over the Philadelphia Eagles, marking the defending Super Bowl champions' second consecutive loss. Rookie running back Cam Skattebo scored three touchdowns, while fellow rookie quarterback Jaxson Dart contributed with passing and rushing scores, both overcoming fumbles from a previous game. The Giants' defense also played a crucial role, sacking Eagles quarterback Jalen Hurts three times and securing an interception. This win is a significant upset for the Giants against their NFC East rivals, who struggled with offensive miscues and defensive lapses.</p>

          <p>China's top economic planner, the National Development and Reform Commission (NDRC), and the State Administration for Market Regulation (SAMR) have jointly published a policy paper aimed at limiting intense price competition. The measures are designed to combat price wars and self-destructive cost-cutting practices within certain industries, which regulators believe harm industry development, innovation, and product quality. Authorities will guide industry associations to evaluate production costs and intervene with warnings, cost investigations, and price inspections when necessary. This initiative seeks to maintain market order and foster healthy economic development.</p>

          <p>The Los Angeles Dodgers secured a dramatic 2-1 walk-off victory against the Philadelphia Phillies in Game 4 of the National League Division Series, advancing to the NL Championship Series. The game ended in the 11th inning due to a critical throwing error by Phillies pitcher Orion Kerkering, who mishandled a grounder with the bases loaded, allowing the winning run to score. The "instant classic" match featured a pitchers' duel and intense bullpen battle, with the Dodgers ultimately capitalizing on their opponent's mistake. This win marks a significant step for the Dodgers in their quest for a World Series title.</p>

          <p>Maine Governor Janet Mills, a Democrat, is reportedly set to announce her campaign for the U.S. Senate next week, challenging long-serving Republican Senator Susan Collins. Mills, who is term-limited as governor, has been a top recruit for the Democratic Senatorial Campaign Committee. She previously gained national attention for publicly confronting President Trump over his administration's stance on transgender athletes. This race is anticipated to be one of the most closely watched contests in next year's midterm elections, offering Democrats a rare opportunity to flip a GOP-held seat in a state that leans Democratic.</p>

          <p>Sanae Takaichi's victory in Japan's Liberal Democratic Party (LDP) leadership race marks a significant ideological shift, positioning her as the country's first female prime minister-in-waiting.

Takaichi's vision combines fiscal expansionism with protectionist policies, prioritizing state-led industrial revival and strategic investment in defense and technology. This approach aims to reduce reliance on China and strengthen security autonomy, with mixed implications for Japan's domestic economy, foreign policy, and engagement with Southeast Asian partners.</p>

          <p>"Battlefield 6," the latest installment in the military shooter series, is poised to challenge "Call of Duty" in the competitive video game market, despite being a significant gamble for publisher Electronic Arts (EA). Developed by four studios, the game is touted as "unbeatable" by its general manager, with a restored single-player campaign and positive community feedback from early playtests. The project, reportedly costing hundreds of millions, faces pressure to succeed after its predecessor's negative reception. Its success will depend on attracting and retaining players against established rivals, with developers cautiously optimistic about its potential.</p>

          <p>California Governor Gavin Newsom has signed a package of bills aimed at strengthening the California FAIR Plan, the state's insurer of last resort, following significant losses from January's wildfires. The legislation seeks to alleviate the FAIR Plan's financial strain and increase legislative oversight over the carrier, which provides coverage when private insurers withdraw. Key measures include enabling the plan to issue bonds for catastrophic claims and appointing legislative members to its governing committee. These reforms are a response to the growing climate-fueled firestorms and aim to stabilize California's insurance market.</p>

They developed a self-healing interface that acts like a liquid seal, maintaining tight internal layers without the heavy external pressure previously required. Experts suggest this innovation resolves a key bottleneck that has long hindered the practical application of these batteries. This breakthrough promises safer, more energy-dense batteries, potentially revolutionizing electric vehicles and portable electronics.</p>

          <p>Robert Roberson, convicted of capital murder in his 2-year-old daughter Nikki's 2002 death, has been granted a stay of execution by the Texas Court of Criminal Appeals, just one week before it was scheduled. Roberson's defense argues he is innocent, claiming Nikki died from pneumonia and medications, not shaken baby syndrome, a diagnosis now considered unsound by new medical research. The ruling orders a review of his arguments under Texas' "junk science" law, potentially paving the way for a new trial.
