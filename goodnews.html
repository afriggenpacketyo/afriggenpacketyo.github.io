          <p>SoftBank Group's shares surged by 13% to a record high following a fiscal first-quarter profit that significantly surpassed analyst expectations. The Japanese conglomerate reported a profit of 421.8 billion yen, driven by a $4.8 billion gain in its Vision Funds, the largest since 2021. This strong performance marks a sharp turnaround from the previous year's loss and is attributed to gains from investments in companies like Grab Holdings and Swiggy. Several of its portfolio companies are also preparing for upcoming initial public offerings. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>The office of Vice President JD Vance stated that he was unaware of a Secret Service request to the U.S. Army Corps of Engineers to raise the water level of the Little Miami River. The adjustment was made to ensure safe navigation for the Vice President's security detail during a family boating trip. The Secret Service confirmed the decision was made independently during standard planning after a public safety boat ran aground in a scouting mission. The incident has drawn some criticism and comparisons to a similar event involving former Vice President Al Gore.</p>

          <h2>Southern European Butterfly Species Spotted in the UK for the First Time</h2>
          <div class="timestamp">2025-08-07 21:06:28 EDT</div>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>A butterfly species native to Southern Europe, the Southern Small White, has been officially recorded in the United Kingdom for the first time. A volunteer photographed the female butterfly at a nature reserve in Suffolk, confirming the species' rapid northward expansion across Europe in recent decades. Experts at Butterfly Conservation attribute this migration, which has seen the butterfly colonize areas from the Alps to the North Sea, at least in part to a warming climate. Whether the species will establish a permanent breeding population in the UK remains to be seen.</p>

          <p>A growing number of people, particularly millennials, are moving away from dating apps and embracing in-person singles events to find romantic connections. Companies like Date Cincy are hosting successful matchmaking events for those tired of the swiping culture and seeking more authentic, face-to-face interactions. Data shows that attendance at singles events is rising, while the value of major dating apps like Bumble has significantly declined. This trend reflects a craving for genuine human connection that many feel is missing from the online dating experience.</p>

          <p>Tonia Haddix, an exotic animal broker featured in the HBO docuseries "Chimp Crazy," has been sentenced to 46 months in prison. She pleaded guilty to perjury and obstruction of justice for lying to a federal judge about the death of a chimpanzee named Tonka, whom she was hiding in her basement. PETA had pursued legal action against Haddix, leading to a court order to relinquish several chimpanzees. Tonka was eventually discovered and relocated to a sanctuary, and the case has drawn attention to the issue of private primate ownership.</p>

          <p>Pharmaceutical company Eli Lilly has announced that its experimental oral weight-loss drug, orforglipron, showed significant success in a late-stage clinical trial. Adults with obesity who took the pill lost an average of 27.3 pounds over 72 weeks, a result comparable to existing injectable GLP-1 therapies. While some participants experienced side effects like nausea, the company plans to submit the drug for FDA approval later this year. An effective oral medication could be a "game changer" by making weight-loss treatments more accessible and convenient for consumers.</p>

          <p>The UK government is planning legislation that would confine serious violent and sexual offenders to specific geographical areas upon their release from prison. This new system would replace current exclusion zones, which only bar offenders from certain locations, by instead defining the area where they are permitted to be. Monitored by enhanced electronic tagging, the policy is intended to give victims greater peace of mind. Critics raise concerns about placing additional pressure on the already strained probation service, though the government plans to hire more staff.</p>

          <p>Restaurant chain Texas Roadhouse announced mixed financial results for its second quarter, with rising beef prices impacting profitability despite strong sales. The company's revenue of $1.51 billion surpassed expectations, driven by a 5.8% increase in same-store sales and higher customer traffic. However, earnings per share fell short of analyst estimates due to the high cost of beef, a headwind expected to continue. The company plans a modest menu price increase to help offset some of the inflationary pressure while aiming to maintain its value proposition for consumers. (not investment advice)</p>
