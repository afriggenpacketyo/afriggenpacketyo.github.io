          <p>Following the death of Hulk Hogan, former WWE broadcaster Jonathan Coachman reminisced about the legendary "Icon vs. Icon" match between Hogan and Dwayne "The Rock" Johnson at WrestleMania X8 in 2002. Coachman described the atmosphere as one of the most amazing moments of his career, highlighting how the wrestlers had to improvise and change the match's structure mid-performance. The Toronto crowd unexpectedly cheered for Hogan, who was scripted as the villain, and booed The Rock, forcing the two to communicate in the ring to adjust their roles. This adaptability and the crowd's electric response solidified the match as a pinnacle moment in professional wrestling history.</p>

          <p>Following a White House statement calling their show irrelevant and "fourth-rate," South Park co-creator Trey Parker issued a mock-serious apology for an episode that heavily satirized President Donald Trump. The season premiere depicted Trump in several unflattering scenarios, including naked in bed with Satan, prompting a sharp rebuke from the administration. The episode also tackled the recent merger of parent company Paramount, suggesting corporate entities are caving to political pressure. The exchange highlights the show's continued willingness to engage in topical, often controversial, political commentary, even as its creators have previously expressed a desire to move away from being a weekly Trump satire.</p>

          <p>Cathie Wood's ARK Invest has increased its holdings in genomics company Illumina, citing stabilizing financial performance and long-term potential. While Illumina's first-quarter revenue saw a slight dip, it improved margins, reduced expenses, and reaffirmed its full-year guidance. The company's valuation is considered reasonable, trading at 22 times forward earnings for 2026, and its extensive genomics dataset provides a significant competitive advantage. Analysts have a "Moderate Buy" consensus on the stock, seeing it as a unique opportunity for patient investors focused on the transformative power of genomic infrastructure.

          <p>Manchester City has agreed to a £27 million deal to re-sign goalkeeper James Trafford from Burnley, just two years after he left the club. The 22-year-old City academy graduate had a standout season with Burnley, helping them secure promotion to the Premier League. Manchester City activated a matching rights clause in his contract after Newcastle submitted a £27 million bid, and Trafford chose to return to his former club. He is expected to sign a five-year contract and will compete with Ederson and Stefan Ortega for the starting goalkeeper position, creating a selection dilemma for manager Pep Guardiola.</p>

          <p>The United Kingdom and India have signed a free trade agreement (FTA) expected to boost their annual bilateral trade by over $34 billion in the long term. The deal will slash tariffs on a wide range of goods, including textiles, automobiles, and alcohol, with 99% of Indian goods shipped to the UK eventually becoming tariff-free. Key provisions include halving the 150% tariff on UK scotch whisky and lowering car duties. The agreement, one of India's first with an advanced economy, is seen as a strategic win for both nations, providing leverage in other ongoing trade negotiations, particularly with the United States.</p>

          <p>In a UK first, individuals in Wales with conditions like coeliac disease will receive pre-loaded debit-style cards to purchase gluten-free food. This new system offers an alternative to the current model of obtaining specific food items on prescription from a pharmacy. The Welsh government aims to "de-medicalise" the process, giving people more choice and dignity when shopping. A pilot program provided participants with £42 every three months, which they found helpful but said only "scratches the surface" of the high cost of a gluten-free diet. The prescription model will remain available alongside the new card system.</p>

          <p>Under the Make America Healthy Again movement, U.S. Health Secretary Robert F. Kennedy Jr. is successfully pushing the food industry to eliminate artificial dyes. The U.S. dairy industry recently pledged to remove artificial colors from ice cream by 2028, following similar commitments from giants like Nestle and Kraft Heinz. Kennedy argues these dyes, found in 19% of food products, are linked to health issues like cancer and hyperactivity. While public health advocates generally support the move, food manufacturers face challenges in switching to less stable and potentially scarce natural colorings, and some worry that American consumers may reject the duller hues of the reformulated products.</p>

          <p>China's military is advancing its modernization through the new Information Support Force (ISF), established to integrate advanced technologies like artificial intelligence into combat systems. Recent reports from the official PLA Daily newspaper provide a glimpse into the force's operations, which include embedding small ISF teams directly with air, naval, and ground units to provide real-time information support. This new structure is a key part of President Xi Jinping's sweeping military overhaul. The ISF is designed to enhance the People's Liberation Army's capabilities in network-centric warfare, improving decision-making and operational effectiveness across all branches of the armed forces.</p>

          <p>The United States is experiencing a dramatic and widespread decrease in its murder rate, which fell by a record 12% in 2023 and is projected to drop a further 20% in 2025. This decline follows a significant spike in violent crime that began in 2020. Crime analyst Jeff Asher suggests 2025 could see the lowest murder rate since the FBI began keeping reliable records in 1960. Cities like Baltimore have seen success with "focused deterrence" strategies, combining law enforcement with social support for high-risk individuals. Experts suggest a massive influx of federal funding from the American Rescue Plan Act, used for everything from violence reduction groups to renovating parks, has contributed to the nationwide trend.</p>

        </div>
        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>This article explains the science behind sunscreen and addresses growing safety concerns. Sunscreens work by using either organic (carbon-based) chemical filters that absorb UV radiation or mineral (inorganic) filters like zinc oxide that physically block it. While essential for preventing skin cancer, some long-approved chemical ingredients have been detected in the bloodstream, raising questions about their long-term effects, though scientists stress that the dose makes the poison. Experts warn against do-it-yourself sunscreens and mixing different products, which can reduce effectiveness. The future of sun protection may lie in new, plant-based compounds that mimic nature's own UV-protective mechanisms.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>In response to a severe housing crisis exacerbated by the 2023 Lahaina wildfire, the Maui County Council has passed a bill to phase out thousands of short-term vacation rentals. The legislation closes a loophole that allowed condos in apartment-zoned areas to be rented to tourists, mandating they be used for long-term housing instead. Proponents, including Mayor Richard Bissen, see it as a critical step to prioritize housing for local residents, predicting it will add over 6,000 units to the housing stock. Opponents argue it will harm the local economy and that the converted units will still be unaffordable for many residents.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>The Federal Reserve is widely expected to hold its benchmark interest rate steady, despite increasing public pressure from President Donald Trump, who is demanding sharp cuts to spur economic growth. Fed Chair Jerome Powell has indicated that rate cuts would likely have occurred already if not for the inflation risks posed by the administration's tariff agenda. The current federal funds rate remains between 4.25% and 4.5%, and futures markets show almost no chance of a cut at the upcoming meeting. A stable Fed rate means that borrowing costs for consumers on products like credit cards and auto loans are unlikely to decrease soon. (not investment advice)</p>
