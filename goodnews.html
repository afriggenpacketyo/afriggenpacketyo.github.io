          <p>Chinese original equipment manufacturers (OEMs) have seen an 86% surge in SUV sales volume in South Africa between January and August, capturing 15% of the market. This growth is primarily driven by brands like Chery and Haval. While Japanese leaders Toyota and Suzuki still hold larger volumes, their individual market dominance is declining. This shift indicates a significant change in consumer preference and market dynamics within the South African automotive sector.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Alibaba Group Holding's cloud unit has introduced Aegaeon, a computing pooling solution that reportedly cut the number of Nvidia GPUs needed for its AI models by 82%. Beta testing showed a reduction from 1,192 to 213 Nvidia H20 GPUs for serving dozens of models up to 72 billion parameters. This innovation, detailed in a research article, addresses resource inefficiency in cloud services where many AI models are served concurrently but some are only sporadically used. The system aims to significantly improve the efficiency and cost-effectiveness of AI infrastructure.</p>

          <p>A popular Chinese spy drama, "Silent Honour," has inspired a significant outpouring of public praise and remembrance for real-life intelligence agents in China. The show has led to a "sudden surge" of visitors to the tomb of Wu Shi, an underground Communist Party member who served as a KMT lieutenant general in Taiwan in 1949. Hundreds of flowers and thank-you notes have been left at his grave, with many calling him an "unsung hero" and expressing national pride. This phenomenon highlights the drama's profound impact on public perception and historical memory regarding national security figures.</p>

          <p>President Trump has signed a proclamation imposing 25% tariffs on imported medium- and heavy-duty trucks and their parts, along with 10% tariffs on imported buses. This move aims to protect U.S. companies from foreign competition and incentivize domestic manufacturing. The administration will offer credits to manufacturers who import parts but assemble vehicles in the U.S. to offset tariff liabilities. This policy is designed to support American labor and expand domestic production within the automotive sector. (not investment advice)</p>

Jewellers are adapting by designing lighter, more elaborate pieces to counter stagnant customer budgets. A significant trend this year is a shift towards buying gold and silver for investment rather than solely for jewelry, reflected in bullion market data and a surge in gold ETFs. India's central bank is also a major buyer, diversifying foreign exchange holdings. While volumes may fall, value demand is expected to hold up, though some families are priced out.

          <p>The United States is experiencing a significant turnaround in its fentanyl epidemic, with fatal overdoses falling by 25% in 2024, saving nearly 30,000 lives. This decline is largely attributed to a commitment to harm reduction policies, which prioritize drug users' health over criminalization. North Carolina, a leader in this trend, utilizes programs like law enforcement assisted diversion (LEAD) and expanded access to medication-assisted treatment (MAT) like methadone. Naloxone, an overdose reversal drug, has also been administered over 16,000 times, further contributing to the reduction in fatalities.</p>
