          <h2>Indian Prime Minister Visits Maldives to Bolster Relations Amid Chinese Influence</h2>

          <p>Indian Prime Minister Narendra Modi concluded a visit to the Maldives aimed at strengthening diplomatic and economic ties as the island nation has recently pivoted towards China. Maldivian President Mohamed Muizzu, who was elected on an anti-India platform, has since softened his rhetoric, calling India a "most trusted partner." During the visit, Modi announced a $565 million credit line and inaugurated several India-funded infrastructure projects, highlighting the strategic importance of the archipelago in the Indian Ocean. The move is seen as an effort to counteract China's growing influence in the strategically vital region.</p>

          <p>New York Jets quarterback Justin Fields returned to the practice field, alleviating fears of a serious injury after he was carted off with a dislocated toe earlier in the week. While he participated in 7-on-7 drills, he was held out of full team drills as the coaching staff eases him back into action. Head coach Aaron Glenn stated that the initial social media panic was unwarranted and that he does not anticipate the injury will derail Fields' season. The incident had initially caused widespread concern among fans, reminiscent of former quarterback Aaron Rodgers' season-ending injury last year.</p>

          <h2>Director Gurinder Chadha Confirms a Sequel to "Bend It Like Beckham" is in Development</h2>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>More than two decades after its original release, a sequel to the hit film "Bend It Like Beckham" is in the works, director Gurinder Chadha has confirmed. Speaking ahead of the Euro 2025 final, Chadha stated that the success of England's Lionesses and the changing landscape of women's football made it a good time to revisit the characters. The original 2002 film, starring Parminder Nagra and Keira Knightley, was a cultural phenomenon credited with inspiring a generation of female footballers. Chadha is targeting a 2027 release to coincide with the film's 25th anniversary and hopes to reunite the original cast.</p>

          <p>Actress Gwyneth Paltrow has been hired as a "very temporary" spokesperson for the tech company Astronomer, which recently faced a public relations crisis. The company's CEO and an HR executive resigned after they were caught in an intimate embrace on a KissCam at a Coldplay concert, with the footage going viral. Paltrow, the ex-wife of Coldplay's frontman Chris Martin, appeared in a video deftly avoiding the scandal while promoting the company's data workflow automation services. The move is an attempt by Astronomer to steer the narrative away from the controversy and back towards its core business.</p>

          <p>Arsenal has officially signed Swedish striker Viktor Gyokeres from Sporting Lisbon for a fee of €73 million (£63m) on a five-year contract. The 27-year-old said his decision was influenced by Arsenal's impressive performance when they played against his former club in the Champions League last season. Gyokeres has been a prolific scorer in Portugal, with 97 goals in 102 matches for Sporting. The acquisition is a major move for Arsenal, bringing their summer spending to approximately £204 million as they look to strengthen their squad with a clinical, powerful forward.</p>

          <p>A Japanese nutritionist living in the U.S. shared her experience shopping at a Costco in Kyoto, Japan, highlighting the "incredible" variety of traditional and healthy foods available compared to American stores. She identified six categories of "longevity foods" she wished were more common in the U.S., including a wide variety of seaweed, diverse soy-based products like tofu, and seasonal Japanese produce. The article notes the cultural significance and health benefits of these items, such as nutrient-dense seaweed and plant-based protein from tofu, which are staples in the Japanese diet and associated with a long, healthy life.</p>

          <p>In a significant political outcome, Taiwanese voters have rejected a recall effort against 24 lawmakers from the opposition Nationalist Party (KMT). The result is a setback for the ruling Democratic Progressive Party (DPP), which had hoped to flip the balance of power in the legislature. The KMT and its allies currently hold a majority, enabling them to block the agenda of President Lai Ching-te. Supporters of the recall had accused the KMT of being too friendly to China and obstructing key legislation, while the KMT framed the effort as political retaliation that undermined democracy.</p>

          <p>The debate over how much coffee is healthy continues, with experts advising that the right amount depends on the individual. While some studies link daily coffee consumption to health benefits and longevity, others suggest high intake can increase risks for certain conditions like dementia or cardiovascular issues in people with hypertension. The FDA recommends no more than 400 milligrams of caffeine per day, equivalent to about four 8-ounce cups. Dietitians stress that people should be mindful of how caffeine affects them personally, paying attention to signs like anxiety or disrupted sleep, and should not replace meals with coffee.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>An international research team has discovered that certain sequences of "junk" DNA, previously thought to be non-functional, actually play a significant role in regulating gene expression. The study focused on a family of "jumping genes" called MER11, which originated from an ancient retrovirus and make up a substantial portion of the human genome. Researchers found that the youngest of these sequences can act like genetic switches, attracting proteins that turn genes on and off without altering the underlying DNA. This finding challenges the "junk" label and suggests these elements have evolved to become crucial components of our genetic machinery.</p>

After medications failed and his condition worsened, he was given less than a year to live before being approved for the transplant.

The trip could occur either before or after the Asia-Pacific Economic Cooperation (Apec) summit in South Korea.

          <p>A provision in the recently passed "One Big Beautiful Bill Act" has made a key student loan benefit permanent, potentially encouraging more employers to help workers pay down their debt. The law solidifies the tax-free status of employer contributions up to $5,250 annually toward an employee's student loans, a benefit first introduced in the CARES Act. Workplace savings professionals believe this certainty will lead to wider adoption of loan reimbursement programs. This development offers a positive avenue for debt relief for workers, as other federal repayment options are being narrowed. (not investment advice)</p>
