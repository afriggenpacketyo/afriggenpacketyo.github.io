          <p>The cost of UK government borrowing fell after Prime Minister Keir Starmer publicly supported Chancellor Rachel Reeves, calming market fears about her potential departure. Investor nerves were rattled when Reeves became emotional in Parliament, leading to a drop in the pound and a spike in bond yields. Starmer later affirmed he and Reeves work "in lockstep," which helped restore some stability. The episode highlighted market sensitivity to the UK's fiscal discipline, with analysts noting that investors view Reeves as crucial for maintaining the government's financial credibility.

Fury, who retired in January after losing a rematch to Usyk, made the announcement on social media, which was cautiously confirmed by his promoters. The fight's realization may depend on the outcome of Usyk's upcoming bout with Daniel Dubois. This development follows comments from Saudi boxing official Turki Alalshikh, who stated he had Fury's word for a return to the ring in 2026 for a major event.</p>

          <p>Huang Yiping, an adviser to China's central bank, has proposed that Hong Kong could be a more suitable location than mainland China for issuing a stablecoin pegged to the offshore yuan. He noted that mainland China's strict capital controls would make a domestic rollout very difficult. The suggestion comes as Beijing grows concerned about the potential for U.S. dollar-backed stablecoins to reinforce American financial dominance. However, Huang also acknowledged that a stablecoin pegged to the Hong Kong dollar would ultimately still be linked to the U.S. dollar, given the existing currency peg. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>A growing number of people without diabetes are using continuous glucose monitors to track their blood sugar, revealing a common pattern known as being a "dipper." Research shows that for these individuals, blood sugar rises and then crashes below baseline levels after eating carbohydrates, which can trigger increased hunger and fatigue. Scientists suggest this may lead to consuming hundreds of extra calories throughout the day, potentially hindering weight loss. To manage these fluctuations, experts recommend pairing carbohydrates with protein and fiber, spreading carb intake throughout the day, and eating carbs last during a meal.</p>

          <p>Newark Liberty International Airport, after suffering from severe delays and cancellations in the spring, is showing signs of improved performance. In June, Newark reportedly became the most reliable of the three major New York City area airports, a significant turnaround attributed to the completion of runway construction and better air traffic control system stability. Despite the positive trend, many frequent travelers remain skeptical due to past negative experiences that have disrupted their plans. The upcoming July Fourth holiday travel period will be a major test of whether these improvements are sustainable.</p>

          <p>A new study combining genetic and archaeological data has traced the origins of Uralic-speaking peoples to Siberia, solving a long-standing linguistic and anthropological mystery. Researchers analyzed ancient DNA to map the migration of these groups across Eurasia between 4,000 and 11,000 years ago, showing how they spread from a homeland near the Ural Mountains to regions like the Baltics and East Asia. This migration also disseminated the Uralic languages, which are distinct from the Indo-European family. The findings connect the approximately 25 million modern Uralic speakers to their ancient ancestral roots.</p>

Pochettino has praised the team's newfound unity and competitive spirit, emphasizing that they are becoming a cohesive unit.

          <p>Saudi Arabian club Al-Hilal's 4-3 victory over Manchester City in the Club World Cup is being hailed as a landmark moment, challenging the perception of the Saudi Pro League as merely a destination for aging stars. The win demonstrates the growing strength of Saudi football, which has been bolstered by massive investment from the country's Public Investment Fund. Despite missing key players, Al-Hilal, a historically successful Asian club, showcased a roster of international talent capable of competing at the highest level. The result serves as a powerful statement about the shifting dynamics of global club football.</p>

          <h2>Owen Farrell Expected to Join British and Irish Lions Tour as Injury Replacement</h2>

          <p>Former England captain Owen Farrell is reportedly set to be called up to the British and Irish Lions tour of Australia as a replacement for the injured Elliot Daly. The decision is notable as Farrell, son of head coach Andy Farrell, has not played international rugby for nearly two years and recently returned from a concussion. Despite his extensive experience and credentials as a three-time Lion, the call-up is controversial given his lack of recent top-level play compared to other available contenders. Coach Andy Farrell had previously confirmed Owen was in the selection conversation.</p>

          <p>A team of Chinese researchers has developed a new blockchain technology designed to be resistant to attacks from future quantum computers. Standard blockchain security relies on encryption algorithms that could be vulnerable to the immense processing power of quantum computing, posing a significant threat to digital ledgers used in finance and supply chains. A researcher highlighted the inadequacy of current methods against such advanced threats. This new solution, developed by a team from several Chinese technology universities, aims to provide a secure, long-term framework for blockchain applications in a post-quantum world.</p>
