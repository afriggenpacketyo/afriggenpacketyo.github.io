          <p>Following its highly successful initial public offering, design software company Figma has created immense paper wealth for its key venture capital backers, including Index Ventures and Sequoia. These firms collectively hold stock valued at approximately $24 billion after shares surged 250% on the first day of trading. The IPO's success is particularly notable after a proposed $20 billion acquisition by Adobe fell through in 2023 due to regulatory opposition. This event marks a significant positive turn for the tech IPO market, which has been sluggish since late 2021, providing substantial potential returns for venture firms and their investors.

Notable moves included the Houston Astros reacquiring former star Carlos Correa from the Twins to fill an infield gap. The New York Yankees overhauled their bullpen by adding three new relievers, while the New York Mets also bolstered their pitching staff and acquired center fielder Cedric Mullins. In one of the biggest splashes, the aggressive San Diego Padres acquired seven new players, including All-Star closer Mason Miller, signaling their strong intent to compete for the division title.</p>

          <p>A federal judge in San Francisco has issued a ruling that temporarily blocks the Trump administration from ending Temporary Protected Status (TPS) for approximately 60,000 immigrants from Honduras, Nicaragua, and Nepal. The decision postpones the terminations, which were set to begin in August, until a hearing can be held in November. In her ruling, Judge Trina Thompson criticized the administration's motives, suggesting the decision was predetermined rather than based on an objective review of country conditions. This provides a temporary reprieve for individuals who have lived in the U.S. for many years under the program, which was initially granted due to natural disasters and civil unrest in their home countries.</p>

          <div class="timestamp">2025-07-31 21:07:58 EDT</div>
        </div>
        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>A new study published in the journal Cell has uncovered the surprising evolutionary origin of the potato, tracing it back to a tomato ancestor. Researchers discovered that the modern potato emerged from a hybridization event around nine million years ago between a non-tuber-producing wild potato species and an ancient tomato. This interbreeding provided the crucial genes necessary for the potato to develop its characteristic starchy tubers, solving a long-standing botanical puzzle. The findings, based on the analysis of over 500 potato genomes, demonstrate how hybridization between different species can lead to the evolution of entirely new traits and the emergence of new plant varieties.</p>

          <p>Apple announced robust financial results for its third quarter, with revenue growing 10% year-over-year to $94.04 billion, surpassing analyst expectations. The strong performance was driven by record iPhone sales and a rebound in its services division, with growth seen across most geographic regions, including Greater China. Despite the positive earnings, the company provided little new information on its artificial intelligence strategy, an area of intense investor focus. CEO Tim Cook reaffirmed the company's commitment to investing significantly in AI and integrating it across platforms, but the lack of a clear roadmap has tempered some market enthusiasm for the stock.

          <p>A statue of Robert Smalls, who escaped slavery by commandeering a Confederate ship and later became a U.S. congressman, is being created for the grounds of the South Carolina State House. This will be the first monument to honor an individual African American at the state capitol, a site currently dominated by statues of White men, many with ties to the Confederacy. The project, made possible by a bipartisan effort in the state legislature, is seen as a significant step toward a more complete representation of history. The statue will depict Smalls' journey from slavery to statesmanship, celebrating his courage and lifelong fight for civil rights and equality.</p>

          <p>Amazon reported second-quarter financial results that surpassed analyst expectations, with revenue increasing 13% to $167.7 billion. However, the stock declined in after-hours trading due to concerns over mixed third-quarter guidance and only modest revenue growth from its key cloud division, Amazon Web Services (AWS). While AWS performance was not as strong as that of its competitors, the company's advertising and e-commerce segments showed robust growth. CEO Andy Jassy also noted that supply constraints, particularly access to power, are challenging the expansion of AI services, indicating significant capital investment will continue.

          <p>The White House has announced plans to construct a new $200 million ballroom, a project long desired by President Donald Trump. The construction, which will be privately funded by Trump and other anonymous donors, is set to begin in September alongside a modernization of the East Wing. The new 90,000-square-foot facility will have a seating capacity of about 650, significantly larger than the current East Room, and will eliminate the need for temporary tents for large events like state dinners. The project aims to enhance the White House's event capabilities while preserving its historical character, with completion expected well before the end of the current presidential term.</p>

          <p>The UK government has announced a policy change that will restrict its main civil service internship program exclusively to university students from lower socio-economic backgrounds. This initiative is part of a broader effort to increase working-class representation within Whitehall and ensure the civil service better reflects the country it serves. Successful interns from the program will also be prioritized for the Fast Stream, the primary graduate entry route. The reform, driven by Cabinet Office minister Pat McFadden, aims to harness a wider range of talent and improve government decision-making by incorporating more diverse perspectives and experiences.</p>

          <p>The Los Angeles Dodgers had a relatively quiet trade deadline, making only minor additions to their roster while other National League contenders made blockbuster deals. The team acquired veteran reliever Brock Stewart and outfielder Alex Call, addressing needs in the bullpen and outfield without giving up significant prospect capital. The front office's strategy reflects their stated confidence in the current roster, which they believe is talented enough to win another World Series. Rather than making a big splash, the Dodgers are betting on the return of injured players and improved performance from their established stars to carry them through the postseason.</p>

          <p>Cole's French Dip, a historic downtown Los Angeles restaurant, has delayed its planned closure by 45 days due to an overwhelming outpouring of community support. Since announcing its closure, the establishment, which claims to have invented the French dip sandwich, has seen massive lines of customers wanting one last meal. The surge in business, combined with advocacy from local groups, allowed owner Cedd Moses to negotiate a temporary extension with the landlord. While the extension provides a brief reprieve and keeps staff employed, Moses stated it is unlikely to be permanent and is actively seeking a new buyer who will respect the landmark's legacy.</p>

          <p>After an 18-month endeavor to forge a career in American football, Welsh rugby star Louis Rees-Zammit has announced he is leaving the NFL to return to rugby union. The 24-year-old, who had spells with the Kansas City Chiefs and Jacksonville Jaguars practice squads, never played in a regular-season NFL game. In a social media post, Rees-Zammit called the experience great but stated it was time to come home and do what he does best. His decision allows him time to secure a contract and prepare for the upcoming rugby season, where he was a celebrated international player with 32 caps for Wales before his departure.</p>
