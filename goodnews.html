          <p>After weeks of anticipation, Big Bear eaglet Gizmo has successfully taken her first flight from the nest, joining her sister Sunny in exploring the world beyond. The eaglet, born in March, could be seen flapping her wings and soaring off into the air. Her first attempt looked to be unsuccessful, as she quickly latched back onto a branch, but she tried again successfully a few seconds later. While it's unclear where the young eagles will venture, they are expected to return to the nest periodically for the next one to three months before fully venturing out on their own. Sunny has continued to visit the nest since her first flight, eating and sleeping at home.</p>

          <p>Charlotte Edwards began her tenure as head coach of the England women's cricket team with a clean sweep over the West Indies, a victory that comes with a degree of caution. While the series win provides a positive start, similar success has been seen before, only for the team to falter on the bigger stages. The focus now shifts to tougher challenges ahead, including a series against India and the upcoming 50-over World Cup in India and Sri Lanka. The dominant nature of the wins has created a sense of optimism, but the real test will be whether the "new" England can perform under pressure when it truly matters.</p>

          <p>Recursion Pharmaceuticals (RXRX) experienced a significant increase in its stock price following the unveiling of Boltz-2, its next-generation AI model designed to predict binding affinity. The company claims the new model, powered by its NVIDIA supercomputer, represents a significant advancement over existing biomolecular structure prediction models. Boltz-2 aims to improve the efficiency of drug discovery by enabling researchers to identify promising molecules earlier in the process. The model is intended to simultaneously predict molecular structure and binding affinity with unprecedented speed and scale, offering R&D teams a valuable tool for prioritizing resources.

          <p>Cardiologists are warning that excessive phone scrolling, a common habit for many, can negatively impact heart health. Doomscrolling, especially when starting or ending the day, can increase anxiety, blood pressure, and sedentary behavior. This can lead to cardiometabolic conditions such as diabetes, hypertension, and obesity. Cardiologists recommend setting time limits, avoiding scrolling in bed, and replacing the habit with healthier alternatives like exercise and face-to-face interaction. The warning highlights the importance of mindful technology use for maintaining both mental and physical well-being.</p>

Bass thanked the council for coming together on the deal, which also invests in emergency response, homeless services, and other programs. The budget provides funding for six classes at the Police Academy, with the goal of ensuring the LAPD has over 8,600 officers.</p>

          <p>More than 100 dogs were rescued from an apparent puppy mill in North Carolina, where they were found living in unsanitary conditions. The SPCA of Wake County removed the dogs from a home where they were surrounded by their own waste, packed in cages, or roaming in cramped quarters. Many of the dogs were mother dogs with nursing puppies, and all are receiving medical evaluations and care. The shelter is seeking donations and foster homes to support the rescue effort. The homeowner was cooperative, and also surrendered 21 chickens.</p>
