          <h2>How Genetic Genealogy Is Being Used to Solve Decades-Old Cold Cases</h2>
          <div class="timestamp">2025-07-13 09:26:25 EDT</div>
        </div>
        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>The field of genetic genealogy, once a hobby for researching family trees, has become a powerful tool for law enforcement in solving cold cases. This article highlights the work of pioneer Barbara Rae-Venter, whose expertise helped investigators identify and capture the notorious Golden State Killer. By building family trees from DNA evidence found at crime scenes, researchers like Rae-Venter can narrow down suspect pools and provide crucial leads. The technique has since been used to solve numerous other long-unsolved crimes, including a nearly three-decade-old case of sexual assault in Ohio.</p>

          <div class="timestamp">2025-07-13 09:08:35 EDT</div>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Two Chinese satellites, Shijian-21 and Shijian-25, appear to have successfully docked in geostationary orbit, a maneuver that likely constitutes a historic autonomous satellite refueling mission. According to the US-based space awareness firm COMSPOC, the two probes were observed visually merged for several days after conducting a series of close-proximity operations. This technological feat, which the United States has not yet accomplished, demonstrates a significant advancement in China's space capabilities. The operation allows for extending the lifespan of satellites and has potential dual-use military applications, and was reportedly monitored by U.S. surveillance satellites.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>This profile explores the career and recent cultural resurgence of Pamela Anderson, arguing that her appeal goes far beyond her famous image from 'Baywatch' and Playboy. The article draws parallels to Marilyn Monroe, noting a sacrificial quality in how she has navigated public life, especially after the violation of her stolen private tape in the 1990s. Now at 58, Anderson is experiencing a renaissance, marked by a serious film role in 'The Last Showgirl' and a widely praised decision to stop wearing makeup. Her journey is framed as a triumph of personal strength and vulnerability over public exploitation.</p>

          <p>UK Transport Secretary Heidi Alexander has announced that the government will introduce measures to make electric cars cheaper to purchase, aiming to encourage more drivers to switch from petrol and diesel vehicles. While details are forthcoming, the move addresses the significant upfront cost of EVs, which is a major barrier to adoption. The announcement coincides with a new £25 million investment to help install curbside charging points for households without driveways. The policy is part of a broader strategy to meet the UK's 2030 ban on new petrol and diesel car sales.</p>

          <p>A 54-pound meteorite, confirmed to be the largest piece of the planet Mars ever discovered on Earth, is set to be auctioned at Sotheby's in New York with an estimated price of $2 million to $4 million. The rock is believed to have been ejected from the Martian surface by an asteroid impact before crashing into the Sahara desert. Representing nearly 7% of all known Martian material on our planet, its origin was confirmed by a specialized lab that compared its chemical composition to data from the 1976 Viking space probe. The rare find is a significant object for collectors and scientific institutions.</p>

          <p>Researchers conducting a sonar survey of the Fox River in Wisconsin have accidentally discovered the remains of a 19th-century shipwreck. The team from the Wisconsin Historical Society was mapping other known cultural sites when their high-resolution sonar revealed the partially buried hull of a different vessel. The wreck is believed to be the L.W. Crane, a 90-foot wooden paddle wheel steamer that caught fire and sank in 1880 while transporting passengers and freight. The unexpected find highlights the potential for new archaeological discoveries, even in well-traveled waterways, and further investigation is ongoing.</p>

          <p>Researchers at the Chinese Academy of Sciences have developed a novel biotransformation system that can convert methanol into sucrose, or common white sugar. Because methanol can be synthesized from captured carbon dioxide, this breakthrough offers a potential pathway to turn a primary greenhouse gas into a food source. The method bypasses the need for traditional agriculture like sugar cane, which requires significant land and water resources. The scientists say this artificial conversion strategy could help address both environmental challenges and future food security needs, contributing to global carbon neutrality goals.</p>

          <p>After years of patient complaints being minimized, the medical establishment is finally acknowledging and addressing the significant pain many experience during IUD insertions. This article explores why women's pain has historically been dismissed and how a recent push, fueled by social media testimonials, is changing practices. In the last year, both the CDC and the American College of Obstetricians and Gynecologists have issued new recommendations urging doctors to have thorough conversations about pain management. This includes utilizing options beyond ibuprofen, such as topical anesthetics and nerve-blocking shots, to make the procedure more tolerable.</p>

          <p>While the NFL has committed to sending players for flag football's debut in the 2028 Los Angeles Olympics, Major League Baseball remains hesitant to allow its stars to participate. This article argues that MLB is missing a massive global marketing opportunity by not committing to what could be a "Dream Team"-level event for baseball. Despite top players like Shohei Ohtani and Aaron Judge expressing a desire to play, logistical issues and the league's preference for its own World Baseball Classic appear to be holding up a decision. The author contends that forgoing the Olympics would be a short-sighted mistake for the sport's growth.</p>

          <p>California is creating its first-ever cabinet-level agency dedicated exclusively to housing and homelessness, a move supporters say is long overdue for a state grappling with soaring housing costs. Governor Gavin Newsom's reorganization plan splits the unwieldy Business, Consumer Services and Housing Agency into two entities. The new housing agency aims to streamline the state's complex and fragmented network of affordable housing funding programs. While the move elevates housing to the highest level of state government, critics question whether the bureaucratic shuffle will effectively tackle the high cost of construction and the root causes of the crisis.</p>
