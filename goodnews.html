        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>A new agri-food deal between the UK and the EU is poised to reverse a ban on British-grown plants being sold in Northern Ireland, a move hailed as "long overdue" by Robin Mercer, a garden centre owner in County Down. The deal aims to align the UK with EU plant health rules, which should alleviate trade barriers that have increased costs and reduced plant selection since Brexit. While described as a "political declaration" requiring further legal negotiation, the Horticultural Trades Association anticipates the deal will boost the range of plants and products available while also streamlining delivery times for retailers across the UK.</p>

          <p>William Goodge, a 31-year-old British ultra-endurance athlete, claims to have broken the world record for the fastest run across Australia, completing the 3,800km journey in 35 days. The article details how Goodge ran the equivalent of two-and-a-half marathons daily, starting from Cottesloe Beach in Perth and finishing at Bondi Beach. Goodge began running marathons after his mother's death from cancer in 2018, using this run to raise money for cancer charities in the UK, US, and Australia. Guinness World Records has yet to verify the record, but the article mentions challenges Goodge faced, including dust storms, injuries, and hallucinations.</p>

        </div>
        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Japan's animation industry is increasingly adopting AI technology, driven by permissive copyright laws and a labor shortage, despite concerns from artists about copyright infringement and job displacement. The article notes that Japan's copyright act allows the use of copyrighted materials to train AI tools without the copyright holder's consent, aiming to attract AI investors. While some studios are using AI to assist with tasks like coloring and background generation, artists worry about losing their jobs, with a survey indicating that 60% fear job losses to AI. Despite these concerns, the integration of AI is seen as a potential solution to fill gaps in the anime industry, which faces unattractive working conditions and a shrinking population of young artists.</p>
