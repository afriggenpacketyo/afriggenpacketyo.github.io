          <h2>Global Recognition of Palestinian Statehood Grows Amid Shifting Western Policies</h2>

          <p>An increasing number of nations now officially recognize Palestine as a state, with a recent UN General Assembly vote showing overwhelming support for a two-state solution. Several Western countries, including the UK, France, and Canada, have recently announced plans to formally recognize Palestine, signaling a significant policy shift that has angered Israeli officials. Despite this growing international consensus, Palestine's bid for full UN membership remains blocked by a U.S. veto in the Security Council. The recognition from 147 countries underscores a long-standing diplomatic effort, which has gained new momentum amid the ongoing conflict in the region.</p>

          <p>A man suspected of directing the deadly 1982 gun and grenade attack on the Jo Goldenberg Jewish restaurant in Paris has been arrested by Palestinian authorities in the West Bank. Mahmoud Khader Abed Adra is accused of terrorist murder for his role in the assault, which killed six people and injured over 20. French President Emmanuel Macron praised the cooperation with the Palestinian Authority and stated that efforts are underway to secure his swift extradition. The arrest marks a significant development in a case that has remained unsolved for over four decades, with a trial expected next year.</p>

          <p>A federal judge has dismissed President Donald Trump's $15 billion defamation lawsuit against The New York Times, labeling the lengthy filing as "decidedly improper and impermissible." The judge criticized the 85-page complaint for containing excessive political rhetoric and praise for the president rather than focusing on legal claims. While tossing the suit, the judge granted Trump's legal team 28 days to refile a more concise and professional complaint, limited to 40 pages. A spokesperson for The Times welcomed the ruling, stating the original complaint was a political document, not a serious legal filing.</p>

          <p>Yevgeny Savin, a former professional footballer turned popular Russian YouTuber, has found remarkable success after re-establishing his football club in Cyprus. Savin fled Russia in 2022 after publicly condemning the invasion of Ukraine, a move that led to him being charged with "discrediting" the Russian army. He purchased a license for a second-division club in Ypsonas, a suburb of Limassol, and renamed it Krasava ENY Ypsonas. With his own investment and sponsorship, the club has since earned promotion to Cyprus's top football league, uniting a diverse fanbase of immigrants from post-Soviet countries.</p>

          <p>Elon Musk's artificial intelligence startup, xAI, is reportedly in the process of raising $10 billion from investors, a deal that would value the company at $200 billion. This fundraising effort highlights the continued surge in valuations for companies developing foundational AI models, following similar large-scale investments in competitors like Anthropic and OpenAI. The new capital is expected to fund the construction of massive data centers and the acquisition of AI chips needed to develop next-generation AI. The high valuation comes despite controversies surrounding its Grok chatbot and its perceived performance gap compared to rivals.</p>

          <p>After months of delays, the Senate has confirmed Mike Waltz, President Trump's former national security adviser, to serve as the U.S. ambassador to the United Nations. The 47-to-43 vote fills a critical diplomatic post that had been vacant for eight months. Waltz's confirmation comes just before the annual U.N. General Assembly gathering in New York. During his confirmation hearing, Waltz stated that the U.N. needs major reform but emphasized the importance of U.S. participation to resolve global conflicts and counter China's growing influence within the international body.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>The Federal Reserve's first interest rate cut since late 2024 has provided relief to the mortgage market, with the average 30-year fixed rate falling to around 6.13%. This reduction translates into substantial savings for homebuyers, as the monthly payment on a $750,000 mortgage is now over $450 less than it was at the start of 2025. Over the life of the loan, this difference could save a borrower more than $160,000 in interest. The move enhances affordability for new buyers and creates attractive refinancing opportunities for existing homeowners. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>Minneapolis Federal Reserve President Neel Kashkari has called for two additional interest rate cuts this year, arguing that the inflationary effects of President Trump's tariffs are likely to be a temporary, one-time event. In his view, this limited long-term pressure on inflation, combined with a weakening labor market, provides the central bank with room to ease monetary policy further. Kashkari, who does not have a vote on the policy-setting committee this year, expressed his growing confidence that the economy can accommodate lower rates without triggering persistent inflation above the Fed's 2% target.

          <p>Scientists have identified a new species of butterfly, named Francis's gorgeous sapphire, in the remote, high-altitude forests of Angola's Namba Mountains. The vivid blue butterfly was discovered during a 2023 expedition in a rugged, boulder-strewn habitat. Researchers note that the species is dependent on mistletoe plants that are vulnerable to the increasing frequency of fires in the region, a threat exacerbated by climate change. The discovery highlights the rich biodiversity of the area while also underscoring the urgent need for conservation efforts to protect its unique ecosystems from environmental pressures.</p>

The framework includes the creation of a new Legacy Commission with independent oversight and a cross-border body for information retrieval, reflecting principles from the 2014 Stormont House Agreement. Irish Deputy Prime Minister Simon Harris described the deal as a "big step forward" and an honest attempt to provide justice for victims, though he acknowledged that trust is low.
