          <p>The U.S. Supreme Court has permitted a transgender male student in South Carolina to continue using the boys' restroom at his school while his legal case proceeds. The court denied an emergency request from state officials to enforce a policy that prohibits transgender students from using facilities aligned with their gender identity. This decision temporarily blocks the state's rule as it applies to this specific student, who is challenging the law as a violation of the Constitution's Equal Protection Clause and Title IX. Justices Thomas, Alito, and Gorsuch noted their dissent from the court's unsigned order.</p>

          <p>The U.S. Forest Service is reversing its long-standing policy and will now provide N95 masks to federal firefighters to protect them from hazardous smoke. For decades, the agency had banned their use, citing concerns about heat exhaustion, despite growing evidence of long-term health risks like cancer for firefighters. The policy change follows criticism and reporting that highlighted how other wildfire-prone nations already provide such protection. This decision is seen by advocates as an implicit acknowledgment of the health dangers posed by smoke inhalation during increasingly intense fire seasons.</p>

          <p>Former soccer star and presenter Gary Lineker achieved a major upset at the UK's National Television Awards by winning the award for Best TV Presenter. This victory ended the unprecedented 23-year winning streak held by the popular duo Ant and Dec in that category. Lineker, who recently departed the BBC's "Match of the Day" program after 26 years, suggested his win might be linked to his outspokenness on social issues. In his acceptance speech, he said the prize "demonstrates that it is OK to use your platform to speak up on behalf of those who have no voice."</p>

          <p>AT&T CEO John Stankey has stated that the era of massive "super cycles" for iPhone sales may be over unless Apple introduces significant advancements, particularly in artificial intelligence. Speaking at a conference, Stankey argued that new hardware releases no longer generate the same level of consumer frenzy, as devices have become more driven by incremental software improvements. He suggested that without a compelling leap forward in AI capabilities that differentiate it from competitors like Google and Samsung, the upcoming iPhone 17 risks being seen as just a marginal upgrade, reflecting investor concerns.</p>

          <h2>Japanese Study Shows High Potential for 'Agrivoltaics' with Solar Panels Over Rice Paddies</h2>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>A pilot study in Japan has demonstrated the significant potential of agrivoltaics, the practice of installing solar panels over active farmland. Researchers from the University of Tokyo placed solar panels above rice paddies, finding they could generate substantial electricity while having a minimal impact on crop yields. After adjustments, the rice harvest reached 85% of a traditional field's output while meeting top quality standards, and the panels produced enough electricity to power over five households for a year. This innovative approach addresses land scarcity by allowing for dual use, providing farmers extra income and advancing clean energy.</p>

          <p>Oracle co-founder Larry Ellison briefly overtook Elon Musk as the world's wealthiest person after a massive surge in Oracle's stock price. Ellison's net worth climbed to $393 billion, edging past Musk's $385 billion, according to the Bloomberg Billionaires Index, though Musk later reclaimed the top spot. The stock jump was fueled by Oracle's extremely positive outlook for its cloud infrastructure and artificial intelligence businesses. Ellison, a prominent ally of President Donald Trump, has also been involved in potential acquisitions of TikTok and Paramount, expanding his influence beyond the tech industry.</p>

          <p>Nearly two decades after its release, former Vogue editor-in-chief Anna Wintour has finally offered her opinion on the 2006 film "The Devil Wears Prada," which was famously based on her leadership style. Wintour called the movie a "fair shot," praising its humor, wit, and Meryl Streep's "fantastic" performance as the demanding editor Miranda Priestly. She recalled attending the premiere wearing Prada but being unaware of the film's plot. The comments come as a sequel to the film is reportedly in production with a 2026 release date.</p>

          <p>Oracle's stock experienced its best day since 1992, soaring nearly 36% and adding $244 billion to its market capitalization. The historic rally was triggered by the company's announcement of a staggering $455 billion in remaining performance obligations, far exceeding analyst expectations. This massive backlog is driven by intense demand for Oracle's cloud infrastructure, which is crucial for running the large workloads required by artificial intelligence companies. The surge signaled strong investor confidence in Oracle's position as a key player in the booming AI sector. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>NASA scientists have announced that a rock sample collected by the Perseverance rover on Mars contains "potential biosignatures," representing the closest the agency has come to finding evidence of ancient life on the planet. The sample, taken from an ancient river valley in the Jezero Crater, exhibits textures and mineral compositions that, on Earth, are often byproducts of microbial life consuming organic matter. While researchers cannot completely rule out non-biological origins, they are excited by the finding. The discovery intensifies the push for a mission to bring the rocks to Earth for definitive analysis.</p>

          <p>A weekend bus strike that was expected to disrupt dozens of routes across London has been mostly called off after a majority of workers accepted a new pay offer. Members of the Unite union employed by London United voted to accept the deal, canceling their planned walkout. However, a smaller group of workers from London Transit are still in negotiations, and if no agreement is reached, a few routes in the city may still face industrial action. The resolution averts wider travel chaos for Londoners, who have already faced significant disruption from other transport strikes.</p>
