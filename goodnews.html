        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Shares of Inditex, the parent company of Zara, experienced a decline of over 6% following the release of weaker-than-anticipated quarterly sales figures. The company reported revenues of 8.27 billion euros for the fiscal first quarter, falling short of the 8.39 billion euros projected by analysts. Furthermore, Inditex indicated a slower start to summer sales, with a 6% increase compared to the previous year's 12% growth, reflecting broader economic uncertainty. The company is closely monitoring the impact of tariffs on consumer spending, particularly in the U.S., its second-largest market. Optimism may be tempered due to broader market uncertainty and slower sales. </p>

          <p>Elon Musk publicly apologized for certain social media posts directed at Donald Trump, acknowledging that they "went too far." This statement follows a public dispute that dissolved a partnership where Musk spearheaded the Department of Government Efficiency under Trump's administration. The conflict originated from Musk's disagreement with the Trump-backed "One Big Beautiful Bill Act" tax and spending bill. Musk had also accused Trump of being mentioned in the "files" of the late sexual offender Jeffrey Epstein, which the White House disputed. The initial conflict led Trump to suggest terminating government contracts and subsidies awarded to Musk's companies. </p>

          <p>Asia is progressively reducing its reliance on the U.S. dollar due to geopolitical uncertainties, monetary shifts, and currency hedging, leading to de-dollarization in the region.

The shift is fueled by the recognition that the dollar can be leveraged in trade negotiations, prompting a reevaluation of overweight U.S. dollar portfolios. Asian economies are seeking to reduce reliance on the greenback to lower FX risks by using their own currencies as a medium of exchange. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>English amateur golfer Tyler Weaver is making his major debut at the US Open at Oakmont, where he is learning from Brooks Koepka. Weaver's brother, Max, will be his caddie, and his parents will be supporting him throughout the event. He qualified for the US Open after a strong performance in Atlanta and has been practicing alongside Koepka, who has emphasized the importance of avoiding double bogeys. Weaver aims to make the cut and potentially contend, while also cherishing the opportunity to be with his family. </p>
