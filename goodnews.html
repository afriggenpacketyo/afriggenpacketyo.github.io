          <p>The much-anticipated mystery band at the Glastonbury Festival was revealed to be the iconic Britpop group Pulp, delighting a massive crowd. Frontman Jarvis Cocker led the band through a nostalgic set that included classics like "Sorted for E's & Wizz" and "Common People," marking the 30th anniversary of their historic 1995 headline performance. Despite attempts to keep their appearance a secret, the performance was widely rumored and served as a celebratory moment for fans.

          <p>McLaren's Lando Norris secured a stunning pole position for the Austrian Grand Prix, outpacing the field by over half a second. The British driver described his lap as "close to perfection" and said he felt like "the old me back," a reference to his struggles with qualifying earlier in the season. The performance comes after McLaren introduced key car upgrades, including a revised front suspension designed to improve his feel for the car. With his championship-leading teammate Oscar Piastri starting third, Norris is in a prime position to gain ground in the drivers' standings at the Red Bull Ring.</p>

          <p>Chrysler is recalling more than 250,000 of its 2022-2025 Pacifica and Voyager minivans due to a potential issue with their side curtain airbags. According to the National Highway Traffic Safety Administration, improperly sealed seams on the airbags may prevent them from holding enough pressure during deployment in certain crashes, increasing injury risk. The company stated it is not aware of any accidents or injuries related to the defect. Dealers will inspect the vehicles and replace the side curtain airbags for free if necessary, and owners are being urged to follow the instructions on their recall notices.</p>

          <p>Indian opener Smriti Mandhana scored a brilliant maiden T20 international century, leading her team to a commanding 97-run victory over England at Trent Bridge. Mandhana's explosive 112 from 62 balls propelled India to a formidable total of 210-5, the second-highest score England has ever conceded in the format. England's chase faltered early, and they were ultimately bowled out for 113, with captain Nat Sciver-Brunt's 66 being the only significant resistance. The comprehensive defeat serves as a stark reality check for England at the start of the five-match series against a powerful Indian side.</p>

          <p>An estimated 100,000 people participated in the Budapest Pride march, defying a government ban in what organizers called the largest such event in Hungary's history. The march served as a powerful rebuke to Prime Minister Viktor Orb√°n's government, which passed a law in March outlawing events that "promote" homosexuality to minors. The ban is part of a broader crackdown on LGBTQ+ rights and democratic freedoms under Orb√°n's rule. The massive turnout, supported by the city's mayor and international officials, symbolized a growing resistance against the government's increasingly repressive policies ahead of next year's elections.</p>

The reopening marks a significant moment of recovery for the beloved Southern California cultural institution, which is now operating on a limited schedule.</p>

          <p>The J.M. Smucker Co. has announced its commitment to remove artificial colors from its entire product portfolio, including brands like Hostess, by the end of 2027. This move also extends to removing synthetic dyes from foods sold to schools a year earlier. While many of its products are already free from these additives, some items like sugar-free jams and certain Hostess snacks still contain them. Smucker's decision aligns with a broader industry trend, as other major food companies like Nestle and Kraft Heinz have made similar pledges amid heightened regulatory scrutiny of artificial food dyes.</p>

The win, however, was marred by a potential injury to Welsh scrum-half Tomos Williams, who left the field with a tight hamstring, creating concern for the squad's depth in that key position. Coach Andy Farrell praised the team's creative play, led by fly-half Finn Russell, but also noted a high penalty count in the first half that needs to be addressed.

The massive haul, with an estimated street value of ¬£96 million, was discovered hidden beneath shipping containers on a vessel that had arrived from Panama. Specialist Border Force officers located the shipment after receiving intelligence. Officials stated that container ships are a primary method for criminal organizations to smuggle drugs into the UK, which is one of Europe's largest cocaine markets.
