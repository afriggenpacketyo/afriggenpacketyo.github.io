          <p>Air Canada is set to gradually resume its flight operations after reaching a mediated agreement with the Canadian Union of Public Employees (CUPE), ending a multi-day strike by its 10,000 flight attendants. The labor dispute, centered on demands for higher wages and compensation for groundwork, had caused the cancellation of hundreds of flights and affected nearly 500,000 passengers. While the first flights are scheduled to resume Tuesday evening, the airline has advised that a full return to regular service could take up to ten days.</p>

          <p>Despite recent market volatility, a Fidelity Investments study shows that many investors remain confident, though seasoned investors are more cautious than newer ones. Certified financial planner Tim Maurer advises that all investors should be "always calibrating" their risk tolerance based on their long-term goals and changing life circumstances. Experts recommend maintaining a well-diversified portfolio, utilizing low-cost vehicles like ETFs to gain broad market exposure, and considering buffer ETFs for downside protection during periods of potential economic headwinds.

The airline stated there was a "reaction near the engine" caused by a disturbance in airflow, prompting a controlled shutdown of the engine. None of the 273 passengers or eight crew members were injured, though some had to spend the night at the airport due to limited hotel capacity before another aircraft completed the journey.</p>

          <p>Excel Dryer, a Massachusetts-based manufacturer of electric hand dryers, has successfully transitioned to a supply chain sourced entirely from American-made parts, a goal its owner pursued for years. The decision was reinforced by the Trump administration's tariffs on Chinese goods, which created significant business risks for companies reliant on offshore manufacturing. After an eight-year search for a domestic motor supplier, the company achieved its 100% domestic sourcing goal in 2023, illustrating a strategic shift away from globalized production in response to geopolitical and economic pressures.</p>

        </div>
        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>This article explores the history of the thong, revealing its creation as a political statement by Austrian-born designer Rudi Gernreich in 1974. Gernreich, a gay man and early LGBTQ+ rights activist, designed the minimal garment in protest of a ban on nude bathing at a Los Angeles beach. His work, including the topless "monokini," was driven by a philosophy of liberating the body from sexual hang-ups and promoting unisex fashion. The thong's origin was not about sexualization but about challenging societal prudery and advocating for bodily freedom.</p>

The claim follows a contentious dispute where the UK Home Office issued a notice under the Investigatory Powers Act, prompting a legal challenge from Apple and criticism from U.S. officials, including President Trump.

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>This article examines the recent explosion in popularity of matcha, the finely ground Japanese green tea, questioning why it has become a mainstream phenomenon nearly a decade after its initial, more niche introduction in the US. The current trend is largely driven by social media, where matcha's aesthetic qualities and the ritual of its preparation are highly visible. Unlike its first wave, the current craze sees matcha heavily customized with sugars and syrups, making it more palatable to a wider audience and transforming it into a symbol of individualized wellness and online cultural consensus.</p>

          <p>Spike Lee's latest film, "Highest 2 Lowest," is a remake of Akira Kurosawa's "High and Low," starring Denzel Washington as a successful music producer facing a moral dilemma when his chauffeur's son is kidnapped by mistake. The movie review suggests the film serves as a self-aware satire, with Lee examining what happens when a creative force, much like himself, risks becoming stale and disconnected from the streets that once inspired him. While the film's beginning is noted as choppy, it builds into a compelling thriller that reconnects its protagonist with a grittier reality.</p>

          <p>A growing cohort of men, both gay and straight, are choosing to become single fathers through surrogacy or adoption, a demographic that was virtually nonexistent two decades ago. This trend reflects shifting societal norms, rising singlehood rates, and a reprioritization of life goals, particularly since the pandemic. For many, fatherhood offers a profound sense of purpose and connection, prompting them to navigate the complex and expensive legal and medical processes involved. The phenomenon highlights changing perspectives on masculinity, family structures, and the deep-seated desire for parenthood.</p>
