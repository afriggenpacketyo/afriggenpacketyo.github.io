          <p>In Kiruna, Sweden, a massive 113-year-old Sami-style Lutheran church, Kiruna Church, was successfully transported three miles from its original location. This extraordinary relocation is part of a multi-year project to move the entire town center, as the expanding iron-ore mine nearby has rendered the ground unstable. The complex engineering feat involved carefully driving the historic structure to its new site. This significant undertaking ensures the preservation of a cherished cultural landmark while accommodating the vital industrial operations that underpin the town's economy, showcasing innovative solutions to urban development challenges.</p>

        </div>
        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>The European Union and the U.S. have outlined a framework trade deal designed to lower tariffs on various sectors, including cars and pharmaceuticals, with most EU exports facing a 15% U.S. tariff. This rate is significantly lower than previously threatened by President Trump but still higher than pre-Trump levels. The agreement is expected to retroactively lower car tariffs to 15% once the EU begins legislative processes to reduce its tariffs on U.S. industrial goods. However, the lucrative European wine and spirits industry was not exempted from tariffs, causing disappointment among exporters despite ongoing commitment for future talks.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Sales of previously owned homes in the U.S. rose 2% in July, surpassing expectations and showing a slight increase compared to the previous year. The market is experiencing its highest inventory levels since May 2020, which is beginning to ease upward pressure on prices, with the median home price increasing by only 0.2% annually. Despite two years of continuous price growth, the market may be nearing an inflection point, as wage growth now comfortably outpaces home price increases. This shift, coupled with a rise in all-cash transactions and longer selling times, suggests evolving dynamics for both buyers and sellers. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>Washington D.C. has reported a murder-free week, a development following President Donald Trump's federalization of the city's police on August 11. Attorney General Pam Bondi announced 77 more arrests by federal law enforcement agencies on Wednesday, bringing the total to 630 arrests and 86 illegal gun confiscations since the crackdown began. This controversial federal intervention, which also involved National Guard troops, aims to address the city's rising crime rates. Proponents argue local leadership has been ineffective, while critics express fury over the federalization of local policing.</p>

          <p>President Donald Trump has agreed to limit tariffs on pharmaceuticals and semiconductors from the European Union to 15%, backing down from previous threats of much higher rates up to 250%. This agreement is part of a broader U.S.-EU trade framework that sets a 15% tariff on most EU exports. In return, the EU is expected to pass legislation to reduce its tariffs on all U.S. industrial goods to zero, which will also trigger a reduction in U.S. car tariffs on EU imports. The deal aims to provide stability in transatlantic trade, though wine and spirits remain excluded from tariff exemptions.</p>

          <p>Walmart has increased its full-year sales and earnings outlook, driven by strong online growth and resilient consumer spending, despite acknowledging rising costs from tariffs. The retail giant topped quarterly sales estimates but missed on earnings due to one-time expenses. CEO Doug McMillon noted that middle- and lower-income households are more sensitive to tariff-related price increases in discretionary categories. Walmart is working to mitigate tariff impacts through strategies like speeding up imports and offering discounts, maintaining its value reputation and attracting higher-income households, distinguishing its performance from struggling competitors like Target.

          <p>A New York appeals court has significantly reduced the civil fraud judgment against Donald Trump, his family, and his company, overturning the initial $454 million penalty as an excessive fine. While the court affirmed that Trump engaged in fraud by inflating his net worth for business advantage, it found the financial penalty unconstitutional. This ruling offers a major reprieve to Trump, sparing him from a half-billion-dollar payment, though it upholds a temporary ban on him and his sons from corporate leadership. The decision, stemming from a sharply divided appellate panel, allows for potential further appeals to the state's highest court, ensuring the legal saga continues.</p>

          <p>Financial experts suggest that home equity loans can be a strategic tool for saving money in the current high-interest rate environment, particularly for consolidating high-rate credit card debt. By converting variable-rate debt into a fixed-rate loan secured by home equity, borrowers can significantly reduce interest payments and improve cash flow. Additionally, using these loans for home improvements that increase property value can offer combined benefits of a low fixed rate, increased home equity, and potential tax deductibility on interest. However, experts caution against using home equity for luxury purchases or if it significantly reduces home equity below 20%. (not investment advice)</p>
