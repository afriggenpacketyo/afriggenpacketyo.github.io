        </div>
        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Energy regulator Ofgem has announced that energy bills in England, Scotland, and Wales will decrease by 7% in July, marking the first drop in a year, which translates to an annual saving of ¬£129 for a typical household. While this decrease is welcome news, charities emphasize that many individuals are still struggling with energy costs, owing approximately ¬£4 billion to suppliers. The drop reflects a fall in international wholesale gas prices, but energy prices remain high overall, and further support is needed for vulnerable families. Standing charges continue to be a point of contention as well, as they add to the overall financial burden for consumers.</p>

          <p>A man in Norway awoke to find a 135-meter container ship had run aground and crashed into his front garden, narrowly missing his house. The Cypriot-flagged cargo ship, NCL Salten, carrying 16 people, went off course in the Trondheim Fjord while traveling southwest to Orkanger. No injuries were reported, and Norwegian police are investigating the incident's cause. The head of NCL called it a "serious incident" and expressed gratitude that no one was injured, noting that the company is awaiting the results of the investigation by authorities. The ship had previously run aground in 2023 but was able to free itself.</p>

The US Treasury anticipates annual savings of $56 million in material costs once the penny is phased out. Made from zinc with a copper coating, the penny costs more to produce than its face value, with production costs nearing four cents per penny. While some argue the penny is useful for charity drives, others advocate for rounding up prices to eliminate the need for the coin.</p>

          <p>The Trump administration is reinstating in-person training at the National Fire Academy in Emmitsburg, Maryland, reversing a decision made in March to pause on-site classes. The Federal Emergency Management Agency (FEMA) initially halted the classes, citing that the government would no longer pay for travel for programs not deemed "mission critical." However, a comprehensive review led to the restoration of certain courses, as FEMA recognized their effectiveness in training. The decision is a relief for Emmitsburg, where the academy is a vital part of the community and local economy.</p>
