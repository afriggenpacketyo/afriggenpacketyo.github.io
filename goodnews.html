          <h2>Tennessee Biologists Assess Fish Populations Post-Hurricane Helene</h2>
          <div class="timestamp">2025-05-01 23:15:47 EDT</div>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Marine biologists with the Tennessee Valley Authority are surveying fish populations in Douglas Lake for the first time since Hurricane Helene impacted East Tennessee waterways seven months ago. The study aims to determine if excessive debris from the hurricane has negatively affected the sport fish population by comparing current data to surveys from the past 30 years, looking for deformities or injuries. Structures like debris can provide fish a place to lay eggs, hunt and feed, so the disruption of the shoreline habitat may force fish to find a new place to congregate. Sport fishing accounts for about 80% of tourism in the area, bringing in hundreds of thousands of dollars a year.</p>

          <p>Japan and the United States have agreed to accelerate tariff talks, aiming for a mutually beneficial agreement possibly by June, following progress in discussions. Ryosei Akazawa, Japan's chief negotiator, stated that ministerial discussions will intensify from mid-May after preliminary talks, focusing on non-tariff barriers and economic security cooperation. While emphasizing Japan's commitment to protecting its national interests, Akazawa acknowledged the possibility of a deal during a potential meeting between Prime Minister Ishigeru Ishiba and President Trump at the G7 summit in Canada. Japan is considering increasing purchases of U.S. corn and soybeans and simplifying screening processes for imported cars as part of the negotiations.</p>

          <p>Billionaire industrialist Charles Koch made a rare public appearance to accept an award from the Cato Institute, using the opportunity to indirectly criticize President Trump's policies. Koch, a long-time influential figure in Republican politics, expressed concern over the abandonment of core principles like free markets, particularly highlighting his disapproval of tariffs. While his political influence has waned since Trump's election, Koch's financial resources remain significant, with his political group announcing a $20 million campaign to encourage the renewal of Trump's 2017 tax cuts. Koch's speech underscores the ongoing tension between traditional libertarian ideals and the current direction of the Republican Party.</p>

          <p>President Trump has removed Mike Waltz from his position as national security advisor, nominating him as ambassador to the United Nations. Secretary of State Marco Rubio will temporarily replace Waltz while continuing his duties as America's top diplomat. Waltz faced criticism for mistakenly adding a journalist to a chat group where sensitive military plans were discussed, which likely influenced the decision. Sources indicate Trump respects Waltz but also perceived issues with his vetting of National Security Council staff. Some officials suggest the administration believed Waltz might struggle to be confirmed by the Senate, allowing for his complete removal without direct firing.</p>

Apple's sales in China fell 2.3% in the last quarter, while overall earnings and revenue increased.
