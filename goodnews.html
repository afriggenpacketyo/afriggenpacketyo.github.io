          <p>The Crown Prosecution Service has dropped charges against Christopher Cash and Christopher Berry, who were accused of spying for China under the Official Secrets Act. The two men, one a former parliamentary researcher, had denied providing information prejudicial to state interests between late 2021 and early 2023. The case, which Beijing had labeled as "malicious slander," was scheduled for trial in October but will no longer proceed. The reasons for the charges being dropped were not detailed in the article.</p>

          <p>Africa's engagement in space technology has evolved from hosting foreign infrastructure to developing its own satellites and programs tailored to continental needs, such as improving connectivity and managing agriculture. The recently inaugurated African Space Agency (AfSA) in Cairo aims to foster collaboration among nations with varying levels of space expertise, from established programs in Nigeria and Egypt to newer ones in Kenya and Rwanda. This shift emphasizes using space as a practical tool for development, with significant partnerships forming with both Europe and China to advance these goals.</p>

The renovation aims to transform the museum into a dynamic space for learning about racial justice and democracy, featuring exhibits on the Reconstruction era and a more personal look at Dr. Martin Luther King Jr. The reopening is scheduled for November 8th.</p>

          <p>In an opinion piece, former Vice President Mike Pence marks the fifth anniversary of the Abraham Accords, highlighting them as a historic achievement of the Trump administration. He argues the accords, which normalized relations between Israel and several Arab nations, have proven resilient, even after the October 7th attacks, and have spurred billions in trade and tourism. Pence criticizes the Biden administration for not expanding the circle of peace and urges the current Trump administration to prioritize bringing Saudi Arabia into the agreement. He asserts that peace is achieved through strength and uniting against common threats.</p>

          <p>A significant number of U.S. lawmakers, currently 10 senators and 27 House members, have announced they will not run for their current seats in 2026, setting a record. The departures are more numerous on the Republican side, with 27 indicating they will leave Washington or seek other offices. Some retirements, like those of Sens. Mitch McConnell and Thom Tillis, involve figures who have clashed with President Trump. The wave of exits comes as the GOP holds slim majorities in both chambers, creating potential challenges for the party in the upcoming election cycle.</p>

          <h2>Experts Question Claims of Magnesium Lotion as a Sleep Aid, Citing Lack of Scientific Evidence</h2>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>The trend of using topical magnesium lotion to improve sleep, a craze popularized on social media, lacks scientific backing according to medical experts. Dermatologists point out that the skin is a barrier, not a sponge, and there is little proof that magnesium can be effectively absorbed through it. Any perceived benefits are more likely attributable to the act of massage or the moisturizing properties of the lotion itself. While sleep experts say the lotion is likely harmless and may offer a powerful placebo effect, they do not recommend it over medically proven treatments for sleep conditions.</p>

          <p>President Trump is set to receive an unprecedented second state visit to the United Kingdom, a diplomatic move seen as leveraging his personal admiration for the royal family. Trump's fascination, partly influenced by his mother's fondness for Queen Elizabeth II, provides the British government with an opportunity to exert soft power on key issues like support for Ukraine. The visit, which will include a state banquet at Windsor Castle and meetings with King Charles, is a significant diplomatic gesture despite Trump's general unpopularity in the UK.</p>

          <p>President Donald Trump's second state visit to the UK, hosted by King Charles III at Windsor Castle, is a highly choreographed event steeped in royal protocol. The visit includes a carriage procession, a military parade, and a formal dinner, all designed as a "royal charm offensive" to strengthen the US-UK relationship. Such events are a minefield of etiquette, and past presidential visits have been noted for minor breaches, such as Trump walking ahead of Queen Elizabeth II in 2019. Despite the focus on ceremony, the visit serves a key diplomatic purpose amid the current geopolitical landscape.</p>

          <p>The successful $17 billion initial public offering of Swedish fintech giant Klarna has renewed speculation about which other major private fintech companies might go public next. Industry analysts point to digital payments firm Stripe and digital bank Revolut as leading candidates, both of which have achieved massive private valuations. Other contenders in the pipeline include British neobanks Monzo and Starling Bank. Klarna's strong debut performance is seen as a positive signal for the market's appetite for large-scale tech listings, potentially encouraging more unicorns to enter the public markets.

Although the team was ultimately undone by costly penalties and a late defensive lapse, the performance was a dramatic improvement from their dismal Week 1 showing.

In August, deposits at non-banking financial institutions, such as brokerages and fund companies, rose by 1.17 trillion yuan. Analysts attribute this trend to low interest rates on savings accounts, which are pushing investors to seek better returns in the capital market.

          <p>China is considering a proposal to repurpose retiring coal-fired power plants by converting them into nuclear facilities, a project known as the C2N initiative. Led by a top state-owned energy infrastructure builder, the plan aims to replace coal boilers with fourth-generation molten salt nuclear reactors. This approach would leverage existing infrastructure, such as turbines and grid connections, potentially accelerating the country's decarbonization efforts. With a significant number of coal plants nearing retirement, this strategy could offer a path to transition to clean energy while preserving valuable assets.</p>
