          <p>Indiana Fever star Caitlin Clark was named a captain for the 2025 WNBA All-Star Game, largely due to overwhelming fan support where she ranked first. However, a breakdown of the voting revealed a starkly different view from her colleagues, who ranked her as only the ninth-best guard in the league. The final starter selection combines votes from fans (50%), media (25%), and players (25%). Despite her popularity and strong statistical performance, her lower ranking among players may reflect her having missed several games due to injury this season.</p>

          <p>The Los Angeles Lakers have made moves in NBA free agency, signing forward Jake LaRavia to a two-year, $12 million contract. The signing came shortly after the team lost a key role player, Dorian Finney-Smith, who agreed to a four-year, $53 million deal with the Houston Rockets. Finney-Smith, acquired from Brooklyn in December, was a significant defensive contributor for the Lakers last season. LaRavia, a 6-foot-7 wing, brings solid shooting to the team, having shot 42.3% from three-point range last season with Memphis and Sacramento.</p>

Business Secretary Jonathan Reynolds stated the system has not been seriously examined for decades and needs modernization to better support working families. The review will address issues like low take-up of shared leave and unaffordable paternity pay, which is currently less than 50% of the National Living Wage. Campaign groups have praised the move, calling it a generational opportunity to fix a system that has been long overlooked.</p>

          <p>According to CNBC's Jim Cramer, a new generation of younger investors is significantly influencing market trends by favoring companies with bold, innovative ideas over traditional blue-chip stocks. He suggests these investors are drawn to narratives and growth potential, rewarding companies like Robinhood and Reddit while being less interested in established firms focused on stock buybacks. Cramer posits that the market is currently "story-dominated," focusing more on the power of individual company ideas rather than being solely driven by Federal Reserve policy or institutional hedge fund strategies. This shift represents a re-evaluation of what constitutes growth and value in the market. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>Robinhood's stock hit an all-time high after the company announced it would offer tokenized shares of private companies, including OpenAI and SpaceX, to its users in the European Union. This move, a first for the company, makes equity in these highly sought-after, non-public companies accessible on the blockchain through its EU crypto app. The launch is part of a broader global crypto expansion for Robinhood, which is leveraging the EU's more flexible regulatory environment. While the feature is not yet available to U.S. customers due to regulatory hurdles, it marks a significant step in democratizing access to private market investments. (not investment advice)</p>
