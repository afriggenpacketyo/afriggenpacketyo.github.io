          <p>London's annual Notting Hill Carnival has commenced, transforming the streets of west London into a spectacle of vibrant colors and lively sounds. The festivities began early with the J'ouvert celebration, followed by the children's parade featuring musicians and dancers in bright costumes. This event, Europe's largest street party, is expected to attract over a million people throughout the Bank Holiday weekend, embodying a rich tradition rooted in Jamaican culture and reggae music. Organizers have scheduled a 72-second silence each day to honor the 72 lives lost in the Grenfell Tower fire, as well as those who have passed away at Carnival in recent years and Kelso Cochrane, whose 1959 murder helped catalyze the event.</p>

His onscreen career gained significant momentum in the 1990s, notably after a role in "The Public Eye" and a subsequent collaboration with "Sopranos" writer David Chase, which led to his iconic six-season run. Adler is celebrated for his enduring contributions to entertainment and is survived by his four daughters.</p>

          <p>Canadian Prime Minister Mark Carney, visiting Kyiv for Ukraine's Independence Day, emphasized that only Ukraine and its allies, not Russia, can determine the nation's future security guarantees. Carney urged an immediate ceasefire to "stop the killing" and condemned Moscow's aggression, warning that unchecked actions could spread beyond Ukraine's borders. The article also highlights Norway's significant commitment of approximately $696 million for advanced air defense systems, including two Patriot systems and radars, to bolster Ukraine's defenses. These coordinated diplomatic and aid efforts underscore the continued international support for Ukraine's sovereignty and its fight for a just and lasting peace.</p>

          <p>SpaceX successfully launched its 33rd resupply mission to the International Space Station (ISS) early Sunday, sending a Dragon capsule loaded with 2.5 tons of crucial equipment and supplies, including an add-on thruster kit. The workhorse Falcon 9 rocket lifted off from Cape Canaveral, initiating a 29-hour rendezvous with the orbiting laboratory complex. The diverse cargo includes over 2,400 pounds of crew supplies, nearly 1,000 pounds of science gear, and a significant propulsion system designed to help maintain the ISS's altitude, a task typically managed by Russian Progress cargo ships. This mission underscores the continued importance of commercial space partnerships and advancements in sustaining human presence in orbit.</p>

          <p>On Ukraine's Independence Day, President Volodymyr Zelenskyy delivered a defiant address, vowing to continue fighting for freedom until calls for a "just peace" are heard, asserting Ukraine is a "fighter" not a victim. The day saw a prisoner swap of 146 soldiers on each side and strong international support, with Canadian Prime Minister Mark Carney pledging a $2 billion military package and US envoy Keith Kellogg attending celebrations. However, Moscow claimed Ukraine attacked Russian power facilities, including a nuclear plant, though Ukraine's Centre for Countering Disinformation called it Russian manipulation.

Initially struggling, SpaceX was saved by a $1.6 billion NASA Commercial Resupply Services contract in 2008, followed by a $2.6 billion contract for astronaut transport. Today, SpaceX dominates launch services, conducting 134 orbital launches in 2024, accounting for 83% of all spacecraft launched. Its Dragon capsule and Falcon 9 rocket are primary for ISS missions, while Starlink satellites provide crucial internet access, and Starship is key for moon plans, underscoring its indispensable role.</p>

          <p>Despite China's "charm offensive" on trade, US allies are largely resisting deeper political alignment with Beijing, prioritizing centuries of shared identity, robust security integration, and cultural allegiance with Washington. The article argues that economic pragmatism, while present, is ultimately being outweighed by an "immovable priority: foundational security." Even with significant EU-China trade relationships and climate deals, allies instinctively safeguard their vital US intelligence-sharing pacts and defense commitments. Their discontent manifests as diplomatic appeals for restraint, rather than outright support for China-led confrontation, suggesting that the fundamental gap between Beijing's global ambition and geopolitical reality remains unbridgeable due to these deep-seated security concerns.</p>
