        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Warner Bros. Discovery is renaming its streaming service Max back to HBO Max, reversing a decision made just two years prior. The company aims to focus on high-quality programming and storytelling, emphasizing quality over quantity. CEO David Zaslav stated that bringing back the HBO brand, known for its prestige, will accelerate growth. The streaming business has improved its profitability and added millions of subscribers, though it lost rights to NBA games and prioritizes debt reduction. JB Perrette, president and CEO of streaming, highlighted the platform's focus on distinct and great content for adults and families, mirroring competitor Disney's strategy of prioritizing quality. The rebrand is part of a larger trend of legacy media companies struggling to achieve profitability in streaming. </p>

          <p>The United States President Donald Trump announced the lifting of sanctions on Syria, a significant policy shift after 14 years of civil war. The sanctions had crippled the Syrian economy, exacerbating humanitarian crises. Trump stated the decision followed talks with Saudi and Turkish leaders, expressing hope for Syria's future stability under its new interim President Ahmed al-Sharaa. The move has been welcomed by US lawmakers and the UN, with expectations of massive investment to rebuild the war-torn nation. Lifting sanctions will facilitate aid delivery and encourage investment from wealthy neighbors, though challenges remain, including corruption and devastated infrastructure. </p>

          <p>Alana "Honey Boo Boo" Thompson, now 19, claims she never saw any of the money earned from the TLC reality show "Here Comes Honey Boo Boo," despite starring in it as a child. She also alleges that her mother, June "Mama June" Shannon, took $35,000 from her "Dancing with the Stars" earnings, returning it recently without apology. Thompson recounts her mother's struggle with drug addiction, which led to her sister gaining custody when she was 14. Despite facing humiliation and challenges, Thompson focused on her education and is now studying nursing in college. </p>

          <p>Researchers are exploring the extraction of valuable metals from wastewater, particularly from the Berkeley Pit in Butte, Montana, to increase U.S. production of rare earths. The Berkeley Pit contains 50 billion gallons of acidic, toxic liquid, from which Montana Resources extracts copper. Researchers are now focusing on extracting neodymium and praseodymium, vital for electric vehicles and defense purposes. This method is considered more economical and cleaner than starting new mines. The project is awaiting a Department of Defense grant to build a concentrator, and if successful, could provide a significant portion of the U.S.'s rare-earth element needs. </p>

          <p>House Republicans have advanced President Donald Trump's tax bill, including trillions in tax breaks, after overnight debate in the House Ways and Means Committee. The committee passed its portion of the legislation, but disagreement over the state and local tax (SALT) deduction remains unresolved. The current proposal raises the SALT cap to $30,000 for those with an adjusted gross income of $400,000 or less, but some lawmakers seek a higher limit. The full House vote could occur soon, but the legislation faces potential changes in the Senate. </p>
