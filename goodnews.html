          <p>Montana Governor Greg Gianforte has vetoed House Bill 477, which would have phased out the use of Styrofoam containers in the state, particularly within the hospitality industry. Gianforte, a Republican, described the bill as government overreach and argued that it would impose unnecessary costs on businesses and taxpayers. Proponents of the bill contended that Styrofoam poses environmental and health risks. The governor stated that he enjoys hot coffee in a Styrofoam cup, illustrating his disagreement with the bill's premise, and further noted that the bill inconsistently targets restaurants and food-service establishments while ignoring other industries that use Styrofoam.</p>

          <p>Travelers in the United States without a Real ID, passport, or other federally recognized identification will face additional security screening at airports starting this week, according to Homeland Security Secretary Kristi Noem. While travelers without compliant identification will still be allowed to fly, they may be directed to a different line or undergo an extra step in the screening process. The Real ID Act, passed in 2005 in response to the 9/11 attacks, aims to establish minimum security standards for state-issued identification documents. Travelers are advised to arrive at the airport early to accommodate potential delays.</p>

          <p>Rivian Automotive beat Wall Street expectations for the first quarter and reaffirmed its 2025 earnings targets but has adjusted its 2025 targets for vehicle deliveries and capital spending, citing the impact of President Trump's tariffs. The electric vehicle manufacturer expects to incur additional expenses per vehicle due to tariffs, including a 25% tariff on imported auto parts. Rivian's new guidance includes deliveries of 40,000 to 46,000 units, down from 46,000 to 51,000 units, and increased capital expenditures of $1.8 billion to $1.9 billion. Despite these challenges, Rivian reconfirmed plans to achieve a modest positive gross profit this year.</p>

          <p>Canadian Prime Minister Mark Carney met with President Trump in the Oval Office days after being elected on an anti-Trump platform, as relations between the two allies are at a historic low. Carney's key goal was to assert that Canada would not become the 51st U.S. state while avoiding a public fight. Despite Trump's previous criticisms of Canada, the meeting was cordial, with Trump praising Carney's electoral victory. The two leaders discussed trade, tariffs, and foreign affairs, including Russia-Ukraine and Iran. While no breakthroughs were achieved, both leaders expressed cautious optimism about future engagement.</p>
