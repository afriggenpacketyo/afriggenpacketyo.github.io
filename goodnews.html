          <h2>The Debate Over Ultra-Processed Foods and Simpler Ingredient Lists</h2>
          <div class="timestamp">2025-06-05 21:08:54 EDT</div>
        </div>
        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Driven by concerns about ultra-processed foods, more retailers and brands are offering products with fewer ingredients, following the lead of M&S's 'Only' range. While some shoppers appreciate the simpler ingredient lists, especially those with food allergies, nutritionists caution against sacrificing fortified nutrients. Experts argue that the term 'ultra-processed food' is not always a reliable indicator of health, as processing can ensure food safety and extend shelf life. Food brands are exploring new processing and packaging technologies to create less processed products, and marketing efforts are expected to emphasize the virtues of simpler foods. </p>

          <p>Chinese scientists have tested core components of quantum-based network technology in a space flight, aiming to build an integrated space-ground system for ultra-secure communications. A laser module and phase encoding device were tested on a rocket flight to assess their robustness against vibration and radiation. This test is a key step towards constructing a quantum secure direct communication network, which is considered more efficient and secure than quantum key distribution. QSDC sends messages directly through a quantum channel, skipping the key-sharing step. </p>

          <p>San Francisco is intensifying its efforts to address homelessness through targeted sweeps of encampments and increased arrests for illegal camping. Between June 2024 and June 2025, nearly 1,000 people have been arrested or cited, although few are ever formally charged. Mayor Daniel Lurie emphasizes that the city's focus is on providing shelter, mental health services, and drug treatment, while creating safer public spaces. While arrests are a last resort, the city's efforts have led to nearly half of the homeless population being sheltered, a 35% increase since 2019. </p>

The reviews provide insights into the strengths and weaknesses of each film. The reviewer makes note of how Al Pacino's performance in 'The Ritual' is less than stellar. </p>
