          <p>Pakistan and Saudi Arabia have signed a significant mutual defense agreement, stipulating that aggression against one nation will be considered an act against both. The pact is designed to bolster security cooperation and promote regional peace, with Pakistan's defense minister suggesting its nuclear capabilities could be made available to Saudi Arabia if needed. This formalizes and strengthens a long-standing strategic partnership rooted in shared religious, economic, and security interests. The deal is seen by analysts as a pivotal moment, potentially serving as a hedge against regional threats and reflecting shifting geopolitical alliances in the Middle East.</p>

          <p>President Donald Trump and Chinese leader Xi Jinping held a call to finalize an agreement aimed at preventing a U.S. ban on the social media platform TikTok. The discussion follows the establishment of a deal framework earlier in the week to address national security concerns over the app's Chinese parent company, ByteDance. A federal law had mandated that ByteDance divest its U.S. operations or face a shutdown, but President Trump has extended the deadline multiple times, expressing a desire to preserve the platform's value. The call represents a critical step in resolving the high-stakes issue between the two economic powers.</p>

          <p>In the practice session for the Azerbaijan Grand Prix, Ferrari's Lewis Hamilton set the fastest time, leading his teammate Charles Leclerc for a one-two finish. The session was marked by incidents, most notably McLaren's Lando Norris crashing into a wall at Turn Four, which broke his rear suspension and ended his run. His teammate and championship rival, Oscar Piastri, also had a brush with the wall but avoided significant damage. Despite McLaren's messy session, their strong pace in race simulations suggests they remain the team to beat for the weekend's main event.</p>

          <p>The price of gold continues to be a key indicator for investors, widely regarded as a safe-haven asset and a hedge against inflation during times of market volatility. As of September 18, 2025, the price stood at $3,671.44 per ounce, though this figure is subject to constant change. Its value is influenced by numerous factors, including global supply and demand, economic conditions, inflation rates, and geopolitical instability. Central bank policies and currency movements, particularly the strength of the U.S. dollar, also play a significant role in determining the precious metal's market price. (not investment advice)</p>

        </div>
        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>SEC Chairman Paul Atkins announced that the agency will propose a rule change that could allow publicly traded companies to report earnings on a semiannual basis instead of quarterly. The move follows a call from President Donald Trump, who argued the change would save money and encourage a focus on long-term business strategy over short-term results. Atkins stated that if the rule is approved, companies would have the option to choose their reporting frequency. Proponents believe it will foster long-term thinking, while opponents raise concerns about reduced transparency for investors.</p>

          <p>An elderly British couple, Peter and Barbie Reynolds, have been released after being detained by the Taliban in Afghanistan for nearly eight months. The couple, who had lived and worked on charitable projects in the country for almost two decades, were freed following mediation efforts by Qatar. Their family expressed immense relief, having previously raised serious concerns about the couple's deteriorating health and the harsh conditions of their imprisonment. The Taliban stated the couple had broken Afghan laws but never specified the charges, releasing them after what they described as judicial proceedings.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Minneapolis Federal Reserve President Neel Kashkari stated he supports two more interest rate cuts this year, citing his belief that President Trump's tariffs will have only a minimal long-term impact on inflation. He argues that the tariffs are likely a one-time price shock rather than a persistent inflationary force, creating room for easier monetary policy. Kashkari's dovish position is further supported by a weakening labor market and stable inflation expectations, even as the current consumer price index remains above the Fed's 2% target. He emphasized that the central bank is not content with 3% inflation. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>U.S. Treasury yields, particularly for the 10-year note, rose to a two-week high, a counterintuitive move following the Federal Reserve's decision to cut interest rates for the first time this year. This increase reflects investor sentiment that the economy may remain resilient, supported by strong labor market data that eased fears of a significant slowdown. While the Fed signaled more cuts could be coming, investors in longer-term debt are also weighing factors like future economic growth, inflation, and government borrowing needs.

          <p>The U.S. Treasury and IRS have issued proposed regulations for President Trump's 'no tax on tips' initiative, which allows certain workers to deduct up to $25,000 in tips annually from 2025 to 2028. The guidance clarifies that workers in 'specified service trades or businesses,' such as healthcare, legal, and financial services, will not qualify for the deduction. Additionally, automatic gratuities, such as mandatory service charges for large parties, are not considered qualified tips because they are not voluntary. The tax break is aimed at a significant portion of the U.S. workforce, with an estimated 4 million workers in tipped occupations.</p>

        </div>
        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Retail companies are increasingly using a 'B2B2C' (business-to-business-to-consumer) model to reduce the impact of trade war tariffs on consumer prices. This strategy involves routing online consumer purchases through a third-party middleman company that buys the product at a wholesale price from the retailer. The middleman then pays the U.S. tariff on the lower wholesale value before shipping to the consumer, effectively cutting the tariff cost. This form of tariff arbitrage allows retailers to absorb the financial pressure from tariffs without passing the full cost on to customers, though some logistics experts question its long-term scalability.</p>

This tight turnaround gives City minimal time for recovery and tactical preparation compared to Arsenal, who had two additional days of rest. Despite the disadvantage, historical data surprisingly shows that Manchester City has performed better in the Premier League with only two days of rest after a European game, remaining undefeated in their last 15 such matches.
