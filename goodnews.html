          <p>Crystal Palace manager Oliver Glasner is focused on securing the club's first major trophy as they prepare to face Manchester City in the FA Cup final. Glasner, who took over in February 2024, has significantly improved the team's performance, achieving the highest points-per-game record of any Palace boss in the Premier League era. Despite challenges during the summer, including player transfers and delayed integration of new signings, Glasner has created a positive environment at the club and is ambitious about their progress, setting their sights on the teams ahead of them in the league table. Palace will qualify for Europe should they win at Wembley.</p>

        </div>
        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Former President Joe Biden dismissed concerns about his mental acuity following the release of Special Counsel Robert Hur's report, which described him as a "well-meaning, elderly man with a poor memory." Audio recordings from Biden's interview with Hur revealed instances where Biden struggled to remember key dates and events. Biden defended his mental fitness, stating he knew what he was doing and did not need Hur's recommendation. The report amplified Republican concerns about Biden's mental fitness, while Democrats initially criticized Hur's report as politically motivated. Later in 2024, Kamala Harris was defeated by Trump in November's general election.</p>

          <p>A rare dust storm swept through Chicago, reducing visibility to near zero and prompting the National Weather Service to issue its first-ever dust storm warning for the city itself. High winds blowing over dry farmlands collected dust and carried it into the Chicago area, impacting travel and causing delays at Midway International Airport. Residents described the event as something out of the history books, with dirt and debris filling the air. Skies cleared up within 30 to 45 minutes after the storm passed.</p>

          <p>President Trump received a series of honorific welcomes during his tour of the Middle East, including a standing ovation in Saudi Arabia and billions in investment pledges from Qatar. He was awarded the United Arab Emirates' highest civilian honor, a stark contrast to the backlash he faces at home over tariffs and immigration policies. Trump touted over $2 trillion in economic investments between the U.S. and the visited nations, and used events as campaign-style rallies. The trip highlighted Trump's transactional approach to foreign policy and the Gulf leaders' eagerness to engage with him, despite concerns over human rights records.</p>

          <p>As the United States and China reduce their presence in Africa, the United Arab Emirates is increasing its investments and influence on the continent. Emirati corporations are investing heavily in ports, renewable energy, and mineral resources across Africa. This push is part of a broader strategy to diversify the UAE's economy and increase its control over global supply chains. While the UAE is considered a reliable ally by the US, its reliance on Chinese technology and minerals for green energy projects highlights the complex dynamics of its global partnerships.</p>

          <p>This article recounts the rescue of abused and indoctrinated children from the Aum Shinrikyo doomsday cult following the 1995 Tokyo subway sarin attack. It details the experiences of Mitsuo Hosaka, who cared for 53 children at a welfare center, describing their initial hostility, lack of social skills, and gradual recovery. The children were subjected to physical abuse and brainwashing within the cult, and the article highlights the challenges of helping them reintegrate into society and overcome the trauma of their upbringing. The account offers a poignant reflection on the lasting impact of cults on children and the importance of love and trust in their development.</p>
