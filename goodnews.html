Hong Kong currently leads the world in IPOs, followed by India, prompting HSBC to enhance its capacity to cater to the expanding wealth management clientele in the region.

          <p>BYD and other Chinese electric vehicle (EV) makers are transforming Europe's small car market, challenging established players like Volkswagen and Renault with competitively priced EVs. BYD recently launched its Dolphin Surf compact hatchback in Europe, offering a range of up to 507km and a starting price of ‚Ç¨22,990, with a promotional offer lowering it to ‚Ç¨19,990. This move is seen as a declaration of intentions from BYD to explore the small car segment in Europe, which analysts believe has huge potential.
