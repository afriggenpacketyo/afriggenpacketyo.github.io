        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Juneteenth, a portmanteau of June and nineteenth, marks the day in 1865 when the last enslaved people in Texas learned of their freedom, more than two years after the Emancipation Proclamation. The holiday gained federal recognition in 2021 amid growing calls for acknowledgment of emancipation's significance in U.S. history. While some corporate sponsorships for Juneteenth events have tapered off, communities nationwide continue to celebrate with parades, concerts, and cultural events. Opal Lee, known as the "Grandmother of Juneteenth," played a pivotal role in advocating for the holiday's federal recognition, emphasizing its meaning of freedom for everyone. The holiday is a reminder of the country's foundation on centuries of slavery.</p>

          <p>Financial experts are debating the worth of high-yield savings accounts, noting that while interest rates have decreased, they still offer better returns than traditional savings accounts. High-yield accounts are recommended for short-term financial goals and emergency funds, but are not a substitute for long-term investing. The accounts provide an opportunity to earn more interest compared to traditional savings accounts, with rates remaining relatively high due to competition among online banks. Experts advise considering CDs as an alternative and emphasize that high-yield savings accounts should be part of an overall financial plan. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>Retirement experts are advising seniors to avoid common mistakes when considering annuities, including not understanding fees, choosing the wrong type of annuity, and failing to designate a beneficiary. Annuities can offer steady income and protection against outliving savings but require careful consideration of contract terms and financial goals. Experts recommend understanding all fees, selecting an annuity that matches risk tolerance, and properly designating beneficiaries to avoid probate. Seniors should also avoid withdrawing excessive funds early, as annuities are designed for long-term retirement income. (not investment advice)</p>
