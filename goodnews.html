          <p>Chinese researchers published a study in Nature Machine Intelligence suggesting that large language models (LLMs) can spontaneously create a human-like system for comprehending and categorizing natural objects.  This finding provides new evidence supporting the potential for AI to reflect key aspects of human cognition. The research focused on the ability of LLMs to develop object representations from linguistic and multimodal data. This advancement could have significant implications for the field of artificial intelligence.</p>
