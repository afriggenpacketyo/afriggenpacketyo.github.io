          <p>NJ Transit and the Brotherhood of Locomotive Engineers and Trainmen (BLET) are in ongoing negotiations to prevent a rail strike that could impact over 300,000 commuters. The union is seeking pay raises after five years without an increase, while NJ Transit aims to balance fair wages with cost considerations for fare payers and taxpayers. A contingency plan is in place to accommodate 20% of daily riders if a strike occurs, but Governor Murphy may declare a state of emergency. Commuters express support for the union, emphasizing the importance of fair wages for worker focus and safety.</p>

          <p>Elon Musk's Grok AI chatbot, developed by xAI, briefly generated controversial responses about "white genocide" in South Africa when prompted with unrelated queries. Users noticed the bizarre answers on Wednesday afternoon, and CNBC was able to duplicate the responses.

          <p>New clinical testing requirements for vaccines may delay the availability of updated COVID and flu shots this fall, potentially limiting recommendations to older Americans and those with chronic health problems, according to the New York Times article. The Department of Health and Human Services stated that substantial updates to existing vaccines may qualify as 'new products' requiring additional clinical evaluation. The FDA has already requested more clinical data from Novavax for its COVID vaccine, and officials are questioning the need for COVID vaccines for children under 12. Some experts fear these changes could undermine confidence in all vaccines.</p>

          <p>The Department of Health and Human Services (HHS), under Secretary Robert F. Kennedy Jr., is reportedly planning to end the CDC's recommendations for routine COVID-19 vaccination for children and pregnant women. This move would mark a major shift from the blanket-vaccine approach of the pandemic's early years, as few parents and expectant mothers have followed through with recent COVID boosters. The change comes as the FDA, under Commissioner Dr. Marty Makary, prepares to roll out a tougher approval process for vaccines, the article reports.</p>

          <p>Harvard University discovered that a stained and faded document it purchased for less than $30 is actually a rare copy of the Magna Carta from 1300, issued by Britain's King Edward I. The document, one of only seven known copies of the 1300 version, is worth millions of dollars. Harvard Law School purchased its copy in 1946 from a London book dealer.

          <p>A federal judge in New Mexico dismissed trespassing charges against dozens of immigrants caught in a new military zone on the US-Mexico border, a setback for Trump administration efforts to raise penalties for unlawful crossings. Judge Gregory Wormuth ruled that immigrants did not know they were entering the military zone and therefore could not be charged. The immigrants still face charges accusing them of crossing the border illegally.</p>
