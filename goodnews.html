          <h2>UK Prime Minister Pushes for Welfare Reform Despite Opposition</h2>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Prime Minister Keir Starmer is determined to push through welfare reforms aimed at cutting the benefits bill by ¬£5 billion by 2030, despite facing potential rebellion within the Labour Party. The Welfare Reform Bill includes measures to make it harder for disabled individuals with less severe conditions to claim Personal Independence Payment in England, Wales, and Northern Ireland. Starmer insists the current system is not working for those needing support or for taxpayers, emphasizing that everyone agrees reform is necessary. The Prime Minister states the intention is to reform the system to make it more efficient and effective.</p>

          <p>Protesters in Barcelona and Mallorca used water pistols against tourists to demand a reevaluation of the economic model driving housing shortages and eroding local culture. Demonstrations were part of a coordinated effort across southern Europe's popular destinations to address the negative impacts of overtourism. Residents claim increasing rents and the replacement of traditional businesses with tourist-oriented establishments are pushing them out of their homes. Spanish authorities are attempting to balance the economic benefits of tourism with the need to protect residents' rights, including housing.</p>

Ohtani had a strong performance as a batter on Sunday, going 3-for-3 with two runs in a win against the San Francisco Giants.</p>

          <p>Hospice staff are at the center of the debate surrounding the assisted dying bill, with varying perspectives on its potential impact on their services. The bill would allow terminally ill adults with six months or less to live the right to medically end their lives in England and Wales. While some support the autonomy it would provide to patients, others worry about the impact on palliative care and potential pressure on patients. Concerns also exist regarding funding shortages for hospices and the need for improved end-of-life care.</p>

          <p>Santos shares experienced a significant surge after receiving a non-binding takeover offer of $18.72 billion from an Abu Dhabi's National Oil Company-led group. The takeover bid led by ADNOC's investment arm XRG includes a cash offer price of $5.76 per Santos share, representing a substantial premium. Santos' board intends to unanimously recommend shareholders vote in favor of the transaction, provided no superior proposal emerges. XRG's interest in Santos stems from its hunt for deals in the natural gas, chemicals, and lower-carbon energy solutions space. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>Japan is prioritizing preemptive cyber defense, urging firms to take proactive steps to protect key systems and data. The government enacted cyber defense legislation in May to shift from reactive to preemptive measures. Private-sector cooperation is deemed vital due to most of Japan's infrastructure being run by private firms. The legislation allows tracking of online data and early action against harmful servers, while obliging companies to report cyberattacks. The government plans to introduce a full-fledged preemptive defense system by 2027.</p>

          <p>China's retail sales grew at the fastest pace since December 2023, driven by government subsidies and boosting consumption.

However, industrial output slowed to 5.8%, and fixed-asset investment expanded by 3.7%, with a deepening contraction in property investment. (not investment advice)</p>
