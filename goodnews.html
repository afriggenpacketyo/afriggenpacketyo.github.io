          <p>The UK's Eurovision entry, Remember Monday, finished 19th in the competition, despite strong vocals and a high level of musicality. Critics attribute the loss to the song, a manic mish-mash of musical styles that lacked consistency. The staging, while fun, may have been too busy, overwhelming viewers.
