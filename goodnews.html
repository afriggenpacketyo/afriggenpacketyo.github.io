          <p>Warren Buffett, the 94-year-old chairman and CEO of Berkshire Hathaway, plans to step down from his role, marking the end of an era for the famed value investor. Buffett's strategy, deceptively simple, focuses on buying "wonderful businesses at fair prices" and holding them for the long term. Over six decades, he transformed a failing textile manufacturer into a $1.1 trillion conglomerate, influencing generations of financiers and becoming an icon of American-style capitalism. His departure raises questions about Berkshire's future without its visionary leader.</p>
