          <p>President Donald Trump appointed Fox News host Jeanine Pirro as the interim U.S. Attorney for the District of Columbia after withdrawing Ed Martin's nomination. Trump praised Pirro's qualifications and her history as a top District Attorney in New York. Pirro's appointment follows criticism of Martin's support for Jan. 6 Capitol riot defendants, leading to his nomination being dropped. Pirro is a staunch Trump supporter, whose ex-husband received a pardon from Trump during his first term in office, and she is considered well-qualified for the position.</p>

          <p>The UK and the US have reached a trade agreement that reduces tariffs imposed by President Trump on British cars and metals. While hailed as a positive step, the agreement primarily mitigates recent tariff increases rather than establishing a broad free trade deal. Prime Minister Keir Starmer emphasized the deal's significance for British businesses and workers, particularly in the car manufacturing and steel sectors. However, critics argue that the agreement does not necessarily improve trading conditions compared to six months prior, with some Conservative leaders even calling it a bad deal for the UK.</p>
