          <p>The Supreme Court unanimously ruled that anti-discrimination laws apply equally to all employees, regardless of whether they are part of a majority or minority group. The justices rejected the idea that members of a majority group must provide more evidence of discrimination to win a lawsuit. The ruling revives a lawsuit brought by Marlean Ames, who claimed she was discriminated against by a lesbian supervisor. The decision clarifies that the Civil Rights Act of 1964 prohibits workplace discrimination against any individual based on race, color, religion, national origin, or sex.</p>
