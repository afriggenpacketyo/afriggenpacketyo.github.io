          <p>The Republican National Committee (RNC) currently possesses nearly five times more cash on hand compared to the Democratic National Committee (DNC), marking the widest disparity between the two parties since at least July 2020. The RNC reported having $72 million at the end of May, while the DNC held only $15 million. This financial advantage could provide the GOP with an early boost as they prepare for the upcoming midterm elections. Some Democrats express concern that the fundraising gap reflects deeper issues within the party, while the DNC highlights a surge in grassroots support and record individual donations since February (not investment advice).</p>
