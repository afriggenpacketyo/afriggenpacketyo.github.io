          <p>China has begun mass production of the world's first non-binary AI chip, a breakthrough led by Professor Li Hongge's team at Beihang University in Beijing. This innovation overcomes limitations in traditional computing by combining binary and stochastic logic. The new chip offers improved fault tolerance and power efficiency for intelligent control applications, including touch displays and flight systems. This development sidesteps some U.S. chip restrictions and addresses the power and architecture challenges faced by current chip technologies.</p>
