          <p>For individuals with significant savings, choosing between a high-yield savings account and a money market account is a key decision in the current economic climate. This article provides a comparative analysis, calculating potential interest earnings on a $20,000 deposit over various timeframes. While high-yield savings accounts currently offer slightly higher rates on average, the difference in earnings can be minimal. Therefore, savers should also consider other features, such as the check-writing capabilities often available with money market accounts, to determine the best fit for their financial needs.

          <p>The White House has announced plans for the construction of a new 90,000-square-foot ballroom in the East Wing, a project President Trump has long desired. The estimated $200 million cost will be covered by President Trump and other private donors, with construction slated to begin in September. The new facility is designed to host large state functions for up to 650 seated guests, eliminating the need for temporary tents on the White House grounds. The project will involve replacing the current East Wing structure, which was built in 1902 and has undergone numerous renovations.</p>

          <p>Following an investigation revealing that Los Angeles has not complied with a 2019 state law, a city councilmember has introduced a motion to force an analysis of its emergency evacuation routes. The law, AB 747, requires local governments to assess the capacity, safety, and viability of these routes, particularly in high-risk areas for disasters like wildfires and tsunamis. The city's planning department had previously cited terrorism concerns for not publicizing the routes, a reason the law's author called a "dubious claim." The new motion demands a detailed report and a timeline for full compliance.</p>

          <p>Apple reported strong third-quarter financial results, exceeding analyst predictions for both profit and revenue, with overall sales growing by 10%. This marks the company's most significant quarterly revenue increase in over three years, driven by a 13% rise in iPhone sales and a 15% jump in Mac revenue. The company's performance was also robust in China, where sales grew 4% after previous declines. Despite weaker sales in the iPad and wearables categories, Apple provided a positive outlook for the upcoming quarter, projecting continued growth. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>Amazon reported second-quarter earnings and revenue that surpassed Wall Street estimates, with sales growing 13% year-over-year to $167.7 billion. The company's cloud computing unit, AWS, and its advertising business both showed solid growth. However, this positive performance was overshadowed by a disappointing operating income forecast for the third quarter, which fell short of analyst expectations. The cautious guidance caused Amazon's shares to drop in after-hours trading, as investors weigh the company's heavy investments in artificial intelligence against its short-term profit outlook.

          <p>This week's new movie releases offer a mix of comedy and horror for audiences. The new "Naked Gun" sequel is praised for effectively reviving the franchise's classic, silly humor, with Liam Neeson delivering a surprisingly entertaining deadpan performance as the son of the original protagonist. Also reviewed is "Together," a horror film starring real-life couple Dave Franco and Alison Brie as a couple whose relationship takes a supernatural and disturbing turn. The film is noted for its effective use of body horror and its interesting commentary on codependency, marking a strong debut for its director.</p>

          <p>The Pentagon has ordered the removal of 1,350 National Guard troops from Los Angeles, significantly drawing down the force deployed by the Trump administration to address protests against immigration raids. Initially, 5,000 troops were sent, a move met with strong opposition and a lawsuit from California officials who argued the deployment was unnecessary and drained resources from other duties. While 250 troops will remain to protect federal property, state and local leaders, including Governor Gavin Newsom and Mayor Karen Bass, applauded the withdrawal and are pressuring for a full demobilization.</p>

          <p>Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky and the nation's parliament have overturned a law that would have curtailed the independence of key anti-corruption agencies. The reversal came after days of large-scale protests across Ukraine, led primarily by young people who feared the law would jeopardize the country's path toward European Union integration. The original bill had been seen as a threat to the anti-corruption reforms required by Western partners for continued financial aid. The successful protests demonstrated the power of civil society in holding the government accountable, even during wartime.</p>

          <p>After announcing she will not run for governor of California, former Vice President Kamala Harris has numerous options for her next chapter. Experts suggest that, given her age and the nature of her 2024 election loss, she will likely pursue a public-facing role to remain politically relevant, potentially including another presidential run in 2028. In the meantime, she could follow the path of other post-White House figures by starting a foundation, writing books, launching a podcast, or championing a specific cause like artificial intelligence. Her immediate plans include a book tour and media appearances.</p>

Analysts describe the Labubu as a "gateway drug" that introduces U.S. consumers to Pop Mart's wider range of "blind box" toys.

          <p>As summer temperatures rise, wearable cooling devices, particularly horseshoe-shaped fans worn around the neck, have grown in popularity as a personal tool to combat the heat. This article explores whether these gadgets are truly effective at providing relief. While they can create a localized cooling sensation by circulating air across the skin on the neck and face, their overall impact on core body temperature is limited. Their effectiveness often depends on ambient humidity and personal comfort levels, serving more as a psychological comfort than a significant physiological cooling solution in extreme heat conditions.</p>
