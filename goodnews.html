          <p>The White House attempted to clarify President Donald Trump's earlier statement about using "heavy force" against protesters at the Army's 250th anniversary parade, stating that the president supports peaceful protests and the First Amendment. Press Secretary Karoline Leavitt emphasized that Trump does not support violence or assaulting law enforcement officers, contrasting this with Democrats' alleged tolerance of unrest. Trump's initial comments suggested protesters would be "met with heavy force," but he later softened his stance, stating that the military's presence would render the protests insignificant. Approximately 6,700 soldiers will participate in the parade, which will feature military vehicles, aircraft, and a last-minute request for an Air Force Thunderbirds flyover.</p>

          <p>Elon Musk stated that he regrets some of his social media posts directed at President Donald Trump, admitting they "went too far" following a public fallout where Musk criticized Trump's tax bill. This comes after Trump indicated openness to reconciliation in an interview, mentioning he felt "a little disappointed" but harbored "no hard feelings." The conflict arose after Musk stepped back from a White House role and condemned Trump's tax bill, even claiming Trump appeared in unreleased government files linked to Jeffrey Epstein, which the White House refuted. Trump had previously criticized Musk and threatened to cancel government contracts with SpaceX.</p>

          <p>A federal judge ruled that the Trump administration cannot deport or detain Columbia University activist Mahmoud Khalil based on foreign policy reasons cited by Secretary of State Marco Rubio. The preliminary injunction prevents the government from deporting Khalil due to Rubio's determination that his presence compromised U.S. foreign policy interests, citing potential First Amendment violations. While the ruling allows the administration to pursue deportation based on alleged inaccuracies in Khalil's green card application, the judge found that the primary reason for his detention was the Rubio determination. The Trump administration has been pushing to deport Khalil and other international students with pro-Palestinian activism.</p>

          <p>California Governor Gavin Newsom accused President Donald Trump of a "brazen abuse of power" in a televised address, citing the administration's immigration enforcement efforts and deployment of military personnel in Los Angeles. Newsom's remarks represent the latest clash between the two leaders, posing both a challenge and an opportunity for the California governor with his own presidential ambitions. Trump has criticized Newsom's leadership and threatened to cut off federal aid to California, while Newsom has accused Trump of authoritarianism and inflaming protests.

          <p>Gov. Gavin Newsom delivered a speech decrying ICE raids and the military presence in California ordered by President Trump, framing it as a call to action against authoritarianism. Newsom highlighted the dangers of escalating force against citizens, potentially alienating Trump's supporters and galvanizing resistance. The success of Newsom's strategy depends on the perception of aggression between the military and protesters in Los Angeles. Steven Levitsky, a professor at Harvard University, suggested Newsom's leadership could help shake off the shock of recent authoritarian actions, particularly as fear silences others. The governor's reach has skyrocketed, with millions watching his address and hundreds of thousands following him on social media.</p>

          <p>Egg prices for consumers have fallen to a five-month low in May, dropping 11% from April to $4.55 per dozen, due to the receding effects of the avian flu outbreak and a seasonal easing in demand. Experts attribute the price decrease to a reduction in bird flu activity and a shift in consumer preferences towards meat and outdoor grilling during the summer months. While egg prices have declined for two consecutive months, they remain elevated compared to the previous year. The bird flu outbreak, which began in 2022, continues to impact the industry, with a recent outbreak affecting nearly 1.4 million birds in Arizona.</p>
