          <p>Oracle's shares experienced a significant 27% spike in after-hours trading, driven by optimistic projections for its cloud infrastructure business. Despite narrowly missing quarterly earnings and revenue estimates, the company reported a massive increase in its remaining performance obligation, a measure of future contracted revenue. This growth is largely attributed to the artificial intelligence boom, with Oracle securing several multi-billion dollar cloud contracts, including one with OpenAI, signaling strong investor confidence in its future performance.

          <p>Actor Raymond Cruz, known for his role as Tuco Salamanca in “Breaking Bad,” was held in custody for five hours following a dispute in his Los Angeles neighborhood. The incident occurred when three women parked their car extremely close to Cruz while he was washing his own vehicle. According to his agent, Cruz asked them to move, and when they refused and began recording him, he turned with the hose, inadvertently splashing them while telling them to stop, which led to an assault complaint.</p>

          <p>French President Emmanuel Macron has appointed his close ally, Defense Minister Sébastien Lecornu, as the new prime minister. The appointment comes just a day after the previous government, led by François Bayrou, was ousted in a no-confidence vote over a contentious budget proposal aimed at cutting public spending. Lecornu, France's fourth prime minister in just over a year, is now tasked with the immediate challenge of consulting with political parties to form a government and pass a budget in a deeply fractured parliament.</p>

          <p>Thomas Kurian, the head of Google's cloud division, detailed how the company is already generating billions of dollars from its artificial intelligence services. Speaking at a technology conference, Kurian explained that Google employs a multi-faceted monetization strategy that includes consumption-based payments where customers pay per token used, monthly subscription fees for services like Gemini and Workspace, and upselling clients to higher-priced, more capable AI models. This approach has contributed to a backlog of customer demand that is growing faster than revenue. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>Nottingham Forest moved swiftly to appoint Ange Postecoglou as their new manager, less than a day after the departure of Nuno Espirito Santo. Nuno's 21-month tenure ended following public criticism of the club's transfer strategy and a reported breakdown in his relationship with owner Evangelos Marinakis. Postecoglou, who was previously with Tottenham, is seen by the club's leadership as a manager with the credentials to build on recent progress and help the team begin challenging for trophies.</p>

          <p>Iran and the International Atomic Energy Agency (IAEA) have signed an agreement in Cairo to resume cooperation, which includes restarting inspections of Iran's nuclear facilities. The deal, facilitated by Egypt, comes after Iran suspended all cooperation with the UN watchdog following a war with Israel in June. This development is a crucial step toward restoring transparency and verification of Iran's nuclear program at a time of heightened international tensions and the reimposition of sanctions by European powers.</p>

          <p>An analysis of Manchester City's Erling Haaland suggests his phenomenal goalscoring record is due more to his ability to create high-quality chances than to his clinical finishing. While an excellent scorer, data shows that his primary advantage comes from his unique combination of speed, strength, and intelligent movement, which allows him to get into optimal scoring positions more frequently than other elite strikers. This physical and tactical superiority in generating opportunities, rather than an outlier conversion rate, is identified as the key to his incredible goal tallies.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>For individuals who experience an unexpected job loss, credit card companies are unlikely to completely waive payments. However, many issuers offer temporary assistance through hardship programs that can provide relief. These programs, which are not automatic and require proactive communication from the cardholder, may include options like temporarily pausing payments, reducing the minimum payment amount, or lowering the interest rate for a set period. It is important for borrowers to understand the terms, as interest often continues to accrue during these periods.</p>

The company's statement acknowledged that customers did not feel the modern designs reflected the brand's beloved "Old Country Store" and vintage Americana aesthetic, prompting a return to its traditional look and feel.</p>
