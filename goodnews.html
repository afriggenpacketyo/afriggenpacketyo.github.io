          <p>Shigeo Nagashima, a celebrated figure in Japanese baseball and recipient of the People's Honor Award, has died at the age of 89 due to pneumonia. Nagashima, known as "Mr. Giants," was a key player and later manager for the Yomiuri Giants, contributing to their dominance in Japanese baseball during the 1960s and 1970s. His retirement in 1974 was a major national event, and his famous speech at the ceremony became part of Japanese popular culture. Nagashima's legacy extends beyond sports, as he is fondly remembered as a symbol of Japan's rapid economic growth era.</p>

          <p>South Koreans are voting in a snap presidential election following the ouster of Yoon Suk Yeol, who faced rebellion charges over his imposition of martial law. Pre-election surveys suggest Lee Jae-myung, Yoon's liberal rival, is likely to win due to public frustration with conservatives. The new president will face challenges including a slowing economy, President Trump's trade policies, and North Korea's nuclear threats. Relations with North Korea remain strained, with the North focused on expanding its nuclear arsenal.</p>

          <p>One of Big Bear's eaglets, Sunny, has taken its first flight from the nest, marking a significant milestone for the famed bald eagle family, Jackie and Shadow. The eaglet, nearly 13 weeks old, jumped from a branch and successfully flew away, though young eagles often return to the nest shortly after their initial flight. Gizmo, the other eaglet, has yet to leave the nest. Sunny and Gizmo will remain in the area for one to three months before venturing out on their own.</p>

          <p>The Trump administration is temporarily halting its plan to garnish Social Security benefits for individuals who have defaulted on their student loans. This decision provides older student borrowers with additional time to become current on their debt and avoid reduced benefit checks. The administration cited its commitment to protecting Social Security recipients who often rely on fixed incomes. The pause is a reversal of the administration's earlier announcement to resume collection activity on student loans.</p>
