          <p>Education Secretary Linda McMahon has endorsed Columbia University's over $200 million settlement with the Trump administration as a "template" for other universities. The agreement addresses campus antisemitism, which McMahon stated Columbia knew was a problem, and also includes measures to combat discriminatory hiring and improve safety. The settlement mandates that Columbia enforce strict rules against disruptive and masked protests, maintain trained security, and cooperate with the NYPD. McMahon emphasized the strong accountability measures, warning that consequences for violations will include suspensions, expulsions, and potential jail time for criminal activity.</p>

          <p>Data analytics firm Palantir has joined the list of the 20 most valuable companies in the United States, with its market capitalization reaching $375 billion. The company's stock has more than doubled in 2025, driven by investor enthusiasm for its artificial intelligence business and strong ties to the U.S. government. In its last quarter, Palantir's U.S. government revenue grew by 45%, contributing to a 39% rise in total sales. Despite its rapid growth, the company trades at a high valuation of 273 times forward earnings, reflecting significant investor confidence in its future prospects. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>The Metro D (Purple) Line in Los Angeles is set to reopen this Saturday after being closed for 70 days to facilitate construction on its extension project. The closure allowed crews to connect power and communication systems for the first phase of the extension, which will add three new stations connecting downtown LA to the Westside. This phase is now 98% complete and expected to open later in 2025. The entire seven-station expansion project, which aims to be finished by the 2028 Olympics, is a critical upgrade for one of Metro's busiest routes.</p>

          <p>Tesla is reportedly planning to launch a test of its robotaxi service in the Bay Area, following a similar rollout in Austin, Texas. According to an internal memo, the service will initially be available by invitation only and will use human co-pilots to monitor the vehicles. This move represents a significant step in Elon Musk's long-promised autonomous vehicle ambitions, which he has increasingly positioned as central to Tesla's future amid declining EV sales. The company will enter a competitive market, facing established players like Waymo, while also navigating regulatory scrutiny and public concerns about its self-driving technology.</p>

          <p>The Trump administration has announced it will release billions of dollars in federal grant funding to schools that had been withheld for review. The freeze, which affected over $6 billion for programs like adult literacy and English language instruction, had caused uncertainty for school districts and prompted lawsuits. The decision to release the funds followed pressure from bipartisan members of Congress and educators who warned of service eliminations. A senior administration official confirmed the release, stating that "guardrails are in place" to ensure the funds align with administration policy.</p>

          <p>The NFL is imposing fines on more than 100 players and dozens of club employees for violating its policy against reselling Super Bowl tickets for profit. An internal investigation found that these individuals sold their allocated tickets to "bundlers" at prices above face value. The league's policy prohibits players and employees from personally profiting from tickets acquired through their NFL affiliation. Players will be fined 1.5 times the face value of the tickets they sold, while employees face a steeper penalty and will lose future ticket privileges.</p>

          <p>This opinion article defends the public ridicule surrounding the viral "kiss-cam" video of a tech CEO and his HR head, who are not married to each other, at a Coldplay concert. The author argues that while some decry the incident as invasive public shaming, the widespread humor reflects a society that still fundamentally values marriage and fidelity. Drawing a parallel to George Orwell's analysis of crude postcards, the piece suggests that such reactions are a healthy recognition of relatable human fallibility rather than a sign of moral superiority or societal decay. The author concludes that the jokes show a robust respect for spousal loyalty.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>President Donald Trump has stated that his administration is considering a "little rebate" for some Americans, funded by the increased revenue from tariffs imposed on trade partners. He suggested the rebate could be targeted at individuals of a "certain income level" but also emphasized that paying down the national debt is a major priority. Experts note that such a rebate would likely require Congressional approval and could be challenging to implement. Some economists also warn that, similar to pandemic-era stimulus, such payments could potentially fuel inflation by increasing consumer spending. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>"Diciannove (Nineteen)," a new Italian film from director Giovanni Tortorici and produced by Luca Guadagnino, is reviewed as a vibrant and formally playful coming-of-age story. The film follows Leonardo, a pretentious literature student in Siena, as he navigates his 19th year, torn between his love for classical authors and the messy realities of modern life. The review praises the lead performance by Manfredi Marini and the film's energetic, stylish filmmaking, which captures the chaotic and solipsistic nature of youth. While occasionally tiring in its restlessness, the movie is lauded for its wit and its honest portrayal of a young man's search for self.</p>

According to their club coach, Messi was absent due to fatigue, while Alba was reportedly dealing with a minor injury. However, because their absences were not approved by the league, they were subject to a long-standing policy that penalizes players for skipping the event. MLS Commissioner Don Garber acknowledged it was a difficult decision but stated the rule had to be enforced, though he is open to reviewing the policy in the future.</p>

          <p>This article explores the possibility of closing on a Home Equity Line of Credit (HELOC) in under two weeks, a timeline much faster than the typical two-to-six-week process. While not common due to necessary steps like appraisals and underwriting, a faster closing may be achievable. To expedite the process, homeowners should choose lenders known for speed, such as online providers or credit unions, and have all necessary financial documents prepared in advance. Asking for digital or drive-by appraisals and being highly responsive to lender requests can also significantly shave time off the approval and funding timeline.</p>
