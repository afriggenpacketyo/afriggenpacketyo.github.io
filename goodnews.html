          <div class="timestamp">2025-05-11 09:14:36 EDT</div>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Home Secretary Yvette Cooper announced plans to end the recruitment of care workers from abroad, requiring firms to prioritize hiring British nationals or extending visas for existing overseas workers. This policy change is part of a broader effort to reduce net migration, potentially cutting up to 50,000 lower-skilled workers entering the UK. The government also intends to raise the threshold for skilled visas and introduce stricter training requirements to boost domestic employment, though concerns have been raised about the impact on care homes already facing workforce challenges.</p>
