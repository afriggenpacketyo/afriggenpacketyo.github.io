          <p>Shares of plant-based food company Beyond Meat skyrocketed over 140% after being added to the Roundhill Meme Stock ETF, triggering a significant short squeeze. The stock, which had fallen to penny-stock status after years of poor performance, saw its value jump from 65 cents to around $2 per share in a matter of days. This dramatic rally, further fueled by a new distribution deal with Walmart, is seen by some as a sign of market froth, where investors are piling into speculative assets despite elevated valuations.

          <p>A highly anticipated meeting between U.S. President Donald Trump and Russian President Vladimir Putin, potentially in Budapest, has been put on hold, providing temporary relief to European allies. The prospect of Putin visiting EU soil for the first time since the Ukraine invasion, and since being indicted for war crimes, had caused significant unease. European leaders stressed that such a meeting would only be acceptable if it led to an immediate ceasefire, while logistical and legal challenges, such as Putin's arrest warrant and airspace restrictions, loomed over the potential summit.</p>

President Trump confirmed the project, which he says is fully funded by $250 million in private donations from business and tech companies, will not cost taxpayers. The addition is intended to host large events and state visits, with a capacity of nearly 1,000 people. Despite previous assurances that the new structure would not interfere with the existing building, images and video show active demolition of the wing that houses the first lady's offices.</p>

          <p>A crisis was averted at Hartsfield-Jackson Atlanta International Airport when the family of Billy Joe Cagle alerted police to his social media posts threatening to "shoot it up." Authorities acted on the tip and arrested Cagle, who has a history of mental health challenges, at the terminal. An AR-15-style rifle loaded with 27 rounds was discovered in his truck parked outside. Officials praised the family's quick action and the police response for preventing a tragedy, highlighting the effectiveness of the "see something, say something" principle in ensuring public safety.</p>

          <p>With the Federal Reserve expected to continue cutting interest rates, the window for securing high-yield certificates of deposit (CDs) is rapidly closing. While CD rates are still competitive compared to traditional savings accounts, they have already declined from their recent peaks. Financial advisors suggest that savers looking to lock in a predictable, fixed return on their money should consider opening a CD soon. The opportunity to earn significant interest, such as over $800 on a $10,000 deposit in a two-year CD, may not be available for much longer as rates continue to fall. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>Warner Bros. Discovery has indicated it is open to a sale after receiving "unsolicited interest" from multiple parties for both the entire company and its Warner Bros. studio specifically. The entertainment giant is now reviewing a range of "strategic alternatives," which could include a full sale, separate transactions for its divisions, or proceeding with its previously announced plan to split into two companies by 2026. This announcement follows recent reports that the company rejected a bid from Paramount Skydance, and it has caused Warner Bros. Discovery's stock to jump nearly 10%.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>This article explains that eligibility for Chapter 7 bankruptcy, which can wipe out unsecured debts, is primarily determined by an income-based "means test." To qualify, a person's income must generally be below their state's median for a household of their size. However, even those with higher incomes may still qualify if their disposable income is minimal after accounting for specific allowed expenses like housing and taxes. For individuals who don't qualify, the article suggests alternatives such as Chapter 13 bankruptcy, debt settlement programs, or debt management plans through credit counseling agencies.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>A CBS News medical correspondent examined the fitness trend of using weighted vests to enhance workouts, noting both potential benefits and risks. Wearing a vest can increase calorie burn and improve cardiovascular workload, but it also functions as a mini stress test on the heart, making it important for individuals with underlying health conditions to consult a doctor first. To avoid injury, it's recommended to start with a light weight (around 5% of body weight) and ensure the vest fits properly to prevent undue stress on joints in the knees, ankles, and hips.</p>
