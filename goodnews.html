          <p>Jimmy Kimmel returned to his late-night show with an emotional monologue, clarifying his controversial comments regarding the murder of conservative activist Charlie Kirk. He asserted it was never his intention to make light of the tragedy and defended the importance of free speech, criticizing what he described as censorship efforts from the FCC chairman. Kimmel also expressed gratitude for the support he received and highlighted a message of forgiveness from Kirk's widow, contrasting it with the political division surrounding the event. The show's return came amid criticism from President Trump and the decision by some affiliate stations to continue preempting its broadcast.</p>

          <p>A large sinkhole abruptly formed on a busy road in Bangkok, Thailand, collapsing a 50-meter section of the street near major city hospitals. Authorities quickly cordoned off the area and evacuated nearby residents and businesses due to the ongoing risk of the hole expanding. Preliminary investigations suggest that heavy rainfall likely eroded a large underground water pipe, causing the ground to give way, with officials noting that sliding dirt from a nearby subway construction project may have worsened the situation. Fortunately, the incident resulted in no reported deaths or injuries, though it caused local utility disruptions.</p>

Her victory makes her the first Latina to represent Arizona in Congress.

          <p>Following a meeting with Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy at the UN, Donald Trump announced a significant policy shift, stating that Ukraine is capable of winning back all of its territory from Russia. This marks a dramatic pivot from his previous suggestions that Kyiv might need to cede land for peace, with Trump now citing Russia's economic troubles and battlefield failures as reasons for his change in perspective. Zelenskyy praised the meeting as productive and called Trump's new stance a "big shift," expressing gratitude for the president's understanding of the situation. The Kremlin disputed Trump's assessment, rejecting the characterization of Russia as a "paper tiger."</p>

          <p>A report by Oxford Economics reveals that YouTube content creators made a significant economic contribution to the United Kingdom, generating £2.2 billion and supporting 45,000 jobs in 2024. The findings coincide with the launch of a new all-party parliamentary group aimed at representing UK creators and influencers, who have often felt undervalued by policymakers. Creators hope this new group will help address industry challenges, such as access to funding and navigating regulations like filming permits. The development is seen as a sign of growing recognition for the creator economy's role in the nation's creative and financial landscape.</p>

          <p>A new report indicates that China's implementation of a visa-free policy has significantly boosted the international influence of Beijing and Shanghai. According to the 2025 International Exchange Centres Index, Beijing climbed to sixth place globally, while Shanghai rose to eighth, driven by a surge in tourist arrivals and improved transportation infrastructure. Shanghai, in particular, saw its foreign tourist numbers double year-on-year in 2024. The report highlights the cities' growing roles as global hubs for tourism, business, and scientific research, with London, Paris, and New York retaining the top three positions in the index.</p>

The home, named Higher Ground, provides a supportive environment for women re-entering the community after treatment or incarceration in a region heavily impacted by the opioid crisis. Residents receive help with employment and education while living in a communal setting that fosters kinship and mutual support. The project has been warmly embraced by the local community, which has contributed donations and volunteer labor to support the home's mission.</p>

          <p>New York City voters are considering a proposal to move municipal elections from odd-numbered years to even-numbered years, aligning them with federal and state races. This initiative is part of a national trend aimed at combating chronically low voter turnout in local elections. Proponents argue that consolidating elections boosts participation, particularly among younger and minority voters, and can save on administrative costs. While concerns exist that local issues could be overshadowed by larger national contests, the success of similar reforms in other cities has shown a dramatic increase in the number of ballots cast.</p>

Historically, spices like cinnamon and pepper were highly valued exotic goods, driving exploration and the creation of global trading companies. In medieval Europe, they were not just flavorings but also markers of social status and were believed to possess healing properties, often used in medicine to treat various ailments.</p>

A significant portion of the reclaimed funds, £186 million, was related to fraudulent activity during the Covid-19 pandemic, with the rest coming from areas like illegal council tax claims. The AI tool, which cross-references data across government departments to identify weaknesses, will now be licensed to other countries, including the US and Australia.
