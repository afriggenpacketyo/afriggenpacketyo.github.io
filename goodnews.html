          <p>Speaker Mike Johnson announced the House's passage of a $9.4 billion package designed to codify spending cuts to foreign aid and public broadcasting. Johnson thanked DOGE for their efforts and indicated that the package is just the beginning of Republican attempts to codify such cuts. The Speaker expressed confidence that the package would also pass through the Senate, marking a victory for fiscal conservatives. The bill aims to prioritize American taxpayers' interests through responsible and transparent government spending. 60</p>

          <p>The German government has increased security measures for Jewish and Israeli institutions throughout the country. Chancellor Friedrich Merz spoke with Israel's Prime Minister, followed by a meeting of Germany's security cabinet. Berlin has reaffirmed Israel's right to self-defense but urged both sides to avoid further escalation. Meanwhile, Israel's embassy in Berlin will remain closed "until further notice," and an economic institute reports tentative signs of recovery for Germany's economy. 75</p>

          <p>A group of Nobel laureates, scientists, writers, and artists have issued an open letter denouncing the resurgence of fascism in various forms globally. Drawing parallels to the rise of fascism a century ago, the letter highlights attacks on democratic norms, racist rhetoric, authoritarian impulses, and assaults on the rights of marginalized groups. The signatories call on individuals who value democracy to defend democratic institutions, uphold facts and evidence, and join collective actions against authoritarianism. They emphasize the importance of international cooperation and multilateralism in regulating relations among nations and ensuring respect for human rights. 65</p>

          <h2>Analysts Doubt Iran Will Block Strait of Hormuz Despite Rising Tensions with Israel</h2>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Despite heightened tensions following Israeli strikes on Iran, analysts believe it is unlikely that Tehran will retaliate by blocking the Strait of Hormuz, a vital oil artery. The Strait of Hormuz sees roughly 20 million barrels per day of oil and oil products pass through, accounting for nearly one-fifth of global oil shipments. Experts argue that impeding oil passage would bring "no net benefit" to Iran, potentially triggering further retaliation and drawing backlash from its largest oil customer, China. While Iran has threatened to close the strait in the past, analysts suggest that a full-scale disruption of global oil flows is both unlikely and possibly physically impossible. 55</p>

          <p>Summer Fridays, once a highly desired perk, are becoming increasingly rare as more companies adopt hybrid work schedules, allowing employees to work from home on Fridays. While employees still value summer-specific benefits like summer Fridays, summer hours, and flextime, most workers are not offered any such perks. A survey by job site Monster reveals that 84% of workers do not receive summer-specific benefits, despite 55% believing these benefits improve productivity. As more commuters settle into flexible working arrangements, fewer workers are making Friday trips, shifting traffic patterns away from the end of the week. 60</p>

          <p>Rare earth elements (REEs), a group of 17 chemical elements, play a crucial role in many modern technological products, including electric vehicles, wind turbines, and defense technologies. While not as "rare" as their name implies, finding areas with high enough concentrations for financially viable extraction is a challenge. China currently dominates the mining and processing of REEs, raising concerns in Western nations about future access. The US and EU are taking steps to build internal supplies of critical materials, including investing in domestic companies and designating strategic projects. 55</p>

          <p>Indian Prime Minister Narendra Modi's visit to Canada for the G7 summit offers an opportunity to reset strained ties between the two countries, which have deteriorated since Canada accused agents linked to the Indian government of assassinating a Canadian citizen. Despite the ongoing investigation and unresolved issues, there are expectations of a thaw in relations since Mark Carney replaced Justin Trudeau as Canada's prime minister. Both sides have much to gain from stabilizing the relationship, particularly in a volatile world, with strong trade and people-to-people ties already in place. The summit also provides Modi with a diplomatic opportunity to address global issues and call for a tougher stance against Pakistan. 60</p>

          <p>Chinese scientists have achieved a breakthrough in the commercial extraction of the critical metal rubidium directly from salt lake brine, potentially reducing dependence on imports. The industrial-scale method produces ultra-pure rubidium chloride from ultra-low concentrations, offering a new domestic source for this strategically vital material. Rubidium, widely used in electronics, specialty glass, and aerospace, has extensive military, technological, and civilian applications. The Qinghai Institute of Salt Lakes (ISL) of the Chinese Academy of Sciences (CAS) announced that researchers had produced 99.9 per cent pure rubidium chloride from potassium chloride material containing just 0.001 per cent rubidium. 70</p>
