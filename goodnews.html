          <h2>Sibling Dynamics and Influences Explored in New Research</h2>
          <div class="timestamp">2025-05-11 07:21:51 EDT</div>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>A New York Times article delves into the complex dynamics of sibling relationships, drawing on research suggesting that siblings significantly influence each other's personalities and achievements, sometimes more than parents do. The article highlights that this "sibling spillover effect" can be particularly strong in disadvantaged families, where siblings spend more time together. It also challenges the traditional birth-order psychology, suggesting that qualities associated with birth order may simply reflect developmental stages. The article further explores the role of genetics and environment in shaping personalities, noting that genetic inclinations can elicit responses that further reinforce certain traits.</p>

          <p>The Trump administration is reportedly considering accepting a luxury Boeing 747-8 jumbo jet from Qatar as a gift, intended for use as Air Force One until near the end of Trump's term, after which ownership would transfer to the Trump Presidential Library Foundation. Legal analyses are being drafted to justify the arrangement, arguing that it doesn't violate bribery laws or the Constitution's emoluments clause because the gift is to the US Air Force, not an individual. The article raises ethical concerns about the appropriateness and legality of such a valuable gift from a foreign government.</p>

          <p>The U.S. Marine Corps has formed an attack drone team to address the increasing use of armed first-person view (FPV) drones in modern warfare, as adversaries like China and Russia advance in this technology. The Marine Corps Attack Drone Team (MCADT) will integrate these drones into the Fleet Marine Force, providing squad-level lethality at a low cost. Experts emphasize the need for the United States to scale up drone production and innovation to compete effectively in this arms race, particularly in light of the large-scale drone production seen in Ukraine and China.</p>

          <p>A proposal to replace public basketball courts with pickleball facilities in a historic Fort Lauderdale beachfront community has ignited controversy, with some residents alleging racial motivations. The basketball courts, built shortly after the end of segregation, have been a popular gathering spot for a diverse group of players. While developers argue that pickleball would appeal to a broader range of residents, critics fear the conversion would destroy a long-standing community tradition and potentially "whiten" the area. The city is exploring options for preserving or relocating the basketball courts amid the debate.</p>
