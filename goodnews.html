          <p>SkillStorm CEO Justin Vianello discussed the challenges the federal government faces in hiring skilled workers, particularly in cybersecurity and tech, which can lead to national security vulnerabilities. He proposes an extended "on-ramp" time of two to four months to custom-build teams with the necessary skills and certifications, addressing the inefficiencies of the current procurement process. Vianello highlights SkillStorm's Performance Acceleration Center for Excellence, which trains and upskills individuals for rapid deployment, offering a cost-effective solution to create U.S.-based tech teams. Former GSA head Emily Murphy supports this approach, emphasizing the need for a new pipeline of clearance-eligible professionals trained on mission-specific tools.

This system, installed in the Eleven Madison skyscraper in Manhattan, can lower cooling costs by up to 40%. Scientists are also exploring new materials that can store energy at different temperatures, making the system more adaptable to various climates. As home electricity bills are expected to rise this summer, energy storage solutions like ice batteries are gaining attention as a way to reduce strain on the power grid.
