          <p>China is implementing an action plan to decrease the amount of grain used in animal feed, particularly soybean meal, to bolster food security amid global trade uncertainties. The goal is to reduce the proportion of grain in animal feed to 60% and soybean meal to 10% by 2030. This initiative is part of a broader effort to minimize grain losses and safeguard domestic yields. Concerns about the reliability of grain supply for livestock have grown as demand for meat increases.</p>

          <p>Luxury carmaker Ferrari reported a 17% increase in first-quarter profit, driven by strong demand for personalized vehicles, but cautioned that potential U.S. tariffs on EU cars could negatively impact earnings this year.

Ferrari has already announced a 10% price increase on certain models in response to the tariffs, adding up to $50,000 to the price of a typical Ferrari.</p>
