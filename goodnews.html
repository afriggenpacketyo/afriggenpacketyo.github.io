          <p>China has unveiled the Multi-hazard Alert Zero-gap and Universal (Mazu) system, an advanced AI-powered weather warning technology specifically developed to aid developing nations in preparing for and mitigating the impact of extreme weather events. The China Meteorological Administration (CMA) highlights the system's expansive global reach and its crucial role in fostering an international early warning partnership network. Active co-development efforts are in progress with partners such as Ethiopia and Pakistan, utilizing China's Fengyun satellites that already provide services to 133 countries. This significant initiative underscores China's commitment to global cooperation in tackling climate challenges and aims to enhance worldwide disaster preparedness.</p>

          <p>President Donald Trump concluded his four-day visit to Scotland, engaging in discussions with First Minister John Swinney on key issues such as whisky tariffs and the Middle East. Swinney advocated for an exemption for Scotch whisky from a 10% U.S. tariff, which currently costs the industry £4 million per week, despite a recently agreed trade framework. During his visit, Trump also officially opened a new course at his Aberdeenshire golf resort and voiced strong opposition to wind turbines, labeling them "ugly monsters" and urging the UK to prioritize North Sea oil and gas. This trip, blending political meetings with private business interests, involved extensive security operations and generated considerable public attention.</p>

          <h2>Exploring the History of Collectible Toys: East Germany's Tiemi and the Monchhichi</h2>
          <div class="timestamp">2025-07-29 03:29:00 EDT</div>
        </div>
        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>This article explores the intriguing history of collectible plush toys, focusing on the widespread popularity of the Japanese-designed Monchhichi in the 1980s and its distinct East German equivalent, the Tiemi. While Monchhichis gained global fame, particularly in West Germany, the communist German Democratic Republic (GDR) developed the Tiemi, named after designer Susanne Tieme, to circumvent bans on capitalist imports. Produced in Sonneberg, a historic toy-making hub, the Tiemi became a beloved item across Eastern Bloc countries before its production ended following German reunification in 1990. These unique figures, including other "Sonni DDR" toys, are now highly prized by collectors, offering a glimpse into a unique segment of cultural and manufacturing history.</p>

          <p>British bank Barclays reported stronger-than-expected pre-tax profit of £2.5 billion in the second quarter, alongside a £1 billion share buyback, buoyed by increased investment banking revenues amidst market volatility. The bank's investment banking unit saw a 10% year-on-year income rise, offsetting declines in advisory fees. This performance aligns with a trend seen in other major banks like JPMorgan Chase and Morgan Stanley, benefiting from turbulent markets influenced by U.S. President Donald Trump's tariff policies. CEO C.S. Venkatakrishnan stated the bank is on track with its three-year plan, achieving significant progress in cost savings and returns. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>Manchester United has pinpointed Aston Villa's Ollie Watkins and RB Leipzig's Benjamin Sesko as their leading candidates for striker acquisitions during the current transfer window, should the club decide to bolster its attacking line. The club's hierarchy recognizes that funding for new arrivals will likely depend on successfully offloading some unwanted players, a process that could extend until the September 1st deadline. While Newcastle also shows interest in Sesko, Aston Villa has firmly stated its disinterest in selling England international Watkins. However, United anticipates that Villa's position might become more flexible closer to the deadline, though they consider the rumored £60 million valuation for Watkins to be excessive.</p>

          <p>Chinese experts are strongly advocating for Beijing to strategically reshape its global messaging and effectively counter the historically dominant Western narrative by harnessing new cultural symbols and actively engaging with scholars throughout Asia. They underscore the imperative for China to assume a more proactive leadership role in establishing international rules and norms, particularly within burgeoning sectors, thereby aligning its soft power capabilities with its escalating global influence. The experts propose that Asian values, fundamentally rooted in the principle of "harmony and diversity," should serve as the cornerstone for a return to consensus-based politics within the region, advocating for an open and collaborative approach rather than imposing a predetermined narrative on other nations.</p>

The article also examines Lewis Hamilton's recent performance, attributing his "unacceptable" qualifying at Spa to adjustments in his car's braking characteristics and the integration of a new data engineer, rather than a fundamental decline in his skill. Furthermore, it addresses the speculation surrounding Red Bull's 2026 engine performance and Max Verstappen's contractual future, emphasizing that true competitive levels will only materialize next year.</p>

          <p>India has officially overtaken China as the primary exporter of smartphones to the U.S. in the second quarter, marking a substantial realignment in global manufacturing supply chains. This significant shift is largely attributed to Apple's accelerated strategy to diversify its production away from China, with India-assembled smartphones now comprising 44% of U.S. imports, a stark increase from just 13% a year prior. China's share, conversely, has diminished to 25%, while Vietnam's stands at 30%. This reorientation is heavily influenced by escalating trade uncertainties and the imposition of tariffs by the Trump administration. Despite this surge, manufacturing efficiency, particularly yield rates, in India and Vietnam still lags behind China's established infrastructure. (not investment advice)</p>

The scheme, which is retroactive to early 2025, builds on pilot programs in various provinces.
