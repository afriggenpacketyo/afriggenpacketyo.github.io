          <p>Americans traveling to 29 European countries in the Schengen Area will soon be required to provide biometric data, including fingerprints and a facial scan, under the new Entry/Exit System. The system, which will gradually roll out starting in October, replaces traditional passport stamps with a digital record of entry and exit dates. EU officials state the changes are designed to enhance security and better track visa overstays. Travelers who refuse to provide the required biometric information will be denied entry into the region.</p>

          <p>OpenAI CEO Sam Altman is defending the company's massive infrastructure plan, which involves an estimated $850 billion in spending on new data center complexes in partnership with Oracle, Nvidia, and SoftBank. The project's scale, requiring energy equivalent to over 13 million homes, has fueled concerns about an AI market bubble and a circular financing model among partners. Altman acknowledges the worries but insists the buildout is necessary to meet the tenfold increase in ChatGPT usage and the "near infinite demand" for AI compute. He argues that such large-scale investment is essential for advancing AI technology, despite the risks of overinvestment. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>The stock market experienced a pullback as investors took profits from high-flying AI-related stocks like Oracle and Micron, which had seen significant gains throughout the month. Despite the broader tech sector slide, Meta announced a major milestone for its Instagram platform, which has now reached 3 billion monthly active users. This growth places Instagram in the same league as Meta's other core platforms, Facebook and WhatsApp. The user growth is attributed to the popularity of its short-form video feature, Reels, and the use of AI to enhance content recommendation systems.

          <p>European Commission President Ursula von der Leyen has adopted a more conciliatory tone toward China, calling for engagement in a "spirit of mutual understanding" to address trade disputes. This shift comes as the EU seeks Beijing's cooperation on critical global issues, including the war in Ukraine and climate change. In contrast to previous, more assertive language regarding China's export controls and market access, the new approach suggests a strategic pivot to prioritize diplomacy. Chinese Premier Li Qiang responded by calling for the two powers to "demonstrate responsibility" and "maintain strategic independence" in a complex global environment.</p>

Having been with Loyola since 1991, she began her role with the basketball team in 1994 after her initial retirement. The university president stated that while she can no longer be physically present on campus, she remains a cherished figure who continues to pray for the community.</p>

Under the treaty, for every migrant returned to France who crossed the Channel illegally, the UK will accept one refugee who has a valid protection case and has not made the journey. This arrival follows the removal of four migrants from the UK to France under the program. The government hopes the plan will disrupt human smuggling networks, though it has faced criticism for being an insufficient deterrent.</p>

          <p>In response to a string of deaths and injuries, the New York City Police Department is now using drones to detect and prevent "subway surfing." The dangerous activity, which involves riding on top of moving trains, has led to 16 deaths in the city over the past three years. Drones canvass train routes, and if someone is spotted, a team is dispatched to intercept the train at the next station and remove the individual. The program was initiated after a rise in incidents, many of which are filmed and shared on social media platforms, prompting lawsuits against tech companies for their role in popularizing the trend.</p>

          <p>The Financial Industry Regulatory Authority (FINRA) has approved a proposal to remove the $25,000 minimum equity rule for "pattern day traders," a change that would make active trading more accessible to retail investors with smaller accounts. The current rule, established during the dot-com bubble, requires traders who execute four or more day trades in five days to maintain a $25,000 balance. The new proposal, which awaits SEC approval, would replace this with an intraday margin rule based on the positions taken, reflecting modern market technology and access.

          <p>Following the Federal Reserve's recent rate cut, the average 30-year mortgage rate has fallen to a three-year low of 6.13%, providing significant savings for homebuyers. For a $250,000 mortgage, this new rate results in a monthly principal and interest payment of about $1,520. This is a reduction of roughly $150 per month compared to the payments at the beginning of the year, when rates were above 7%. Over the full 30-year term of the loan, this lower rate translates to a total interest savings of approximately $54,000 for the borrower. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>A family has shared that their son, who was diagnosed with nonverbal autism, began speaking just days after starting treatment with leucovorin, a generic drug typically used to manage chemotherapy side effects. Researchers are studying the drug based on a theory that some children with autism have a condition that blocks the transport of folate (vitamin B9) to the brain, which leucovorin can bypass. While early trials have shown positive effects on speech for some children, more research is needed for FDA approval for this use. The drug's low cost presents a challenge, as there is little financial incentive for pharmaceutical companies to fund large-scale trials.</p>
