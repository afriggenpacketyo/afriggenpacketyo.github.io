Dominguez, who was content earning $4 million a month, was swayed by Escobar's offer of $20 million monthly. He recounts his lavish lifestyle, including owning 30 Lamborghinis, and how he transitioned from smuggling marijuana to cocaine due to financial pressures and threats from suppliers. Dominguez was eventually arrested and served over a decade in prison for drug trafficking and money laundering, and now at 73, he aims to become a legitimate entrepreneur.</p>

Japan set guidelines for the safe development of artificial intelligence-controlled defense systems, and household spending in April edged down 0.1% due to weak durable goods demand.

          <p>Overcapacity in China's manufacturing sector is causing producer prices to remain in deflationary territory, impacting global markets. Cheap Chinese imports could ease the cost-of-living crisis and help bring down inflationary pressure, benefiting consumers and economies with limited manufacturing bases. While steep tariffs deter Chinese exports to the U.S., China is doubling down on manufacturing, stirring anxiety in Asia about a flood of cheap imports squeezing local industries. This influx of low-cost Chinese goods could provide central banks some relief as they juggle lowering living costs and reviving growth. (not investment advice)</p>
