          <div class="timestamp">2025-08-14 02:25:10 EDT</div>
        </div>
        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>The UK economy expanded by a better-than-expected 0.3% in the second quarter, according to preliminary estimates from the Office for National Statistics. This growth, primarily driven by services and construction, surpassed Reuters economists' forecast of 0.1%, despite a prior contraction in May. The article notes the Bank of England recently cut interest rates to 4% amidst sticky inflation and a cooling jobs market, indicating a finely balanced monetary policy situation. Analysts suggest the slowdown in the second quarter was partly due to manufacturing shifts ahead of tariff changes, with hopes for a rebound likely to be tempered by labor market softness and inflationary pressures.

          <p>South Korea's Supreme Court has rejected a 30 million won copyright claim against The Pinkfong Company, creators of the global hit "Baby Shark." U.S. composer Jonathan Wright asserted that Pinkfong's 2015 song copied his 2011 version. However, the court upheld lower court decisions, ruling that Wright's rendition lacked the originality required for copyright protection, as both songs stem from a long-standing traditional melody popular at American summer camps. This final ruling confirms Pinkfong's position that their viral success is based on a public domain chant, bringing an end to the protracted legal battle over the popular children's tune.</p>

          <p>The NBA has unanimously approved the sale of the Boston Celtics to a group led by private equity mogul Bill Chisholm for $6.1 billion, marking the largest price ever paid for an American professional sports team. Chisholm will initially acquire at least 51% ownership, with full control expected by 2028, potentially valuing the franchise at $7.3 billion. This acquisition surpasses previous records, including the Washington Commanders and Phoenix Suns sales. The article highlights that the new ownership group includes existing Celtics shareholder Rob Hale and Bruce Beal Jr., taking over from Wyc Grousbeck's group, which bought the team for $360 million in 2002 and oversaw two NBA championships.

          <p>A growing trend, dubbed "bleisure" travel, sees over half of business travelers, and 73% of C-suite executives, bringing loved ones on work trips. The article highlights motivations such as reclaiming family time and significant cost savings, as companies often cover initial travel and accommodation expenses. Natasha Colkmire, a travel website owner, shared how her family joined her business trips, cutting expenses. While generally accepted, many employees keep these plans private from their companies due to "policy grey zones" regarding expense claims and insurance. Companies like Omic, however, encourage the practice as long as business objectives are met and costs are separated.</p>

          <p>US President Donald Trump signed an executive order aimed at easing regulations for commercial rocket launches, specifically directing the Transportation Secretary to expedite or eliminate environmental reviews for FAA launch licenses. The article notes the order's stated purpose is to boost US leadership in global space markets by addressing "inefficient permitting processes" and canceling "outdated, redundant or overly restrictive rules." This move could significantly benefit private space companies like SpaceX, owned by Elon Musk, despite their recent public disagreements. Environmental groups have criticized the deregulation, warning of increased risks to people and wildlife from private launches and potential explosions.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>A new Gallup poll indicates that the percentage of Americans who consume alcohol has fallen to a record low of 54%, largely driven by a growing public awareness of alcohol's health risks. The article notes that younger demographics, specifically those aged 18 to 34, are particularly influenced by this trend, showing a higher perception of harm from moderate drinking and lower consumption rates. Experts suggest this shift is also supported by increased social acceptance of sobriety, the popularity of non-alcoholic beverages, and economic considerations. This notable decline, more pronounced among women, signals a potential long-term change in American drinking habits.</p>

All reported cases are linked to travel, primarily from the Indian Ocean region. While the specific mosquito types are not present in the UK, the UKHSA is urging travelers to take precautions like using insect repellent and bed nets.
