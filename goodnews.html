          <p>Jack Draper's pursuit of the Queen's Club title was halted in the semi-finals by Jiri Lehecka, who won 6-4, 4-6, 7-5. Draper, battling tonsillitis, displayed resilience by leveling the match after losing the first set, but Lehecka secured a crucial break in the third set. Despite the loss, Draper expressed his determination to compete, stating he wouldn't have withdrawn even with a broken leg. He will now rest and prepare for Wimbledon, aiming to recover fully for the upcoming tournament. The tennis star's health issues made the defeat even more difficult, but he will now focus on recuperation. Optimism remains high for his future performances. His next tournament will be the prestigious Wimbledon tournament.</p>

          <p>Siarhei Tsikhanouski, a jailed Belarusian opposition leader, has been released from prison after being incarcerated since 2020. Tsikhanouski, who intended to challenge Alexander Lukashenko for the presidency, was pardoned, according to the Viasna rights group. His wife, Sviatlana Tsikhanouskaya, who ran against Lukashenko in his place, released a video thanking the US for its efforts. The release coincided with a visit from US Special Envoy for Ukraine, General Keith Kellogg, who was in Minsk for talks with Lukashenko to facilitate an end to the war in Ukraine. This marks a significant development in Belarus's political landscape.</p>

          <p>Ian McLauchlan, a former Scotland captain and British and Irish Lions great, has died at the age of 83. McLauchlan, known as 'Mighty Mouse,' led Scotland 19 times and was celebrated for his fearsome scrummaging. He played a crucial role in successful Lions tours to New Zealand and South Africa in the 1970s. He was inducted into Scottish Rugby's Hall of Fame in 2013 and awarded an OBE in 2017. McLauchlan's contributions to rugby extended beyond the field, serving as Scottish Rugby's president from 2010-2012.</p>

          <h2>US Sunscreens Less Effective Than Those Abroad</h2>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>As a heatwave approaches, experts say that US sunscreens are less effective than many available overseas, particularly in protecting against UVA rays. This is largely due to regulatory differences, as the FDA has not approved a new UV-filter for sunscreen in over 20 years. Other countries, like France and South Korea, have approved a wider range of UV-filtering ingredients, allowing for more advanced sunscreens. Despite this, dermatologists stress the importance of wearing sunscreen, suggesting a broad-spectrum sunscreen with an SPF of 30 or higher. A bipartisan bill aims to modernize sunscreen regulations and allow non-animal testing alternatives for regulatory approval.</p>

          <p>A photo project by Miora Rajaonary aims to raise awareness of female genital schistosomiasis (FGS), a neglected tropical disease affecting millions of women and girls, mainly in Africa. The women portrayed wear traditional Malagasy face masks, symbolizing their bravery in speaking about the disease publicly. The photos feature painted backdrops and props like laundry and buckets, representing the women's lives and the contaminated water they work in. The project, titled Sahy Rano, emphasizes the courage of these women in breaking taboos and sharing their stories.

          <p>A federal appellate court has blocked a Louisiana law mandating the posting of the Ten Commandments in public school classrooms. The court ruled the law unconstitutional, violating the separation of church and state. Civil liberties groups hailed the decision as a victory, arguing the mandate would isolate non-Christian students. Republican leaders, including President Trump, supported the law, claiming the Ten Commandments are historical and foundational to U.S. law. Louisiana plans to appeal the ruling, potentially taking it to the U.S. Supreme Court. The ruling underscores ongoing debates about the role of religion in public education.</p>
