          <p>Nvidia CEO Jensen Huang announced the company's new "NVLink Fusion" program at Computex 2025, allowing customers to integrate non-Nvidia CPUs and GPUs with Nvidia's NVLink technology. This move expands NVLink's accessibility, previously exclusive to Nvidia chips, enabling semi-custom AI infrastructure development. Partners like MediaTek and Qualcomm Technologies will be able to combine their CPUs with Nvidia's GPUs in AI data centers, potentially capturing a larger share of the ASIC-based data center market. According to analysts, this signifies Nvidia's strategic plans to dominate the data center landscape, offering a more flexible AI infrastructure. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>New research indicates that just five minutes of moderate-to-vigorous exercise daily can improve cognitive performance in older adults aged 65 to 80. The study, published in Age & Ageing, found that activities like running, swimming, and brisk walking enhance information processing, focus, multitasking, and short-term memory. Researchers emphasize that transitioning from minimal physical activity to even a few minutes of daily movement yields the most significant cognitive gains. The study also suggests prioritizing exercise over sleep when time is limited, as increased moderate-to-vigorous activity shows more benefits for cognitive outcomes.</p>

The results highlight a divided electorate, with far-right candidates securing a combined 21.15%. A win for Trzaskowski, from Prime Minister Donald Tusk's centrist Civic Coalition, would enable Tusk to advance his EU-friendly reform agenda, which has faced opposition from the current nationalist president.</p>

          <p>Britain and the European Union have reached a landmark agreement aimed at enhancing security cooperation and reducing trade barriers imposed by Brexit. The deal, championed by Prime Minister Keir Starmer, seeks to reset relations with the bloc amid concerns over U.S. commitment to European security. Key aspects include an extension of European trawler fishing rights in British waters until 2038 and a push for British companies to participate in a 150 billion euro joint defense procurement program. The agreement has faced political contention at home, with some criticizing the extension of fishing rights.</p>
