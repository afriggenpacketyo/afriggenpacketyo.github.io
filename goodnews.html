          <p>Prince Harry and Meghan have extended their partnership with Netflix through a new multiyear, first-look deal for their company, Archewell Productions. This arrangement gives Netflix the initial right to accept or decline their projects before they are offered to other studios, providing more flexibility than their previous exclusive deal. Upcoming projects include a second season of Meghan's cooking show and a feature film adaptation of the novel "Meet Me at the Lake," signaling a continued push by the couple to develop their media ventures in the U.S.</p>

The movie theater chain significantly narrowed its net loss to $4.7 million, compared to $32.8 million in the same quarter last year, and reported a 26% rise in attendance. CEO Adam Aron credited the positive results to a recovering box office and the company's success in restructuring its debt, suggesting a solid foundation for capitalizing on future industry growth and momentum into 2026.

          <p>U.S. chipmakers Nvidia and AMD have agreed to an unusual arrangement where they will pay the federal government 15% of the revenue from their AI chip sales to China. This agreement was a condition for receiving export licenses, which were recently granted after a temporary restriction on sales of certain advanced chips to the Chinese market. President Trump confirmed the deal, stating he negotiated the figure down from 20%, framing it as a beneficial arrangement for the country that allows U.S. companies to compete in the critical Chinese market.

          <p>The stock market has shown little negative reaction to the news that Nvidia and AMD will pay the U.S. government a 15% share of AI chip sales to China. Investors appear to view the deal as a net positive, as it restores the companies' access to the lucrative Chinese market, which had been revoked under tightened export controls. Analysts suggest that retaining 85% of revenue from a market potentially worth billions is far better than being completely shut out, preventing Chinese rivals like Huawei from dominating the space entirely.

          <p>President Donald Trump has signed an executive order to extend the current tariff truce with China by another 90 days, averting an immediate escalation of trade tensions. The decision provides temporary relief and more time for negotiators from both nations to continue talks, though the underlying trade relationship remains fragile. Ahead of the announcement, Trump publicly urged China to significantly increase its purchases of American soybeans as a way to help reduce the U.S. trade deficit, indicating key priorities for the ongoing discussions.</p>

The arrangement also puts China in a difficult position, as it needs the advanced chips for its AI ambitions but will be wary of the new U.S. government levy and persistent security concerns about American technology.</p>
