          <h2>UK and India Sign Trade Deal Amid Global Tariff Tensions</h2>

          <p>The United Kingdom and India have entered into a bilateral trade agreement, reducing tariffs on key exports like U.K. whisky and cars. This deal occurs amid rising global trade tensions initiated by the United States, with President Trump raising tariffs on imports worldwide. The agreement will gradually eliminate tariffs on most traded goods within a decade, with immediate benefits including halved tariffs on U.K. whisky and gin. The U.K. government anticipates the agreement will boost bilateral trade by ¬£25.5 billion, reflecting a strategic move to strengthen economic ties outside of the U.S.-led trade conflicts.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Friedrich Merz, a former corporate lawyer, has been elected as the next German chancellor after requiring two rounds of voting in Parliament. Supporters describe him as well-prepared and thoughtful, while critics point to a perceived inability to plan more than one step ahead and a history of breaking promises. Merz's election comes at a critical juncture for Germany, with challenges in the nation's economy, security, and its role in Europe. His initial failure to secure enough votes underscores the difficulties he faces in uniting lawmakers to address both domestic and international crises, particularly in light of the rising influence of the far-right Alternative for Germany (AfD).</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Palantir shares experienced a 12% drop despite the data analytics and artificial intelligence software company reporting ongoing revenue growth acceleration. Analysts raised concerns about modest full-year revenue guidance, sequential margin decline, and a year-over-year decline in international commercial revenue. While Palantir exceeded revenue expectations and increased its revenue guidance for the year, the company's high software multiple makes it susceptible to compression as revenue growth slows. CEO Alex Karp expressed optimism, stating that Palantir is "on fire" due to a combination of 20 years of investment and a cultural shift in the U.S.</p>

          <p>Top New Jersey officials are seeking a court order to prevent former Senator Robert Menendez from holding public office again in the state following his conviction on bribery and corruption charges.

Simultaneously, Republican state legislators are attempting to strip Menendez of his state-funded pension. Menendez, who maintains his innocence, has criticized the justice system, echoing sentiments expressed by President Trump.</p>

          <p>A new study published in the European Heart Journal indicates that the shingles vaccine can lower the risk of cardiovascular events, including stroke and heart failure, for up to eight years. The study, involving over one million people aged 50 or older, found a 23% lower risk of cardiovascular events in those vaccinated. The protective effect was particularly prominent in men, people under 60, and those who smoke or are inactive. While the study focused on a live zoster vaccine, experts suggest that the newer Shingrix vaccine may also have similar benefits.</p>
