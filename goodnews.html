          <p>Treasury Secretary Scott Bessent indicated that he expects to meet with Chinese officials again within the next few weeks to continue trade negotiations, aiming for a more comprehensive agreement. This follows a 90-day pause on tariffs previously imposed by both countries, with both sides lowering their baseline tariff rate. Bessent also highlighted progress on discussions regarding fentanyl, suggesting China is serious about assisting the U.S. in stopping the flow of precursor drugs. This development has led to a rally in global stock markets, with the S&P 500 rising significantly. (not investment advice)</p>

Apple had previously announced plans to spend $500 billion to expand its U.S. operations, including assembling artificial intelligence servers in Houston.

While gold prices have dipped slightly, they remain near record highs, prompting investors to consider cashing out.

However, selling gold means losing a valuable portfolio diversifier and a hedge against inflation, which could be crucial in the long term. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>California Governor Gavin Newsom is pushing for a statewide ban on homeless encampments, calling on cities and counties to outlaw tent camps on public property. Newsom's administration has allocated billions to address homelessness, but this move signals a tougher stance on the issue. The governor has created a model ordinance for municipalities to adopt, but cities will decide the penalties for violations. While the ordinance does not specify criminal penalties, it does make encampments on public property a crime by definition, and frustration with homelessness has been rising among Californians.</p>

          <p>President Donald Trump is advancing a plan to lower U.S. drug costs by linking them to prices in other developed countries, a policy he calls the "most favored nation" approach. The executive order directs federal agencies to fight "unreasonable and discriminatory policies" in foreign countries that allegedly undercut market prices. Experts express doubts about the policy's effectiveness, questioning whether other nations and drugmakers will comply. While some support the idea of lowering prices, concerns remain about the feasibility and potential impact on drugmakers' profits and research capabilities.</p>

          <p>California Governor Gavin Newsom is urging local governments to begin clearing homeless encampments, escalating efforts to ban makeshift camps throughout the state. Newsom's administration drafted a local law that counties, cities and towns can directly adopt or modify to achieve the Democratic governor's goals. He's also releasing $3.3 billion in voter-approved funds to expand housing and treatment options for homeless residents. The key provisions of the model ordinance include prohibitions on "persistent camping" in one location, a ban on encampments that block sidewalks and a requirement that local officials provide notice and make every reasonable effort to identify and offer shelter prior to clearing an encampment.</p>

          <h2>Trump Seeks Voluntary Drug Price Cuts, Lacks Clear Legal Authority</h2>

          <p>President Trump signed an executive order asking drugmakers to voluntarily reduce the prices of key medicines in the United States, but the order lacks clear legal authority to mandate lower prices. The administration may consider regulatory actions or importing drugs from other countries if drugmakers do not comply. The order also calls on federal agencies to investigate why European countries get lower prices and to push them to pay more. This approach has been viewed as a win for the pharmaceutical industry, as it avoids more damaging policies. (not investment advice)</p>
