          <p>China's Foreign Minister Wang Yi has reiterated China's unwavering support for Pakistan, referring to the country as an "ironclad friend," while also urging dialogue between Pakistan and India to de-escalate tensions following recent clashes. Wang Yi met with Pakistani counterpart Ishaq Dar in Beijing, where Dar updated him on the situation since the ceasefire agreement with India on May 10. China supports both nations in managing their differences through discussion to achieve a lasting ceasefire. This comes after a period of heightened conflict involving drone strikes, missile launches, and artillery fire following a militant attack in Indian-administered Kashmir.</p>

          <p>Tim Friede, a man who has allowed himself to be bitten by venomous snakes over 200 times, may hold the key to developing a universal antivenom. Over decades, Friede has built up an immunity to multiple types of venom, prompting researchers to study his blood for potential public health benefits. The World Health Organization estimates that millions are bitten by venomous snakes annually, resulting in tens of thousands of deaths. Researchers hope to synthesize a universal antivenom from Friede's antibodies, offering a more effective treatment for envenomation.</p>

          <h2>Tokyo to Waive Water Fees to Combat Extreme Summer Heat</h2>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>The Tokyo metropolitan government will waive basic water utility charges for households for four months this summer, aiming to encourage residents to use air conditioning without financial concerns amid increasingly extreme heat. The supplementary budget bill, allocating 36.8 billion yen ($256 million) for the initiative, will be submitted to the Tokyo metropolitan assembly in June. Tokyo Governor Yuriko Koike emphasized the need to protect residents' lives and daily living due to declining real wages and predictions of an extremely hot summer. Approximately 8.2 million households are expected to benefit from the plan, saving around 5,000 yen over the four months.</p>

          <p>Manchester United and Tottenham are set to face off in the Europa League final, with both teams looking to salvage disappointing seasons. BBC Sport correspondents debate which team has had the worse season, citing self-inflicted damage and poor performance for Manchester United, and underachievement and injuries for Tottenham. The outcome of the final could determine the future of Tottenham's manager, Ange Postecoglou, while Manchester United aims to justify their decision to stick with Erik ten Hag. This match is critical for both teams to end their seasons on a high note.</p>

          <p>Yoshinobu Yamamoto delivered a stellar performance, pitching seven scoreless innings with nine strikeouts, but the Dodgers found themselves trailing late in the game. Closer Tanner Scott faltered, blowing a one-run lead in the ninth and allowing a two-run homer in the tenth. Despite the setbacks, the Dodgers rallied in the bottom of the tenth, with timely hits and walks leading to a 4-3 walk-off victory over the Arizona Diamondbacks. Max Muncy's sacrifice fly sealed the win, snapping the Dodgers' four-game losing streak and preventing a waste of Yamamoto's brilliant outing.</p>

          <p>The first blood test to help diagnose Alzheimer‚Äôs disease will be available from late June in the US following regulatory clearance for its use last week, according to the Japanese company behind the innovation. The test will initially be available at about 50 American research institutes and hospitals that specialize in Alzheimer‚Äôs disease. The Food and Drug Administration cleared the blood test to help diagnose Alzheimer‚Äôs disease last week, potentially making it easier to find and treat patients with the memory-robbing disease that affects nearly 7 million Americans.</p>
