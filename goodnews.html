          <p>Alaska Airlines grounded all flights nationwide due to an IT outage affecting operations. The Federal Aviation Administration issued a ground stop at the airline's request, leading to widespread travel disruptions. The airline apologized for the inconvenience and advised passengers to check their flight status before heading to the airport. This is the second IT outage affecting Alaska Airlines this year, with a similar incident occurring in July, halting flights for about three hours. The immediate impact on Seattle Tacoma International Airport was minimal, but the situation remained fluid as the airline worked to resolve the issue. The incident underscores the reliance of modern air travel on stable IT infrastructure. </p>

          <p>Former NFL referee Terry McAulay has criticized the Southeastern Conference (SEC) after reports that longtime official Ken Williamson was permanently suspended following questionable calls during a Georgia-Auburn game. McAulay defended Williamson, calling him a very good referee and pointing out that officials, like players and coaches, sometimes have bad games. He criticized the conference's oversight of officiating, suggesting it would create a dark stain on college football. The controversial calls in the Auburn-Georgia game prevented Auburn from taking a commanding lead, ultimately contributing to Georgia's victory. The SEC routinely evaluates officiating crews, but the impact of these evaluations on future assignments remains private. </p>

          <p>European leaders have committed to financially supporting Ukraine through 2026 and 2027 but postponed a decision on how to provide the funds until December. EU leaders debated the legal risks of using frozen Russian Central Bank assets as collateral for a large loan to Ukraine. Belgium, holding most of those assets, seeks more reassurances before proceeding. The European Commission will now work out options for financing Kyiv, with a decision expected at the December summit. Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy stressed the urgency of receiving the funds in 2026, preferably at the start of the year. </p>

          <p>As student lunch debt in the U.S. soars to nearly $200 million annually, communities are stepping up to help. Individuals like DJ Bracken are creating foundations to pay off school lunch debt, while teachers like Kati Jo Christensen are using social media to raise funds. These efforts highlight the growing problem of food insecurity among students and the need for systemic change. Only nine states have permanently adopted free meals for all students, prompting advocates to push for broader access to free lunches. The issue underscores the importance of nutrition and education working hand in hand. </p>

          <p>Lewis Hamilton has warned McLaren's title contenders Oscar Piastri and Lando Norris about Max Verstappen's "cut-throat" character as they head into the final five races of the season. Hamilton, who battled Verstappen intensely in 2021, emphasized the need for consistency and a ruthless approach. Verstappen, trailing in the championship, is seen as having an easier job as the hunter. The McLaren drivers are free to race each other without internal team rules, aiming to capitalize on their car's speed. The comments set the stage for a competitive and potentially contentious conclusion to the Formula 1 season. </p>
