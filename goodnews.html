          <p>Browns' rookie quarterback Shedeur Sanders addressed the media at the team's minicamp, fielding questions about his jersey number and the possibility of acquiring his college number, 2, from wide receiver DeAndre Carter. Sanders jokingly cited his signing bonus as a limiting factor in purchasing the number, opting to wear No. 12 instead. The former Colorado quarterback, who had significant NIL deals in college, joins a crowded quarterback room in Cleveland and is competing for playing time with other rookies. Coach Kevin Stefanski praised both Sanders and fellow rookie Dillon Gabriel for their performance during the minicamp practice.</p>

The Gates Foundation, established by Bill Gates and his ex-wife Melinda, aims to reduce child mortality, fight diseases, and alleviate poverty.
