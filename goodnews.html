          <p>Thousands of energy customers are set to receive payouts, some up to ¬£1,000, and may have debts written off due to the scandal involving forced installation of prepayment meters. Energy companies will disburse over ¬£70 million in compensation and support following a review by Ofgem, revealing suppliers fell short of required standards when switching vulnerable customers to prepayment methods without consent. The review was launched after it emerged that energy firms were remotely changing smart meters or entering homes, sometimes forcibly, to install prepayment meters for those struggling to pay bills during the cost of living crisis. A new code of practice is now in place with stricter conditions for involuntary prepayment meter installations. (not investment advice)</p>

While JPMorgan Chase is a leader in various financial sectors, it seeks to increase its market share in wealth management, where competitors like Morgan Stanley and Bank of America currently lead.

          <p>During a postgame press conference, Chicago Sky star Angel Reese was not asked about the WNBA's investigation into alleged hateful comments directed toward her after a game against the Indiana Fever. The WNBA investigated claims of "hateful fan comments" that reportedly occurred after Indiana Fever star Caitlin Clark fouled Reese during a game, but the league found insufficient evidence to validate the allegations. Reese had previously accused Clark's fans of racism and alleged they created AI-generated explicit images of her and sent them to her family members. The league is committed to fostering a safe and inclusive environment for everyone and will continue to be vigilant in enforcing their fan code of conduct.</p>

While Arteta has transformed the club since 2019, making them regular title challengers, Arsenal has not won any silverware since the 2020 FA Cup final. The club has finished second in the past three Premier League seasons and was knocked out at the semi-final stage of the Champions League and Carabao Cup this term.

          <p>New research from Vanguard indicates that having at least $2,000 in an emergency savings account is the top predictor of financial well-being, surpassing even high income or asset levels. The survey of over 12,000 investors found that those with emergency savings reported a greater improvement in financial well-being, as it provides confidence in handling unexpected expenses. Behavioral economist Paulo Costa notes that the median cost of an emergency is around $2,000, making this amount crucial for alleviating financial anxiety. The study also revealed that individuals with $2,000 in emergency savings spend less time worrying about their finances each week. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>An expert challenges the common online fitness advice that one gram of protein per pound of body weight is necessary for muscle growth, calling it "baloney." The article argues that excessive protein recommendations can make exercise seem unattainable and push people towards consuming more animal products, which have environmental and ethical concerns. Research indicates that the benefits of eating more protein plateau at around 0.73 grams per pound of body weight per day. The piece emphasizes that focusing on whole plant foods and dietary patterns is more beneficial for overall health than fixating on specific nutrients.</p>

The author advocates for prostate cancer screening, believing that early diagnosis improves prognosis and allows patients and families to plan accordingly.

          <p>The 2025 Emmy season features a wealth of TV series set and shot in Los Angeles, showcasing the city's iconic locales. Series like "Shrinking," "Only Murders in the Building," "Nobody Wants This," "The Studio," "Monsters: The Lyle and Erik Menendez Story," "Hacks," "Running Point," and "Forever" utilize real L.A. locations to enhance their storytelling. These locations, ranging from Pasadena City Hall to the Sunset Strip's Chateau Marmont, add authenticity and character to the shows. Location managers emphasize that the locations often become characters themselves, enriching the narrative.</p>

          <h2>Tesco Shoppers Mock AI-Powered Cameras at Self-Checkouts</h2>

          <p>Tesco shoppers are reacting to the introduction of AI technology at self-checkouts, which uses overhead cameras to identify unscanned items and displays a live-action replay. While some shoppers joked about the technology resembling VAR in football, others expressed concerns about privacy and surveillance. The move comes as shoplifting in the UK has reached record highs, prompting retailers to implement stricter security measures. One Tesco worker expressed gratitude for the new technology, citing the challenges of monitoring multiple self-checkouts alone.</p>

          <h2>Sam Underhill Banned for Four Weeks After Dangerous Tackle</h2>

          <p>Bath flanker Sam Underhill has been given a four-week ban for a dangerous tackle during the club's European Challenge Cup final victory against Lyon. Underhill received a yellow card for the head-on-head collision, but an independent panel upheld the complaint that it warranted a red card. The ban will cause Underhill to miss the rest of Bath's season, including their Premiership semi-final, and potentially matches for England this summer.</p>
