          <h2>Training Program Aims to Reduce 'Elderspeak' in Care Settings</h2>
          <div class="timestamp">2025-05-03 07:34:28 EDT</div>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>A new training program called CHAT (Changing Talk) teaches caregivers to avoid 'elderspeak,' a form of communication resembling baby talk that can undermine older adults' sense of dignity. The program, developed by researchers at the University of Iowa and the University of Kansas, includes videos demonstrating appropriate and inappropriate communication techniques. Studies have shown that reducing elderspeak can decrease resistance to care and lower the use of antipsychotic drugs in nursing homes. The training emphasizes addressing older adults respectfully, avoiding terms of endearment, and using appropriate language and tone.</p>

          <p>The article discusses the importance of love and connection, especially during times of illness and loss, highlighting the author's experience befriending a fellow cancer patient named Anjali. Initially hesitant to form relationships with other patients, the author learned the value of showing up for others and providing support, particularly as Anjali neared the end of her life. The author reflects on how illness can teach us about the need for human connection and the importance of generosity, emphasizing the radical power of seeing, understanding, and showing up for another human. The piece underscores the health implications of loneliness and the need to actively cultivate relationships to navigate grief and uncertainty.</p>

          <p>Lewis Capaldi made a surprise appearance at a charity gig in Edinburgh, performing six songs for the Campaign Against Living Miserably (CALM). This marks Capaldi's first performance since announcing a break from performing in 2023 to focus on his mental health. The performance was a last-minute decision, with fans asked not to film the set. The appearance is not indicative of an immediate return to gigging, but rather a gesture of support for CALM.</p>

          <p>Prime Minister Anthony Albanese of Australia has been re-elected for a second term, marking a significant victory for the center-left Labor Party despite trailing in polls due to cost-of-living concerns. The Australian Broadcasting Corporation called the election shortly after polls closed, highlighting a resounding defeat for the conservative opposition led by Peter Dutton, who struggled with campaign missteps and association with Trump's policies. Albanese's victory comes amid global uncertainty stemming from the Trump administration, influencing Australian voters. It remains to be seen if Labor will maintain its parliamentary majority, given the rise of independent and minor-party candidates.</p>

          <p>The documentary 'The Encampments,' which explores student protests against Israel's actions in Gaza, has faced censorship attempts, including vandalism and social media ad suppression.

They highlight a pattern of silencing Palestinian voices, citing examples such as threats against venues screening Palestinian films and attacks on filmmakers. The authors assert that Palestinian films aren't dangerous because they incite violence, but because they offer a perspective contrary to the U.S. government and Israel's narratives.</p>
