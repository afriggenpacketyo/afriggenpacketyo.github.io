          <p>A small plane carrying skydivers crashed shortly after takeoff at Cross Keys Airport in New Jersey, resulting in injuries to all 15 people on board. While some injuries were reported as severe, officials expressed amazement that there were no fatalities, attributing the effective emergency response to recent mass casualty training at the same airport. The pilot had reported engine trouble and was attempting to return to the airport when the crash occurred. The National Transportation Safety Board is investigating the incident, noting the same aircraft was involved in a previous landing incident in 2023.</p>

          <p>This opinion article argues that former President Donald Trump shares key characteristics with America's Founding Fathers, such as courage, vision, and a willingness to sacrifice personal comfort for the nation. The author contends that Trump, like the wealthy signers of the Declaration of Independence, risked a life of luxury to fight against what he perceived as tyranny. The piece dismisses anti-Trump protests as misguided, suggesting that Trump's actions are in line with the foundational principles of the country. The author posits that the Founding Fathers would have embraced Trump as one of their own for his commitment to the nation.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>China's civil aviation authority has enacted a new safety regulation for travelers carrying power banks on flights, which went into effect on June 28. The rule mandates that all power banks must have China Compulsory Certification (CCC), a quality-assurance mark, to be allowed in carry-on luggage. Any device without this certification is considered substandard and will not be permitted through security. To accommodate travelers, Chinese airports will establish areas for passengers to discard, store, or mail their non-compliant power banks, ensuring adherence to the new safety standards.</p>

        </div>
        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>The United States and Vietnam have finalized a trade agreement that imposes a 20% tariff on Vietnamese imports, significantly lower than a previously threatened rate. A key provision of the deal is a 40% duty on products transshipped through Vietnam from other countries, a practice often associated with China to evade trade barriers. Analysts suggest this agreement may set a precedent for future U.S. trade negotiations with other emerging Asian economies like Thailand and Malaysia. However, the deal does not necessarily indicate a smoother path for trade talks with the European Union, which face different challenges. (not investment advice)</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>The cost of UK government borrowing fell, calming financial markets after a period of volatility. The drop in bond yields followed Prime Minister Keir Starmer's public support for Chancellor Rachel Reeves, who had appeared emotional in Parliament a day earlier after a major U-turn on welfare reforms. Investors, who had feared Reeves might resign, reacted positively to the show of stability, believing her departure could weaken fiscal discipline. This market reassurance helped the pound regain some lost ground, demonstrating the financial community's preference for political stability and consistent fiscal policy. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>The Colombian navy has intercepted the first-ever unmanned semi-submersible vessel equipped with a Starlink satellite antenna off its Caribbean coast. Although the drone vessel was not carrying drugs at the time, authorities believe it was a trial run by the powerful Gulf Clan drug cartel and had the capacity to transport 1.5 tons of cocaine. This seizure highlights a significant technological advancement by trafficking organizations, using autonomous systems to evade detection and eliminate the risk of crew capture. The use of such sophisticated technology presents a new and challenging threat for international law enforcement agencies.</p>

In the midfield, players like Real Madrid's Rodrygo and Crystal Palace's Eberechi Eze are on the radar, but high transfer fees could be a barrier.

          <p>A coalition of tribal leaders, activists, and environmentalists is advancing a plan to partially restore the historic Tulare Lake in California's San Joaquin Valley. The proposal involves acquiring nearly 24,000 acres of farmland to create a new reservoir and wetlands, which would help manage floodwaters, store water for drought, and revive critical wildlife habitat. For the Tachi Yokut Tribe, restoring the lake, which they call Pa‚Äôashi, holds deep cultural and spiritual significance. While facing challenges like funding and land acquisition, supporters see it as a historic opportunity to rethink the region's relationship with water.</p>

          <p>This analysis argues that the policy platform of New York City mayoral nominee Zohran Mamdani, often labeled as radical, is composed of ideas that have been tested elsewhere. Proposals like a temporary rent freeze, a pilot program for city-owned grocery stores, and fare-free bus lines are presented not as revolutionary but as practical measures to address affordability and inequality. The article suggests these policies have seen promising results in other cities and states, and that Mamdani's agenda is less about radical socialism and more about making government work effectively to improve the quality of life for its residents.</p>

Commissioned in 2019, the Shandong operates with the PLA Navy's Southern Theatre Command, primarily in the South China Sea.
