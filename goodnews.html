        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>A psychologist and intelligence researcher recounts a seven-year bet made with controversial political scientist Charles Murray, author of "The Bell Curve." Murray wagered that by 2025, the genetic basis of IQ would be substantially understood, a claim the author disputed. The article argues that despite advances like genome-wide association studies, science is no closer to a deterministic genetic explanation for intelligence, with findings showing complex, non-deterministic relationships. The author concludes that Murray's prediction has not materialized, asserting that intelligence, like wealth, is influenced by a combination of genetics and environment.</p>

        </div>
        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>The article argues that public health campaigns urging families to completely eliminate ultra-processed foods are unrealistic and frustrating for many working parents. While acknowledging the health risks associated with diets high in these foods, the author points out their necessity for convenience, affordability, and managing dietary restrictions. The piece highlights that the "ultra-processed" category is overly broad, lumping nutritious items like tofu and some yogurts with junk food. It suggests a more pragmatic harm-reduction approach rather than complete avoidance, which often requires significant time and financial resources that many families lack.</p>

          <p>The final group of living Israeli hostages held by Hamas for over two years has been released, marking a significant development in the Gaza ceasefire agreement. Concurrently, U.S. President Donald Trump addressed the Israeli Knesset, declaring an end to the war and the dawn of a "new Middle East," which was met with widespread applause. However, the Hostage Families Forum has accused Hamas of breaching the deal by returning only four of the 28 bodies of deceased hostages. The event highlights both the progress toward peace and the remaining points of contention in the complex negotiations.</p>

The selection includes a Grand Final-winning trio from Hull KR—Mikey Lewis, Jez Litten, and Joe Burgess—marking a significant moment for the club. Notably, Super League's Man of Steel winner, Jake Connor, was not selected, highlighting the fierce competition for positions. The squad features a mix of Super League talent and six players from Australia's NRL, as England prepares for the highly anticipated series beginning at Wembley.</p>

        </div>
        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>In his book "The Tragedy of True Crime," author John J. Lennon, who is currently incarcerated for murder, explores the complex backgrounds of convicted criminals to challenge the genre's typical good-versus-evil narratives. Lennon argues that many perpetrators have themselves been victims of severe abuse and trauma, which complicates simple notions of irredeemability. By examining his own life and the cases of three other men, he suggests that heinous acts often arise from a chain of societal and personal failures. The article reflects on Lennon's work as both legitimate journalism and a personal bid for redemption.</p>

          <p>U.S. Middle East envoy Steve Witkoff has publicly praised the "tireless efforts" of UK National Security Adviser Jonathan Powell in helping to secure the Gaza ceasefire. This commendation provides a political boost to Powell, who is currently facing scrutiny over a collapsed China espionage case in the UK. Witkoff's statement contrasts sharply with comments from the U.S. ambassador to Israel, who downplayed the UK's role. The praise highlights the close working relationship between Powell and Witkoff, which has been instrumental in coordinating diplomatic efforts.</p>

          <p>A new book explores the phenomenon of "zombification" in nature, where parasites manipulate the behavior of their hosts for their own benefit, such as fungi that control flies or worms that induce crickets to drown themselves. This article discusses how understanding these mechanisms could have significant scientific applications for humans. Researchers are investigating how these parasites suppress host immune systems, which could inform the development of new immunosuppressive drugs. Additionally, some zombifying pathogens, like baculoviruses that infect caterpillars, are already being explored as targeted, environmentally-friendly forms of pest control.</p>

          <h2>A Curated List of Eight Romance Novels for Readers New to the Genre</h2>
          <div class="timestamp">2025-10-13 07:30:00 EDT</div>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>This article presents a selection of eight romance novels designed to appeal to readers who may be skeptical of the genre. It argues that modern romance has expanded to include a wide diversity of stories, settings, and characters, moving beyond common stereotypes. The list includes historical romances, contemporary stories, and fantasy elements, featuring popular tropes like "enemies to lovers" and "grumpy-sunshine" pairings. Books by authors such as Emily Henry, Cat Sebastian, and Jasmine Guillory are recommended, all of which guarantee the genre's key characteristic: a "happily ever after" ending.</p>

          <p>As global finance leaders gather in Washington, D.C. for the annual IMF and World Bank meetings, the economic divergence within Europe is a central theme. The continent is experiencing varied economic performance, creating a "three-speed" recovery. France is grappling with political uncertainty that has unsettled its bond market and could negatively impact growth. In contrast, Germany's economy is forecast to outperform in 2026 due to the government's focus on fiscal speed and execution. European central bankers will be discussing these domestic challenges alongside broader global pressures like trade tariffs and Chinese competition. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>Tropical Storm Lorenzo, the 12th named storm of the 2025 Atlantic hurricane season, has formed in the central Atlantic. Forecast models currently show a range of potential intensities, from a weak tropical storm to a Category 2 hurricane. However, the projected path, or "spaghetti models," indicates the storm is likely to curve north and then east into the open Atlantic, posing no immediate threat to Florida or the U.S. East Coast. The National Hurricane Center is continuing to monitor the storm's development as it moves through the central Atlantic Ocean.</p>

          <h2>Analyst Suggests Chinese Stock Market is Resilient to U.S. Tariff Threats</h2>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>According to an economist at Soochow Securities, the Chinese stock market is demonstrating resilience and is unlikely to be derailed by renewed tariff threats from the U.S. The analyst argues that the foundation of the current global bull market is a weakening U.S. dollar, and that investors have become "immune" to the constant cycle of trade tensions. While concerns over U.S. fiscal policy and political instability continue to cause market jitters, the direct impact of tariff threats on the market's overall trajectory is seen as limited. This perspective suggests a stable outlook for Chinese equities. (not investment advice)</p>
