          <p>South Korea's primary stock index, the Kospi, surged to a new record high, marking its tenth consecutive session of gains after the government announced it was scrapping a planned tax increase on stock investments. The index closed significantly higher, reflecting strong investor confidence in the policy reversal. This event occurred within the context of mixed trading across other Asia-Pacific markets, as investors monitored ongoing national security and trade talks between the United States and China. The strong performance highlights the sensitivity of markets to fiscal policy decisions affecting investment returns. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>South Korea's Foreign Minister, Cho Hyun, is scheduled to visit China for discussions with his counterpart, Wang Yi, signaling a potential thaw in diplomatic relations. A key topic on the agenda is the possibility of Chinese President Xi Jinping attending the upcoming Asia-Pacific Economic Cooperation (APEC) summit in Seoul. If confirmed, this would mark Xi's first visit to South Korea since 2014. The meeting is viewed as an opportunity for the two nations to recalibrate their relationship, which had become strained under South Korea's previous administration due to its closer alignment with Washington.</p>

          <p>A team of climate experts, who were dismissed from the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration (NOAA) by the Trump administration, has revived the popular climate.gov website under a new, independent domain. The original government site, a primary source of climate information for millions, was effectively dismantled after staff were fired and the homepage was redirected. Led by its former manager, Rebecca Lindsey, the new climate.us platform aims to restore public access to trusted, unbiased climate data free from political interference. The initiative is funded by public donations and seeks to counteract the suppression of scientific information.</p>

          <p>Despite falling to an 0-2 record after an overtime loss to the Dallas Cowboys, the New York Giants displayed a newfound competitiveness that was absent in their season opener. Quarterback Russell Wilson delivered a sensational performance with 450 passing yards, connecting repeatedly with star rookie receiver Malik Nabers. Although the team was ultimately undone by costly penalties and a late-game interception, their offensive firepower and overall fight suggest progress. The article posits that while the team's playoff chances are slim, their entertaining style of play may finally give their fanbase a reason for hope after years of poor performances.</p>

          <p>Recent data from China's central bank indicates that a significant amount of household savings continued to flow into the country's stock market, suggesting that the current equity rally has further potential. In August, deposits at non-banking financial institutions, such as brokerages and mutual funds, rose by 1.17 trillion yuan. This trend is driven by low interest rates on traditional bank deposits, which are pushing investors to seek higher returns in the capital markets. The earnings yield on China's largest companies is currently more attractive than returns on government bonds or bank deposits. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>China is considering an innovative initiative to convert its retiring coal-fired power plants into sites for advanced nuclear reactors. The proposal, known as 'C2N' (Coal to Nuclear), is being championed by a top state-owned energy infrastructure builder as a direct path to decarbonization while preserving existing infrastructure, particularly in coastal regions. With approximately 100 gigawatts of coal capacity expected to be retired by 2030, this strategy could leverage established locations and potentially face fewer hurdles regarding site safety requirements and public acceptance. The plan involves using fourth-generation nuclear reactors for the conversions.</p>

          <p>The United Kingdom and the United States are set to formalize a major partnership to accelerate the development of nuclear power, particularly through the construction of advanced modular reactors. The agreement, announced ahead of U.S. President Donald Trump's state visit, includes plans to fast-track safety certifications and unlock billions in private investment. A key project involves energy supplier Centrica and U.S. firm X-energy building up to 12 advanced reactors in Hartlepool, creating thousands of jobs. UK Prime Minister Keir Starmer hailed the deal as the start of a 'golden age of nuclear' that will enhance energy security.</p>

          <p>The Atlanta Falcons defeated the Minnesota Vikings 22-6, securing their first victory of the season and spoiling the Vikings' home opener. Atlanta's defense was dominant, sacking rookie quarterback J.J. McCarthy six times and holding him to two interceptions and no touchdowns. While Atlanta's own quarterback, Michael Penix Jr., also had a modest game, the team's rushing attack, led by Bijan Robinson's 143 yards, controlled the contest. The game was largely a field goal battle until a late fourth-quarter touchdown by Tyler Allgeier sealed the win for the Falcons, who effectively shut down any chance of a Vikings comeback.</p>
