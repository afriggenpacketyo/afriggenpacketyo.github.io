          <p>The UK government is considering significant changes to driving laws in England and Wales, including mandatory eye tests every three years for drivers over 70. This proposal follows a coroner's report that called the UK's self-reporting system for visual health the "laxest in Europe" after an inquest into deaths caused by drivers with failing eyesight. The new road safety strategy also aims to lower the drink-driving limit to align with Scotland's stricter standard and introduce penalty points for passengers not wearing seatbelts. The government states these measures are necessary to address the high number of road fatalities and injuries.</p>

          <h2>Scientists Describe the 'Music' of Newly Formed Black Holes</h2>
          <div class="timestamp">2025-08-10 22:00:17 EDT</div>
        </div>
        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>This article explores the concept that newly formed black holes emit a form of "music" through gravitational waves. While mature black holes are known for letting nothing escape, the process of their formation—such as from a star's collapse or the merger of two smaller black holes—creates powerful vibrations in spacetime. These distortions quickly settle into a mathematically perfect shape determined by the black hole's mass and spin, a process that radiates energy outward as gravitational waves. Scientists describe these waves as a kind of pure, strange music that, with advancing technology, we will soon be able to experience and study more closely.</p>

          <p>China has introduced a nationwide childcare subsidy program, offering families 3,600 yuan (about $501) annually for each child under the age of three. This initiative builds on similar pilot programs already active in over 20 provinces. According to analysis, the subsidy is expected to have a more significant impact in less affluent regions where the payment represents a larger portion of the average resident's income. For example, the subsidy amounts to over 13.5% of an average income in the poor province of Gansu, compared to just 4.1% in the wealthy city of Shanghai, potentially boosting consumption and birth rates more effectively in rural areas.</p>

          <p>Chip manufacturers Nvidia and AMD have reached an agreement with the U.S. government to pay 15% of their revenue from certain semiconductor sales in China. This arrangement is part of a deal to secure export licenses for advanced chips, such as Nvidia's H20 and AMD's MI308, which were specifically designed for the Chinese market following earlier U.S. export restrictions. The agreement comes amid easing trade tensions between Washington and Beijing and follows extensive lobbying efforts by Nvidia's CEO. The move is seen as a pragmatic step to allow American companies to compete in the critical Chinese market while adhering to U.S. regulations.</p>

          <p>SoftBank founder Masayoshi Son is directing his company's focus toward becoming a central player in the artificial intelligence revolution, a move described as his biggest bet yet. Son predicts that artificial superintelligence (ASI), which he defines as AI 10,000 times smarter than humans, will arrive within a decade. To position SoftBank at the forefront, the company has made substantial investments, including acquiring chip designer Arm, planning to buy Ampere Computing, and committing billions to OpenAI. This aggressive strategy reflects Son's long-held belief in AI's transformative power, aiming to build an integrated AI ecosystem that spans from semiconductors to robotics and end-user applications.</p>

          <p>English golfer Justin Rose captured his first PGA Tour title in over two years, winning the St. Jude Championship in a dramatic three-hole playoff against American JJ Spaun. After both players finished at 16-under par, they matched each other with a par and a birdie on the first two playoff holes. Rose secured the victory with another birdie on the third hole, which Spaun could not match. The win was a disappointment for fellow Englishman Tommy Fleetwood, who had entered the final round with a one-stroke lead but finished tied for third after a late bogey, extending his search for a maiden PGA Tour victory.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>The UK government has introduced new measures to help newly qualified nurses and midwives in England secure jobs within the NHS. The plan aims to cut red tape, allowing hospital trusts to hire graduates based on anticipated needs rather than waiting for formal vacancies to arise. This move addresses a growing problem where the number of graduates significantly exceeds available positions, with an estimated 4,000 more nursing and midwifery graduates than vacancies. While nursing unions welcomed the news as a source of hope for students, employer representatives raised concerns about how the new measures would be funded, given that trust budgets are already under immense pressure.</p>

          <p>In the Chargers' preseason game against the New Orleans Saints, quarterback Trey Lance delivered a strong performance, bolstering his chances in the competition for the backup role. Lance showcased his dual-threat ability, completing seven of fourteen passes and rushing seven times for 48 yards, including a five-yard touchdown run. His growing confidence and ability to extend plays with his legs have seemingly closed the gap with Taylor Heinicke, who appeared rusty in his first preseason action. Coach Jim Harbaugh praised Lance's decision-making and expressed satisfaction with his game-time experience, as the Chargers went on to win the game 27-13.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>A 2022 study conducted on mice suggests a surprising connection between nose-picking and an increased risk of developing Alzheimer's-like symptoms. Researchers found that when the nasal tissue is damaged, certain bacteria, like Chlamydia pneumoniae, have a clearer path to the brain via the olfactory nerve. In response to this infection, the mouse brains deposited amyloid-beta protein, a key feature found in the brains of humans with Alzheimer's disease. While the findings are preliminary and have not been replicated in humans, they offer a new avenue for understanding how the disease may begin and suggest that avoiding damage to protective nasal tissue could be beneficial.</p>

          <p>A 60-foot passenger vessel named Discovery ran aground in powerful surf near Honolulu's Kewalo Basin Harbor. The boat, with two crew members aboard, was captured on video being tossed by large waves, nearly flipping on its side before coming to rest in shallow water. The operator reported that two large waves hit the stern, causing a loss of propulsion after it went aground. No one was injured in the incident, and the boat's fuel and batteries were removed to prevent pollution. The vessel's owner, Atlantis Adventures, is working with authorities to safely remove the boat and inspect it before returning it to service.</p>

          <p>Fashion designer Willy Chavarria has issued a public apology following criticism that a shoe he designed with Adidas Originals culturally appropriated a traditional Mexican sandal. The Oaxaca Slip-On was inspired by huaraches made by Indigenous artisans but was reportedly produced in China without partnership or credit to the Oaxacan communities. Mexico's president was among those who spoke out against the design. In his statement, Chavarria expressed deep regret that the shoe was not developed in a meaningful partnership with the community, and Adidas has also apologized, stating its commitment to a respectful dialogue to honor the region's cultural legacy.</p>
