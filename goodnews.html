          <p>World number one Scottie Scheffler has taken firm control of The Open Championship, holding a four-shot lead heading into the final day at Royal Portrush. His consistent and unflappable performance, marked by a third-round 67, has created an air of inevitability around his potential victory. Scheffler, who has a perfect record of converting 54-hole leads into wins, is pursuing his fourth major title. His closest competitor is Li Haotong, while other contenders like Matt Fitzpatrick and Rory McIlroy face a significant challenge to overcome his commanding advantage.</p>

          <div class="timestamp">2025-07-19 15:41:00 EDT</div>
        </div>
        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Germany is pivoting its foreign policy to foster closer security cooperation with France and the United Kingdom, forming a new "E3" alliance. This strategic shift, highlighted by a new comprehensive treaty with the UK, is driven by the ongoing threat from Russia and uncertainty about the United States' long-term commitment to European defense under President Trump. German Chancellor Friedrich Merz has signaled that the nuclear capabilities of France and the UK could supplement or even replace the US security guarantee. This move reflects a broader European effort to achieve greater defense independence and strategic autonomy.</p>

          <p>Manchester United forward Marcus Rashford is reportedly nearing a loan move to Barcelona, a transfer that has sparked discussion about his fit with the Spanish club. After falling out of favor at Old Trafford, Rashford could provide a solution for Barcelona, which has been seeking to strengthen its left-wing attack after other targets became unavailable. The loan structure of the deal is financially advantageous for Barcelona, which still faces economic constraints. While Rashford's form has been inconsistent, the move is seen as a low-risk, high-reward opportunity for Barcelona to acquire a talented player in his prime years.</p>

          <p>The 81st anniversary of the July 20, 1944, plot to assassinate Adolf Hitler is being commemorated, remembering the bold but failed attempt led by officer Claus von Stauffenberg. The "Operation Valkyrie" coup was intended to overthrow the Nazi regime as Germany faced military defeat, but Hitler survived the bomb blast with minor injuries. Although the conspirators were executed and initially labeled as traitors, they are now honored as heroes in modern Germany. Historians note the plotters were conservative elites, not necessarily democrats, but their actions represent a significant symbol of German resistance against the Nazi dictatorship.</p>

          <p>Major champions Bryson DeChambeau and Henrik Stenson have criticized the R&A for its handling of slow play at The Open Championship. Both golfers were warned by officials about their pace during the third round, a day after another player received a controversial penalty. Stenson noted the inconsistency of being warned for being a few minutes over schedule on Saturday, when earlier rounds had run an hour over time. DeChambeau argued for a more modern and fair system, suggesting that every player's shots should be timed individually to eliminate ambiguity and hold slower players accountable.</p>

          <p>A feature article explores Generation Life, a faith-based group of young activists promoting chastity until marriage. The group conducts "beach outreach" at the Jersey Shore, engaging their peers in conversations about love, relationships, and the negative impacts of social media. Instead of focusing on abstinence, they frame chastity as a countercultural movement about seeing a person's whole worth beyond the physical, arguing it fosters deeper intimacy and self-respect. Their message taps into Gen Z's anxieties about modern dating and the pressures of online life, presenting caution and commitment as a form of empowerment.</p>
