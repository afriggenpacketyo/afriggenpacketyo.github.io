          <p>Uber and Waymo have launched their robotaxi service in Atlanta, continuing their partnership's expansion. The service covers approximately 65 square miles around Atlanta, utilizing Waymo's driverless technology in electric Jaguar I-PACE SUVs. This follows a similar launch in Austin, Texas, earlier this year, preceding Tesla's robotaxi service. The robotaxis will not operate on highways or travel to the airport initially, marking a cautious but significant step in the deployment of autonomous vehicles in urban environments, and the company hopes to expand the service after gathering data. The development represents the ongoing evolution and commercialization of self-driving technology in the transportation sector.</p>

The UK government has urged British nationals in Israel to register their presence and plans further evacuation flights based on demand and security, however the situation remains volatile.</p>

          <p>Federal Reserve Chair Jerome Powell emphasized the central bank's dedication to preventing an "ongoing inflation problem," despite criticism from President Trump. Powell indicated that the Fed is likely to maintain its current policy stance until there is more clarity on the economic impact of tariffs. He characterized economic growth as strong and the labor market as near full employment, but noted that inflation remains above the Fed's 2% target. Powell's remarks come as Trump has intensified his criticism of the Fed's policies, but the Fed chair is expected to present these comments to congressional committees this week.</p>

The park reported that the bears, Mish and Lucy, posed no threat to the public, but visitors were escorted to a secure building as a precaution. The park's keeping team used recall training to safely return the bears to their enclosure, and an investigation is underway to determine the cause of the escape, which was attributed to an "operational error." The park has initiated a full internal investigation to prevent future incidents, emphasizing that the structural integrity of the enclosure was not compromised.</p>

        </div>
        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Purchasing a $400,000 annuity at age 70 can yield varying monthly payouts depending on factors such as gender, annuity type, and interest rates. For males, the monthly payout is around $2,923, while for females it's approximately $2,763 due to differing life expectancies, and a joint life annuity for a couple both aged 70 would yield about $2,449 per month. Interest rates influence annuity payouts, and elevated rates generally result in stronger payouts for new annuities, and optional riders like death benefits can reduce monthly income. The decision to purchase an annuity should be carefully considered, as it involves converting a lump sum into guaranteed income with limited accessibility to the original amount.

          <p>Federal Reserve Chair Jerome Powell reiterated his stance that the central bank should maintain steady interest rates, citing inflation risks stemming from U.S. tariffs. Powell acknowledged pressure from President Trump to cut rates, but he emphasized the uncertainty surrounding the economic impact of tariffs, and he stated that the Fed's goal is to prevent tariff-related price increases from becoming an ongoing inflation problem. While some Fed officials have signaled the possibility of rate cuts due to a slowing labor market, Powell indicated that it would be premature to lower borrowing costs for consumers and businesses. Powell's remarks suggest that the Fed is prioritizing inflation control amid economic uncertainty.</p>

Boyle uses a digital aesthetic, shot mostly on iPhones, to create a disorienting and immersive experience.

She played a crucial role in publishing works by authors like Angela Davis and Gayl Jones, while advocating for their work and pushing for broader readership.

          <p>Caitlin Morgan, a Swansea University graduate, secured a trainee accountant position after submitting 646 job applications over 18 months. Morgan faced numerous rejections and a lack of feedback, leading her to question the value of her university degree.

Morgan believes that the use of artificial intelligence in recruitment processes may have contributed to her initial difficulties, and she had to adjust her CV to be compatible with applicant tracking systems. Despite the challenges, she is set to begin her role in London in September.</p>
