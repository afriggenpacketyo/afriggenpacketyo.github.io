          <div class="timestamp">2025-06-19 08:32:03 EDT</div>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>The UK government is expanding the Warm Home Discount scheme, providing ¬£150 off energy bills to 2.7 million more households, including nearly a million with children. This expansion scraps the previous criteria related to property size and energy score, making the discount available to more people on means-tested benefits. While energy companies will fund the discount, leading to a potential slight increase in bills, the government anticipates that savings from cutting company expenditure will offset this rise. Market expectations suggest another rise in gas and electricity bills from October due to higher oil and gas prices, despite recent reductions in household bills controlled by the energy price cap.

          <p>A UBS report indicates that the United States added approximately 1,000 new millionaires each day in 2024, totaling 379,000 new millionaires and increasing the country's millionaire population by 1.5% to 23.8 million. This growth is attributed to a strong year on Wall Street and a stable U.S. dollar. However, the first half of 2025 has been more turbulent due to trade war concerns and recession fears, which have impacted the markets and the dollar's value. According to UBS economist James Mazeau, it is too early to determine if U.S. household wealth will continue to grow at the same rate, but he noted the resilience of American real estate.

          <p>Continuous glucose monitors (CGMs), traditionally used by diabetics, are gaining popularity among non-diabetics in the "Make America Healthy Again" movement, which advocates for self-reliance in health. Despite limited evidence of health benefits for non-diabetics, influencers are promoting CGMs as tools for weight loss and metabolic health. Experts warn that relying solely on CGM data can lead to unhealthy dietary choices and that focusing on broader health markers is more beneficial. The promotion of CGMs reflects a trend of prioritizing individual control over health, sometimes at the expense of professional medical advice.</p>

          <p>Dear everyone,\n\n\n\nI‚Äôm writing to share the news that three excellent journalists are joining our team as staff writers: Quinta Jurecic, Toluse Olorunnipa, and Nancy Youssef. The Atlantic continues to be the premier destination for the most talented journalists in America, and the addition of these three extraordinarily talented writers simply underscores this point.\n\n\n\nFirst, Quinta: Quinta‚Äôs byline is actually a familiar one to you and to our readers; as a contributing writer here for the past several years, she‚Äôs produced some of the most incisive coverage of the Trump years of anyone in journalism. Quinta was one of the people I looked to in the early days of the first Trump term to try to make sense of it all, and she delivered, time and time again. (Her Atlantic archive is a rich source of analysis and wisdom for those seeking to understand our political moment.)\n\n\n\nQuinta is sharp, quick, and extremely adept at translating difficult concepts of law and governance into illuminating stories for the general reader. She is currently a fellow at the Brookings Institution, and a senior editor at Lawfare, for which she previously served as managing editor. Quinta will be joining us at the Wharf.\n\n\n\nNext, Tolu, a Pulitzer Prize-winning reporter known for his thoughtfulness, brilliant writing, and years of experience covering politics at the highest level. He is equally at home questioning presidents in the Oval Office as he is documenting the impact of their decision-making on the people they ostensibly serve. He joins us from The Washington Post, where he has been a national political reporter and the paper‚Äôs White House bureau chief. Before joining the Post, Tolu did stints at Bloomberg News and The Miami Herald.\n\n\n\nTolu is the co-author of His Name is George Floyd: One Man's Life and the Struggle for Racial Justice, which won the 2023 Pulitzer Prize for Nonfiction, the Dayton Literary Peace Prize, and was a finalist for the National Book Award, the Los Angeles Times Book Award, and the J. Anthony Lukas Prize. Tolu will be based at the Wharf.\n\n\n\nAnd now, Nancy: Nancy is a fearless and experienced reporter with a great knowledge of the Middle East. She was based in Baghdad during the Iraq War and later in Cairo, where she covered the broader Muslim world. Her reporting from Iraq focused on the everyday experience of Iraqis and how the U.S.'s military presence reshaped the country‚Äôs social and political dynamics.\n\n\n\nNancy comes to us from The Wall Street Journal, where she developed a reputation both as a scoop artist and as a tenacious leader among Pentagon and national security reporters. Before joining the Journal, she was a reporter at Buzzfeed News, the Daily Beast, McClatchy Newspapers, the Detroit Free Press, and the Baltimore Sun. Nancy will also be based at the Wharf.\n\n\n\nPlease join me in welcoming them to The Atlantic.\n\n\n\nBest wishes,\n\n\n\nJeff</p>
