          <p>In a joint operation, the U.S. Navy destroyed a speedboat carrying an estimated 1,000 kilograms of cocaine approximately 80 nautical miles south of the Dominican Republic. Dominican authorities subsequently recovered 377 packages of the drug from the vessel. Officials described the action as the first joint operation of its kind against "narco terrorism" in the Caribbean. The mission is part of a broader U.S. naval deployment in the region aimed at combating drug trafficking, which has been criticized by some human rights groups and Venezuela.</p>

          <p>The San Diego International Airport is preparing to open its new Terminal 1, advising travelers of a phased transition on Monday and Tuesday. On Monday evening, some arriving flights will use the new terminal, while all departures will still use the existing one. By Tuesday, all operations will fully shift to the new facility, which features 30 gates, expanded security checkpoints, and more parking. The old terminal will then be demolished to make way for the next phase of construction, which is part of a larger airport modernization project.</p>

The leaders of the three nations stated the move is intended to revive hope for a two-state solution and build international momentum toward lasting peace. This decision represents a significant shift in policy for these key Western allies. The announcement was met with strong condemnation from Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu, who called it a "reward to terror," and also drew disapproval from the United States.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Pat McFadden, the UK's Work and Pensions Secretary, has stated that reforming the welfare system "must happen" to tackle the rising cost of benefits and provide better support for people to return to work. The government plans to press ahead with changes, including offering skills and employment support to tens of thousands on sickness benefits who currently have no requirement to seek a job. McFadden emphasized that the current system is unhealthy for individuals and unsustainable for the public budget, which is forecast to reach £100 billion by 2030.</p>

          <p>A pioneering scientific project on the island of Nantucket is attempting to combat Lyme disease by genetically engineering the local white-footed mouse population. Since mice are the primary natural reservoir for the Lyme-causing bacteria, scientists plan to create mice with a heritable immunity and release them into the wild. The goal is to break the disease's transmission cycle, as ticks feeding on these immune mice would not become infected. The project, called "Mice Against Ticks," is proceeding with extensive community consultation before any potential field trials.</p>

          <p>The University of Austin (UATX) has officially launched, welcoming an inaugural class of 92 students with a mission centered on the "fearless pursuit of truth" and a commitment to open debate. Founded in response to what its creators see as a crisis of self-censorship and a lack of intellectual diversity in higher education, UATX currently offers free tuition funded by private donors. The curriculum is rooted in Western civilization, and classes are small, seminar-style discussions intended to foster rigorous intellectual exchange among students with diverse viewpoints.</p>

          <p>The remarkable migration of tens of millions of monarch butterflies from the U.S. and Canada to a specific forest in Mexico is currently underway. This epic 3,000-mile journey is made possible by a unique "super generation" of monarchs that can live up to nine times longer than typical ones, allowing them to complete the trip. While the migration is an awe-inspiring natural phenomenon, conservationists are concerned, as the monarch population has declined by 70% over the last 30 years due to habitat loss and other environmental pressures.</p>
