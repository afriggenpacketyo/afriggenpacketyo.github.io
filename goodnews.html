          <h2>Maersk Revises Container Market Outlook Amid US-China Trade Tensions</h2>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Danish shipping giant Maersk has adjusted its global container market volume growth forecast for 2025 from 4% to a range of -1% to 4% due to increasing macroeconomic and geopolitical uncertainties, particularly stemming from the trade tariff landscape between the U.S. and China. Despite this revision, Maersk reported a stronger-than-expected first-quarter operating profit, driven by robust demand earlier in the year. The shipping industry continues to navigate the complexities arising from U.S. President Donald Trump's trade policies, which include significant import duties on products from China, prompting retaliatory tariffs from Beijing on U.S. goods.</p>

          <p>Ailish McBride, a 20-year-old make-up artist with partial color blindness, is competing on BBC Three's 'Glow Up', using her knowledge of color theory and labeled palettes to create bold looks despite her difficulty distinguishing between certain shades. McBride, who struggles to differentiate between red and orange, and sees light blues as grey, embraces experimentation and challenges to show that color blindness is not a barrier to creativity in make-up. Although she was eliminated from the competition after two weeks, she takes pride in her work, inspiring others to pursue their goals regardless of their limitations. McBride intends to work on films and in theaters.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Nintendo projects to sell 15 million units of its new Switch 2 console in the fiscal year ending March 2026, with market analysts expecting similar numbers in 2025 alone. This forecast comes as the company reported a decrease in fourth-quarter revenue and profit, due to consumers awaiting the new console. Nintendo is also monitoring the potential impact of U.S. tariffs on goods manufactured in Vietnam, which could affect pricing and demand in the U.S. market. The company's president noted that tariffs could significantly reduce profits, and analysts believe Nintendo's forecasts are typically conservative.</p>

          <p>President Trump is expected to announce a trade agreement with Britain, marking the first deal since imposing tariffs on numerous trading partners, though details remain unclear. The agreement, anticipated since Trump's first term, could lower British tariffs on U.S. cars and farm goods, and remove taxes on U.S. technology companies. The announcement follows nearly three years of negotiations, with Britain also negotiating trade deals with the European Union and recently agreeing to a trade deal with India. This agreement could offer vindication for Prime Minister Keir Starmer's cultivation of President Trump.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>A new study reveals that home washing machines may not effectively eliminate harmful bacteria, including antibiotic-resistant strains, even at high temperatures. Half of the tested machines failed to disinfect clothing during a rapid cycle, while a third did not clean sufficiently during a standard cycle. The study suggests that domestic laundering of healthcare uniforms could spread antimicrobial resistance within communities and hospitals. Researchers recommend that healthcare professionals and institutions re-evaluate policies allowing workers to wash work clothing at home and suggest using disinfectants and high-temperature washes to minimize risks.</p>

The collection also included comment cards the mother had written about each man, detailing their dancing skills and other observations. The discovery provided a new perspective on her mother, who had rarely spoken about her experiences during the war.</p>

          <p>Hundreds of thousands of glittering Velella velella, or by-the-wind sailors, have washed ashore along the California coast, creating a beautiful marine life spectacle. These small, oval-shaped creatures with vibrant blue to deep purple gelatinous bases and transparent triangular sails are typically found on the open sea. The phenomenon is part of the spring transition when prevailing wind directions shift, stranding the creatures along the shoreline. While related to jellyfish, Velellas are harmless to humans and are actually large colonies of specialized hydrozoa.</p>

          <p>For Prime Minister Keir Starmer of Britain, the news of an imminent trade agreement with the United States is a much-needed political victory, as well as vindication of his strategy of assiduously cultivating President Trump. That Britain is the first country in the world to conclude a deal with the United States after Mr. Trump imposed an across-the-board tariff of 10 percent on dozens of American trading partners seemed to affirm the ‚Äúspecial relationship‚Äù often invoked by British and American diplomats. Starmer turned up in the Oval Office\nwith a letter from King Charles III\n, inviting Mr. Trump to make a rare second state visit to Britain.</p>
