          <p>Tropical Storm Gabrielle is intensifying in the Atlantic Ocean and is on track to become the seventh named storm of the 2025 hurricane season. While no watches or warnings are currently in effect, the storm's center is projected to pass east of Bermuda on Monday. The National Hurricane Center has warned that swells generated by Gabrielle are likely to cause life-threatening surf and rip current conditions along the U.S. East Coast from North Carolina northward into Canada. Forecasters anticipate the storm could reach hurricane strength within the next day or two.</p>

          <p>The UK's Transport Secretary has approved a £2.2 billion plan for a second runway at London's Gatwick Airport, a move aimed at boosting economic growth. The project involves bringing the airport's existing northern runway into regular use, which could increase annual flights from 280,000 to nearly 389,000 by the late 2030s. While the government hails the decision as a "no-brainer for growth," the expansion faces strong opposition from environmental campaigners and local groups concerned about increased noise and pollution.</p>

Defensive lineman Jordan Davis recovered the loose ball and ran it back for the decisive score, capping a remarkable comeback victory for Philadelphia. The Eagles overcame a 19-point deficit in the second half to remain undefeated for the season.</p>

          <p>Arsenal salvaged a 1-1 draw against Manchester City thanks to a 93rd-minute equalizer from Gabriel Martinelli at Emirates Stadium. After Erling Haaland gave City an early lead, manager Pep Guardiola employed an unusually defensive 5-5-0 formation in the second half to protect the advantage. The tactic nearly succeeded, but Martinelli's late goal denied City the win, leaving both teams feeling they missed an opportunity in the Premier League title race. The result is seen as a significant boost for current league leaders Liverpool.</p>

          <p>A section of London's iconic Oxford Street was closed to traffic for a day in a trial aimed at revitalizing the world-famous shopping destination. Mayor Sadiq Khan, who supports making the change permanent, hailed the event as the start of a "fight back to rescue this street." While many pedestrians enjoyed the car-free environment, the proposal has faced opposition from some residents and councillors who are concerned about increased traffic on side streets and reduced accessibility for those with mobility challenges.</p>

          <p>In a recent interview, President Donald Trump indicated that media mogul Rupert Murdoch and his son Lachlan are likely to be involved in the deal for the U.S. operations of TikTok. The statement adds a new dimension to the ongoing negotiations over the future of the popular social media app, which is owned by the Chinese company ByteDance. U.S. law requires ByteDance to divest its American operations due to national security concerns, and Trump's comments suggest Fox Corporation could become a key investor in the new entity.</p>

          <p>To combat production quality issues seen elsewhere in the aviation industry, the assembly line for China's C919 passenger jet employs advanced "smart factory" technology. A recent study reveals the use of a unified network combining 5G and time-sensitive networking to connect every tool, sensor, robot, and worker on the final assembly line. This integrated system creates a sensing-transmission-control loop designed to eliminate errors, such as missing bolts or misplaced tools, that might be overlooked in manual checks.</p>
