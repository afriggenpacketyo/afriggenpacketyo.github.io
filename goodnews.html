          <p>President Trump announced Michael Waltz's nomination as U.S. ambassador to the United Nations, while Secretary of State Marco Rubio will serve as interim national security advisor. The move follows Waltz's scrutiny after inadvertently adding a reporter to a Signal chat discussing a U.S. military strike. Vice President JD Vance stated Waltz was brought on to reform the National Security Council and would be better suited as UN ambassador. State Department spokesperson Tammy Bruce learned about Rubio's appointment during a press briefing, praising his versatility and familiarity with the president, and Trump defended Waltz after the Signal mishap, stating he had learned a lesson.</p>

          <p>Acting ICE Director Todd Lyons stated that the agency will increase raids in sanctuary cities if they refuse to cooperate with ICE agents, focusing on criminal illegal immigrants regardless of sanctuary policies.

He emphasized ICE's commitment to removing dangerous individuals from communities and protecting children. Lyons also mentioned that additional funding for 10,000 agents would significantly enhance ICE's capabilities to address public safety threats.</p>

          <p>Migrant crossings at the U.S. southern border continued to be at historically low levels in April, marking three months into President Trump's efforts to curtail illegal immigration. Border Patrol agents recorded approximately 8,400 apprehensions, a slight increase from March but consistent with February's figures. These numbers contrast sharply with the high influx of migrants under the Biden administration. Trump administration officials attribute the drop to the president's immigration crackdown, including rapid deportations and increased border security. Some Democrats criticize these policies as draconian and inhumane, citing violations of due process rights.</p>

          <p>Dozens of homeless people living in the Deschutes National Forest in central Oregon were evicted by the U.S. Forest Service due to a wildfire prevention project. The project, involving tree removal, debris clearing, and controlled burns, prompted the closure of the area, with authorities citing safety concerns due to heavy machinery and fire operations. The eviction comes after the Trump administration directed federal agencies to increase timber production and forest management. A judge denied a restraining order to stop the closure, arguing that the public's interest in restoring natural habitats outweighs the residents' interest in residing on the land.</p>

          <p>A lynx born in a zoo in Cornwall may become the first UK zoo-born cat to be successfully released into the wild, as part of a European breeding program to increase genetic diversity. The female lynx was moved to Germany's Black Forest, where it will be monitored in an enclosure to assess its survival skills. Despite being raised in captivity, experts believe it can adapt to hunting prey, though its relationship with humans will be a key factor. The goal is to reintroduce lynxes to control deer populations and restore ecosystems in Europe.</p>

          <p>President Trump is set to close a duty-free loophole for low-value packages, which will increase prices for US customers of online retailers like Shein and Temu. These retailers have relied on the "de minimis" exemption to ship low-value items directly to the US without duties or import taxes. The move aims to tackle the illegal importation of synthetic opioids, as the administration believes Chinese shippers use deceptive practices to hide illicit substances in low-value packages. The change will subject packages from mainland China and Hong Kong to import duties, impacting online shoppers who will likely see price increases.</p>

CEO Tim Cook expects tariffs to add $900 million to costs for the upcoming quarter, assuming tariff rates remain stable. The company's stock dropped in after-hours trading due to the tariffs news and weaker-than-expected services revenue. Apple is heavily reliant on Chinese manufacturing, but Cook stated that India and Vietnam would produce more iPhones, iPads, and Macs. Analysts suggest the tariff confusion could benefit Apple in the short term, as consumers rush to purchase products before potential price increases.</p>

          <p>Amazon reported better-than-expected results for the first quarter but issued soft guidance for the current period, citing uncertainty surrounding President Trump's tariffs. The company expects second-quarter operating income to be between $13 billion and $17.5 billion, below consensus forecasts. Amazon CEO Andy Jassy acknowledged that Trump's tariffs have made it hard to predict their impact on the company's businesses. He said Amazon could emerge from the uncertain tariff environment stronger than before, given its ability to offer low prices.</p>

          <h2>Manchester United and Tottenham Could Meet in All-English Europa League Final</h2>

          <p>Manchester United and Tottenham both took significant steps toward reaching the Europa League final with semi-final first-leg wins. United secured a 3-0 victory at Athletic Bilbao, while Tottenham defeated Bodo/Glimt 3-1. Statisticians estimate a high probability of both teams reaching the final, which would create just the sixth all-English final in any major European competition. This scenario would also result in six English teams qualifying for next season's Champions League.</p>
