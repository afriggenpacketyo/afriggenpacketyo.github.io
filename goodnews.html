          <p>Ram Trucks, owned by Stellantis, plans to introduce a new industry-leading warranty for its 2026 vehicle lineup, covering the engine, transmission, and related components for 10 years or 100,000 miles. This warranty replaces the current five-year or 60,000-mile warranty, which is standard for full-size pickup trucks. The decision comes as vehicle prices have increased, leading to longer financing periods. Ram CEO Tim Kuniskis emphasizes the need to protect customers' investments with extended coverage, given that most truck buyers finance for seven years or more.</p>

Meta's CEO, Mark Zuckerberg, is reportedly investing heavily in AI talent for its "superintelligence" AI lab, following delays in the release of Meta's latest flagship AI model.

          <p>The U.K. Parliament voted to decriminalize abortion in England and Wales, preventing women from facing criminal charges for ending a pregnancy. The House of Commons approved an amendment to a crime bill, motivated by concerns over the prosecution of women, including those who experienced miscarriages. Tonia Antoniazzi, who introduced the amendment, emphasized that the legislation aims to remove vulnerable women from the criminal justice system. Anti-abortion groups opposed the measure, arguing it would remove protections for unborn babies and leave women vulnerable to abuse.</p>

The Japan National Tourism Organization attributes the surge to strong travel demand, school holidays in some markets, and increased visitors from China, the Philippines, and the United States.

The CDC emphasizes that the MMR vaccine remains the best protection against measles and its complications, noting that symptoms are generally milder in vaccinated individuals.

          <p>The article explores why straight men are often perceived as being "bad" at gossip, which is defined as sharing detailed and engaging stories about others. Research suggests that men and women gossip at similar rates, but women tend to gossip more neutrally, giving them more practice in social storytelling. The article suggests that men's reticence to engage in gossip stems from a fear of appearing "messy" or lacking social credibility. Improving men's ability to gossip could help combat the male loneliness epidemic by fostering intimacy and stronger social bonds.</p>

          <p>As tariffs increase, businesses are using "tariff engineering" to reduce duty liabilities by altering product materials, dimensions, or compositions to fit into different harmonized system codes. This practice involves strategic design choices to create products subject to lower tariff classifications and duty rates. Companies in sectors like fast-moving consumer goods, garments, apparel, and footwear can relatively easily implement tariff engineering, while more heavily regulated sectors such as automotive, aerospace, and electronics face greater challenges due to the need for extensive validation and approval. However, companies must tread a fine line between redesigning products and fraudulently misrepresenting product classifications.</p>

          <p>AbbVie announced that its migraine drug, Qulipta, met the primary endpoint in a head-to-head late-stage trial, demonstrating superiority over the generic treatment topiramate. The study aimed to show a lower discontinuation rate due to undesired effects from Qulipta compared to topiramate, with Qulipta being stopped in 12.1% of patients versus 29.6% for the generic. The study also met all secondary goals, with 64.1% of patients on Qulipta experiencing a 50% or more reduction in migraine headache days, compared to 39.3% on topiramate. Qulipta, first approved in the United States in 2021, generated $658 million in international sales last year.</p>

          <p>The article suggests three high-yield dividend stocks in the energy sector to consider for passive income: ExxonMobil, ConocoPhillips, and Kinder Morgan. ExxonMobil offers a reliable dividend with a strong track record, while ConocoPhillips has upside potential from higher oil prices and an efficient asset base. Kinder Morgan benefits from increased energy consumption and has opportunities to invest in LNG and low-carbon fuels. The author recommends these stocks for investors looking to balance their portfolios and generate passive income. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>Honda has successfully tested an experimental reusable rocket, marking its entry into the space sector. The test flight, conducted on Hokkaido, Japan, reached an altitude of nearly 300 meters, with the prototype landing close to its designated spot. Honda aims to develop the technology for a suborbital launch by 2029, driven by the increasing demand for satellite launch rockets. The company plans to leverage its existing technologies from various products and automated driving systems to develop reusable rockets for satellite-based communication and environmental monitoring.</p>

          <div class="timestamp">2025-06-18 07:09:36 EDT</div>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>The U.K. Parliament has voted to decriminalize some late-term abortions, barring women in England and Wales from being prosecuted for terminating their own pregnancies, regardless of the term or trimester. The new legislation aims to provide care and support to women rather than criminalization, recognizing the need for compassionate approaches. While abortion is allowed up to 24 weeks of pregnancy under certain conditions, the new law changes the rules governing abortions in a clinical setting. This is the biggest change to British abortion laws since the Abortion Act of 1967.</p>
