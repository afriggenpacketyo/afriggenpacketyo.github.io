          <p>House Speaker Mike Johnson is determined to bring the budget bill, which failed in committee, to the House floor before Memorial Day. Johnson emphasized the bill's significance and the need to pass it swiftly, despite resistance from some Republicans concerned about Medicaid requirements and spending. He acknowledged potential delays due to states' difficulties in implementing new eligibility rules but expressed confidence in reaching a resolution. Johnson also mentioned Treasury Secretary Scott Bessent's urgency to pass the bill by July 4 and said he has been in contact with Senate Majority Leader John Thune to ensure the bill's passage in the Senate.</p>

          <p>Saturday Night Live's 50th season has been creatively and numerically successful, leading to questions about the show's future and ability to maintain relevance. Despite rumors of cast departures, the season finale unfolded in a typical fashion, with the show finishing as the top broadcast entertainment program among viewers aged 18 to 49, averaging 8.2 million viewers each week across all platforms. The article explores potential changes to the show, including who might replace Weekend Update hosts Colin Jost and Michael Che, and how SNL can continue to make news and lampoon modern politics effectively. The success of the 50th-anniversary celebrations has quieted rumors about Lorne Michaels' retirement, at least for another season.</p>

          <p>Princess Eugenie has spoken about her experiences with scoliosis surgery as a child, including the physical and emotional challenges she faced during recovery. She felt embarrassed before the operation and struggled with the emotional impact of post-surgery care, but her mother helped her view the scar as a "badge of honour." The princess wore a wedding dress that showed her scar in 2018, emphasizing the importance of showing "people your scars" and changing perceptions of beauty. Scoliosis is a condition where the spine twists and curves to the side, often starting in children aged between 10 and 15.</p>

          <p>Howard White, a founding father of the Jordan Brand, recounts Nike's decision to bet on Michael Jordan 40 years ago, a move that revolutionized the sneaker industry. Nike offered Jordan $2.5 million, triple what anyone else in the league was making, and the Air Jordan became a massive success, generating $126 million in sales in its first year. Jason Mayden, chief design officer for the Jordan Brand, emphasizes the importance of connectivity and visionary design in the brand's marketing approach.

          <p>The article explores the tradition of Hawaiian lei making, an ancient practice introduced by early Polynesian settlers, where leis are given as an expression of aloha. Lei maker Meleana Estes learned the art from her grandmother and emphasizes the intentionality behind each lei. However, the future of lei making is in peril due to suburban sprawl, climate change, and the fact that 90% of flowers used are now imported. Andrew Mau, who owns a lei boutique, adapts by using alternative materials like unripe fruit and wood beads to create "forever leis."</p>

          <p>Following a stock market rebound, investment experts are advising investors to diversify their portfolios, particularly into international equities and real assets like gold and Bitcoin. Despite historical trends favoring U.S. stocks, concerns about high valuations in the S&P 500 and potential recession risks make diversification a prudent strategy. Experts suggest considering China and India as part of an international diversification plan, highlighting China's economic stimulus and India's strong growth potential. Investors are also advised to be mindful of concentration within their U.S. stock holdings and consider investing in "quality" stock funds (not investment advice).</p>

While warnings of potential drought conditions exist, growers have irrigation systems in place to mitigate the effects of extreme weather. The article also provides suggestions on how to enhance the flavor of strawberries, such as pairing them with black pepper or balsamic vinegar.</p>
