          <p>Kensington Palace marked Prince William's 43rd birthday by posting a photo of him with the family's Cocker spaniel, Orla, and her puppies. The photo, taken by the Princess of Wales in Windsor, was signed "with love" by Catherine, their children, and "the puppies". The Royal Family's official account also shared a message and photo of Prince William visiting farmers on the Duchy of Cornwall. Orla was gifted to the couple by Catherine's brother in 2020 after the death of their previous dog, Lupo, and recently gave birth to four puppies. The image portrays a relaxed and informal moment for the Prince amidst recent formal occasions. The photo of Prince William with his puppies exudes a peaceful and comforting tone. </p>

          <div class="timestamp">2025-06-21 04:47:45 EDT</div>
        </div>
        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Japan has been proactively building supply chain resilience, particularly in rare earth minerals, after experiencing an export ban from China in 2010 following a territorial dispute. Japan has reduced its reliance on Chinese rare earths to below 60% through stockpiling, recycling, investing in non-China projects like Australia's Lynas, and promoting alternative technologies. Western officials see Japan's approach as a template for other nations, but recognize the difficulty in escaping China's dominance. Despite progress, Japan still relies on China for heavy rare earth elements, highlighting the ongoing challenge of diversifying supply chains. The Japanese model demonstrates a proactive approach to mitigating supply chain risks.</p>

          <p>Shohei Ohtani contributed an RBI single as the Los Angeles Dodgers defeated the Washington Nationals 6-5. Ohtani went 1-for-3 with two walks, showing no lingering effects from being hit by a fastball in the previous game. Miguel Rojas also starred, hitting a two-run homer. Manager Dave Roberts served a one-game suspension related to a previous game's altercation, while Ohtani is still scheduled to pitch against Washington. Ohtani's performance and Rojas's home run were key to the Dodgers' victory, setting a positive tone for the series.</p>

          <p>A Scottish schoolgirl's message in a bottle, sent in 1994, was discovered in Norway over three decades later. Alaina Beresford, then 12, sent the message as part of a school project, and it was found by a volunteer cleaning up a Norwegian island. The volunteer, Pia Brodtmann, sent a postcard to Alaina, who was stunned to receive it at the same address after so many years. Alaina's handwritten letter, sent in an empty fizzy drink bottle, requested information about the finder and their location. This discovery highlights the enduring nature of human connection and the surprises that can emerge across time and distance.</p>

          <p>Dame Esther Rantzen has appealed to the House of Lords not to block the Terminally Ill Adults Bill, which would give terminally ill adults in England and Wales the right to an assisted death. The bill was backed by MPs but faces opposition in the Lords, where some fear it could lead to coercion of vulnerable people. Rantzen, who joined Dignitas after being diagnosed with terminal lung cancer, emphasized that the Lords' role is to scrutinize, not oppose, the will of the elected chamber. The proposed legislation includes safeguards such as multiple declarations, independent doctor assessments, and a multi-disciplinary panel review to prevent abuse.</p>

          <p>The House of Commons has backed a bill to allow assisted dying in England and Wales, marking a significant social change. The bill now moves to the House of Lords, where it faces potential amendments, delays, or rejection. The government anticipates a "commencement period" before any assisted deaths occur, estimating hundreds will seek this option initially, potentially rising to 4,000 annually after a decade. This decision reflects a socially liberal shift in Parliament, although the vote was closely contested. The future of the bill now rests with the House of Lords.</p>
