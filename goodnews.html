          <p>Conservative leader Friedrich Merz has won a parliament vote to become Germany's next chancellor at the second attempt, overcoming an initial defeat. The first vote saw Merz fall six votes short of the absolute majority he needed, a significant blow to his prestige and an unprecedented failure in post-war German history. His coalition with the Social Democrats should have had enough seats in parliament from the start, but it appears some members dissented during the first vote. Merz, 69, will now be sworn in as chancellor by President Frank-Walter Steinmeier, and his team of 17 ministers will take office.</p>

          <p>Nearly 30,000 ceramic poppies are on display at the Tower of London to commemorate the 80th anniversary of Victory in Europe Day. The installation, named The Tower Remembers, is designed to reflect the loss of life through war and provide a space for remembrance. The poppies are positioned to resemble a cascading "wound" at the heart of the Norman fortress, which was bombed during the Blitz. Visitors can view the poppies as part of a general admission ticket to the Tower of London until Armistice Day on November 11.</p>

          <p>The UK and India have finalized a trade deal after three years of negotiations, aiming to reduce tariffs and boost trade between the two countries. The agreement will make it easier for UK firms to export goods like whisky and cars to India, while cutting taxes on India's clothing and footwear exports. The UK government stated that the deal does not include changes to immigration policy. Both Prime Ministers hailed the agreement as a landmark achievement that will stimulate economic growth and create jobs in both countries.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>A new study suggests that the shingles vaccine may offer additional health benefits beyond preventing the viral infection, including a reduced risk of heart disease. The study found that people who received the vaccine had a 23% lower risk of cardiovascular events, such as stroke and heart failure, for up to eight years. The protective effect was particularly noticeable in men, people under 60, and those with unhealthy lifestyles. Experts suggest the vaccine's impact on inflammation may contribute to the reduced heart disease risk.</p>

          <p>Ultima Espino, a 35-year-old woman, developed symptoms of osteoporosis after giving birth, leading to multiple unexplained bone fractures and the need for a walker. She was diagnosed with pregnancy and lactation-associated osteoporosis (PLO), a rare form of the disease. The condition was attributed to a genetic predisposition to osteoporosis combined with overproduction of milk during pregnancy, leading to calcium loss. Espino has been receiving bone growth injections and taking calcium supplements to improve her bone density.</p>
