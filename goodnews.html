          <p>The New York Times reviewed a guest list and social media posts to reveal the attendees of President Trump's exclusive dinner and White House tour for top holders of his $TRUMP memecoin. Invitees included Justin Sun, a Chinese billionaire previously sued by the SEC, and various crypto executives. Trump's leveraging of his position for financial gain through his crypto business raised eyebrows, and the event highlighted the intersection of cryptocurrency and political influence. Matthew Liu, co-founder of Origin, defended the event, emphasizing its focus on industry growth and collaboration with regulators. The digital world had become physical, as attendees' names and contact information were delineated on paper lists, checked by staffers at the door.</p>

          <p>The White House is undergoing a restructuring of the National Security Council, significantly reducing its size and reassigning staff, according to CBS News sources. This follows President Trump's appointment of Marco Rubio as National Security Advisor, replacing Mike Waltz. Vice President JD Vance's national security advisor, Andy Baker, is set to take on a top role in the restructured NSC as deputy national security advisor, along with White House deputy chief of staff Robert Gabriel. The move reflects Trump's preference for a top-down approach to foreign policy, with fewer staff involved in the decision-making process. Some former NSC members expressed concern that fewer personnel could lead to less control over the bureaucracy.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>A new study in Global Change Biology reveals that the increasing use of hummingbird feeders has led to changes in the size and shape of Anna's Hummingbird beaks, according to NPR. The beaks have become longer and more slender to better access nectar from feeders, while males' beaks have grown pointier for fighting off competition. This adaptation has also allowed the hummingbirds to expand their range northward into cooler climates. Researchers tracked hummingbird feeder mentions in newspaper archives and studied museum specimens to observe these evolutionary changes. This shows how human actions can rapidly influence the evolution of organisms, although the long-term consequences remain uncertain.</p>

          <p>President Trump announced his endorsement of a plan for a partnership between U.S. Steel and Nippon Steel, which had previously been blocked by the Biden administration, according to the New York Times.

While the specifics of the deal remain unclear, Trump's announcement suggests an investment by Nippon Steel rather than an outright acquisition.

          <p>ABC News reports that a federal judge has temporarily blocked the Trump administration from revoking Harvard University's ability to enroll international students. Harvard sued the administration, alleging the move was a violation of the First Amendment. The Trump administration had claimed the school lost its ability to use the Student and Exchange Visitor Program (SEVP) due to non-compliance with information requests. Harvard President Alan Garber called the order a "critical step" to protect the rights of international students.
