          <p>The Trump administration has returned a Guatemalan man to the United States after a judge ruled he was wrongly deported without due process. The man, identified as O.C.G. in court documents, had sought asylum in the U.S. following violent attacks in Guatemala. After being deported and then returning, an immigration judge initially barred his deportation, but O.C.G. was subsequently sent to Mexico without due process, where he was allegedly held for ransom and sexually assaulted. The Justice Department admitted errors in their initial account of his removal, leading to the judge mandating his return to the U.S., where he will now seek protection from persecution.</p>

          <p>Egypt's foreign minister has assured Greece that Egypt will safeguard the historic Saint Catherine's Monastery, following a court ruling that raised concerns about the monastery's land ownership. The court affirmed the monks' right to use the monastery and religious sites in the area, despite ruling that the land is public property. Greece's foreign minister traveled to Cairo to discuss the matter, and both countries agreed to work together to protect the monastery's rights and legal status. Established in the sixth century, Saint Catherine's Monastery is the world's oldest continually inhabited Christian monastery and holds significant religious and historical importance.</p>

          <p>A researcher is disputing claims that a fungus labeled a "potential agroterrorism weapon" in a recent arrest is a significant threat, arguing that it is already widespread in the U.S. Yunqing Jian and Zunyong Liu were charged with attempting to smuggle strains of Fusarium graminearum into the United States for research purposes. Harold Kistler, an adjunct professor at the University of Minnesota, states that F. graminearum is prevalent across the U.S. and causes a common crop disease called Fusarium head blight. Farmers use various methods to mitigate the risk of the fungus, and the FDA monitors toxins produced by it.</p>
