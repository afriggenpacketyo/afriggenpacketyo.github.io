          <p>A New York Times article reports that federal transportation safety officials are investigating after two commercial flights had to abort landings at Ronald Reagan Washington National Airport due to an Army Black Hawk helicopter entering restricted airspace. Air traffic controllers instructed Delta Air Lines Flight 1671 and Republic Airways Flight 5825 to abort their landings. The FAA had restricted nonessential helicopter traffic around the airport after a fatal collision in January. Transportation Secretary Sean Duffy expressed outrage, and Senator Ted Cruz called for legislation to improve civilian air safety. The Army stated that the incident is under investigation and that they are committed to aviation safety.</p>

          <p>The South China Morning Post reports that China has passed a new law to promote the private economy, set to take effect on May 20. This law is designed to provide legal recourse for private firms, particularly against local-level governments, and protect them from arbitrary fines and asset seizures. Observers and entrepreneurs are closely watching how the law will be implemented and whether it will effectively curb administrative powers and ensure fair treatment in legal cases. The law forbids administrative measures to intervene in economic disputes and unscrupulous fine collections.</p>

          <p>NPR reports that a federal judge has struck down President Trump's executive order targeting the law firm Perkins Coie, deeming it unconstitutional. Judge Beryl Howell found the order to be an attack on the independence of the legal profession and the judicial system. The order had imposed punitive measures on Perkins Coie for representing clients and causes that Trump disliked. The judge framed the targeting of Perkins as an attack on the foundational principles of the American legal system. Perkins Coie welcomed the ruling, affirming core constitutional freedoms.</p>
