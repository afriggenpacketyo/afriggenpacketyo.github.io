          <p>The Chinese central government is requiring local administrations to justify any annual increase in company fines exceeding 20%, aiming to curb illegal investigations and profit-seeking behaviors targeting private enterprises. This directive is part of a broader economic recovery effort initiated in March, addressing issues like arbitrary fines, inconsistent enforcement standards, and abuse of power, which are major concerns for businesses. Hu Weilie, China‚Äôs vice-minister of justice, emphasized the campaign's success hinges on truly correcting these problems through real-time nationwide statistical analysis of enforcement activity, focusing on unusual increases in punitive fees. The Justice Ministry hopes this initiative will foster a more stable and predictable business environment.</p>

          <p>New York City's subway system is piloting artificial intelligence to improve security and reduce crime by analyzing real-time camera feeds to detect suspicious behaviors.

Michael Kemper, the MTA's chief security officer, is leading the initiative, emphasizing that facial recognition technology will not be used.

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>President Trump has repeatedly claimed record-breaking military recruitment figures, attributing the success to his reelection. However, military data indicates that enlistments began rebounding before the election, with experts crediting Biden-era recruitment reforms. While enlistments have increased year-over-year, they remain below previous peaks, and the Army adjusted its goals after falling short in prior years. Experts highlight the impact of programs like the Army's Future Soldier Prep Course and a recent pay increase for junior enlisted troops as key factors in the recruitment improvements, rather than solely partisan politics.</p>
