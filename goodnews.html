          <h2>WTA to Provide Ranking Protection for Players Freezing Eggs</h2>
          <div class="timestamp">2025-06-11 14:59:26 EDT</div>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>The Women's Tennis Association (WTA) will now offer ranking protection to female tennis players ranked in the top 750 who choose to freeze their eggs or embryos, provided they spend more than 10 weeks away from competition. This new rule aims to alleviate the pressure on players to return to the court prematurely after undergoing the procedure. Sloane Stephens, a former US Open champion, shared her personal experience of rushing back to tennis after freezing her eggs and emphasized the importance of this protected ranking for players' health and well-being, allowing them ample recovery time without jeopardizing their careers. This initiative is seen as a positive step towards supporting female athletes' family planning decisions. The context of the WTA's decision stems from a growing awareness of the challenges faced by female athletes balancing their careers and personal lives.</p>

          <p>After declining for three consecutive months, inflation rose again in May to 2.4%, according to the Bureau of Labor Statistics, which could potentially impact gold prices. Historically, inflation and gold prices have shown a positive correlation, with gold often used as a hedge against inflation. However, this relationship is not always consistent, as demonstrated by recent months where gold prices rose despite declining inflation due to other economic factors like market uncertainty. While the minimal 0.1% increase in inflation may not guarantee a rise in gold prices, investors are advised to consider multiple factors when making investment decisions, with gold limited to 10% or less of their overall portfolio to avoid overcrowding other assets at the same time.

          <p>Starbucks is piloting a new banana-flavored protein cold foam at five U.S. locations, aiming to tap into the growing popularity of protein-enhanced beverages and snacks. This test is part of Starbucks' broader strategy to reimagine its menu and introduce innovative products through its "Starting Five" program. As part of this menu redesign, Starbucks plans to reduce its food and beverage offerings by 30% by the end of Fiscal Year 2025 to streamline operations and enhance customer experience. The move comes as Starbucks seeks to boost sales and revitalize its brand under the "Back to Starbucks" restructuring plan, which includes operational and aesthetic upgrades. The coffee chain hopes to increase sales and customer loyalty by simplifying the menu.</p>

          <p>Elon Musk publicly stated his regret for some of his recent social media posts directed at President Donald Trump, admitting they "went too far." This follows a public dispute between Musk and Trump, which had disrupted their close partnership and raised concerns about the future of Musk's companies, Tesla and SpaceX. The conflict originated from Musk's opposition to the "One Big Beautiful Bill Act," a Trump-backed tax and spending bill that Musk claimed would undermine the Department of Government Efficiency (DOGE). The initial disagreement led to a drop in Tesla's stock value, but shares have since recovered, and Trump indicated a willingness to speak with Musk despite their differences.</p>

She also humorously mentioned the appeal of seeing "hot girls get to make out with each other" in AEW storylines, referencing a recent event at Double or Nothing.

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Following President Trump's implementation of tariffs, the U.S. Treasury collected a record $22 billion in tariff payments in May, signaling the financial impact of these trade policies. While these revenues represent a small fraction of the federal government's overall income, House Republicans are considering using them to offset projected losses from their proposed tax and spending bill. However, concerns remain about whether tariff revenues can adequately compensate for the potential economic consequences of the tax cuts, with some analysts suggesting that the costs could ultimately be passed on to consumers through higher prices or reflected in narrower profit margins for companies. The debate highlights the complex interplay between trade policy, government revenue, and economic stability. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>Google has offered buyouts to employees in several divisions, including Search, Ads, and central engineering, as part of ongoing efforts to reduce headcount since the 2023 layoffs. The "voluntary exit program" is available to U.S.-based employees, and some teams are also requiring remote workers to return to the office.
