          <p>A helicopter crew conducted a dramatic rescue of two hikers who became stranded on a remote beach near Elephant Rock at Point Reyes National Seashore. The pair called for help after realizing that rising tides had completely cut off their only path back to safety. Responders used a 100-foot line to hoist the hikers from the shore, flying them to the Marin County Fire Department without any reported injuries. Officials warn that Point Reyes has many coastal hazards, including sneaker waves and unstable cliffs, and advise visitors to check tide charts and carry emergency communication devices.</p>

          <p>Australia will acquire 11 advanced Mogami-class frigates from Japan's Mitsubishi Heavy Industries in a deal worth approximately $6.5 billion. Australian Defense Minister Richard Marles described it as the largest defense-industry agreement ever made between the two nations, reflecting a close strategic alignment in the Indo-Pacific. The deal is part of Australia's broader military restructuring aimed at developing long-range strike capabilities in response to China's military expansion. This marks Japan's first warship export since before World War II, a significant move given its post-war pacifist constitution.</p>

          <p>United Parcel Service (UPS) has agreed to a $1.7 million settlement to resolve a lawsuit from 45 California counties alleging the company improperly disposed of hazardous materials. The lawsuit claimed that UPS discarded corrosive, ignitable, and toxic waste in regular trash bins, which were then sent to landfills unequipped to handle such materials. Investigators from several district attorney's offices conducted a years-long probe into 140 UPS locations. UPS cooperated with the investigation and has since implemented new waste management systems and employee training programs across its California facilities.</p>

          <p>It is currently peak mating season for tarantulas in California, a time when the normally reclusive male spiders leave their burrows in search of a mate. Experts note that sightings are common at dusk in chaparral, desert, and mountain areas across Southern California, including popular spots like Joshua Tree and Griffith Park. While their appearance can be startling, tarantulas are generally harmless to humans unless provoked and possess a mild venom. They may defend themselves by flicking irritant hairs from their bodies, so observers are advised to keep a respectful distance.</p>

The ad buy covers every major California market as well as national media hubs like New York and Washington, D.C. As a "conservative Democrat," Cloobeck aims to boost his name recognition in a crowded field with no clear front-runner, especially after former Vice President Kamala Harris declined to run. Cloobeck, who made his fortune in the timeshare industry, has long been a major donor to the Democratic party.</p>

          <p>Philadelphia Eagles running back Saquon Barkley has declined an invitation to serve on President Trump's revitalized council on sports, fitness, and nutrition. Barkley, who was listed alongside other prominent sports figures, confirmed he turned down the offer due to his busy schedule and after consulting with his family. The council was reestablished as part of a recent executive order that also brought back the Presidential Fitness Test for schools. Barkley, who has previously golfed with both Trump and Barack Obama, stated that while he appreciates the offer, he was surprised to be mentioned for the role.</p>

          <p>The remains of an auroch, an extinct species of large wild cattle from the Bronze Age, have been discovered by archaeologists in a cave system near Ingleborough in the Yorkshire Dales. The discovery was made as part of a larger project exploring the prehistoric use of the area, which also uncovered evidence of Neolithic human burials. The findings provide new insights into how ancient peoples lived and farmed in the region. The project highlights the crucial role of recreational cavers, who often make initial discoveries in hard-to-access underground locations.</p>

          <p>New research from the American Cancer Society indicates that expanded screening recommendations are leading to more diagnoses of early-stage colorectal cancer in people aged 45 to 49. Following the lowering of the recommended screening age to 45, one study found that screenings in this age group increased by 62% between 2019 and 2023. A second study showed a corresponding sharp rise in the detection of localized, treatable cancers. While researchers called the findings promising, they noted that screening rates among younger adults remain suboptimal and inequitable across insurance and education levels.</p>

          <p>According to CNBC's Jim Cramer, the stock market's strong rebound on Monday was driven by the impressive earnings reports from the "Magnificent Seven" tech companies. He pointed to "flawless" results from Microsoft and strong performance across the board from Alphabet, Meta, Apple, and Amazon as the core of the market's resilience. Cramer suggested that even with Tesla's vehicle business struggling, the tech giants are so dominant and cash-rich that they are difficult to bet against. This strength overshadowed concerns from a weak jobs report. (not investment advice)</p>

The bulk of the savings came from successfully blocking an attempt to freeze federal funding.

          <p>The UK's National Institute for Health and Care Excellence (NICE) has issued new guidance recommending that patients receive structured support for at least a year after stopping obesity medications like Wegovy. This advice for the NHS comes as experience shows many people regain most of the weight they lost once treatment ends. The guidance emphasizes that weight management is a long-term process, and patients need a plan that includes healthy eating, exercise, and behavioral support to maintain their progress. An estimated 1.5 million people in the UK are on these jabs.</p>
