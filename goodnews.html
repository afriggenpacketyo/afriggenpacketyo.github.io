          <p>Alphabet reported second-quarter revenue and earnings that exceeded analyst expectations, driven by strong performance in its Google Cloud and advertising units. The company's overall revenue grew 14% year-over-year, with its cloud business seeing a 32% increase, bolstered by a new partnership with OpenAI. Despite the positive results, Alphabet announced it will raise its capital expenditure forecast for 2025 by $10 billion to $85 billion, signaling a deeper investment in its artificial intelligence infrastructure and talent acquisition to meet growing demand.

          <p>South Korea's economy grew by 0.6% in the second quarter, surpassing economists' expectations and successfully avoiding a technical recession. This growth marked a significant reversal from the 0.2% contraction experienced in the first quarter of the year. The expansion comes as the nation navigates crucial trade negotiations with the United States, with potential tariffs looming over its export-driven economy. The Bank of Korea has maintained its interest rates, prioritizing financial stability despite forecasts of low growth and stable inflation near its 2% target. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>South Korean chipmaker SK Hynix announced record-breaking second-quarter financial results, with operating profit soaring 68% and revenue hitting an all-time high. The surge was driven by sustained, strong demand for its high bandwidth memory (HBM) technology, which is a critical component in chipsets used for generative artificial intelligence. As a leading supplier to major tech companies like Nvidia, SK Hynix's performance underscores the ongoing boom in the AI sector. The company's revenue rose by approximately 35% compared to the same period last year, significantly outperforming market estimates. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>Philadelphia Eagles quarterback Jalen Hurts has stated that he does not plan to wear his recently unveiled Super Bowl LIX championship ring, signaling his focus is entirely on the upcoming season. Despite being named the MVP of the game where the Eagles defeated the Kansas City Chiefs, Hurts emphasized that he has "moved on to the new year." The custom-designed rings, which feature 12 carats of diamonds, celebrate the franchise's second Super Bowl victory. Hurts' comments were made as the reigning champions opened their training camp, underscoring his forward-looking mentality rather than dwelling on past achievements.</p>

          <p>A new comprehensive analysis published in The Lancet Public Health suggests that taking 7,000 steps per day is associated with significant health benefits, challenging the more commonly cited 10,000-step goal. The research, which reviewed dozens of studies, found that a 7,000-step count was linked to a 47% lower risk of death and substantial reductions in the risk of dementia, heart disease, and type 2 diabetes compared to taking only 2,000 steps. The authors propose that 7,000 steps could be a more realistic and achievable public health target, while still offering clinically meaningful improvements in long-term health outcomes.</p>

          <p>Southwest Airlines reported a 42% drop in second-quarter profit, with earnings and revenue falling short of Wall Street estimates. However, the carrier announced that travel demand has stabilized after a weaker-than-expected start to the year, a sentiment echoed by other major airlines. The company is currently overhauling its business model, moving away from policies like open seating and introducing new fare structures to improve revenue. Southwest expects its third-quarter unit revenue to be relatively flat compared to last year and has also announced a new $2 billion share buyback program. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>Recent comments from In-N-Out owner Lynsi Snyder about her personal move to Tennessee sparked widespread, incorrect rumors that the fast-food chain was relocating its headquarters out of California. The company has since clarified that its corporate operations are being consolidated in Baldwin Park, California, where the chain was founded in 1948. Snyder's remarks about the difficulties of raising a family and doing business in the state were amplified in a political context, causing concern among loyal Californian customers. In-N-Out is, however, expanding its operations eastward and has established a second headquarters in Tennessee.</p>

          <h2>The Word 'OK' Traced Back to a 19th-Century Joke and a Presidential Campaign</h2>
          <div class="timestamp">2025-07-23 17:27:00 EDT</div>
        </div>
        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>This article explores the origins of the word "OK," one of the most universally understood terms on the planet. Most scholars trace its first appearance to a Boston newspaper in 1839, where it was used as a jocular abbreviation for "oll korrect," a deliberate misspelling of "all correct." The term gained widespread popularity during President Martin Van Buren's 1840 reelection campaign, as his nickname "Old Kinderhook" conveniently aligned with the letters O.K. Its simplicity and versatility helped it spread globally, particularly through its use in telegraphy and by American soldiers in the 20th century.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>President Donald Trump has indicated that his administration is considering the elimination of capital gains taxes on profits from home sales. Currently, sellers face taxes on profits exceeding $250,000 for individuals or $500,000 for married couples, a threshold that an increasing number of homeowners now surpass due to rising property values. The proposal, which follows a similar bill from Rep. Marjorie Taylor Greene, aims to boost the housing market and provide financial relief to long-term homeowners. Tax policy experts suggest that raising the exemption is more likely than a full elimination. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>An article featuring advice from cardiologists highlights the critical importance of avoiding a sedentary lifestyle to reduce the risk of developing dangerous blood clots. According to medical experts, regular physical activity improves circulation and prevents blood from pooling in the veins, a major contributor to clot formation. In addition to regular movement, cardiologists recommend staying well-hydrated and being aware of personal risk factors such as obesity, diabetes, and a history of smoking. The article stresses that while blood clots are a normal bodily function, abnormal clotting can be life-threatening and requires preventative measures.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>A bipartisan group of senators, including Republicans Susan Collins and Lisa Murkowski, has introduced legislation to exempt U.S. small businesses from President Trump's tariffs on Canadian imports. The bill, named the CANADA Act, comes as the administration threatens to impose a blanket 35% tariff on Canadian goods by August 1. Lawmakers from border states argue that the tariffs harm small businesses that rely on cross-border trade, drive up costs for consumers, and damage the long-standing economic relationship between the two countries. The legislation targets existing and potential tariffs on goods imported by or for small business concerns. (not investment advice)</p>
