          <p>In response to falling beef prices and strong competition from imports, China has introduced a new plan to strengthen its domestic cattle industry and encourage consumption. The policy, announced by several government departments, aims to increase high-quality beef production and implement a new quality-grading system for local meat. This initiative is part of a broader strategy to enhance the appeal of domestic agricultural products and address a national dietary imbalance with insufficient high-quality protein intake.

          <p>United Parcel Service (UPS) has agreed to a $1.7 million settlement in a lawsuit brought by 45 California counties over allegations of improper hazardous waste disposal. The lawsuit claimed that UPS facilities were discarding corrosive, ignitable, and toxic materials into regular trash bins, which were then sent to landfills not equipped to handle such waste. UPS cooperated with the investigation and has since implemented new waste management systems and employee training programs across its California locations to ensure compliance.</p>

          <p>Shares of American Eagle Outfitters surged over 20% after President Donald Trump endorsed the company's controversial ad campaign starring actress Sydney Sweeney. Trump praised the ad on his Truth Social platform, calling it the "HOTTEST" out there and noting that the jeans were "flying off the shelves." The campaign had previously faced backlash from some critics who accused its wordplay on "genes" of promoting eugenics, a claim the company has denied. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>President Donald Trump's public praise for an American Eagle ad featuring actress Sydney Sweeney has ignited both a stock market rally and a cultural debate. Trump lauded the ad after some social media users criticized its wordplay on "genes" as echoing eugenics rhetoric, a controversy that American Eagle dismissed. The president's endorsement, in which he noted Sweeney is a registered Republican, caused the company's stock to surge, highlighting the intersection of celebrity, politics, and consumer marketing.</p>

          <p>New research from the American Cancer Society reveals a significant rise in early-stage colorectal cancer diagnoses among people aged 45-49, directly linked to increased screening rates. Following recommendations to lower the screening age to 45, screenings in this demographic jumped 62% between 2019 and 2023. This has corresponded with a sharp increase in the detection of localized cancers, which researchers call promising news, though they caution that screening rates among younger adults remain suboptimal and inequitable.</p>

          <p>The United Kingdom has enacted tighter controls on firearms licensing, a change championed by Emma Ambler, whose twin sister and two nieces were murdered with a legally held gun in 2020. The new rules, which came into law on August 5, require two character references for shotgun certificate applications and mandate that police investigate applicants for signs of domestic abuse or dishonesty. Ambler expressed hope that these strengthened regulations will prevent similar tragedies by ensuring only suitable individuals can access firearms.</p>
