          <p>A New York appeals court has nullified the more than $454 million judgment against Donald Trump, his family, and his company in their civil fraud case. The court deemed the financial penalty, originally imposed by Judge Arthur Engoron for inflating asset values to secure better business deals, to be excessive. The original ruling had found Trump and his co-defendants liable for a decade of business fraud, which they have consistently denied, claiming the case was politically motivated. This decision reverses a significant financial and legal blow to the former president, though the case may be subject to further appeals.</p>

          <p>Walmart has increased its full-year sales and earnings forecast, driven by another quarter of strong double-digit growth in its e-commerce division. Despite topping Wall Street's sales estimates, the company's earnings per share fell short for the first time since 2022, citing one-time expenses and rising costs from tariffs. Chief Financial Officer John David Rainey stated that while the company is absorbing some tariff costs, others are being passed to consumers, though customer spending has remained resilient. The retailer's performance provides a key insight into consumer health amid economic pressures. (not investment advice)</p>

          <h2>New Research Questions the Efficacy of Wolf Hunting in Protecting Livestock</h2>
          <div class="timestamp">2025-08-21 11:07:51 EDT</div>
        </div>
        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>A recent study published in Science Advances suggests that public wolf hunting in the Western U.S. has a minimal impact on reducing livestock losses for ranchers. Researchers analyzed data from Montana, Idaho, Oregon, and Washington and found that killing a wolf saved only a small fraction of a single cow, meaning roughly 14 wolves would need to be killed to prevent one livestock death. The study also found that hunting did not decrease the number of government-led removals of problematic wolves. These findings challenge the long-held assumption that reducing wolf populations directly and effectively mitigates human-wildlife conflict for ranchers.</p>

As a new celebrity ambassador for the company, she aims to reduce the stigma associated with these drugs, emphasizing that using them is a form of self-care, not an "easy way out."

          <p>Arsenal is expected to sign Crystal Palace and England forward Eberechi Eze, reportedly swooping in after their North London rivals, Tottenham Hotspur, had already agreed to terms. The deal materialized quickly after an injury concern arose for Arsenal's Kai Havertz, prompting the club to act on its long-standing interest in Eze. A key factor in the decision was reportedly Eze's childhood connection to Arsenal, having played in their academy. This transfer is seen as a major coup for Arsenal supporters, not only for acquiring a talented player but also for besting their rivals in the process.</p>

          <p>Italian police divers have performed their annual maintenance on the famous underwater statue, "Christ of the Abyss," located on the seabed off the coast of Portofino. Using pressurized water hoses, the team carefully removed a year's worth of accumulated crustaceans and bacteria from the 2.5-meter bronze sculpture. The statue was placed in the bay of San Fruttuoso in 1954 as a memorial for those who have died at sea and has become one of the Mediterranean's most popular dive spots. This cleaning method is environmentally safe, as it uses seawater to dislodge microorganisms without damaging the statue or the marine ecosystem.</p>

        </div>
        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Financial experts suggest that homeowners can use home equity loans to save money, particularly for consolidating high-interest debt or funding value-adding home improvements. With home equity at record levels and interest rates on credit cards near all-time highs, a fixed-rate home equity loan can offer a lower-cost borrowing alternative. Using the loan for debt consolidation can reduce monthly payments and interest costs, while using it for renovations can increase a home's value and potentially offer tax deductions. However, experts caution against using these loans for luxury spending or daily expenses, as they are secured by your home. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>Lyle and Erik Menendez, convicted of murdering their parents in 1989, are scheduled for parole hearings this week after their life sentences were reduced. The brothers, who were 21 and 18 at the time of the crime, have always maintained they acted in self-defense after years of severe sexual and emotional abuse by their father. Their sentences were resentenced to 50 years to life following the presentation of new evidence supporting their abuse claims and renewed public interest. Now in their 50s, they are eligible for parole under California's youthful offender law, with a decision expected shortly after their hearings.</p>

          <p>The average interest rate for a five-year fixed mortgage in the UK has fallen to 4.99%, marking the first time it has dipped below the 5% threshold since May 2023. This decline is seen as a symbolic turning point that could boost buyer confidence and increase competition among lenders. The average two-year fixed rate also continued to fall, reaching 4.97%. While the immediate financial savings for borrowers may be small, the steady downward trend in borrowing costs is welcome news for homebuyers and those looking to remortgage in a market still recovering from previous rate shocks.

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Sales of previously owned homes in the U.S. rose by 2% in July compared to June, defying analyst expectations of a slight decline. The increase is attributed to a dip in mortgage rates during May and June when these sales contracts were likely signed. Concurrently, the inventory of homes for sale grew by nearly 16% year-over-year, reaching its highest level since May 2020. This increase in supply is beginning to temper price growth, with the median home price showing only a marginal 0.2% annual increase, suggesting the market may be approaching an inflection point.
