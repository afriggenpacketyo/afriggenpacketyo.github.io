          <p>A Harris's hawk that had been terrorizing the village of Flamstead, Hertfordshire, has been given a permanent home with a local falconer. The hawk, nicknamed "Bomber Harris," was responsible for dive-bombing attacks on approximately 50 people, with one victim requiring hospital treatment. Falconer Wayne Housden captured and trained the bird, noting that its behavior was likely due to hormonal or territorial issues. Housden spent around ¬£1,000 building an aviary for the hawk and plans to feature it at the Flamstead Scarecrow Festival in August. The falconer believes the hawk was a captive-bred bird that had been lost by its owner, and he intends to ensure it will not be failed again.</p>

          <p>Faizan Zaki, a 13-year-old from Dallas, won the Scripps National Spelling Bee, overcoming a shocking moment of overconfidence. Faizan, who was the runner-up last year, nearly misspelled "commelina" before correcting himself and ultimately winning with the word "eclaircissement." The bee celebrated its 100th anniversary, and Faizan may be remembered for a word he got wrong more than one he got right. Despite the near-miss, Faizan's passion for spelling and joyful approach made him a champion, and he plans to donate a large portion of his winnings to charity. His victory marks the 30th time in 36 years that an Indian American has won the competition.</p>

          <p>A new report from WWF highlights the vital role of UK saltmarshes in tackling climate change by locking away greenhouse gases. Saltmarshes, which have been significantly reduced due to agriculture, act as natural carbon sinks and flood defenses. WWF is advocating for the inclusion of these tidal habitats in the UK's official carbon inventory to incentivize their restoration and protection. Researchers have installed greenhouse gas monitoring stations on a restored saltmarsh in North-West England, revealing that these areas absorb more carbon dioxide in the summer than they release in the winter. The report emphasizes that mud in saltmarshes is as crucial for climate mitigation as trees are.</p>

          <p>Japan's parliament has initiated its first debate in 28 years on legislation that would allow married couples to keep separate surnames. Despite growing public support, the passage of any of the three opposition-proposed bills appears unlikely during the current Diet session. The ruling Liberal Democratic Party remains hesitant, citing concerns about family cohesion and traditional values. A revision to the Civil Code is necessary to enable couples to maintain different family names, with most women currently abandoning their maiden names after marriage. A recent Kyodo News poll showed that 71% of respondents support the dual family-name system.</p>

Tokyo's core consumer prices rose at the fastest pace in over two years, while Japan's unemployment rate and job availability ratio remained unchanged in April. Japan is also lifting some sanctions against Syria to aid rebuilding efforts after the fall of Bashar al-Assad.</p>

          <p>Glastonbury Festival has transformed from its humble beginnings in 1970, when tickets cost ¬£1 and included free milk, into a global music phenomenon. The festival's evolution includes the introduction of the Pyramid stage, partnerships with organizations like CND, and adaptations to challenges like mud and gatecrashers. Over the years, Glastonbury has become known for its diverse lineup, including hip-hop headliners, and its commitment to social and environmental causes. This year's festival will feature headliners like The 1975, Neil Young, and Olivia Rodrigo, and it will be the last before a fallow year for the field to recover.</p>

          <h2>SEC Drops Lawsuit Against Binance, Ending Crypto Enforcement Action</h2>

          <p>The Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) has formally dropped its lawsuit against Binance and its founder, Changpeng Zhao, concluding one of the last remaining crypto enforcement actions initiated by the agency. The lawsuit, filed in June 2023, accused Binance of illegally serving U.S. users, inflating trading volumes, and commingling customer funds. This dismissal signifies a symbolic end to a period of aggressive crypto crackdowns in the U.S., particularly as the current administration signals a more industry-friendly approach. Binance is involved with World Liberty Financial, a project aiming to become a crypto bank, and Zhao has been appointed as an advisor to Pakistan's newly formed Crypto Council.
