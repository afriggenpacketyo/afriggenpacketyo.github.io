Prime Minister Mark Carney stated the visit underscores the bond between Canada and the Crown, shaped by shared histories and common values. The King and Queen were greeted by officials, indigenous leaders, and school groups, with Camilla wearing a diamond maple leaf brooch previously worn by Queen Elizabeth II. The visit occurs during a trade war with the US, as President Trump has suggested Canada would be better off as a US state.</p>

          <p>Lewis Pugh, a British-South African endurance athlete, completed a 62-mile swim around Martha's Vineyard to raise awareness about shark conservation as the film "Jaws" nears its 50th anniversary. Pugh aims to change public perception of sharks, which he says the film wrongly portrayed as villains. He emphasized the importance of protecting sharks, stating that around 100 million are killed each year, an unsustainable rate. Despite the mental and physical challenges of swimming in frigid waters with the awareness of sharks, Pugh hopes his efforts will inspire drastic measures to protect these vital apex predators.</p>

          <p>French President Emmanuel Macron addressed a viral video showing his wife, Brigitte Macron, appearing to shove him in the face upon arrival in Vietnam, dismissing it as playful banter. Macron told reporters that the couple was simply joking around and that the incident was being overblown. His office also downplayed the interaction, describing it as a moment of complicity after a long trip, and said that the French president and his wife were unwinding after a long trip and playfully teasing each other. Macron argued that the images and reaction to them offered a cautionary tale about disinformation in the social media age.</p>

          <p>A mobile prison is visiting U.K. schools to teach children about the realities and consequences of crime. The project, led by former police officer Mick Amos, involves students dressing in inmate attire and experiencing replica prison cells with items from local jails. The aim is to open the door to conversations about drugs, alcohol, violence, and other issues, helping students make informed choices. Organizers emphasize that it's not a scare tactic but an awareness program, particularly important in the U.K. where children as young as 10 can be arrested.</p>
