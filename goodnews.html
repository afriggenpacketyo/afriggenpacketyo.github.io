          <p>Donald Trump is scheduled for a three-day state visit to the U.K., marking an unprecedented second such honor for a U.S. president. Hosted by King Charles III at Windsor Castle, the trip includes a formal welcome with royal pageantry, a state banquet, and a wreath-laying at Queen Elizabeth II's tomb. The visit, initiated by Prime Minister Keir Starmer, also involves a meeting between the two leaders at Chequers to discuss policy and view historical archives. This diplomatic event is designed to strengthen UK-US relations amidst a packed schedule of ceremonial and political engagements.</p>

        </div>
        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>The average rate for a 30-year fixed mortgage has dropped to its lowest point since late 2022, reaching 6.13% ahead of an anticipated interest rate cut by the Federal Reserve. This decline reflects investor sentiment in mortgage-backed bonds, though some analysts caution that rates could paradoxically rise after the Fed's announcement, a pattern seen in previous rate-cut cycles. Experts note that historically, Fed cuts during non-recessionary periods have not significantly impacted long-term rates. The market remains watchful of the Federal Reserve's upcoming policy statement and its potential effects. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>After a decades-long decline, the sun's activity has been surprisingly increasing since 2008, according to a new NASA study. This reversal counters previous predictions that the sun was entering a period of historic inactivity, a "deep solar minimum." The heightened activity could lead to more frequent solar storms and flares, which pose risks to spacecraft, astronauts, and Earth-based technology like power grids and GPS systems. In response, NASA is launching new missions to better track and predict space weather to mitigate potential impacts on critical infrastructure.</p>

          <p>Panama has unveiled its "Vision 2025–2035" strategy, a significant plan to revamp the Panama Canal to maintain its global competitiveness. The project includes building a new reservoir and pipeline, expanding container terminals, and enhancing logistics corridors. Canal administrator Ricardo Vazquez Morales emphasized the need to accommodate rising energy exports from the U.S. to Asia, warning that Panama could lose business to rival routes without these upgrades. The announcement, however, came as officials avoided directly addressing questions regarding Chinese ownership and influence over the critical trade route.</p>

          <p>President Trump has once again extended the deadline for ByteDance to sell TikTok's U.S. operations, pushing it to December 16th. This fourth extension comes as a "framework deal" is reportedly being finalized, which would see about 80% of TikTok's U.S. business owned by an investor group including Oracle, Silver Lake, and Andreessen Horowitz. Under this arrangement, existing American users would migrate to a new application. The move provides more time for the complex deal to be completed, avoiding an immediate ban of the popular social media app in the United States.</p>

          <p>Representative Brian Mast, chair of the House Foreign Affairs Committee, has withdrawn a controversial provision from a State Department reform bill. The measure would have granted the Secretary of State, Marco Rubio, broad authority to deny or revoke the passports of U.S. citizens alleged to have provided "material support" to terrorist organizations. The proposal drew widespread criticism from civil liberties advocates, who feared it could be used to target pro-Palestinian activists and other political opponents. A committee spokesperson stated they did not want the contentious measure to overshadow other bipartisan aspects of the legislation.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>According to Treasury Secretary Scott Bessent, President Trump's credible willingness to let TikTok "go dark" in the U.S. was the key factor that motivated China to agree to a deal framework. Bessent revealed that while the commercial terms of a deal had been largely settled for months, China paused negotiations after Trump's tariff announcements. The president's firm stance on national security, prioritizing it over the deal itself, ultimately "turned the tide" and brought the parties back to the table. This insight sheds light on the high-stakes negotiation tactics employed by the administration to force a resolution over the app's ownership.</p>
