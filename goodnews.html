          <p>A year after Hurricane Helene caused widespread destruction in the southeastern U.S., a resident of Leicester, North Carolina, is building his dream home from salvaged materials. John Saunby gathered discarded items like porch posts and kitchen floorboards from the storm's rubble, viewing the debris-filled woods as a source of treasure. With a creative vision that includes unique features like Black Locust bark siding, he is turning what was destined for a landfill into a testament to resilience and resourcefulness. The project, which he calls his "last hurrah" of home-building, is a poignant example of finding opportunity in the aftermath of disaster.</p>

          <p>England's women's rugby team, the Red Roses, has advanced to its seventh consecutive World Cup final after a hard-fought 35-17 victory over France. Ellie Kildunne was instrumental in the win, scoring two decisive tries upon her return from a concussion that sidelined her during the quarter-finals. Despite a strong challenge from France, who were trailing by only two points at halftime, England's dominance, particularly in their driving maul, proved superior in the second half. The match, played before a crowd of over 25,000, showcased the Red Roses' resilience as they overcame errors to secure their place in the tournament's ultimate showdown.</p>

Her employer secured her a one-bedroom apartment with a balcony for just 35,000 yen, equivalent to $238 per month, highlighting the affordability of living in the Japanese countryside compared to major cities. Smith has embraced the different culture and lifestyle, documenting her experiences on social media to show a more authentic, non-Tokyo perspective of life in Japan.

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>The Liberal Democrats have proposed a novel solution to address the UK's asylum backlog: using the Civil Contingencies Act, a law typically reserved for national emergencies and wartime. The party suggests this would enable the rapid establishment of temporary "Nightingale processing centres" and the doubling of asylum caseworkers to expedite decisions. This approach aims to reduce the costly and prolonged use of hotels to house asylum seekers. The proposal is a key focus of the party's annual conference, where they are also advocating for increased police visibility by opening desks in supermarkets and other public spaces.</p>

          <p>Red Bull's Max Verstappen claimed pole position for the Azerbaijan Grand Prix after an exceptionally turbulent qualifying session that was halted by a record six red flags. The session was repeatedly interrupted by crashes, including one by McLaren's Oscar Piastri in the final segment. Verstappen managed to set the fastest time in the final moments after the last restart, narrowly beating Williams' Carlos Sainz. The chaotic conditions led to a mixed-up grid, with championship contender Lando Norris starting in ninth and Ferrari's Lewis Hamilton failing to advance to the top-10 shootout, setting the stage for an unpredictable race.</p>

          <p>An elderly British couple, Peter and Barbie Reynolds, have returned to the UK after being detained by the Taliban in Afghanistan for nearly eight months. The couple, who had lived and run a charitable training program in the country for almost two decades, were released following negotiations brokered by Qatar. The Taliban stated the couple had broken Afghan laws but never specified the reason for their detention. After an emotional reunion with their daughter in Doha, they landed at Heathrow Airport. Their family expressed immense gratitude for their release, noting the couple's desire to eventually return to continue their work in Afghanistan.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>The Trump administration has intervened to stop U.S. Steel from shutting down its plant in Granite City, Illinois, by exercising newly acquired "golden share" rights. These rights, a condition of the recent $14.1 billion takeover of U.S. Steel by Japan's Nippon, give the White House veto power over major strategic decisions like plant closures. After the company informed nearly 800 workers of the impending closure, Commerce Secretary Howard Lutnick warned that the administration would not permit it, leading U.S. Steel to reverse its decision. This marks the first use of these powers, underscoring the administration's increasing influence in the private sector.</p>

She explained that after years of trying to live anonymously, she decided to embrace her story to help others who have experienced public shaming, particularly in the digital age. Lewinsky noted the cultural shift brought by younger generations and the #MeToo movement, which allowed for a re-evaluation of how women were treated by the media. She emphasized the importance of telling one's own story, finding humor in hardship, and insisting on a different ending than the one written by others.</p>

          <p>A growing number of American students are applying to universities in Europe, the UK, and Asia, driven by rising tuition costs and political turmoil in the United States. Data indicates a steady increase in U.S. students studying abroad over the past five years, with consultants reporting a dramatic spike in interest since the 2024 election. For many, the significantly lower tuition fees overseas present a compelling alternative to accumulating substantial student debt from U.S. institutions. Beyond finances, some students cite concerns about the domestic political landscape and a desire for a more international perspective as key factors in their decision to pursue higher education abroad.</p>
