          <p>Ford Motor Company has reinstated its full-year financial outlook after previously suspending it due to uncertainty surrounding President Trump's auto tariffs. The automaker now projects a net impact of $2 billion from these tariffs, a figure that has been incorporated into its revised guidance for adjusted earnings. Despite this significant cost, Ford's second-quarter revenue surpassed expectations, and its commercial "Pro" division showed strong growth. The company continues to navigate the complex financial landscape created by trade policies while managing its transition toward electric vehicles. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>Microsoft has announced quarterly financial results that exceeded Wall Street estimates for both earnings per share and overall revenue.

Investors are closely watching the growth of Microsoft's Azure cloud computing division, which remains a key driver of the company's success.

          <p>The U.S. Federal Reserve has decided to keep its key interest rate unchanged, maintaining its position between 4.25% and 4.5% despite pressure from President Donald Trump for a rate cut. The decision was not unanimous, with two board members dissenting in favor of lowering rates, a rare occurrence. Fed Chair Jerome Powell cited concerns over the potential inflationary effects of tariffs as a reason for caution. The move comes as new data shows the U.S. economy grew by 3% in the second quarter, a rebound that complicates the central bank's task of balancing growth and inflation. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>Leipzig's 22-year-old striker, Benjamin Sesko, has become a top target for several Premier League clubs, including Manchester United, Newcastle, and Chelsea, with a potential transfer fee of around £70 million. The Slovenian international is highly regarded for his combination of size, speed, and clinical finishing, drawing comparisons to Erling Haaland. Despite a strong scoring record in the Bundesliga, Sesko is still seen as a developing player with significant potential. While a move this summer is possible, some experts believe he might benefit from another season at Leipzig to continue his development.</p>

While home equity loans offer a fixed-rate lump sum, HELOCs provide a variable-rate revolving line of credit, offering flexibility for different financial needs and potential tax deductions.

          <p>Former Vice President Kamala Harris has officially announced that she will not be a candidate in the 2026 election for governor of California. After a period of reflection following her 2024 presidential campaign, Harris stated that her public service will not be in elected office for now, but she will share more about her future plans in the coming months. Her decision removes a potential frontrunner from the race to succeed Governor Gavin Newsom and leaves open the possibility of another presidential run in 2028. Harris also called for new methods and fresh thinking to address the country's political challenges.</p>

          <h2>Financial Experts Suggest Strategies for Debt Relief Amidst Paused Interest Rates</h2>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>With the Federal Reserve holding interest rates steady, borrowers with high-rate debt, particularly on credit cards, are advised to explore proactive debt relief strategies. Financial experts recommend three key moves: conducting a thorough budget review to cut unnecessary spending, understanding the risks and fees associated with options like debt management programs or credit counseling, and addressing the root behaviors that led to debt accumulation. Since immediate relief from lower interest rates is not forthcoming, taking these steps can help individuals regain financial control and work towards long-term stability. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>Life sciences company Danaher has seen its stock rally following a better-than-expected second-quarter earnings report and an increased full-year forecast. However, investors question whether this upward trend is sustainable given persistent headwinds, including a slow recovery in China and the impact of U.S. tariffs. While the company's biotechnology and life sciences segments beat estimates, its diagnostics business in China faced declines due to policy changes. Analysts suggest that a sustained rally for Danaher and the broader sector may not occur until consistent mid-single-digit revenue growth returns in the coming quarters. (not investment advice)</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>The Federal Reserve has kept its benchmark interest rate unchanged, continuing its cautious approach amid economic uncertainty and the potential impact of tariffs on inflation. The decision by the Federal Open Market Committee (FOMC) was widely anticipated but included a rare dissent from two governors, who favored a rate cut. The committee's statement noted that while economic growth moderated in the first half of the year, the labor market remains solid and inflation is somewhat elevated. This decision reinforces the Fed's wait-and-see strategy as it monitors incoming economic data before making future adjustments. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>Residents in states including California, Texas, and Colorado should anticipate an increase in tarantula sightings as the spiders' mating season begins. During September and October, thousands of mature male tarantulas, which can be the size of a baseball, emerge from their burrows to search for mates. These spiders are generally timid and rarely bite humans unless provoked. The males, typically 8 to 10 years old, embark on this journey as their final act, often dying within a year of mating, while females can live for over 20 years.</p>

This optimistic statement comes after a period of escalating trade tensions and a significant decline in Chinese exports to the U.S. While negotiators from both countries have described recent discussions as constructive, they have offered different timelines for a potential pause in new tariffs.</p>

          <p>A U.S. Senate committee has voted to advance a bill that would prohibit members of Congress and their spouses from owning or trading individual stocks. Republican Senator Josh Hawley joined with Democrats on the Homeland Security and Governmental Affairs Committee to pass the measure, known as the PELOSI Act, in an 8-7 vote. The bill aims to prevent potential conflicts of interest by requiring lawmakers to divest their stock holdings. The legislation sparked a debate within the committee about wealth and public service, but its path to a full Senate vote remains uncertain.</p>

          <p>A new study published in The Lancet suggests that walking 7,000 steps per day can provide significant health benefits, challenging the widely-held 10,000-step goal. The research, a meta-analysis of multiple studies, found that achieving 7,000 steps daily was linked to a substantially lower risk of death and cardiovascular disease, making it a more realistic target for many people. The benefits varied by age, with younger adults seeing the most improvement around 5,400 steps, while for older adults, more steps continued to yield greater benefits. The study also reaffirmed that daily walking helps reduce symptoms of depression and anxiety.</p>
