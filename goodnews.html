        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>An analysis suggests President Trump's recent diplomatic breakthrough in Gaza, which eluded the previous administration, resulted from a unique combination of factors. The article credits his close, albeit sometimes contentious, relationship with Israeli Prime Minister Netanyahu, which allowed him to exert significant private pressure that past presidents avoided. Furthermore, his established business and political ties with key Gulf states like Qatar and Saudi Arabia were instrumental in securing regional backing and convincing Hamas to agree to the terms. This approach combined personal relationships with an unorthodox, high-pressure style to break the long-standing diplomatic stalemate in the region.</p>

          <p>Levi Strauss reported third-quarter profits that surpassed Wall Street expectations, attributing the success to targeted price increases and a strategic shift toward direct-to-consumer sales. The company's gross margin expanded, and it successfully raised its full-year financial outlook despite broader macroeconomic volatility and tariff costs. CEO Michelle Gass stated that the price hikes have been implemented surgically without negatively impacting consumer demand, a trend the company will monitor closely. This strategy, combined with selling more through its own stores and website, has allowed the denim maker to improve profitability and maintain strong growth momentum. (not investment advice)</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Detroit Lions head coach Dan Campbell vehemently denied an ESPN report claiming the team had contacted the NFL to monitor low hits on star defensive end Aidan Hutchinson. Calling the report "bogus" and "bull," Campbell asserted that no one from the Lions organization made such a request to the league office. The original report suggested the team was concerned about opponents targeting Hutchinson's legs, particularly after his recovery from a significant leg injury last season. Hutchinson has had a dominant start to the season, and Campbell's forceful denial aims to quash any narrative of the team seeking special treatment for its star player.</p>

          <p>President Trump has reportedly met with billionaire entrepreneur Jared Isaacman to again discuss his potential nomination to lead NASA, months after the president publicly withdrew the initial offer. Trump had previously pulled the nomination citing Isaacman's past political donations and his close ties to SpaceX CEO Elon Musk, which he deemed a conflict of interest. However, recent meetings suggest a reconciliation, as the administration seeks a permanent leader for the space agency. The renewed talks come as NASA faces significant challenges, including budget cuts and staffing reductions resulting from a government efficiency initiative that Musk himself had led.</p>

          <p>The Internal Revenue Service has released the updated federal income tax brackets and standard deduction amounts for the 2026 tax year, adjusting them to account for inflation. This annual change is designed to prevent "bracket creep," where inflation pushes taxpayers into higher tax brackets even if their real purchasing power hasn't increased. For 2026, the standard deduction will rise for all filing statuses, including for married couples filing jointly, heads of households, and single filers. These adjustments come after the recent passage of legislation that made many previous tax cuts permanent, affecting how much Americans will owe. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>At a recent media conference, Paramount CEO David Ellison addressed questions about the role of his father, billionaire Larry Ellison, stating unequivocally, "I run the company day to day." While acknowledging his father as the largest shareholder and a phenomenal mentor, he emphasized that his own leadership dictates the company's strategy. This clarification comes as Paramount pursues a potential acquisition of Warner Bros. Discovery, a move that would require significant financial backing from his father. Ellison also pushed back on fears of consolidation leading to more cuts, suggesting that Paramount's strategy is focused on producing more content to maximize shareholder value.</p>

          <p>In a recent interview, author D.J. Waldie, a lifelong resident and chronicler of Los Angeles, argues that residents must develop a deep, informed love for the city to address its complex problems. He suggests that a lack of historical awareness has led to poor policy decisions regarding housing, homelessness, and politics. Waldie’s work aims to move beyond Hollywood clichés and fabricated myths, encouraging Angelenos to engage with the city's real, often overlooked, history. He believes that by fostering this connection and sense of place, citizens can become more politically engaged and better equipped to make Los Angeles anew.</p>

          <p>Hungarian novelist László Krasznahorkai, the 2025 Nobel Prize in Literature winner, is celebrated for his challenging and experimental prose that explores the stultifying effects of political oppression. His work, characterized by long, labyrinthine sentences and a mood of existential dread, defies easy reading but offers a profound commentary on societal decay and the readiness of people to accept it. Born under Soviet influence, his early novels are soaked in an atmosphere of political terror, yet their themes of anomie and resignation remain timeless. The article suggests his selection fits the Nobel committee's mission of honoring writers who transform specific histories into universal, transcendent language.</p>

The move aims to capture a share of the massive global video game market and provide more value to Netflix subscribers. Co-CEO Greg Peters acknowledged the company's gaming efforts so far have been foundational, but this new initiative represents a more visible step toward integrating interactive entertainment directly into its main platform.</p>

          <p>Following the agreement on the first phase of a peace plan, Israel and Hamas are preparing for a ceasefire, the release of hostages, and the withdrawal of some Israeli troops from Gaza. The process is expected to begin within 24 hours of the Israeli Cabinet's approval, with Hamas then having 72 hours to free the 20 living hostages in exchange for some 2,000 Palestinian prisoners. Subsequently, hundreds of aid trucks are expected to enter Gaza. However, this is just the first step, with more complex negotiations to follow on issues like Hamas's disarmament and the future governance of Gaza under an international body.</p>

          <p>In his first solo directing project, "The Smashing Machine," Benny Safdie explores the downfall of a sports champion, mixed-martial artist Mark Kerr, played by Dwayne "The Rock" Johnson. In an interview, Safdie explained his fascination with what happens when a figure at the peak of their profession begins to falter, seeing it as a way to explore relatable human vulnerability. The film delves into Kerr's late-90s career, his battle with painkiller addiction, and his personal struggles, intentionally avoiding a triumphant sports biopic narrative. The project also represents a significant dramatic turn for Johnson, who sought out the role to challenge his heroic public image.</p>

          <p>Former British Prime Minister Rishi Sunak has accepted paid advisory positions with tech giant Microsoft and artificial intelligence startup Anthropic. An independent government watchdog, Acoba, has stipulated that he is barred from lobbying UK ministers on behalf of the companies for two years. During his premiership, Sunak prioritized technology regulation and hosted a major AI safety summit. He stated he will donate his earnings from these new roles to a charity he founded to address numeracy issues in the UK. The appointments come after speculation that Sunak, who still has a home in California, might pursue a career in Silicon Valley.</p>
