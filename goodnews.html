          <p>Ryan Coogler's film *Sinners*, set in 1932 Clarksdale, Mississippi, is bringing renewed attention to the historic town, known as the birthplace of blues music. The film's success has led to free screenings in Clarksdale, which had lost its only movie theater in 2003, thanks to a local campaign and Coogler's support. The movie, blending elements of musicals, horror, and period drama, captures the soul and history of the Mississippi Delta, according to Clarksdale native Tyler Yarbrough. Local residents appreciate Coogler's careful respect for their culture and hope the film will boost tourism and provide a better understanding of the town's rich heritage.</p>

Japan's government is releasing cheaper stockpiled rice to combat soaring prices, while an opposition leader apologized for calling the rice "animal feed." The U.S. Defense Secretary urged Asian allies to invest more in defense to deter China. A man started a fire on a Seoul subway, leading to an evacuation, and a new Asian art museum opened on Naoshima Island in Japan.

          <p>A ban on the sale of single-use disposable vapes has come into effect across the UK, aiming to protect children's health and the environment. The ban targets the rise in youth vaping, with disposable vapes being a key driver, while also addressing the environmental issue of millions of vapes being thrown away annually. While rechargeable and refillable devices are still permitted, retailers face fines for breaching the ban. Health experts emphasize that further regulation is needed to fully tackle youth vaping, even as vaping is considered less harmful than smoking.</p>
