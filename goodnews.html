          <p>Schools across the U.S. are adopting locked magnetic pouches as a solution to cellphone distractions in classrooms, with students in 35 states now facing restrictions on phone use. The Yondr pouches, costing $25-30 per student, have been purchased by districts to enforce statewide bans on cellphones during school hours. While some students initially resisted the idea, others have welcomed the change, reporting positive effects such as increased social interaction during lunch periods. The pouches aim to create a culture change in schools, fostering an environment conducive to learning and development by reducing reliance on technology. </p>

Dr. Bennett emphasizes that women often deploy alongside male counterparts and engage with female civilians in modern conflicts. The group provides a supportive community for women who may feel isolated after leaving the armed forces due to misconceptions about women's roles in the military. </p>

          <p>The EU is introducing a new digital border system, the Entry/Exit System (EES), to track non-EU citizens entering and leaving the Schengen Area. The system aims to strengthen security and streamline travel, but concerns have been raised about potential delays during initial registration.

The EES will be gradually implemented, with full activation expected by April 2026, affecting various border crossings and transportation methods. </p>
