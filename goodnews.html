          <p>European stock markets are anticipated to commence the trading week on a generally positive note, with key indices like Germany's DAX, France's CAC 40, and Italy's FTSE MIB projected to see slight increases. This cautious optimism follows last Friday's lower close, as market participants evaluated recent European and U.S. inflation figures and the likelihood of a Federal Reserve interest rate cut in September, a prospect fueled by Fed Chair Jerome Powell's dovish remarks. Additionally, investors are digesting China's August manufacturing data, which unexpectedly returned to growth, and the agreement between India and China to be development partners, not rivals, during the Shanghai Cooperation Organization meeting.

The summit, the largest to date with over 20 foreign leaders including Russian President Vladimir Putin and Indian Prime Minister Narendra Modi, serves as a platform for China to project itself as a global peacemaker amidst ongoing international tensions. Xi highlighted China's investments in SCO countries and pledged support for vocational education programs, emphasizing the opportunity for high-quality development and cooperation. The meeting also saw a reaffirmation of India-China relations, with both sides agreeing on the importance of being partners.</p>

          <p>China's manufacturing activity unexpectedly returned to growth in August, with the RatingDog manufacturing purchasing managers' index (PMI) reaching 50.5, surpassing economist estimates and signaling the fastest expansion since March. This improvement was largely propelled by a recovery in new export orders, indicating resilience in external demand despite existing tariffs. While overall output and new orders saw gains, the article notes that domestic demand showed less improvement, and employment in the manufacturing sector remained challenging for the fifth consecutive month. Experts caution that the durability of this upturn depends on sustained export stability and a pickup in domestic demand. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>European Union chief Ursula von der Leyen revealed that Europe is formulating "precise plans" for a multinational troop deployment to Ukraine, intended as part of post-conflict security guarantees. This force, potentially comprising tens of thousands of troops, would receive intelligence and surveillance assistance from the United States, with President Trump reportedly reassuring the EU of an American presence. German Chancellor Friedrich Merz also indicated that Germany is preparing for a prolonged conflict in Ukraine, emphasizing that a quick resolution at Ukraine's expense is not an option.

          <p>A new report indicates that Australia can implement its upcoming social media ban for under-16s using various technologies, but all methods present risks and shortcomings. The ban, set to take effect in December, aims to curb harmful social media impacts, requiring platforms to prevent underage accounts. While identity document verification offers accuracy, it raises concerns about data privacy and retention. Facial assessment technology shows a "buffer zone" of inaccuracy around age 16, leading to potential false positives or negatives. The article highlights the government's call for platforms to use layered age assurance methods, despite mental health advocates warning of potential isolation for children.</p>
