          <p>Sister Jean Dolores Schmidt, the widely beloved team chaplain for the Loyola University Chicago men's basketball team, has passed away at the age of 106. She gained national fame in 2018 during the team's surprising run to the Final Four of the NCAA tournament, becoming a symbol of spirit and guidance. Serving at Loyola for over 60 years, she was known for offering both prayers and practical basketball advice to the players. In her memoir, she described her role with the team as the most transformational position of her life, blending faith with life skills developed through sports.</p>

          <p>First Lady Melania Trump announced that eight Ukrainian children who had been held in Russia have been reunited with their families, with more returns expected soon. She revealed that she has been in direct communication with Russian President Vladimir Putin for months to facilitate these reunifications. According to the agreement, Russia will also coordinate the return of Ukrainians who were displaced as children but have since turned 18. This development marks a significant step in addressing the thousands of Ukrainian children who Ukraine says were forcibly abducted by Russia since the 2022 invasion.</p>

          <p>The U.S. has formalized a deal allowing Qatar to construct an air force facility at Mountain Home Airbase in Idaho, where Qatari pilots will be trained to fly F-15 fighter jets. U.S. Defence Secretary Pete Hegseth announced the agreement, highlighting it as another example of the strong partnership between the two nations. The announcement comes after President Trump signed an executive order pledging to defend Qatar, a key ally that hosts the largest U.S. military base in the Middle East. Hegseth also praised Qatar for its significant role in the recent Gaza ceasefire negotiations.</p>

          <p>Following the start of the Gaza ceasefire, humanitarian organizations are preparing to scale up aid delivery to the territory's 2.1 million people, many of whom are facing famine conditions. The UN reports that enough food is ready to feed the entire population for three months, with the goal of increasing daily deliveries to hundreds of truckloads. Aid will enter through the Rafah, Kerem Shalom, and Erez crossings as Israeli forces begin a partial withdrawal. Despite the preparations, organizations like Human Rights Watch warn that suffering will continue as long as Israel's blockade restricts aid at the necessary scale.</p>

        </div>
        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>A ceasefire agreement between Israel and Hamas has been reached, largely due to significant political pressure from the Trump administration. The deal involves the release of Israeli hostages in exchange for Palestinian prisoners and a halt to the fighting, with aid allowed to flow into Gaza. This article suggests that President Trump leveraged his unique relationships with Israeli Prime Minister Netanyahu and leaders in Qatar, Egypt, and Turkey to force both sides into an agreement they were otherwise reluctant to accept. The long-term viability of the peace remains uncertain, hinging on negotiations for a second phase and addressing the root causes of the conflict.</p>

          <p>Shares of Applied Digital soared 16% after the company reported first-quarter revenue of $64.2 million, an 84% increase from the previous year and well above analysts' expectations. The growth is attributed to strong demand for artificial intelligence data centers, including a massive lease agreement with CoreWeave. The company is expanding its data center capacity in North Dakota, with projects expected to bring total leased capacity to 600 MW. Despite a net loss for the quarter, the robust revenue growth signals strong investor confidence in the company's position within the booming AI infrastructure market. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>Denmark will invest $4.26 billion to strengthen its military presence in the Arctic, a move aimed at addressing U.S. concerns over the defense of Greenland. The investment will fund new Arctic ships, a patrol aircraft, drones, and enhanced radar systems, along with a new military headquarters in Nuuk, Greenland's capital. Additionally, Denmark plans to purchase 16 new F-35 fighter jets, adding to its previous commitment of 27 aircraft. The decision reflects growing geopolitical focus on the Arctic and Denmark's acknowledgement that it had previously neglected the territory's military capabilities.</p>

          <p>The Knight First Amendment Institute, a free-speech group affiliated with Columbia University, has won a major legal victory against the Trump administration. A federal judge ruled that the detention and attempted deportation of pro-Palestinian student activists, including Columbia student Mahmoud Khalil, was unconstitutional and designed to suppress free speech. The ruling highlights a stark contrast between the institute's defiant defense of constitutional principles and Columbia University's more conciliatory approach, which included a controversial settlement with the administration over antisemitism claims.

The bill overrides local zoning regulations in eight counties, including Los Angeles, to permit taller and denser residential buildings near subway, light rail, and dedicated bus stops. Proponents, such as YIMBY groups, praise the law as a crucial step toward addressing the state's severe housing crisis and reducing carbon emissions by encouraging public transit use.

These costs are notably lower than they were a year ago, reflecting the cooling market conditions and the Federal Reserve's rate-cutting campaign.
