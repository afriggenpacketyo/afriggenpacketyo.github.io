        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Economists warn that Europe must adapt quickly to avoid becoming a 'shock absorber' in the evolving US-China trade landscape. While recent talks have led to a temporary reduction in tariffs, the long-term outlook for Europe is bleak if it fails to integrate politically and coordinate fiscal and industrial policies. Without deeper integration, Europe risks being forced to adjust to the choices of others without shaping the outcomes, potentially hindering its ambition to become a 'third pole' in a bipolar world.</p>

          <p>The LA 2028 Olympics committee is partnering with Archer Aviation to potentially provide an air taxi service during the Olympic and Paralympic Games, aiming to transport spectators between venues and alleviate traffic congestion. If certified by the FAA in time, the electric vertical take-off and landing (eVTOL) aircraft would offer short flights between select destinations. Archer Aviation hopes to have its Midnight aircraft, which can carry up to four people, certified at similar safety levels as commercial airliners. The service aims to transform transportation in Los Angeles and leave a lasting legacy.</p>

          <p>Northern California's commercial Dungeness crab season is under threat due to migrating humpback whales becoming entangled in fishing ropes, prompting fishermen to seek alternative solutions. Fisherman Brand Little uses a high-tech system with a remote-controlled pop-up device to minimize rope usage and prevent whale injuries. The California Department of Fish and Wildlife shortened the crab season to mitigate the risk to migrating whales. The technology is an experiment sponsored by the California Department of Fish and Wildlife, and fishermen hope to continue catching crabs without harming whales.</p>

          <h2>Horses Migrated Between Asia and North America Thousands of Years Ago, Study Finds</h2>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>A new study reveals that ancient horses repeatedly migrated between North America and Eurasia during the late Pleistocene, when a land bridge connected the two continents. Researchers found that horses undertook multiple migrations across the Bering land bridge between 50,000 and 13,000 years ago, with genetic exchanges occurring in both directions. The studied fossils included Dalianensis horses, named after the northeastern Chinese city of Dalian, which had a mixed ancestry from both Eurasian and American populations.</p>

          <p>Rural Japan is experiencing severe depopulation, so some unstaffed train stations and vacant homes are being transformed into places for tourists to stay -- and it is proving a success. Transport operators are working with local communities to repurpose quiet outposts into hubs of activity, injecting new life into surrounding areas with their creativity. This offers a promising model for revitalizing rural areas and preserving cultural heritage.</p>

The cost will be shared by the Department of the Army and the U.S. Semiquincentennial Commission. Plans for the parade have drawn criticism from Democrats, who view it as a wasteful display.</p>
