          <p>After a 100-year ban due to pollution, Parisians are once again swimming in the Seine River. The reopening follows a massive $1.5 billion cleanup project linked to the Olympics, which has successfully brought the water quality up to European standards on most days. Designated swimming areas have been established, complete with safety measures like lifeguards and lifebuoys. While many residents and officials, including the mayor, celebrated the historic moment as a "childhood dream," some locals remain skeptical about the water's cleanliness despite official assurances.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>At Oregon State University's Chapple Big Fish Lab, scientists are studying sharks in Washington's Willapa Bay to better understand ocean health and change the public's negative perception of the creatures. Researchers, led by Dr. Taylor Chapple, capture sharks to analyze their stomach contents, which provides insights into the animals' health and the bay's water quality. The sharks are released unharmed after the brief examination. Despite the ecological importance of their work, the scientists note that overcoming the public's fear makes it difficult to secure funding for their research.</p>

          <p>An Arizona couple was fined $4,000 by their property management company, Denali Real Estate, for posting negative online reviews about their rental experience, which included black mold. A clause in their lease prohibited negative reviews and imposed a $2,000 penalty per violation. This action appears to be illegal under the 2016 Consumer Review Fairness Act (CRFA), which protects consumers' right to share honest feedback without retaliation. After a local news outlet investigated, the company stated it would remove the clause, though the tenant's fine remains in dispute.</p>

          <h2>Happiness Researcher Advocates '90-Second Rule' for Managing Negative Emotions</h2>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Mo Gawdat, a former Google executive and happiness researcher, promotes a "90-second rule" to better manage feelings of anger and stress. The concept is based on neuroscientist Jill Bolte Taylor's finding that it takes 90 seconds for stress hormones to flush from the body. After this brief period, one can consciously choose not to re-engage with the negative thought, preventing a cycle of rumination. Gawdat suggests asking practical questions to assess the situation's truth and whether action can be taken, fostering a more mindful and resilient response to life's upsets.</p>

          <p>Inspired by the hobby-centric culture in Denmark, a professor at Emory University undertook a year-long experiment to try 17 different hobbies, from woodworking to mahjong. The author, Marina Cooley, found the experience fundamentally changed her life, helping her kick a "doomscrolling" habit and feel less lonely by connecting with new communities. She argues that actively pursuing hobbies is a secret to finding balance, as it forces individuals to set boundaries around work and other obligations. The experiment led her to redefine self-care and build stronger, more meaningful relationships.</p>

          <p>A recent study analyzing Census Bureau data reveals that Florida was the most popular state for retirees to move to in 2023, attracting a net inflow of over 44,500 residents aged 60 and older. The state's appeal is attributed to its tax-friendly policies, such as having no state income tax, which means Social Security benefits and retirement account withdrawals are not taxed. Other top destinations for retirees included North Carolina and Arizona. In contrast, California saw the largest net loss of residents in this age group. (not investment advice)</p>

The terrain closely resembles that of Mars, providing a realistic setting for research and for crews to establish the rhythms and procedures essential for survival.

          <p>Deaths from heart attacks in the U.S. have plummeted by nearly 90 percent since 1970, thanks to decades of medical and public health progress. This dramatic improvement is attributed to successful anti-smoking campaigns, the development of cholesterol-lowering statin drugs, and better emergency treatments like CPR and angioplasty. The article notes that while acute heart attack deaths are down, chronic heart disease remains a leading killer, exacerbated by rising rates of obesity and diabetes. Future progress may depend on wider adoption of advanced screening and new drugs. (not investment advice)</p>

The "Kill the Drill" movement formed after the state initially granted an exploratory drilling permit, which evoked memories of the 2010 Deepwater Horizon oil spill threat. After public pressure, the state reversed the permit and Governor Ron DeSantis signed a bill creating a 10-mile buffer zone, protecting the region's seafood industry from future drilling threats.</p>
