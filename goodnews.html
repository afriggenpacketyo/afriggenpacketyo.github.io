          <p>India is reportedly considering eliminating tariffs on imports of steel, auto components, and pharmaceuticals from the U.S. on a reciprocal basis, signaling a significant shift from its protectionist trade policies. This proposal comes as India aims to finalize a trade deal with the U.S., its largest trading partner. Experts suggest that while the deal could benefit sectors like financials and healthcare, India will likely ensure that domestic businesses are not harmed. Some analysts believe that certain sectors, such as steel and pharmaceuticals, may not be significantly impacted due to factors like transportation costs and the nature of pharmaceutical products.</p>
