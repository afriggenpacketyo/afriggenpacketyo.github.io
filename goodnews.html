          <p>Abu Dhabi National Oil Company (ADNOC) is reportedly evaluating a potential acquisition of some of BP's assets, particularly its liquefied natural gas (LNG) holdings, fueling speculation about a possible takeover of the energy giant. While a full takeover is considered less likely, ADNOC's interest underscores BP's underperformance and strategic reset, which includes increasing investment in oil and gas while divesting $20 billion in assets. BP is attempting to restore investor confidence after a period of volatility, and analysts suggest that breaking up the company is not the solution shareholders seek. The strategic reset involves increasing annual oil and gas spending to $10 billion through 2027 while cutting spending on renewables. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>French President Emmanuel Macron has announced his ambition for France to manufacture the most advanced chips globally, positioning the country as a key tech hub in Europe. Macron's comments came as Nvidia CEO Jensen Huang noted that Nvidia's first GPU was manufactured in France, though current French capabilities are not at the leading edge. Macron is pushing for France to produce semiconductors in the 2nm to 10nm range, potentially requiring partnerships with companies like TSMC or Samsung to establish local factories. This initiative aligns with France's broader efforts to build out its AI infrastructure, including a partnership between Nvidia and Mistral AI to create an "AI cloud."</p>

          <p>The Food Standards Agency (FSA) has issued a warning that several Jolly Rancher sweets are "unsafe to eat" due to the presence of mineral oil aromatic hydrocarbons (MOAH) and mineral oil saturated hydrocarbons (MOSH), which are not compliant with UK laws. MOAH can cause DNA damage and potentially increase the risk of cancer if consumed regularly over time. The FSA is urging UK businesses and consumers to stop buying and selling the affected products, which include Jolly Rancher Hard Candy, Jolly Rancher 'Misfits' Gummies, and others. The Hershey Company has been working with the UK government to remove the products since 2024, but some businesses continue to import them.</p>

This development is expected to position China for major advances in artificial intelligence (AI), 6G, and quantum computing. While Europe and the US are already established in the field, China's pilot production line, built on the new TFLN material, is showing gains in technical performance by overcoming limits for high-speed optical links.

          <p>India's central bank, the Reserve Bank of India (RBI), plans to tighten regulations on overseas remittances by resident Indians, preventing them from holding foreign currency deposits with lock-in periods. The RBI aims to prevent overseas transfers from being used to passively park money in interest-bearing accounts abroad, considering it a red flag in a still-controlled capital regime. The proposed changes reflect India's cautious stance on outward remittances and full convertibility of the rupee, as authorities seek to protect foreign exchange reserves and manage currency volatility. The move is part of a comprehensive review of the legal framework governing the Liberalised Remittance Scheme (LRS) to simplify regulations. (not investment advice)</p>
