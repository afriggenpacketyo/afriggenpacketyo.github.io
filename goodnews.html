        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>A rare dust storm swept through northwest Indiana and north-central Illinois, including Chicago, causing near-zero visibility and prompting the National Weather Service to issue a dust storm warning, the first ever for the city. The storm, originating near Bloomington, Illinois, was fueled by strong winds from thunderstorms lifting dust from exceptionally dry farmland. The article notes that such storms are uncommon in the area, with the last significant dust storm affecting Chicago during the Dust Bowl era of the 1930s. This event underscores the impact of dry soil conditions and strong winds on creating hazardous weather phenomena.</p>

          <p>Federal courts, including the Supreme Court, are pushing back against the Trump administration's aggressive deportation policies, insisting on due process for immigrants. The courts have emphasized that immigrants must have the opportunity to challenge their deportations, especially under the Alien Enemies Act. This article highlights several cases where courts have intervened to ensure immigrants receive adequate warning and the ability to contest their removal. The Supreme Court has criticized the administration's efforts to expedite deportations without providing sufficient notice or due process rights, reinforcing constitutional protections for all persons, not just citizens.</p>

          <p>Paleontologists have discovered a 500-million-year-old, three-eyed predator named Mosura fentoni, or the "sea moth," in the Burgess Shale of the Canadian Rockies. The creature, about the length of an index finger, had a pencil sharpener-like mouth lined with teeth and intimidating claws extending from its head. This discovery provides new insights into animal life during the Cambrian period. The well-preserved fossil also revealed a multi-segmented abdomen-like region, indicating a more complex anatomy than previously observed in other radiodonts.</p>
