          <p>A referendum in Italy will allow voters to decide on loosening citizenship laws for immigrants, potentially granting citizenship to long-term residents and their children more quickly. The proposed reform aims to integrate foreign residents who contribute to the country's economy and society, but faces opposition from right-wing parties. The outcome of the vote could have significant implications for Italy's demographic makeup and its approach to immigration policy. The success of the referendum hinges on voter turnout, with opponents seeking to discourage participation to invalidate the results.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>A new study suggests that subsidizing men's participation in childcare and household chores could help reverse declining birth rates in countries like China. The research indicates that incentivizing fathers to share childcare responsibilities yields greater long-term fertility gains compared to solely subsidizing mothers. This policy proposal comes as China faces a rapidly aging population, shrinking workforce, and strained social welfare system. The study highlights the persistence of traditional expectations that place the burden of childcare primarily on women, which clashes with rapid economic changes and contributes to declining fertility rates.</p>

While some venture capitalists advocate for longer working hours to compete globally, many founders argue that overwork leads to decreased retention and a revolving door of talent. They contend that Europe's startup ecosystem needs more funding and resources rather than increased working hours. The youngest generation at work are less likely to put up with overworking and tend to prioritize work-life balance.</p>
