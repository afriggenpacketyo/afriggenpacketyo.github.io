          <p>The U.S. and China are intensifying their space race, particularly concerning lunar exploration, with both nations aiming to land humans on the Moon by the end of the decade. China has made significant advancements, including successful tests of its Lanyue lunar lander and Long March-10 rocket, reiterating its goal for cosmonauts on the Moon before 2030. This challenges NASA's Artemis program, which targets a similar timeframe around 2027, despite the U.S. having a historical advantage. However, questions linger over NASA's chosen lunar landers, while Chinese commercial space players are also growing, leading some experts to believe China could reach the Moon first.</p>

          <p>SpaceX successfully launched an unpiloted X-37B Space Force rocket plane into orbit on a classified, long-duration mission from Kennedy Space Center. This marks the eighth flight for the reusable vehicle since 2010, with the Falcon 9 booster completing its sixth successful landing. While mission specifics remain confidential, Space Force and Boeing officials disclosed two payloads: one testing high-speed laser communications for proliferated space networks and another evaluating a quantum navigation sensor for GPS-denied environments. The X-37B, resembling a mini space shuttle, serves as a testbed for advanced avionics and reusable spacecraft components, with its orbital duration remaining undisclosed.</p>

          <p>Millions of travelers across the UK are bracing for significant traffic congestion and train disruptions this bank holiday weekend. A strike by the RMT union on the CrossCountry network will severely impact services from Friday to Monday, with no direct trains on Saturday. The RAC also predicts heavy road traffic, especially on the M5. Network Rail advises passengers to check journeys due to both strikes and engineering works. Despite the travel woes, the weather forecast for central and southern England anticipates warm, largely dry, and sunny conditions, offering a pleasant backdrop for those who successfully reach their destinations.</p>

          <p>A federal judge has issued a preliminary injunction, ordering Florida to halt further expansion and begin winding down operations at the "Alligator Alcatraz" immigration detention center in the Everglades. Judge Kathleen Williams ruled that the facility, which holds several hundred detainees, causes irreparable harm to the sensitive ecosystem and violates environmental laws. The order prohibits new construction and the transfer of additional detainees, requiring removal of temporary structures within 60 days. Florida officials have appealed the decision, arguing the state-run facility is exempt from federal environmental laws, a stance the judge rejected, noting the decades-long efforts to preserve the Everglades.</p>

          <p>Thailand's former prime minister, Thaksin Shinawatra, has been cleared of royal defamation (lese majeste) charges by a Bangkok court. The 76-year-old, who could have faced up to 15 years in prison, was found not guilty, alleviating a significant legal threat to his family's political influence. Thaksin's daughter currently leads the Pheu Thai party, although their political standing has recently shown a decline in public support. This acquittal marks a crucial development in Thailand's complex political landscape, where the lese majeste law criminalizes criticism of the monarchy.</p>

          <p>Nvidia CEO Jensen Huang lauded Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing Co. (TSMC) as one of history's greatest companies, calling investment in its stock "very smart." His comments come as the U.S. administration considers acquiring equity stakes in tech firms, particularly those receiving CHIPS Act funding like TSMC. Huang, visiting Taiwan to thank TSMC for its work on Nvidia's next-gen AI chip platform, Rubin, confirmed TSMC is producing six new products for Nvidia. Despite a Wall Street Journal report denying U.S. plans for equity stakes in general, the Commerce Secretary had confirmed talks about a 10% stake in Intel. (not investment advice)</p>

          <h2>New Study Reveals Corn's Unique Communication with Neighboring Plants</h2>

          <p>An international team of scientists has discovered that corn plants communicate with their neighbors by releasing a gas, linalool, which prompts nearby plants to alter their soil. This mechanism offers valuable insights into optimizing linalool release to combat pests and potentially increase crop yields. The research, published in Science, involved field surveys in Hainan province, China, revealing that densely planted corn in inner rows experienced less herbivore damage but also showed reduced growth. This finding highlights a sophisticated form of plant-to-plant interaction, opening new avenues for agricultural innovation and pest management strategies.</p>

          <p>Elon Musk and his social media company, X (formerly Twitter), have reached a tentative settlement with former employees who sued for $500 million in severance pay. The lawsuit, initiated by Courtney McMillian, alleged that approximately 6,000 workers were wrongly denied benefits after mass layoffs in 2022 following Musk's takeover. The plaintiffs claimed the company failed to provide six months' worth of salaries as promised, instead offering significantly less or nothing. While details of the agreement are not yet public and require court approval, this development marks a step towards resolving the legal disputes stemming from the significant workforce reductions.</p>

Economists expect Powell to subtly affirm the likelihood of a rate cut while carefully framing policy strategy and inflation control. The Fed is also expected to retool its "flexible average inflation targeting" framework, potentially reverting to a more preemptive stance on inflation. (not investment advice)</p>

The farm, operated by "well-organized drug-trafficking organizations," had diverted creeks, poisoned soil with banned pesticides like methamidophos, and left thousands of pounds of waste. Crews removed nearly 2,400 plants and 2,000 pounds of trash, noting terraces cut into hillsides, illegal trails, and evidence of poaching.
