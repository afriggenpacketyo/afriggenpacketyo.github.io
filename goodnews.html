          <p>Asian stock markets experienced substantial gains on Monday, with mainland China's CSI 300 and Hong Kong's Hang Seng Index leading the region's rally. This market buoyancy was largely fueled by Federal Reserve Chair Jerome Powell's recent remarks, which hinted at potential interest rate cuts as early as next month, significantly boosting investor confidence. Chinese property stocks also climbed after Shanghai eased homebuying restrictions, contributing to a broader positive sentiment across the region's equity markets. Analysts suggest maturing time deposits could shift into equities, sustaining the current momentum. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>Arsenal forward Bukayo Saka is anticipated to be sidelined for up to four weeks after sustaining a hamstring injury during Saturday's home victory against Leeds United. This significant setback means he will miss Arsenal's crucial game at Liverpool and England's upcoming World Cup qualifiers next month. Club captain Martin Odegaard is also a doubt for the Anfield match due to a shoulder injury suffered in the same game. Despite these immediate challenges, Arsenal remains optimistic about both players' long-term recovery, leveraging their expanded pool of attacking talent.</p>

          <p>China is exploring the expansion of its ambitious "Great Green Wall" project into Mongolia, as part of collaborative efforts to mitigate severe desertification across the Mongolian Plateau. With nearly 80% of Mongolia's land affected by degradation, the issue extends beyond its borders, contributing significantly to increasingly severe sandstorms in the wider East Asian region. This joint initiative aims to slow environmental decline and address the challenges posed by stronger winds and growing desertification, which caused China's worst sandstorm in a decade in 2021.</p>

The Monetary Authority of Singapore (MAS) anticipates continued moderate inflation, citing easing global crude oil prices.
