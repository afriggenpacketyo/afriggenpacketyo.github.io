          <p>Epic Games announced that Fortnite is now globally unavailable on iOS after Apple blocked its attempt to reinstate the game on the App Store. This action follows a judge's ruling that Apple cannot charge commissions on purchases made outside of iOS apps. Epic Games had resubmitted Fortnite to the U.S. App Store, but Apple's rejection means Fortnite on iOS will remain offline worldwide until Apple reverses its decision. The dispute highlights ongoing tensions between Epic Games and Apple regarding App Store policies and revenue sharing.</p>

          <p>House Republicans are considering a temporary $4,000 tax deduction for older adults as part of their tax bill, framed as a 'bonus' to help retirees retain more income. This proposal serves as an alternative to eliminating taxes on Social Security benefits, an idea previously promoted by President Trump. The deduction, applicable from 2025 to 2028, would phase out for single filers earning over $75,000 and married couples filing jointly earning over $150,000. While it offers some tax relief, experts note its impact is less significant than a tax credit, potentially saving a median income retiree less than $500 per year.</p>

Novogratz anticipates a significant reduction in Galaxy's auditing costs now that it is listed on the Nasdaq, attributing the high costs to the regulatory oversight associated with crypto companies.

To secure better rates, the article recommends considering online banks, which often offer more competitive rates due to lower overhead costs.

          <p>China and Russia are planning to construct a nuclear reactor on the moon by 2035 as part of the International Lunar Research Station (ILRS) project. The power station will provide energy for long-term lunar exploration and scientific research at the proposed lunar base, located near the lunar south pole. The ILRS, involving over a dozen international partners, is seen as a rival program to NASA's Artemis Program. This ambitious project underscores China's mission to become a leader in space exploration and its collaboration with Russia to advance lunar capabilities.</p>

          <p>While the turbulent trade relationship between the U.S. and China presents opportunities for South Korean shipbuilders, competition from China remains strong. Increased docking fees for Chinese-made vessels in the U.S. could lead to some orders shifting to South Korea. However, despite these potential gains, South Korean shipyards must still contend with China's dominance in the global shipbuilding industry. The article highlights that the agreement to de-escalate a bilateral tariff war between the U.S. and China may provide some relief for Chinese shipbuilders, maintaining competitive pressures on their Korean counterparts.</p>
