        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Mark Zuckerberg is aggressively investing in artificial intelligence by acquiring talent and technology for Meta. The company recently invested $14.3 billion in Scale AI, hiring its founder Alexandr Wang, and plans to bring on Nat Friedman and Daniel Gross, formerly of GitHub and Safe Superintelligence, respectively. Meta is embedding AI across its operations, from online advertising to the metaverse, aiming to enhance ad targeting and reduce costs. However, Meta's open-source approach with the Llama family of models has faced criticism, prompting the CEO to revamp the AI organization to compete with industry leaders like Google and OpenAI. The intense competition for AI talent has led to bidding wars, with Meta reportedly offering substantial signing bonuses to lure experts from rival companies. (not investment advice)</p>

This project is considered a symbol of Japan-India cooperation, utilizing Japan's renowned shinkansen technology. They may also revise the 2008 Joint Declaration on Security Cooperation to enhance their partnership amid China's growing maritime influence, and strengthen communication ahead of a Quad summit.</p>

          <p>The National Health Service (NHS) in England plans to offer DNA testing to all newborn babies to assess their risk of developing hundreds of diseases. This initiative aims to revolutionize prevention and provide faster diagnoses, with the goal of predicting and preventing illness before symptoms begin. The program will involve sequencing complete DNA from umbilical cord blood samples, screening for approximately 7,000 single-gene disorders. Concerns remain about the need for qualified professionals to interpret the data and provide appropriate counseling to affected individuals and families.</p>

          <p>Dame Esther Rantzen is appealing to the House of Lords to support the Terminally Ill Adults Bill, which would give terminally ill adults in England and Wales the right to an assisted death. The bill has been passed by MPs and now needs to go through the Lords before becoming law. Critics, including Lord Shinkwin, argue that the bill could lead to vulnerable people being coerced into ending their lives. Dame Esther, who joined the Swiss assisted dying clinic Dignitas, believes the bill sets out a rigorous process and should be supported.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Japan has been proactively addressing supply chain resilience, particularly in rare earth minerals. Following China's 2010 export ban targeting Tokyo, Japan diversified its sources, invested in non-China projects like Australia's Lynas, and implemented stockpiling and recycling measures. As a result, Japan's dependence on Chinese rare earths has significantly decreased. This experience provides a template for Western nations seeking to reduce their reliance on China's dominance in critical minerals.</p>
