          <p>Alphabet announced second-quarter financial results that exceeded analyst expectations for both revenue and earnings per share. The company reported strong growth in its Search, YouTube advertising, and Google Cloud segments. Despite the positive results, Alphabet also raised its projected capital expenditures for 2025 from $75 billion to $85 billion, citing a surge in demand for its Cloud and AI services. This increased investment highlights the company's commitment to expanding its artificial intelligence capabilities, including recent high-profile talent acquisitions and the growth of its Gemini AI chatbot and AI Overviews in search.</p>

          <p>IBM reported second-quarter financial results that surpassed Wall Street's forecasts for both revenue and earnings, driven by strong performance in its software and infrastructure divisions. The company's revenue grew nearly 8% year-over-year, with its generative AI business expanding to a $7.5 billion book of business. Despite the positive earnings report and reaffirming its full-year guidance, IBM's shares fell in extended trading. Company executives cited cautious client spending due to geopolitical tensions and some delayed decision-making on discretionary projects as potential headwinds.</p>

          <h2>Bipartisan Senate Bill Aims to Exempt Small Businesses from Trump's Canadian Tariffs</h2>
          <div class="timestamp">2025-07-23 17:16:41 EDT</div>
        </div>
        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>A bipartisan group of senators, including Republicans Susan Collins and Lisa Murkowski, has introduced legislation to shield U.S. small businesses from President Trump's tariffs on Canadian goods. The proposed "CANADA Act" would exempt small business concerns from the 25% duty on Canadian goods and 10% tariff on energy imports. The move comes as Trump threatens to increase the blanket tariff to 35%, escalating trade tensions with Canada, a major trading partner for most U.S. states. Proponents of the bill argue the tariffs harm small businesses, increase consumer costs, and damage cross-border relationships.</p>

          <p>A recent incident where a married CEO and his subordinate were caught on a Jumbotron at a Coldplay concert has gone viral, sparking widespread discussion about public privacy. The moment led to the CEO's resignation and has been widely parodied, but it also prompted online sleuths to identify and flood the social media pages of those involved, including the CEO's wife. This article explores the phenomenon of "panopticontent," where ordinary people are turned into public figures without consent, often fueled by social media platforms like TikTok. The event raises ethical questions about surveillance, online shaming, and the commodification of private moments by brands.</p>

          <p>In a pair of legal victories for Kilmar Abrego Garcia, a federal judge in Tennessee ruled he should be released from criminal custody, while another judge in Maryland barred ICE from immediately detaining him. Abrego Garcia, who was charged with human smuggling, was previously deported to El Salvador in what the government called an "administrative error" despite a court order protecting him. The new rulings ensure he will not be swiftly deported again upon release, ordering that he be returned to supervised release in Maryland and that the government provide 72 hours' notice before any future removal proceedings.</p>

          <div class="timestamp">2025-07-23 16:50:00 EDT</div>
        </div>
        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>The phenomenon known as "corn sweat" refers to the moisture released into the air by vast fields of corn through a process called evapotranspiration. During hot and sunny weather, this process can significantly increase humidity, making the air feel more oppressive and raising the heat index to dangerous levels. While the process itself is natural, the massive monocultures of corn in the Midwest can intensify this effect during heat waves. This article explains that although evapotranspiration has a cooling effect, the extreme humidity it generates can offset it, contributing to more intense and dangerous summer heat.</p>

The plan prioritizes the buildout of essential infrastructure, including data centers, semiconductor plants, and the electrical grid. It also aims to establish rules for government contractors to eliminate perceived ideological bias in AI systems and compel federal agencies to remove regulations that obstruct AI development. A key component of the strategy involves creating AI export packages to supply American technology and standards to allied nations.</p>

          <p>Meta has rolled out new safety features for its platforms, including Instagram, aimed at protecting teenage users from predatory behavior and exploitative content. The updates include enhanced direct messaging protections that provide more information about unknown contacts and allow teens to block and report accounts in a single step. This initiative follows Meta's removal of over 600,000 accounts linked to sexualizing children earlier this year. The company is facing mounting pressure from policymakers and state attorneys general who accuse it of failing to adequately shield young users from harm.</p>

          <p>With interest rates elevated, savers face a choice between the guaranteed returns of a certificate of deposit (CD) and the flexibility of a high-yield savings account. A calculation based on current rates shows a $10,000, 6-month CD could earn slightly more guaranteed interest than a high-yield savings account over the same period. However, the savings account's variable rate could decline with anticipated Federal Reserve rate cuts, potentially widening the earnings gap in favor of the CD. This article suggests that for those who can afford to lock away funds, a CD offers more predictable and potentially higher returns. (not investment advice)</p>

The mission aims to provide critical data on "space weather," the phenomena that can disrupt GPS signals, power grids, and endanger astronauts. The identical satellites will fly in tandem, allowing for precise measurements of how energy from the sun couples with Earth's magnetosphere. The launch also deployed several other small satellites for missions including testing 5G communications in space and measuring Earth's radiation budget.</p>

          <p>The price of gold has experienced a dramatic increase, rising over 42% in the past year to its current price near $3,430 per ounce. This significant surge reflects growing investor interest in the precious metal as a hedge against persistent inflation and economic uncertainty. This article notes that while gold is traditionally seen as a way to protect wealth, its recent appreciation has also made it a profitable asset. For those considering an investment, it suggests strategies like purchasing fractional gold or using dollar-cost averaging to enter the market without paying the full price per ounce.
