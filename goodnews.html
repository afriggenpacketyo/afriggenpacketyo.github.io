          <p>NBA legend Shaquille O'Neal has put forward a theory that the recent Blue Origin space flight, which featured an all-female crew including Jeff Bezos's fianc√©e Lauren Sanchez and singer Katy Perry, may not have actually occurred. O'Neal cited discrepancies within the video released by Blue Origin, including the lack of hair movement in zero gravity and an already open hatch upon landing. O'Neal believes Bezos would not risk sending Sanchez into actual space, suggesting the use of green screen technology to simulate the experience. Blue Origin has not yet responded to requests for comment.</p>

          <p>New York University (NYU) has withheld the diploma of Logan Rozos, a graduate who used his commencement speech to condemn the "genocide" in Gaza and accuse the U.S. of complicity. The university administration strongly denounced Rozos's remarks, accusing him of abusing the privilege of addressing the graduating class to express personal political views. NYU is currently pursuing disciplinary action against Rozos, citing a violation of university policies. The university is among several being investigated by the Trump administration for alleged antisemitism on campus since the start of the Israel-Gaza conflict.</p>

          <p>A new study reveals that ancient horses repeatedly migrated between North America and Eurasia during the late Pleistocene epoch, approximately 50,000 to 13,000 years ago. This migration occurred via the Bering land bridge, which connected the two continents when sea levels were lower. The study examined fossils, including those of Dalianensis horses found in northeastern China, which showed mixed ancestry from both Eurasian and American populations. These findings highlight the genetic exchanges between horse populations across the Bering land bridge.</p>

          <p>A CBS News analysis reveals that lawyers are increasingly engaging in venue shopping, seeking out federal jurisdictions with judges sympathetic to their political views. Conservatives have frequently filed lawsuits against the Biden administration in small Texas courts with Republican-appointed judges, while liberals have filed cases against the Trump administration in larger venues, predominantly in the 9th Circuit. The Supreme Court is now considering whether a single federal judge should be able to dictate policy for the entire country by issuing a nationwide injunction, a practice criticized for eroding confidence in the courts.</p>

          <p>As rural Japan faces depopulation, unstaffed train stations and vacant homes are being repurposed into tourist accommodations. Transport operators are collaborating with local communities to transform these quiet outposts into hubs of activity, revitalizing the surrounding areas. This initiative is proving successful, injecting new life into rural areas and attracting tourists seeking unique experiences. The repurposing of these stations is part of a broader effort to address the challenges of rural depopulation and promote sustainable tourism.</p>

          <p>The availability of COVID vaccines this fall is uncertain due to new clinical testing requirements that may delay updated shots. The Department of Health and Human Services (HHS) has announced that substantial updates to existing vaccines, such as those related to seasonal strain changes, may qualify as new products requiring additional clinical evaluation. This includes COVID shots and potentially the seasonal flu vaccine. HHS leaders have been questioning the need for annual COVID shots, especially for children, suggesting a shift towards risk-based recommendations.</p>

          <p>The United Arab Emirates (UAE) and the United States have reached an agreement for the UAE to construct the largest artificial intelligence (AI) campus outside the U.S., granting the UAE greater access to advanced AI chips. The deal reflects the Trump administration's confidence that the chips can be managed securely, partly by mandating that data centers be operated by U.S. companies. Despite the administration's confidence, some worry that striking deals with Persian Gulf countries could diminish the U.S.'s hold on the burgeoning tech, and that China would be able to access these data centers for its own benefit.</p>

The PLA Ground Force Service Academy will be based in Hefei, Anhui province; the PLA Information Support Force Engineering University in Wuhan, Hubei province; and the PLA Joint Logistics Support Force Engineering University in Chongqing. The initiative aims to strengthen the talent pool and provide specialized training for the PLA‚Äôs new service branches, the Information Support Force (ISF) and Joint Logistics Support Force (JLSF). Since 2016, the PLA has been undergoing a structural overhaul to improve its capabilities for modern warfare by 2027 and achieve a "world-class" military by 2049.</p>

          <p>A man was apprehended at the Otay Mesa Port of Entry in California after attempting to smuggle six parrots into the United States by stuffing them into his boots. U.S. Customs and Border Protection officers discovered the birds after noticing "unusual clothing bulges" around his ankles. Six additional parrots, including two that were dead, were found in his car. This incident highlights the dangers of animal smuggling, as birds can carry diseases that threaten native wildlife and agricultural industries. The man was detained and turned over to Homeland Security Investigations and U.S. Fish and Wildlife Services for further investigation.</p>

Venezuela's Vegas birdied five of his final six holes to set the pace at seven under, while Luke Donald shot a bogey-free 67 to sit three off the lead. McIlroy, playing alongside Scottie Scheffler and Xander Schauffele, managed just two birdies in his three-over-par round.
