          <h2>Trump Administration Issues Executive Order Targeting College Sports Revenue and NIL Deals</h2>
          <div class="timestamp">2025-07-24 20:24:49 EDT</div>
        </div>
        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>President Trump has signed an executive order aimed at regulating the evolving landscape of college sports, specifically Name, Image, and Likeness (NIL) deals. The order seeks to ban "third-party, pay-for-play payments" while preserving athletes' rights to brand endorsements and ensuring revenue-sharing plans support women's and non-revenue sports. It also directs universities with high athletic revenues to maintain or increase scholarship opportunities for sports that generate less income. The move attempts to introduce federal guardrails into what the White House described as an "out-of-control" system, addressing concerns about competitive balance and the preservation of non-revenue athletic programs.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>French President Emmanuel Macron has declared that France will formally recognize the State of Palestine in September at the UN General Assembly. This decision aligns with France's historical commitment to a two-state solution and follows similar moves by other European nations like Spain and Ireland. The announcement was welcomed by Palestinian officials but condemned by Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu, who stated the move "rewards terror." The decision comes amid the ongoing conflict in Gaza and international pressure for a ceasefire and a lasting peace settlement in the region.</p>

          <p>The Roman Catholic Archdiocese of Los Angeles has initiated a Family Assistance Program to deliver food, groceries, and medicine to immigrant families fearful of ongoing ICE enforcement raids. The program aims to support vulnerable members across its 288 parishes, tapping into delivery networks established during the COVID-19 pandemic. Archbishop José Gomez stated the effort is for "good, hard-working men and women" who are now afraid to leave their homes. The initiative has already received significant donations, including $50,000 from businessman Rick Caruso, as the community responds to the widespread arrests of undocumented immigrants in the region.</p>

          <p>A number of prominent Democrats are increasing their public visibility, signaling the unofficial start of the 2028 presidential primary campaign. Figures like Rahm Emanuel, Pete Buttigieg, and Gavin Newsom are appearing on a diverse range of podcasts and media outlets, including those with conservative hosts, in an apparent strategy to reach a broader audience. These potential candidates are also adopting more moderate rhetoric on sensitive cultural topics, such as gender identity, in what appears to be a course correction following the 2024 election loss. This shift indicates an effort to reclaim middle-ground voters and avoid being perceived as too extreme by the electorate.</p>

          <h2>Big Tech is Underspending on AI Development, Argues Jim Cramer</h2>

          <p>CNBC's Jim Cramer has asserted that major technology companies like Meta, Amazon, Alphabet, and Microsoft are not overspending but are actually underspending on artificial intelligence. He argues that the race for AI dominance is a "winner-take-all" situation, and companies must invest heavily to secure a leading position, likening it to the original race for search engine supremacy. Citing Alphabet's recent decision to increase capital expenditures for its cloud and AI services, Cramer suggests these investments are both urgent and necessary for future profitability. He believes the company with the most accurate AI chatbot will eventually achieve a near-monopoly. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>The mid-credits scene for Marvel's “The Fantastic Four: First Steps” signals the arrival of the team's iconic arch-nemesis, Doctor Doom, into the Marvel Cinematic Universe. The scene depicts a mysterious cloaked figure approaching Sue and Reed Richards' super-powered son, Franklin, setting up a future conflict. This introduction aligns with Marvel Studios' plans for its next major crossover film, “Avengers: Doomsday,” which will feature Robert Downey Jr. returning to the franchise to portray the Latverian villain. The tease suggests Doom's interest in Franklin's immense powers and hints at the catalyst that will bring the Fantastic Four into the main MCU timeline.</p>

          <p>The U.S. Environmental Protection Agency and Mexico's environmental ministry have signed a new memorandum of understanding committing to a "permanent, 100% solution" for the Tijuana River pollution crisis. EPA Administrator Lee Zeldin stated that President Trump was motivated to act after hearing from Navy SEALs who train in the contaminated waters. The agreement aims to accelerate long-discussed infrastructure improvements, with Mexico committing $93 million in previously allocated funds. The plan addresses decades of cross-border sewage and industrial discharge that have severely polluted the river, the nearby ocean, and even the air in Southern California communities.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Los Angeles Rams wide receiver Puka Nacua is positioned for a significant contract extension next offseason, following the trend of young NFL receivers securing lucrative deals. After two standout seasons, the former fifth-round draft pick will earn just over $1 million this year, making him one of the best bargains in the league. With veteran Cooper Kupp's departure and the arrival of Davante Adams, Nacua has ascended to the role of the team's top receiver. If he maintains his high level of production in the upcoming season, he could command a nine-figure contract in 2026.</p>

          <p>McDonald's is set to test a new lineup of 10 beverages inspired by its short-lived spinoff chain, CosMc's, which was shuttered in May. Instead of standalone stores, the fast-food giant will introduce the drinks at 500 of its U.S. restaurants, targeting Gen Z customers' preference for flavorful cold drinks. The new menu includes items like a Creamy Vanilla Cold Brew and a Popping Tropic Refresher. This move represents a strategic pivot, aiming to integrate the beverage concepts directly into the main McDonald's platform to boost sales and attract customers during afternoon snack breaks.</p>

Despite the historical trend of the president's party losing seats, Johnson points to the 13 House Democrats in districts Trump won as key opportunities. He also defended the recently passed "One Big Beautiful Bill Act," predicting voters will feel its economic benefits despite current polling showing widespread disapproval. Johnson believes the law's tax cuts and other provisions will act as "jet fuel" for the economy, leading to electoral success for the GOP. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>The U.S. Supreme Court has temporarily blocked a lower court ruling from North Dakota that would have prevented individuals from suing to enforce the Voting Rights Act. The decision preserves, for now, a key mechanism for challenging discriminatory voting practices. The case was brought by two Native American tribes who successfully challenged a state redistricting plan for diluting their voting strength. While a temporary victory for voting rights advocates, the issue remains precarious as the court is set to rehear a similar but more complex case from Louisiana, which could ultimately determine the future of private enforcement under the landmark 1965 law.</p>
