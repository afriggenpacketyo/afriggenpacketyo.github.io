          <p>Newmont Corporation has announced a significant leadership change, with President and Chief Operating Officer Natascha Viljoen slated to become the new Chief Executive Officer in January. This appointment is historic, as Viljoen will be the first woman to lead the company in its more than 100-year history. She will succeed Tom Palmer, who is retiring from his role as CEO and board member on December 31, concluding a distinguished career of 12 years with Newmont and nearly 40 years in the mining industry. The transition is viewed as a strategic move to guide Newmont into its next phase of growth, leveraging Viljoen's extensive experience in the sector.</p>

          <p>New York Giants rookie quarterback Jaxson Dart made a remarkable debut, leading his team to their first win of the season against the Los Angeles Chargers. Dart achieved a rare statistical milestone, joining Tim Tebow as only the second quarterback since 2000 to record a passing touchdown, a rushing touchdown, and over 50 rushing yards in his inaugural start. He completed 13 of 20 passes for 111 yards and ran for 54 yards, demonstrating his dual-threat capabilities. This performance also marked him as the first quarterback to win his first career start against a team that was at least 3-0 in the last 23 years, highlighting his immediate impact.</p>

          <p>Gaming industry giant Electronic Arts (EA) has been acquired in an unprecedented $55 billion deal, making it the largest leveraged buyout in Wall Street history. A consortium comprising Saudi Arabia's Public Investment Fund (PIF), Silver Lake, and Jared Kushner's Affinity Partners will take the company private, with shareholders receiving $210 per share. EA CEO Andrew Wilson is set to continue leading the company, expressing excitement about the new partners' experience in sports, gaming, and entertainment. However, industry experts voice concerns that the substantial $20 billion debt financing the acquisition could potentially impact EA's future investment in game development and lead to further operational adjustments.

His firm, Farrells, announced his passing, remembering him as a "maverick" who relished challenging conventions. Farrell's impressive portfolio includes iconic London landmarks such as the MI6 building, famously featured in James Bond movies, and the exuberant TV-am headquarters, known for its giant eggcups on the roof. Beyond his striking designs, Sir Terry was also a committed urbanist whose work influenced government policy and promoted environmental awareness, including the Farrell Centre in Newcastle focused on sustainable building innovations.</p>

          <p>"Bernd das Brot," a perpetually grumpy German children's television character, has surprisingly achieved viral fame in the United States after being highlighted on John Oliver's "Last Week Tonight." Known for his world-weariness and dry quips, this sad loaf of bread has been a cult figure in Germany for 25 years, often embodying a humorless German stereotype. The article explains that Bernd's "anti-fun" persona, which garnered him an Adolf Grimme Prize, offers a stark contrast to typical upbeat children's programming, resonating with both young and adult audiences. His enduring appeal stems from his honest gloom and quirky interactions, now captivating a new international audience.</p>

          <p>Donald Trump's comprehensive 21-point plan to end the Gaza war has been revealed, outlining a pathway to a Palestinian state and a future roadmap for the region.

The plan also calls for the removal and disarmament of Hamas, reform of the Palestinian Authority, and security guarantees for Gaza enforced by the US and regional powers. While Trump expressed confidence, initial reactions from Israeli Prime Minister Netanyahu and Hamas indicate cautious consideration amidst significant diplomatic hurdles.</p>

          <p>Dr. Rebecca Heiss, a stress physiologist, challenges conventional stress management, arguing that inward-focused methods often fail. Her two decades of research, involving over 750 Americans, indicates that nearly 60% of people feel more stressed when attempting to control it internally. Instead, she advocates for "stress springboarding," a method of channeling stress energy outward by actively helping others. This perspective posits that stress is inherently a social experience, designed to trigger oxytocin release and foster connection. The article provides actionable advice, such as assisting colleagues, supporting friends, or volunteering, asserting that focusing on community contribution can literally rewire the brain for more effective stress handling.</p>
