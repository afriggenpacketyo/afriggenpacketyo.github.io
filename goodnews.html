          <p>Thousands of union members and activists rallied in downtown Los Angeles to protest recent ICE raids and the arrest of union leader David Huerta. The protests were peaceful but contrasted sharply with the vandalized surroundings and heavy presence of law enforcement. Huerta, president of SEIU California, was arrested while documenting an immigration enforcement raid, and faces a charge of conspiracy to impede an officer. Speakers at the rally, including civil rights leader Dolores Huerta, emphasized nonviolent tactics and the importance of organizing against the perceived injustices of the immigration policies. Participants expressed concerns about the impact of the raids on immigrant communities and the presence of the National Guard in the city.</p>

          <p>Canada has pledged to meet NATO's 2% defence spending target within a year, significantly boosting its military spending. Prime Minister Mark Carney announced the decision, citing multiplying threats from hostile governments, terrorist entities, and cyber criminals. Carney said Canada was "too reliant" on the United States for defence and that Washington was "reducing its relative contribution to our collective security." The new strategy includes investing more in soldiers and equipment, expanding the military's capability, strengthening the domestic defence industry, and diversifying Canada's defence partnerships.</p>
