          <p>The G7 summit in Canada, hosted by Prime Minister Mark Carney, faced disruptions due to the escalating war between Israel and Iran and President Trump's unexpected departure. Despite these challenges, leaders addressed key issues such as trade, Ukraine, and global cooperation. Trump's early exit led to missed bilateral meetings but also fostered a more relaxed atmosphere among the remaining leaders, according to some observers. Carney emphasized the summit's focus on long-term resilience and secured joint statements on artificial intelligence, migrant smuggling, and critical minerals, showcasing an "outcomes focused" approach to diplomacy. 75</p>

          <p>Rafael Devers is beginning his career with the San Francisco Giants after a trade from the Boston Red Sox, expressing his willingness to play wherever the team needs him. This contrasts with his earlier reluctance to change positions with the Red Sox, where he initially resisted moving from third base. Devers emphasized his commitment to giving 100% to the Giants and deferring to the team's decisions regarding his role. The Giants assume the financial responsibilities of his 10-year deal, hoping Devers will contribute significantly to their performance in the NL West. 70</p>

          <h2>Trump to Extend US TikTok Ban Deadline, White House Says</h2>

          <p>President Trump is poised to extend the sale or ban deadline for TikTok in the United States for the third time since taking office this year. The White House stated that the 90-day extension will "ensure this deal is closed so that the American people can continue to use TikTok with the assurance that their data is safe and secure." The extension is at odds with the will of Congress, which passed the sale-or-ban measure last year. The move has led some analysts to dismiss the notion that a ban might ever take place during his time in office. 60</p>

          <p>China is leading the world in converting decommissioned coal-mining sites into solar power projects, which could help advance the clean energy transition and reduce a surplus of solar panels. According to Global Energy Monitor (GEM), China has 90 former coal mines operating as solar-power facilities, with additional projects planned. These projects can help address land-utilization issues and are symbolic of a just energy transition. Other countries, including Australia and the US, are also pursuing conversion projects. 75</p>

          <p>Goliath, a Galápagos tortoise at Zoo Miami, celebrated his 135th birthday and first Father's Day. Goliath's hatchling, born on June 4, is the first Galápagos tortoise hatchling born at Zoo Miami. The zoo has submitted applications to Guinness Book of World Records to recognize Goliath as the oldest first-time father in history. In the wild, Galápagos tortoise hatchlings are on their own from the moment they emerge from the egg, with no further connection to their parents. 85</p>

          <h2>Judge Blocks Trump Administration Passport Policy Targeting Transgender People</h2>
          <div class="timestamp">2025-06-17 19:51:03 EDT</div>

          <p>A federal judge in Massachusetts blocked the State Department from enforcing an executive order that required Americans to select their gender assigned at birth on new passports. The ruling allows individuals to choose the gender they identify with and to select "X" on passport applications. The executive order, issued by Mr. Trump, reversed a previous policy under the Biden administration. The American Civil Liberties Union sued the Trump administration over the policy, claiming that the executive order was discriminatory against them. 80</p>
