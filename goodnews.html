        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>India's economy demonstrated robust growth, expanding at an annual rate of 7.4% in the quarter ending in March, surpassing economists' expectations amidst global economic uncertainties. This figure marks the strongest quarterly growth for the fiscal year 2025, with the overall economy growing by 6.5% during the entire fiscal year. This growth is attributed to strong domestic consumption and a relatively low dependence on exports, which has helped to mitigate the impact of international trade policies. Despite trade tensions with the U.S., India's economic outlook remains positive, as New Delhi is potentially next in line to negotiate a trade agreement with Washington. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>Major U.S. retail giants are reportedly pushing their Chinese suppliers to shoulder a significant portion, between 50% and 66%, of the costs associated with U.S. import duties. This shift comes as the ongoing U.S.-China trade war intensifies pressure on businesses' financial bottom lines. Retailers, including Walmart and Target, are engaging in negotiations with suppliers in China and Southeast Asia to absorb these additional costs. The negotiations are ongoing as both sides navigate a challenging period for the industry.</p>

          <p>An experimental nasal spray containing a monoclonal antibody is being tested as a potential treatment to slow down Alzheimer's disease by reducing brain inflammation. Joe Walsh, the first Alzheimer's patient to receive the treatment, has shown reduced inflammation in his brain, according to researchers. The experimental treatment is part of a broader effort to find new ways to interrupt the cascade of events in the brain that lead to Alzheimer's dementia. While it remains unclear whether the treatment will improve Walsh's cognitive function, his wife has observed positive signs in his social engagement.</p>

          <p>Adam Riess, who won the Nobel Prize in Physics for his work on the accelerating expansion of the universe, is now questioning the standard model of cosmology. Riess's measurements of cosmic distances have revealed a discrepancy, known as the Hubble tension, between the observed expansion rate and that predicted by the standard model. This has led him to believe that the theory may be flawed and require a major revision. Riess's willingness to challenge the established model has sparked debate among cosmologists, with some suggesting that the tension may fade with more data.</p>

          <p>This article explores the complexities of animal instincts, challenging the idea of a simple, inborn behavior. A neuroscientist argues that the term 'instinct' is confusing and unhelpful, advocating instead for the term 'species-typical' behavior. The article examines specific animal behaviors, such as tailorbirds sewing nests, to understand the various processes shaping them. It emphasizes the role of genetics, environment, learning, and individual experiences in shaping animal behavior, cautioning against simplistic dichotomies.</p>
