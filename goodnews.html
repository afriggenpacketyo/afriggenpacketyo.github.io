          <p>Hamas has reportedly issued a "positive response" to the latest U.S.-mediated ceasefire proposal aimed at ending the conflict with Israel in Gaza. The group stated it is prepared to enter negotiations to implement the framework, which follows President Trump's announcement that Israel had agreed to a two-month truce. However, Hamas is insisting on guarantees for a complete Israeli withdrawal and an end to the war following the proposed 60-day pause. The negotiations are occurring amid a dire humanitarian situation, with the Gaza Health Ministry reporting over 57,000 Palestinian fatalities and controversy surrounding aid distribution by the Gaza Humanitarian Foundation.</p>

          <p>British tennis player Emma Raducanu has been knocked out of Wimbledon in the third round following a hard-fought match against world number one Aryna Sabalenka. Despite a strong performance that pushed the top seed, Raducanu ultimately lost 7-6, 6-4 on Centre Court. The 22-year-old showed significant resilience, even taking a 4-1 lead in the second set before Sabalenka mounted a comeback. While the loss was disappointing for the home crowd favorite, her competitive play against a three-time Grand Slam champion was seen as a positive sign of her return to form and a significant improvement over previous top-10 encounters.</p>

          <p>A cardiologist with over 20 years of experience treating heart attacks has outlined five 'toxic' food categories he avoids giving to his own children to promote lifelong health. The list includes microwave popcorn due to chemical-lined bags, flavored yogurts for their high sugar content, and processed meats like bacon and hot dogs, which are linked to heart disease. He also advises against sugary cereals and drinks that cause blood sugar crashes, and deep-fried foods prepared in reused industrial oils. The article advocates for healthier alternatives like air-popped popcorn, plain Greek yogurt, and lean proteins to build better eating habits from childhood.</p>

          <p>England's women's cricket team kept their T20 series against India alive with a dramatic five-run, last-ball victory at The Oval. Chasing 172, India needed six runs from the final ball, but captain Harmanpreet Kaur was caught, ending their innings at 166-5. The match featured major momentum swings, including a powerful spell from England bowler Lauren Filer and a stunning batting collapse where England lost nine wickets for just 31 runs after a strong start. Sophia Dunkley and Danni Wyatt-Hodge both scored impressive half-centuries for the hosts in a chaotic but thrilling encounter that narrows India's series lead to 2-1.</p>

          <p>In an interview, documentary filmmaker Ken Burns described the American Revolution as the most important event in world history since the birth of Christ because it introduced the novel concept of a "citizen." He argues that the Declaration of Independence distilled a century of enlightenment thinking and set in motion two centuries of global movements for liberty. Burns emphasizes that America's founding was a bloody and divisive civil war, not a sanitized event, and that understanding this complexity makes the founders' achievements more inspiring. He suggests that in today's divided times, Americans can draw strength from the fact that the nation was forged out of deep conflict.</p>

          <p>England wicketkeeper Jamie Smith scored a remarkable 184 not out against India, setting a new record for the highest score by an English wicketkeeper in a men's Test match. The 24-year-old's aggressive innings, which included a 303-run partnership with Harry Brook, demonstrated the attacking style favored by England's current leadership. Since his debut a year ago, Smith has shown immense potential, drawing comparisons to Australian great Adam Gilchrist for his power-hitting and ability to change a game. This performance solidifies his place in the team and suggests he could become one of England's greatest-ever players in his position.</p>

          <p>The initial public offering (IPO) market is showing signs of life after a prolonged slump, largely fueled by the recent success of companies like crypto firm Circle and AI infrastructure provider CoreWeave. Circle's stock has surged sixfold since its debut, providing significant returns to venture capital investors who have been awaiting liquidity opportunities since early 2022. While the trend is encouraging for a backlog of private companies, venture capitalists remain cautiously optimistic, citing the need for sustained economic stability and noting that many recent IPOs have seen only modest gains before declaring a full market recovery.

Moldovan President Maia Sandu stated the summit shows that EU accession is "already underway" and not a "distant dream." EU officials reiterated their commitment to Moldova's sovereignty and resilience, particularly in the face of Russian hybrid attacks and disinformation campaigns. Moldova is eager to advance its membership negotiations before its upcoming elections, though progress for both Moldova and Ukraine has been complicated by political dynamics within the EU, including opposition from Hungary.</p>

          <p>The U.S. Air Force has suspended a proposed project with SpaceX to test hypersonic rocket cargo deliveries from the Johnston Atoll, a remote Pacific wildlife refuge. The decision follows reports and opposition from biologists and environmental groups who warned that the project would harm the 14 species of tropical seabirds that nest on the island. The program aimed to test the delivery of up to 100 tons of cargo anywhere on Earth within 90 minutes, a potential breakthrough for military logistics. The Air Force is now reportedly exploring alternative locations for the tests, which would utilize commercial rockets for rapid global deployment.</p>
