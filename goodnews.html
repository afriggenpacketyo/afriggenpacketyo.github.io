          <p>A robotic Soviet spacecraft, Kosmos-482, launched in 1972 and intended for Venus, is expected to re-enter Earth's atmosphere. Due to a rocket malfunction, it remained stranded in Earth orbit for 53 years and is now predicted to return on Friday or Saturday. Experts believe the spacecraft, protected by a heat shield, has a good chance of surviving its re-entry and potentially reaching the surface partly intact. While the exact landing location is unknown, its orbit is between 52 degrees north and south latitude, posing a low risk of injuries on the ground.</p>

          <p>New York City Mayor Eric Adams met with President Trump in Washington, D.C., to discuss city priorities and thank the president for his past support during his federal corruption case. Documents related to Adams's case were released, revealing an F.B.I. investigation into witness tampering, though he was never charged. The Justice Department's decision to drop the case against Adams led to resignations within the department. The meeting occurred amidst sensitive issues between the city and the Trump administration, drawing criticism from mayoral candidates who view Adams's relationship with Trump as detrimental to New York City.</p>

          <h2>Trump Hints at Lowering Tariffs on China Ahead of Trade Talks</h2>
          <div class="timestamp">2025-05-09 20:39:20 EDT</div>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>President Trump signaled potential openness to lowering tariffs on China to 80% ahead of trade talks between U.S. and Chinese negotiators in Switzerland. He emphasized that China should open its markets to the U.S., noting that "closed markets don't work anymore." The upcoming talks are the first publicly announced meeting since the trade war began, with investors closely watching for a resolution to reduce market volatility. Analysts suggest that tariffs may ultimately settle around 34% as both sides show openness to de-escalation and negotiation.</p>

          <p>Elton John, Dua Lipa, and over 400 British musicians, writers, and artists are urging the Prime Minister to support an amendment to the Data (Use and Access) Bill to protect their work from AI. The amendment would require developers to be transparent about using copyrighted material to train AI models, allowing for licensing agreements between creators and companies. Concerns are mounting among artists regarding the inclusion of their works in data used to develop generative AI systems, with some arguing that a restrictive copyright regime could hamper the UK's bid for growth.</p>

          <p>After their daughter Maribeth tragically died, Kari and Bill Cox of West Virginia decided to continue giving foster children hope by taking in four more kids, bringing their total to 14. Maribeth, who had autism, was adopted from China and thrived in their loving family. Following her death, Kari found a journal entry where Maribeth expressed gratitude for her loving family, which inspired Kari and Bill to continue fostering children in need. Kari states that their need was greater than her pain, and that's the essence of a mother's instinct, that unwavering selflessness that goes beyond the biological to create something truly divine.</p>

          <p>California public health officials have announced an annual quarantine on mussels that aren't commercially harvested, due to naturally occurring toxins that can make them poisonous to humans. The quarantine, running through October 31, warns against eating sport-harvested mussels off the West Coast due to the risk of paralytic shellfish poisoning and domoic acid biotoxins. These toxins occur during algae blooms and accumulate in shellfish, with no known antidotes for the poisoning. Commercially grown mussels from certified companies are exempt from the quarantine, as they undergo frequent testing.</p>
