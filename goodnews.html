          <p>Chinese government scientists reported the results of a successful weather modification experiment in Xinjiang, where cloud seeding drones increased rainfall by over 4 percent across a large area. The operation generated over 70,000 cubic meters of additional precipitation using a small amount of silver iodide. The test, conducted by the China Meteorological Administration, demonstrates China's continued investment in and advancement of weather modification technologies to address water scarcity in arid regions.</p>

          <p>Romania held a re-run of its presidential election after the original vote in November was annulled due to irregularities and allegations of Russian interference. The initial election saw a far-right, pro-Russian candidate surprisingly win the first round, but the results were overturned by the constitutional court. While the pro-Russian candidate is banned from the re-run, his ally from the hard-right Alliance for the Unity of Romanians is expected to progress to the second round, facing challenges from pro-EU candidates. The election highlights the ongoing tensions between pro-Western and pro-Russian factions in the country.</p>

        </div>
        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>The article critiques the recent panic surrounding baby food pouches and ultra-processed foods, arguing that it is another way of making mothers feel guilty. The author, a mother herself, questions the moral judgment placed on mothers who choose convenience over cooking everything from scratch. She emphasizes the importance of considering social, political, and economic factors, such as time constraints and labor, rather than solely blaming mothers for dietary choices. The author calls for a more supportive society for parents, advocating for improved paternity leave, workplace creches, and SureStart centers.</p>
