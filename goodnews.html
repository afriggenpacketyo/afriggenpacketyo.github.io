          <p>Tensions escalated dramatically at the annual Red River Rivalry as players from the Oklahoma Sooners and Texas Longhorns engaged in a heated pregame scuffle on the field at the Cotton Bowl. Staff members and referees promptly intervened to separate the opposing teams, underscoring the enduring intensity of this historic collegiate football matchup. The incident occurred with sixth-ranked Oklahoma boasting an unblemished record, while Texas aimed to recover from an upset loss. The game also featured Oklahoma quarterback John Mateer returning from injury, contrasting with Texas's Arch Manning, who has faced challenges in his inaugural season as a full-time starter.</p>

          <p>China is actively formulating its 15th five-year plan, an extensive blueprint set to guide the country's development over the next half-decade. This upcoming plan is anticipated to significantly reshape China's approach to infrastructure spending and investment, potentially moving away from the large-scale public works projects that characterized previous periods of rapid economic expansion. While earlier initiatives were successful in driving growth, some contributed to local government debt. The new strategy is expected to prioritize more tech-driven and people-focused infrastructure, aiming for sustainable development while addressing financial pressures. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>UK Prime Minister Sir Keir Starmer is scheduled to attend an international peace summit in Sharm El-Sheikh, Egypt, on Monday, where a significant Gaza peace plan is expected to be formally signed. The summit, co-chaired by US President Donald Trump and Egyptian President Abdel Fattah al-Sisi, will convene leaders from more than 20 nations. Starmer plans to commend Trump and other key mediators for their efforts in brokering the initial phase of the ceasefire agreement, which involves a crucial hostage-prisoner exchange and the delivery of increased humanitarian aid. However, subsequent phases, dealing with complex issues like Gaza's governance and Hamas disarmament, are expected to present substantial negotiation challenges.</p>

          <p>An opinion article suggests that US-Gulf partnerships, particularly with the UAE, could significantly challenge China's aspirations for global AI leadership. While China has launched an innovative underwater data center in Hainan, its ambition to lead the $242 billion data center industry faces hurdles. The article highlights the rapid data center expansion in the UAE, bolstered by Trump administration deals for chip supplies and the upcoming Stargate UAE AI data center. The US's growing financial stakes in semiconductor companies and its integrated supply chain with Nvidia are presented as critical advantages, potentially outpacing China's near-term data center build-up.

This significant development coincides with a partial withdrawal of Israeli troops from Gaza and a confirmed peace summit in Egypt aimed at finalizing the agreement. However, the situation remains precarious, with Hamas mobilizing fighters in Gaza and ongoing concerns regarding internal violence and the efficient distribution of humanitarian aid.</p>

          <p>Quaker, a 15-year-old British army horse, has been granted a well-deserved retirement at The Horse Trust sanctuary in rural Buckinghamshire, following serious injuries sustained during a dramatic runaway incident in London last year. The horse was one of five from the Household Cavalry Mounted Regiment that were spooked by construction noise, causing them to gallop through city streets, where they collided with taxis and a tour bus, resulting in injuries to several people and soldiers. Major Thomas Stewart confirmed that Quaker's injuries, including a broken bone and severe bleeding, rendered him unable to return to active duties, making retirement the optimal choice for his long-term welfare.</p>
