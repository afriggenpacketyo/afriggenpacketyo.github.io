        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>According to a psychologist specializing in couples, common sources of conflict include tone of voice, family relations, household chores, and communication styles. Contemptuous tone is a strong predictor of divorce, while arguments about family often reflect unmet needs. Uneven distribution of household labor and ineffective communication can also lead to significant conflict. The article suggests strategies for couples to address these issues, such as naming the effect of condescending tones, reassuring each other in family disputes, acknowledging the invisible load of domestic work, and using a designated word to signal the need for a time-out during heated conversations.</p>

The MLS Players' Association (MLSPA) has criticized the offer, stating that the payout is below international standards and that the league has attempted to strong-arm players into CBA waivers. The current CBA allows players to receive half of any prize money with a hard cap of $1 million, which the Club World Cup's participation prize already maxes out. The prize money structure was protested by the Seattle Sounders, highlighting the ongoing negotiations between the league and its players.</p>
