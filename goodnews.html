          <p>China is launching a new visa category effective October 1st, aimed at attracting global professionals in science, technology, engineering, and mathematics (STEM). The policy change is designed to offer greater flexibility and fewer barriers for international talent, signaling a strategic move to enhance innovation and competitiveness in its high-tech industries. While the new visa is welcomed by foreign nationals who faced uncertainty about their post-graduation stay, observers caution that its success will depend on effective policy support and implementation. The move is seen as a significant shift in the country's immigration policy.</p>

          <p>Japan's Nikkei 225 stock index surged to a new record high, crossing the 44,000 mark, following the resignation announcement of Prime Minister Shigeru Ishiba. The market rally was led by the technology sector, with investors reportedly betting that the country's next leader will introduce a new wave of fiscal stimulus to bolster the economy. Despite near-term political uncertainty, financial analysts suggest the leadership change could lead to greater long-term policy stability and a more pro-growth environment. The positive market movement reflects investor optimism about potential economic policies from the next administration. (not investment advice)</p>

She recounted how Schwarzenegger had her sing En Vogue's "Whatta Man" approximately 12 times at his birthday party. The artist also discussed her initial struggles in the music industry, where executives were unsure how to market her unique voice and appearance, often telling her to change her look.

          <p>Cannabis use among Americans aged 65 and older has seen a significant 46% increase between 2021 and 2023, according to a recent study. With marijuana now legal for medical or recreational use in most states, the stigma surrounding it is diminishing, and many seniors are exploring it as a solution for issues like pain, PTSD, and relaxation. However, medical professionals caution that THC, the main psychoactive compound, may carry cardiovascular risks regardless of how it is ingested. Despite these warnings, many older adults view cannabis as another option in managing their health, weighing its benefits against the potential risks.</p>

          <p>The Los Angeles Dodgers have activated third baseman Max Muncy from the injured list, providing a much-needed boost to the team's struggling offense. Muncy, who missed 23 games with an oblique injury, was immediately placed back in the lineup, batting cleanup against the Colorado Rockies. His return is the first of several anticipated reinforcements for the Dodgers as they head into their playoff stretch, with pitcher Alex Vesia and utility player Tommy Edman also expected back soon. Muncy emphasized his focus is on being himself and not trying to do too much to reverse the team's recent slump.</p>

          <p>A port operator in northeastern China is establishing a new fruit transit center and a dedicated shipping service, dubbed the "durian express," to deliver fresh durians from Southeast Asia more quickly. The initiative by Liaoning Port Group aims to reduce shipping times to as little as six days, addressing the challenge of preserving freshness for the coveted fruit on its long journey to the region's 100 million consumers. This move targets a relatively untapped market for durians, which has historically faced logistical hurdles due to its distance from traditional southern entry points like Guangzhou and Shenzhen.</p>

          <p>The California legislature has passed a bill aimed at shutting down the pipeline from out-of-state puppy mills by banning online pet dealers and brokers who misrepresent themselves as local breeders. The legislation, AB 519, seeks to close a loophole from a 2019 law that barred retail pet stores from selling commercially bred dogs but did not cover the growing online market. This move follows an investigation that exposed how dogs were being trucked into California and sold through deceptive practices. If signed by the governor, the bill will provide greater transparency and protection for consumers purchasing pets online.</p>

          <p>The U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA) has approved this year's updated COVID-19 vaccines, specifically targeting adults aged 65 and older and younger individuals with certain medical conditions that increase their risk of severe infection. While officials state that anyone can get a vaccine after consulting a doctor, the narrower approval may limit access for some who were previously eligible. High-risk conditions include asthma, diabetes, heart conditions, obesity, and pregnancy.

          <p>England's Test cricket coach, Brendon McCullum, has expressed frustration with what he calls "disrespectful" misconceptions about his team's aggressive style of play, often labeled "Bazball." He clarified that the team's approach is not about recklessly swinging the bat but about creating an environment where players can perform without being restricted by the pressures of international cricket. McCullum, who dislikes the term, emphasized that the focus is on fostering a positive mindset to allow talent to flourish, rather than adhering to a rigid, high-risk playing style. He asserted that the team is deeply determined to succeed.</p>

          <p>Norwegian Prime Minister Jonas Gahr Stoere has won a second term after his Labour Party emerged as the top vote-getter in a closely contested parliamentary election. With around 28% of the vote, Labour and its four left-leaning allies secured a narrow majority of 87 seats in the 169-seat parliament. The election campaign focused on domestic issues like the rising cost of living and the quality of public services, as well as the tumultuous international political landscape. The populist Progress Party on the right also saw significant gains, doubling its share of the vote from the 2021 election.</p>

          <p>CNBC's Jim Cramer reviewed several recent pessimistic narratives on Wall Street that he argues were largely overblown, particularly concerning major tech companies. He pointed to fears that a Department of Justice ruling would force a punitive breakup of Alphabet, which did not materialize, and concerns about Amazon's web services falling behind, which the market has since moved past. Cramer also discussed worries over Apple's AI strategy and competitive pressures on Nvidia, suggesting that negativity is often overhyped. He asserted that when these negative predictions fail to come true, the corrections are rarely acknowledged by market pessimists. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>The Murdoch family succession dispute has concluded with a $3.3 billion settlement, solidifying Lachlan Murdoch's control over Fox Corp. and News Corp. The agreement resolves legal challenges from his siblings—Prudence, Elisabeth, and James—who will relinquish their shares in the family trust in exchange for their portion of the settlement. Patriarch Rupert Murdoch had sought to amend the trust to ensure his media empire's conservative direction under Lachlan, fearing his other children's more liberal views would alter its course. This resolution ends the internal power struggle and secures the intended ideological future for outlets like Fox News.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>China has made remarkable strides in reducing air and water pollution over the past decade, even as its industrial sector has continued to expand. According to Ma Jun, founder of the Institute of Public and Environmental Affairs, this success is not due to deindustrialization but rather a technology-driven decarbonization effort. From 2015 to 2022, the average annual level of PM2.5 air pollution fell by over 35%, a reduction comparable to what the U.S. achieved in three decades. This environmental progress is attributed to massive investments in green infrastructure, cutting-edge technology, and real-time pollution monitoring systems.</p>
