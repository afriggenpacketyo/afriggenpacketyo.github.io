          <p>Robinhood announced second-quarter financial results that significantly surpassed Wall Street expectations, with revenue climbing 45% year-over-year to $989 million. The company's net income more than doubled, and it experienced substantial growth in its user base, with funded customers increasing by 2.3 million. This strong performance was driven by robust net deposits and higher valuations in equities and cryptocurrencies, alongside a 76% surge in subscribers to its premium Robinhood Gold service. The report reflects a period of major growth for the company, with its stock having rallied over 400% in the past year. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>Meta's shares climbed after the company reported second-quarter earnings that beat revenue expectations and provided a strong forecast for the upcoming quarter. Revenue grew 22% year-over-year to $47.52 billion, with net income rising 36% to $18.34 billion, largely driven by a significant beat in advertising revenue. The company also raised its capital expenditure outlook, signaling major investments in AI, including the hiring of Scale AI's CEO to co-lead its new Superintelligence Labs. Despite a $4.53 billion operating loss in its Reality Labs division, overall user growth across its apps remained strong. (not investment advice)</p>

The walkout, the 12th since spring 2023, concluded after previous negotiations over pay and working conditions broke down. Streeting stated he is not willing to negotiate further on pay but will resume discussions on other issues like career progression and exam fees. He warned the union that the recent strike had squandered governmental goodwill, though the BMA expressed hope for a tangible settlement offer this time.</p>

          <p>The Museum of Contemporary Art in Los Angeles has named Ann Goldstein, a former senior curator with deep roots at the institution, as its interim director. The appointment follows the announcement that current director Johanna Burton will be leaving to lead the Institute of Contemporary Art at the University of Pennsylvania. Burton's departure marks another leadership transition for MOCA, which has seen five directors leave since 2008. Goldstein, who worked at MOCA for over two decades before holding leadership roles at other major museums, is seen as a stabilizing force during the search for a permanent replacement.</p>

          <p>A Senate committee has advanced legislation aimed at banning members of Congress and their spouses from trading individual stocks. In an 8-7 vote, Republican Senator Josh Hawley joined with Democrats on the Homeland Security and Governmental Affairs Committee to move the bill forward, despite opposition from other committee Republicans. The proposed measure, now called the Honest Act, would require lawmakers to divest their individual stock holdings. The move has drawn praise from former House Speaker Nancy Pelosi and a conceptually positive, if later critical, response from President Trump, highlighting the complex political dynamics surrounding the issue.</p>

          <p>The U.S. State Department has confirmed the repatriation of an American child from the al-Hol camp in northeastern Syria, a facility housing tens of thousands of individuals with alleged ties to ISIS. The child, who will be reunified with family, has spent their entire life in the camp, which is known for its poor living conditions and security challenges. The U.S. continues to urge other nations to repatriate their citizens from al-Hol and similar camps, calling it the only durable solution to the humanitarian crisis. This action occurs as Washington pushes for a unified Syrian territory under its new interim government.</p>

          <p>Former Vice President Kamala Harris has announced she will not run for governor of California, ending months of speculation and opening up the race to succeed the term-limited Governor Gavin Newsom. In her statement, Harris indicated that her public service would not be in elected office for now, but she plans to remain politically active. Her decision fundamentally reshapes the contest in the nation's most populous blue state, where she was considered a leading potential candidate. The move allows a crowded field of other prominent Democrats and Republicans to begin their campaigns in earnest for the upcoming election.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>The Federal Reserve's Open Market Committee voted to keep its benchmark interest rate steady in the 4.25%-4.5% range, citing elevated economic uncertainty while noting solid labor market conditions. The decision came with two dissents from Fed Governors who favored a rate cut, marking a rare public division. Fed Chair Jerome Powell acknowledged the economy is in good shape but faces risks, including the potential inflationary impact of tariffs. This hold strategy defies persistent calls from President Donald Trump for aggressive rate cuts to stimulate the economy and lower borrowing costs. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>This article explores the interest-earning potential of depositing $10,000 into a high-yield savings account in the current rate environment. While traditional savings accounts offer minimal returns, high-yield options provide significantly higher rates, with some online banks offering over 4%. The analysis provides specific calculations showing that a $10,000 deposit could earn over $400 in one year, assuming rates remain constant. However, the article also notes that these accounts have variable rates that will fluctuate with market conditions, making future earnings subject to change. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>The Hollywood Premiere Motel, a 1960s-era lodging known more for its weathered neon sign than its guest ratings, has been officially named a Los Angeles Historic-Cultural Monument. The City Council approved the designation, recognizing the motel as a rare and highly intact example of mid-century Googie architecture that catered to automobile tourism. Despite poor online reviews, its distinctive look has made it a popular filming location for television shows and music videos. While the landmark status does not guarantee protection from demolition, it requires city review for any proposed alterations to the historic property.</p>

          <p>RB Leipzig's 22-year-old striker, Benjamin Sesko, is a top target for several Premier League clubs this summer, including Manchester United and Newcastle. Valued at around £70 million, the Slovenian international is noted for his height, speed, and clinical finishing, drawing comparisons to Erling Haaland. Sesko has become a more versatile player, contributing significantly to Leipzig's attack with 39 goals over the past two seasons. With Leipzig failing to qualify for European competition, an informal agreement may allow him to leave if a top club meets the asking price, setting the stage for a potential high-profile transfer.</p>

With rates for many other borrowing options remaining high, tapping into home equity can be an affordable alternative for homeowners. The average rates for home equity loans are in the low-to-mid 8% range, while the average HELOC rate is around 8.26%. The article explains the difference between the two products—a fixed-rate lump sum versus a variable-rate line of credit—and notes that rates are poised to decline if the Federal Reserve issues further cuts.
