          <p>Asian markets showed mixed performance as Japan's Nikkei 225 reversed gains after Sanae Takaichi became the first female prime minister, winning the lower house vote. South Korea's Kospi index surged to a record high amid optimism about a potential trade agreement with the U.S., with auto stocks like Hyundai Motor and Kia Corp leading the gains. Australia's ASX/S&P 200 also rose following a critical minerals agreement with the U.S., benefiting rare earth companies such as Lynas Rare Earths and Iluka Resources. Hong Kong's Hang Seng Index and mainland's CSI 300 saw increases, while CATL's shares jumped after strong third-quarter earnings. (not investment advice) </p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>A collaborative research team from China and Australia has identified a cellular weakness that may help in the fight against prostate cancer. The team discovered two protein enzymes that play a crucial role in the growth, survival, and treatment resistance of prostate cancer cells. This research, published in the journal Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences (PNAS), suggests that a new therapeutic strategy could be developed to target these enzymes. The androgen receptor (AR) protein, essential for male sexual development, is also a key factor in prostate cancer, and the team's findings offer insights into regulating this protein. </p>

          <p>Australian scientists have discovered new species, including a semi-transparent crab and a glowing lantern shark, while exploring the deep sea off the coast of Western Australia. The expedition, conducted in the Gascoyne Marine Park, unearthed a West Australian Lantern Shark, characterized by its bioluminescent properties and large eyes. Researchers also identified a new type of porcelain crab, which uses hairs to filter feed on plankton, rather than using claws. About 20 new species have been identified so far, with an estimated 600 more awaiting description and naming. </p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>At China's Canton Fair, exporters are observing an increasing demand for yuan-based trade settlements, particularly from customers in Indonesia, Malaysia, and Central Asian countries. One exporter noted that yuan-settled orders now account for 10-20% of their total exports, a rise from single digits in the previous year. The trend is driven by Chinese suppliers involved in data center projects in Southeast Asia and the essential need for diesel-generator sets in developing countries with inadequate power infrastructure. This shift highlights the yuan's growing acceptance in international trade. </p>

Takaichi has pledged to form a government with a high number of women and address women's health struggles, aiming to strengthen Japan's economy and reshape the country for future generations.

Aircraft windshields are designed to withstand damage, but such incidents at that altitude are rare. </p>

Local resilient corals will be transplanted onto the sculptures, transforming them into a vibrant, living reef accessible to snorkelers.
