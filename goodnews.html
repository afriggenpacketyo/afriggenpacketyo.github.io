        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Following the Federal Reserve's removal of Wells Fargo's asset cap, analysts and Jim Cramer are optimistic about the bank's future growth. The removal of the $1.95 trillion asset cap, imposed due to past misconduct, allows Wells Fargo to expand its deposit base and invest in high-growth business areas. Analysts from Bank of America and Morgan Stanley have raised their price targets for Wells Fargo shares, anticipating increased loan growth and expansion into capital markets. CEO Charlie Scharf sees this as a significant opportunity to compete more effectively with Wall Street peers and improve customer services (not investment advice).</p>

          <p>As New York City's Democratic mayoral primary approaches, former Governor Andrew Cuomo is vying for a political comeback, while Democratic Socialist Zohran Mamdani gains momentum. Cuomo's entrance into the race follows his resignation amid sexual harassment allegations, which he denies, and scrutiny over his handling of COVID-19 deaths in nursing homes. Mamdani is running on a progressive platform, attracting support with social media engagement and populist appeals. Despite the allegations, Cuomo remains a front-runner, owing to name recognition and a track record that resonates with voters, while Mamdani's fresh approach is also proving effective.</p>

          <p>Health Secretary Robert F. Kennedy Jr. plans to mandate nutrition courses in medical schools to ensure doctors are trained in treating illnesses with food, threatening to withhold federal funding from non-compliant institutions. Kennedy believes medical schools currently focus too heavily on treating illnesses with drugs rather than promoting health through nutrition. While some medical schools claim to already offer sufficient nutrition education, experts argue there is a need for consistent standards and more comprehensive training in this area. The proposal has garnered support from nutrition experts who have long advocated for increased nutrition education in medical curricula.</p>

Despite previously praising Musk's work with the Department of Government Efficiency (DOGE), Johnson stated that Musk is "flat wrong" about the bill's impact on the national debt.

          <p>An AI program trained to study ancient handwriting styles suggests that some Dead Sea Scrolls might be older than previously thought. By combining AI, radiocarbon dating, and handwriting analysis, researchers have developed a more accurate method for estimating the age of ancient texts. The redating of some scrolls could reshape our understanding of the Dead Sea Scrolls, Judaism, and early Christianity. The AI model, trained on 24 manuscripts with reliable radiocarbon dating, analyzed the handwriting style of 135 scrolls with unknown dates, achieving 79% accuracy.</p>

          <p>Capture6, a California startup, is developing technology to clean water and remove CO2 from the atmosphere at a reduced cost. The company's process repurposes industrial and water treatment waste, generating clean water and capturing carbon dioxide. The technology strips fresh water from brine, separates the salt into sodium and chlorine, and turns the sodium into lye, which bonds with CO2. This approach is particularly appealing in drought-stricken areas and is projected to save costs in brine management, and it will create a circular economy that can benefit the environment.</p>

          <p>This article analyzes the potential for home equity line of credit (HELOC) rates to fluctuate following the Federal Reserve's June meeting. While predicting interest rate changes is difficult, the likelihood of HELOC rates decreasing depends on post-meeting comments from Federal Reserve chairman Jerome Powell. If Powell indicates imminent rate reductions, lenders may preemptively lower HELOC rates, but conversely, comments suggesting higher rates could cause HELOC rates to rise slightly. The analysis also compares HELOCs with home equity loans, highlighting the benefits of fixed rates in an uncertain economic climate (not investment advice).</p>

Despite the integration of women into combat jobs, Defense Secretary Pete Hegseth insists that standards were lowered, a claim Vanasse refutes.
