          <p>President Trump has given the green light to the merger between U.S. Steel and Nippon Steel, reversing President Biden's previous decision to block the acquisition due to national security concerns. Trump stated that the partnership will generate at least 70,000 jobs and contribute $14 billion to the U.S. economy. As part of the agreement, U.S. Steel's headquarters will remain in Pittsburgh, and the majority of the investment will occur within the next 14 months. Following the announcement, U.S. Steel shares experienced a surge of over 20%.</p>

          <div class="timestamp">2025-05-24 06:00:00 EDT</div>
        </div>
        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>New research suggests that the sensitivity of human teeth can be traced back to the exoskeletons of ancient, armored fish. Evolutionary biologist Yara Haridy and her colleagues discovered that the anatomy of these ancient fish scales is similar to that of vertebrate teeth. This suggests that the ability to sense pressure and temperature, which causes toothaches, evolved from the sensory capabilities of these ancient creatures. The finding sheds light on the evolutionary origins of our skeletons and explains why our teeth are sensitive to pain and temperature.</p>
