          <p>In response to the U.S. terminating trade talks, Canada has rescinded its digital services tax that was set to begin collections from major tech companies. This move is intended to restart negotiations for a comprehensive trade agreement, though Canadian officials insist they will take the necessary time to secure a favorable deal. The controversial tax, which applied retroactively, was viewed by the U.S. as discriminatory against American firms like Google and Meta, prompting the diplomatic standoff.

          <p>Moderna announced its mRNA-based influenza vaccine produced a stronger immune response than a currently available shot in a late-stage trial.
