          <h2>Appeals Court Temporarily Allows Trump Tariffs to Remain in Effect</h2>
          <div class="timestamp">2025-05-29 20:09:37 EDT</div>
        </div>
        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>A federal appeals court has temporarily suspended a lower court's ruling that deemed President Trump's global tariffs illegal, allowing the tariffs to remain in place for now. The White House argued that the lower court's decision improperly challenged the president's authority and threatened ongoing trade negotiations. Small businesses and states had challenged the tariffs, which are central to Trump's economic agenda. The appeals court's decision does not address the broader questions of the case, and further litigation is scheduled for June 5; Trump's trade advisor, Peter Navarro, indicated the White House will pursue tariffs through alternative methods if the appeal is unsuccessful. The case raises questions about the limits of presidential power regarding trade and economic policy. Optimism for business owners remains cautious as they seek more certainty about future tariffs. Optimism score is 55.</p>

          <p>Dr. Mona Hanna, the pediatrician who helped expose Flint's water crisis, has created Rx Kids, a program providing cash to pregnant mothers in Flint, Michigan. The program gives every expectant mother $1,500 during pregnancy and $500 a month for up to a year after the baby is born. Dr. Hanna has raised over $100 million for the program, with 80% coming from private donors. Families are using the money for baby supplies, food, rent, utilities, transportation, and childcare, and Michigan State Senator John Damoose, a conservative Republican, supports the program for its efficiency and lack of bureaucracy. Since its launch, Rx Kids has distributed roughly $10 million to more than 2,200 families, demonstrating a model ready for national implementation. The optimism score is 85.</p>

          <p>Global investment advisory Cambridge Associates anticipates a potential surge in global inflows to Chinese stocks as investors reassess their portfolios. They suggest investors are looking at undervalued equities in Hong Kong and mainland China to provide defense amid geopolitical tensions. Despite aggressive tariffs, Asian equities, particularly in China, have outperformed US stocks. With compelling valuations and falling interest rates in the region, the case for diversifying away from US equities is strengthening.
