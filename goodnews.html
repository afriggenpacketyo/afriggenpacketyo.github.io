          <p>During the 250th-anniversary parade in Washington, the US Army showcased its autonomous and intelligent combat technology with robot dogs, also known as quadruped unmanned ground vehicles (Q-UGVs). The US Marine Corps also utilizes robot dogs for patrol and reconnaissance, particularly in dangerous missions such as explosives detection. China has also invested heavily in Q-UGVs for various operations by the People‚Äôs Liberation Army. These unmanned autonomous systems offer advantages over unmanned aerial vehicles (UAVs) and wheeled unmanned ground vehicles (UGVs) in urban combat, as UAVs struggle indoors and UGVs have difficulty with obstacles.</p>

          <p>The United Kingdom has successfully cultivated a positive relationship with President Trump, securing a favorable trade deal with lower tariff rates on car and steel exports. Trump expressed his affinity for the UK, stating that his liking for them is their "ultimate protection" from further tariffs. Despite differing political ideologies, Trump praised British Prime Minister Keir Starmer, describing him as a "friend" and highlighting the strong cultural links between the U.S. and Britain. This relationship is also attributed to the UK's avoidance of trade and foreign policy conflicts with Washington.</p>

Detailed proposals will be consulted on later this year, contingent on the mayor obtaining planning powers from the Deputy Prime Minister. Concerns remain about traffic diversion, bus route changes, and the quality of retail offerings on Oxford Street.</p>

          <p>The pharmaceutical industry believes that antibody-drug conjugates (ADCs) could eventually replace chemotherapy in certain cancer treatments, reducing harsh side effects. ADCs deliver chemotherapy directly to cancer cells, sparing healthy cells, unlike traditional chemotherapy. Companies like AstraZeneca, Daiichi Sankyo, Pfizer, and Merck are investing billions in developing ADCs, with some showing promise in specific settings. However, experts note that refining these treatments and identifying the right cancer-causing proteins and payloads are essential for broader application.</p>

          <p>Bullet train services between Tokyo and northeastern Japan were suspended for over five hours due to a malfunction on a not-in-service train. The train, a new type that debuted last year, stopped in Tochigi Prefecture, forcing two other trains to halt. Passengers on the halted trains were transferred or returned to Utsunomiya Station, where temperatures reached 35.0 C. The railway operator conducted on-site repairs, and the defective train was able to travel to Nasushiobara Station at around 4 p.m.</p>

The Trump Organization stated that the phone will be "built in the United States," but analysts suggest it was designed and would be manufactured by a Chinese firm. Experts cite the lack of local manufacturing capabilities in the U.S. as a major obstacle, noting that the phone would likely be produced by a Chinese original device manufacturer (ODM).</p>
