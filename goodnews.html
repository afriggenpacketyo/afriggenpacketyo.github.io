          <h2>Understanding the Differences Between Debt Consolidation Loans and Programs</h2>
          <div class="timestamp">2025-09-02 15:12:25 EDT</div>
        </div>
        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>This article explains two primary methods for managing significant credit card debt: debt consolidation loans and debt consolidation programs. A loan involves taking out a new, single loan with a lower interest rate to pay off multiple debts, simplifying payments. A program, offered by a debt relief company, functions similarly but involves the company negotiating on the borrower's behalf, which may be more accessible for those with imperfect credit. The best option depends on an individual's credit score and financial situation, and both can potentially improve credit utilization ratios. (not investment advice)</p>

        </div>
        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>For taxpayers facing significant debt to the IRS, several resolution pathways are available beyond immediate full payment. Options include working with a tax debt relief service to negotiate a repayment plan or utilizing an "offer in compromise" to settle for less than the full amount if facing severe financial hardship. Other solutions are installment agreements for manageable monthly payments, temporary collection delays, and penalty abatements for those with reasonable cause for late payment. The article stresses that proactive communication with the IRS is crucial to finding a manageable solution. (not investment advice)</p>

        </div>
        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>The article clarifies that while there are no government-sponsored credit card debt forgiveness programs, consumers struggling with overwhelming balances have options. One method is debt settlement, where a company negotiates with creditors to accept a lump-sum payment that is less than the total amount owed, though this can negatively impact credit scores. Bankruptcy is presented as a more drastic last resort that can completely eliminate debt but has severe, long-term credit implications. The article also suggests alternatives like consolidation loans and financial hardship programs offered directly by lenders. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>McDonald's is bringing back its "Extra Value Meals" in an effort to win back low-income customers who have reduced their spending due to inflation. The fast-food giant noted a significant drop in traffic from this demographic and sluggish breakfast sales. Starting September 8, the menu will feature deals like a $5 sausage and egg McMuffin meal and an $8 Big Mac meal. This move reflects a broader trend of consumer pullback, as other companies like Constellation Brands have also reported decreased demand due to economic pressures on households.</p>

          <p>With the Federal Reserve expected to cut interest rates in September, savers with Certificate of Deposit (CD) accounts should be strategic to maximize their returns. The article advises against several key mistakes, including shopping around for the perfect rate for too long, as this could mean missing out on current highs before they drop. Savers are also urged to monitor the rate climate closely, as banks may lower their rates preemptively. Finally, it warns against allowing existing CDs to automatically roll over upon maturity, as the new accounts will almost certainly have lower interest rates. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>As the price of gold approaches record highs near $3,500 per ounce, beginner investors may find it challenging to enter the market. The article suggests several strategies to get started without paying top prices for a full ounce. These include investing through gold ETFs or stocks, which offer lower entry points, and considering fractional gold options like smaller bars or coins. Another recommended approach is dollar-cost averaging, which involves investing a fixed amount of money at regular intervals to build a position over time, mitigating the risk of a single large purchase at a market peak.

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>A federal judge has issued an injunction barring the Trump administration from using the National Guard or other military forces for domestic law enforcement activities in California. The ruling stems from a lawsuit filed by the state after troops were deployed to Los Angeles during protests over immigration policies. Judge Charles Breyer stated that the deployment willfully violated the Posse Comitatus Act, which restricts the military's role in domestic law. The decision is a significant legal setback for the administration's use of military personnel in U.S. cities and has been celebrated by California Governor Gavin Newsom.</p>

          <p>Bitcoin saw a slight increase on Tuesday, trading around the $111,000 level, while the broader stock market experienced a sell-off. The cryptocurrency's minor rally contrasted with a surge in gold, which reached a new record high above $3,500 an ounce, reinforcing its traditional safe-haven status amid economic uncertainty. Market analysts suggest that while Bitcoin benefits from some of the same geopolitical and economic drivers as gold, its performance has been partly dampened by a significant rotation of capital into Ethereum. The divergent moves highlight a market seeking both safety and yield. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>Republican Senator Joni Ernst of Iowa has announced that she will not run for reelection in 2026, ending her Senate career after two terms. Ernst, the first female combat veteran to serve in the Senate, cited prayer and reflection in her decision. Her retirement opens up a competitive race for her seat in a state that has trended Republican in recent years. Ernst had recently faced criticism from both Democrats and members of her own party, and her departure is expected to draw a crowded field of candidates from both parties ahead of the midterm elections.</p>

Starting September 15, members can choose between ad-supported versions of Peacock Premium or Paramount+ as part of their existing membership, with the ability to switch between the two every 90 days. The addition provides more value to the $98 annual subscription without increasing the price. Unlike Amazon, Walmart does not invest in producing original content but is instead leveraging partnerships to bolster its entertainment offerings.</p>
