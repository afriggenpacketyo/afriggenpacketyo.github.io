          <p>Michelle Goldberg's article discusses the Democratic Party's initial reluctance to acknowledge Joe Biden's declining health and fitness for office, despite widespread concerns. Goldberg reflects on her own early doubts and the pressure from party officials who prioritized incumbency and feared internal divisions. She argues that this 'cover-up' stemmed from groupthink and risk aversion, ultimately harming the party's credibility. The article suggests that a reckoning is needed to learn from these missteps and regain public trust by being honest about the situation, rather than solely blaming Biden's inner circle.</p>

Toru Fujii, head of Fujii Shuzo, hopes that opening up to people from overseas will eventually lead to increased exports, particularly to Europe, where the brewery currently has few sales.

          <p>Tesla has amended its corporate bylaws to require shareholders to hold at least 3% of the company's issued and outstanding shares to sue over a breach of fiduciary duties. Ann Lipton, a corporate law expert, stated that the company is taking advantage of a Texas state law that allows corporations to limit shareholder lawsuits. This change would make it difficult for shareholders to bring lawsuits against insiders for breach of fiduciary duty. This follows Tesla's move to incorporate in Texas after a court decision against Elon Musk's compensation package.</p>
