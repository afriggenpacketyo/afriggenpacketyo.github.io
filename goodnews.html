          <p>A Turkish-born florist was murdered near Nuremberg in 2000, one of ten people of Turkish or Greek origin killed by the far-right extremist National Socialist Underground (NSU). The case raised questions about how the NSU could operate for years without detection. In Munich, Hanna S. faces a nine-year sentence for allegedly attacking neo-Nazis in Budapest in 2023. Prosecutors claim she belongs to a militant left-wing extremist group involved in violence tourism, while the defense argues the event was a neo-Nazi show without clear evidence against S. S. and others are accused of attacking three people and have surrendered to German authorities to avoid extradition to Hungary. The trial began in February, with a verdict expected this month.</p>

          <p>Multinational companies are increasing investment allocations to sectors such as high-end manufacturing, healthcare, and pharmaceuticals in China, according to HSBC co-CEO David Liao Yi-chien. MNCs remain optimistic about consumption-related industries like fast-moving consumer goods. This reorientation reflects China's position as a global market for driving innovation, consumption, and growth. China ranks as the top target market for companies looking to increase their global trade capabilities, with 40% planning to increase manufacturing in China over the next two years. China continues to attract international investment due to its vast market size, comprehensive industrial facilities, dynamic innovation ecosystem, and abundant talent.</p>

          <p>With Ishiba's resignation as Japan's prime minister due to the end of US tariff negotiations, Japan's new leader will have to navigate the complex relationship with China. Chinese foreign ministry spokesman Lin Jian declined to comment on the resignation, calling it an internal matter for Japan. Analysts expect Tokyo to continue viewing Beijing as a strategic competitor. The new leader will need to balance economic interests with security concerns in the region, requiring careful diplomacy and strategic planning.</p>

          <p>Nvidia-backed Mistral AI has achieved a $13.8 billion valuation in a Series C funding round, with Dutch chip equipment maker ASML securing a major stake. ASML invested 1.3 billion euros in Mistral AI's 1.7 billion-euro funding round, gaining an 11% shareholding. This more than doubles Mistral's previous valuation of 5.8 billion euros, reflecting the booming AI industry. Mistral, a European rival to OpenAI, is building large language models for AI applications and requires significant infrastructure investments. Mistral is launching its first reasoning model to compete with OpenAI and China's DeepSeek, marking a significant step in its development.</p>

          <p>Apple is set to unveil its next iPhone lineup amid a global trade war that could lead to higher prices. These iPhones are expected to be manufactured in China and India, despite the Trump administration's insistence on domestic production. While Cook has pledged investments in the U.S., iPhones still face tariffs, potentially raising prices by $50 to $100. The new lineup is expected to have minor updates, including camera and battery improvements, and possibly an ultra-thin “Air” model. Analysts question Apple's innovation in the AI era, noting that the company's stock has been weighed down by trade war concerns and AI delays.</p>

          <p>India has urged BRICS members to address trade imbalances, as the bloc rallies against U.S. tariffs. India's External Affairs Minister S. Jaishankar noted that India's biggest trade deficits are with BRICS partners. China's President Xi Jinping warned against "Hegemonism, unilateralism, and protectionism," urging BRICS nations to unite. India sees BRICS as an economic initiative, while China and Russia view it as a geopolitical grouping. Jaishankar emphasized the need for expeditious solutions to address trade deficits, highlighting the record high of $99.21 billion with China. Despite trade tensions, conciliatory statements between Trump and Modi suggest a robust structural foundation for the India-US relationship.</p>

          <p>Thailand's Supreme Court has ruled that former Prime Minister Thaksin Shinawatra must serve a one-year prison term for previous convictions on graft and abuse of power charges. The court investigated whether officials mishandled his return to Thailand in 2023 and found that his detention in a police hospital did not count as serving prison time. Thaksin's eight-year sentence had been commuted to one year by King Maha Vajiralongkorn, and he was released on parole after six months in the hospital. Thaksin is expected to be sent to the Bangkok Remand Prison following the ruling, marking a significant development in Thai politics.</p>
