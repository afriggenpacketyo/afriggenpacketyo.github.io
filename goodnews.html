          <p>Stock trading app eToro experienced a significant surge in its Nasdaq debut, with shares popping 30% after pricing its IPO above the expected range, raising nearly $310 million. The Israel-based company sold almost six million shares at $52 each, valuing the company at roughly $4.2 billion. This IPO is being closely watched as a sign of renewed interest in IPOs after a period of market correction due to tariff concerns. EToro's CEO, Yoni Assia, expressed optimism about the market stabilizing and the company's growing business in cryptocurrencies, with crypto assets contributing a significant portion of its trading revenue.

          <p>New York Attorney General Letitia James has filed a lawsuit against Capital One, alleging that the bank misled customers by failing to inform them about higher interest rates available in its "360 Performance Savings" product while freezing the rates of its existing "360 Savings" accounts. The suit claims that Capital One's actions resulted in New York customers missing out on millions of dollars in interest payments as interest rates rose in 2022. This legal action mirrors a similar suit dropped by the CFPB under the Trump administration, and Capital One has stated it will vigorously defend itself against the claims.</p>

          <p>Joseph Nye, the influential international affairs scholar who coined the term "soft power," has passed away at the age of 88. Nye's concept of soft power, which emphasizes influence through culture, aid, and diplomacy rather than military force, gained prominence in foreign policy circles worldwide. Throughout his career, Nye served in various government roles under Presidents Carter and Clinton, and was a vocal critic of Donald Trump's approach to foreign policy, which he believed undermined essential institutions of soft power. His work has had a lasting impact on how international relations are understood and practiced.</p>

          <p>With credit card debt balances declining but interest rates remaining high, now is the time for borrowers to consider strategic debt consolidation. Taking the initiative to shop for lenders and determine the right approach, whether independently or through a debt relief company, is crucial. Borrowers should also explore alternatives like home equity lines of credit (HELOCs) or home equity loans, which may offer lower interest rates. By making informed decisions and exploring all available options, borrowers can work toward regaining financial freedom. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>Harvard University President Alan M.
