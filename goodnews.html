          <p>Nicusor Dan, the liberal, pro-EU mayor of Bucharest, has won the Romanian presidency after defeating right-wing nationalist George Simion. Simion's earlier first-round victory, fueled by anger over the annulled presidential race due to claims of Russian interference, made for a tense election. Dan secured 53.6% of the vote and promised to build Romania together, irrespective of voting preferences. Supporters celebrated Dan's victory as a win for a pro-European future and an honest Romania, while Simion initially insisted he had won before conceding defeat.</p>

          <p>Professor Benjamin Horton, dean of City University of Hong Kong‚Äôs energy and environment school, views China as a "great hope" for climate science due to its funding availability, green technology advances, and government support. Horton notes that China is investing in green technology and reforestation, contrasting with other countries that are pulling back. Having spent much of his career in the US, UK, Europe, and Australia, Horton chose to work in China because he considers it a pro-environment superpower. He was previously a professor at Nanyang Technological University and director of the Earth Observatory of Singapore.</p>

          <p>Japan's farm minister, Taku Eto, is facing criticism after stating he doesn't need to buy rice because he receives ample amounts from supporters, amidst soaring rice prices affecting households. Eto's comments, made at a fundraising party, contrast with his ministry's efforts to lower rice prices, including releasing government stockpiles. The average rice price has doubled due to a poor harvest, and public dissatisfaction with the government's handling of the situation is high. Eto has since expressed regret for his remarks and pledged to work towards resolving the issue.</p>
