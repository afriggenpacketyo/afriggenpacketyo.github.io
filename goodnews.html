        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Mahmoud Khalil, a Columbia University activist recently released from immigration detention, stated that the Trump administration's attempts to silence pro-Palestinian voices have failed. Khalil, who was arrested on March 8 and held for over three months, accused the White House of dehumanizing those who disagree with the administration. Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez, a New York Democratic congresswoman, joined Khalil and said his release demonstrates the Trump administration is losing its legal battle to deport migrants advocating for Palestinians. A judge ordered Khalil's release after determining he was not a flight risk or threat to his community, though the Trump administration intends to appeal the decision. The article underscores the ongoing legal and political battle surrounding immigration and freedom of speech. The optimism score for this article is 55.</p>

          <p>California Governor Gavin Newsom challenged Vice President JD Vance to a debate after Vance criticized Newsom's policies in Los Angeles. Vance claimed that Newsom is endangering law enforcement, a statement Newsom's communications director called categorically false.

          <p>Mahmoud Khalil, a Palestinian rights activist and Columbia University graduate, was reunited with his family after being detained by ICE for over three months. Khalil was released from a Louisiana immigration detention facility after a judge ruled his detention unconstitutional. He stated his commitment to advocating for Palestinian rights, and Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez emphasized that the persecution based on political speech violates First Amendment rights. Khalil's detention sparked widespread condemnation as an assault on free speech, and his release marks a setback for the Trump administration's efforts to deport pro-Palestinian international students.
