          <p>Over two years after filing for bankruptcy, the Bed Bath & Beyond brand is returning to brick-and-mortar retail with a new store concept called "Bed Bath & Beyond Home." The first location opened in Nashville, operated by The Brand House Collective, with plans for more stores in the area. To entice shoppers, the new stores will honor the company's iconic legacy coupons, a popular feature of the original chain. This revival marks a significant step in the brand's turnaround effort after its previous store closures and transition to an online-only format.</p>

          <p>Independent MP Rupert Lowe incorrectly identified a group of charity rowers off the Norfolk coast as "illegal migrants" in a social media post, prompting a response from HM Coastguard. The crew was, in fact, rowing from Land's End to John O'Groats to raise money for Motor Neurone Disease research. After realizing his mistake, Lowe pledged a £1,000 donation to their cause. The rowers, which included a former Royal Marine, found the incident "hilarious" and noted the "vigilante-style" response from onlookers on the shore.</p>

Trent Rockets' captain, Nat Sciver-Brunt, delivered a powerful performance, scoring 64 runs from 40 balls in an effort to chase down Phoenix's total of 148. However, her contribution was not enough to overcome the deficit, as her teammates struggled to build momentum. Birmingham Phoenix's innings was anchored by Emma Lamb, who scored 55 runs, setting a challenging target that ultimately proved to be out of reach for the Rockets.</p>

          <p>Artificial intelligence is significantly boosting the digital advertising revenues of major tech companies like Meta and Alphabet, which both reported strong quarterly earnings. These giants are leveraging AI to improve ad system efficiency and targeting, attracting increased spending from e-commerce firms. In contrast, smaller platforms such as Snap and Pinterest are experiencing difficulties, with Snap facing issues from a botched ad platform update and Pinterest citing tariff-related concerns. This trend highlights a growing divergence where larger players capitalize on AI investments while smaller competitors struggle to keep pace. (not investment advice)</p>

The company produced a record 597 metric tons of neodymium-praseodymium (NdPr) oxide, a critical component for magnets used in electric vehicles and electronics. This positive performance, coupled with a recent $400 million investment from the Department of Defense, has raised investor hopes for the company's path to profitability as it scales up its magnet production facilities.

          <p>Goldman Sachs, long a dominant force in investment banking, is now strategically focusing on growing its asset and wealth management (AWM) division. The firm aims to build a more durable, fee-based revenue stream to complement the cyclical nature of its dealmaking and trading businesses. Marc Nachmann, the global head of AWM, explained that the strategy involves increasing the number of advisors, expanding internationally, and doing more lending for ultra-high-net-worth clients. This push is part of a broader Wall Street trend to capture the stable income generated from managing money. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>Chelsea FC's sale of Armando Broja to Burnley has pushed the total revenue from selling academy-developed players to over £250 million in the last three years. This strategy has become a crucial financial lever for the club, especially under the Premier League's profit and sustainability rules (PSR). Because sales of homegrown players are recorded as pure profit, these deals provide significant flexibility for the club to fund new signings. The article highlights how this approach, which includes high-profile sales like Mason Mount and Conor Gallagher, has been essential for Chelsea's financial strategy.</p>

          <p>The historical four-year price cycle of Bitcoin, traditionally centered around its "halving" event, is showing signs of breaking down, according to market analysts. This pattern typically saw Bitcoin rally to a new all-time high post-halving, followed by a major crash. However, the recent U.S. approval of spot Bitcoin ETFs led to a new price peak before the last halving, disrupting the cycle. Experts suggest that increased institutional investment and a more supportive regulatory environment are creating a new dynamic, potentially ending the era of 80% price crashes.

          <p>After a significant surge in price, gold may be poised for a potential decline, offering a more affordable entry point for investors. Several factors could contribute to this, including cooling inflation, which historically has an inverse relationship with the price of gold. A potential easing of geopolitical tensions, another key driver of gold's value as a safe-haven asset, could also lead to a price drop. If these factors materialize, the resulting decrease in investor demand for a hedge against uncertainty could cause prices to retreat from their recent record highs. (not investment advice)</p>

The new photographs reveal a teardrop-shaped dust plume and the beginnings of a tail.

          <p>A team of archaeologists from East Carolina University has discovered four shipwrecks at a historic site in North Carolina, one of which is believed to be the remains of La Fortuna. This Spanish privateer ship exploded during an attack on the colonial port in 1748. Wood samples suggest the vessel was built with materials from Spanish Caribbean colonies, and its location is near where a cannon from the ship was found in 1985. The discovery, along with three other wrecks, offers new insights into the colonial maritime history of the region.</p>

          <p>A massive blob of hot rock, known as the Northern Appalachian Anomaly, located deep beneath New Hampshire, may be responsible for keeping the Appalachian Mountains elevated. New research suggests this thermal anomaly, which is hotter than its surroundings, originated 80 million years ago during the continental rifting between North America and Greenland. Scientists theorize that the heat from this blob makes the continent above it lighter and more buoyant, causing the ancient mountain range to be uplifted. The anomaly is slowly migrating and is projected to be under New York in about 15 million years.</p>
