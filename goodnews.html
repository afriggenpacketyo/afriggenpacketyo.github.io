          <p>Pride Month concluded with large-scale marches in cities like New York, San Francisco, and Budapest, where participants both celebrated LGBTQ+ identity and protested against increasing political attacks. In New York, the theme "Rise Up: Pride in Protest" highlighted opposition to recent policies targeting transgender people and diversity programs. The events commemorated the legacy of the Stonewall Riots and the 10th anniversary of legalized same-sex marriage in the U.S. In Hungary, tens of thousands defied a government ban on LGBTQ+ public events, underscoring the global nature of the ongoing fight for rights and inclusion.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>China has officially lifted its comprehensive ban on Japanese seafood imports, which was first imposed in August 2023. The ban was a strong protest against Japan's decision to release treated radioactive wastewater from the damaged Fukushima nuclear power plant into the ocean. Following an agreement reached in May to resume trade, procedural steps are now underway to restart shipments. However, it may take several months before Japanese seafood products are fully available again in the Chinese market, marking a significant, albeit slow, de-escalation in economic tensions between the two nations.</p>

          <p>Jeannette Jara, a member of Chile's communist party and the country's former labor minister, has decisively won the presidential primary for the incumbent left-wing coalition. With over 60% of the vote, she will represent the government in the November general election against a field of right-wing candidates. Jara gained prominence for her role in passing legislation to reduce the standard work week to 40 hours. Her victory sets the stage for a contentious election, as right-wing contenders currently lead in polls amid public concern over crime and immigration under President Gabriel Boric's administration.</p>

          <p>A young mountain lion cub that suffered a fractured skull and other severe injuries after being struck by a vehicle has been successfully released back into the wild. The San Diego Humane Society's Ramona Wildlife Center spent nearly five months rehabilitating the animal, carefully providing medical care while ensuring it did not become habituated to humans. After gaining sufficient weight and demonstrating natural survival instincts, the cub was released in a remote area of the Santa Ana Mountains. The center is currently caring for two other orphaned cubs with the same goal of returning them to their natural habitat.</p>

          <p>The quest to find the thylacine, or Tasmanian tiger, which was declared extinct in 1986, has become a national obsession in Australia, fueled by thousands of reported sightings. Enthusiasts use trail cams and search for physical evidence, convinced the marsupial predator still roams the Tasmanian bush. In a parallel effort, scientists at the University of Melbourne are leading a $15 million de-extinction project, aiming to edit the DNA of the thylacine's closest living relative, the dunnart, to bring the species back. While some experts remain skeptical of both approaches, the enduring passion reflects a collective hope and perhaps remorse over the animal's extinction.</p>

          <p>Legendary German director Werner Herzog, now 82, is known for a six-decade career of making uncompromising films that explore the edges of human sanity and the indifference of nature. In a recent profile, he reflects on the extreme lengths he has gone to for his art, such as physically hauling a 340-ton steamship over a mountain for his film "Fitzcarraldo." Herzog, who never attended film school, emphasizes the need for "good criminal energy" and real-life experience to create authentic cinema. He continues to work constantly, viewing the finished film as the ultimate "loot" from his often-harrowing but artistically rewarding adventures.</p>

          <p>The Principality of Sealand, a micronation established on a former World War II anti-aircraft fort seven miles off the English coast, continues its unique existence. Founded in 1967 by Roy Bates as a "romantic gesture" for his wife, the state has its own constitution, currency, and a single permanent resident. Over the decades, the "royal family" has defended their territory from rival pirate radio broadcasters and even staged a counter-coup against German and Dutch plotters. Today, Sealand sustains itself by selling noble titles online, embodying a quirky and enduring story of independence and defiance.</p>

The game was a tribute to Parker, who won championships with both franchises and whose No. 3 jersey was raised to the rafters at halftime. Despite a third-quarter surge from the Sparks, they were unable to contain Reese and the Sky in the final period, leading to a disappointing outcome on an otherwise celebratory day.</p>

          <p>Dodgers pitcher Justin Wrobleski showcased his growing confidence and skill with a stellar performance in a 5-1 victory against the Kansas City Royals. Coming in as a bulk reliever, the 24-year-old left-hander pitched six scoreless innings, allowing just three hits while striking out six. Wrobleski's recent success is attributed to an increase in his fastball velocity and small mechanical adjustments, which have helped him rebound from a disastrous start earlier in the season. His emergence provides the Dodgers with another valuable and impressive young arm as they continue their strong season.</p>

          <p>Vin Diesel has revealed that the character of Brian O'Conner, famously played by the late Paul Walker, is planned to return for the final installment of the "Fast & Furious" franchise. Speaking at an automotive event, Diesel stated that bringing the character back was one of his conditions for agreeing to the finale, which is slated for an April 2027 release. Walker's character was last seen in "Furious 7," which was completed posthumously using a combination of archival footage, digital effects, and his brothers as stand-ins. The announcement raises questions about the methods that will be used for this posthumous digital performance.</p>
