          <p>England's cricket team lost to South Africa by 14 runs in the first T20 match of their series, which was heavily affected by rain in Cardiff. The game was initially reduced to nine overs per side, with South Africa scoring 97-5 before another rain delay. England's target was then revised to a challenging 69 runs in just five overs. Despite an aggressive effort led by Jos Buttler's 25 runs from 11 balls, England fell short, finishing at 54-5. The loss of key wickets early in the chase ultimately cost the home side the game.</p>

          <p>The U.S. Supreme Court has denied an emergency request from South Carolina officials, allowing a transgender male student to continue using the boys' restroom at his school for the time being. The decision allows a lower court's injunction to remain in effect while the student's legal challenge against a state ban proceeds. The state's policy prohibits transgender students from using facilities that align with their gender identity. In its unsigned order, the court noted that the denial was not a ruling on the ultimate merits of the case, with Justices Thomas, Alito, and Gorsuch dissenting from the decision.</p>

          <p>The U.S. Forest Service is reversing a long-standing policy and will now provide N95 protective masks to federal firefighters battling wildfires. For decades, the agency had banned their use, citing concerns about heat exhaustion, despite growing evidence of the health risks from smoke inhalation, including cancer. The policy change follows a series of media reports and pressure from federal lawmakers who criticized the agency for neglecting firefighter health. This move aligns the U.S. with other wildfire-prone nations like Canada and Australia, which already provide masks to their crews to protect them from harmful smoke particles.</p>

          <p>Former football star and presenter Gary Lineker has won the award for best TV presenter at the National Television Awards, ending the 23-year winning streak of duo Ant and Dec. The victory, determined by public vote, comes after Lineker's departure from the BBC's "Match of the Day" following controversies over his social media use. In his acceptance speech, Lineker suggested the win demonstrates that it is acceptable to use one's platform to advocate for others. Other major winners at the ceremony included the finale of the popular sitcom "Gavin and Stacey" and the Netflix drama "Adolescence."</p>

          <p>Nearly two decades after its release, former Vogue editor-in-chief Anna Wintour has finally offered her review of the 2006 film "The Devil Wears Prada," which was famously based on her leadership style. Wintour called the movie, starring Meryl Streep as the demanding editor Miranda Priestly, a "fair shot" that had significant humor and wit. She recalled attending the premiere wearing Prada but being unaware of the film's plot, and noted that Streep's fantastic performance allayed fears of the character being a mere caricature. The review comes as a sequel to the hit film is reportedly in production.</p>

          <h2>Oracle Shares Experience Historic Surge Driven by Strong AI and Cloud Demand</h2>
          <div class="timestamp">2025-09-10 16:28:43 EDT</div>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Oracle's stock value surged by nearly 36% in a single day, marking its best performance since 1992 and adding approximately $244 billion to its market capitalization. This dramatic increase was fueled by the company's announcement of a massive $455 billion in remaining performance obligations, far exceeding analyst expectations. The demand is largely driven by Oracle's cloud infrastructure business, which is a key player in the booming artificial intelligence sector, positioning it as a major competitor to other cloud providers. The surge also briefly made co-founder Larry Ellison the world's wealthiest person. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>NASA has announced a significant finding from its Perseverance rover on Mars, which has collected a rock sample containing potential biosignatures. The sample, taken from an ancient river valley in the Jezero Crater, shows mineral and textural patterns that on Earth are often byproducts of microbial life. While scientists cannot yet rule out non-biological origins for these features, they state this is the closest humanity has come to discovering evidence of past life on another planet. The agency is now focused on developing a mission to return these crucial samples to Earth for more detailed analysis.</p>

          <h2>Planned London Bus Strike Partially Averted After Pay Deal is Reached</h2>

          <p>A widespread bus strike that was expected to disrupt dozens of routes across London this weekend has been largely called off. The Unite union announced that employees of London United, one of the two bus companies involved, accepted a new pay offer, averting their planned walkout. However, some industrial action may still proceed if a separate agreement is not reached with the other operator, London Transit. This would potentially affect a smaller number of routes in the city. The resolution comes after a week of significant travel disruption in the capital due to a separate strike by London Underground workers.</p>

          <p>Boeing has reached a tentative five-year labor agreement with the union representing over 3,000 of its striking defense workers. The deal, which is subject to a ratification vote on Friday, reportedly includes improved wages and the restoration of a signing bonus. The employees, who are primarily based in St. Louis and work on F-15 fighter jets and missile systems, have been on strike since the beginning of August after rejecting a previous contract offer. If approved, the agreement would end the first strike at the facility in nearly three decades, allowing production to resume.</p>
