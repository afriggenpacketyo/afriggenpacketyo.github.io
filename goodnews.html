          <p>The U.S. Department of Justice has formally recommended that the Supreme Court deny the appeal from Ghislaine Maxwell, who is serving a 20-year sentence for her role in Jeffrey Epstein's sex trafficking scheme. Maxwell's lawyers argued that a non-prosecution agreement Epstein signed in 2007 should have protected her from being charged in New York. However, the DOJ contends the agreement was only valid in Florida and that Maxwell was, at most, an incidental beneficiary not explicitly covered by its terms. An attorney for Epstein's victims stated that Maxwell should remain imprisoned for her horrific crimes.</p>

          <p>A massive 54-pound Martian meteorite, the largest piece of Mars ever found on Earth, is being put up for auction by Sotheby's with an expected price of up to $4 million. The rare rock, designated NWA 16788, represents about 6.5% of all known Martian material on our planet. It was likely ejected from Mars by an asteroid impact and traveled 140 million miles before landing in the Sahara Desert, where it was discovered in 2023. The auction house highlights the meteorite's immense scientific value in potentially unlocking more secrets about the red planet.</p>

          <p>A year after historic flooding wiped out their farm and home in South Dakota, the Oberg family is rebuilding, but the emotional and financial scars remain. The family, who had no flood insurance, sold off a third of their land to afford a new house, which they placed on a man-made hill for protection. The article highlights the "whiplash weather" caused by climate change, where record rainfall was followed by severe drought, creating immense challenges for farmers. Despite the hardship, local farmers are finding hope in a promising current growing season, underscoring their resilience.</p>

          <p>Paraguay's President Santiago Peña has forcefully declared his country's commitment to its 68-year diplomatic relationship with Taiwan, describing it as a strategic alliance based on shared democratic values. Speaking at a business forum, Peña stated that Paraguay would defend the partnership "with all its strength," reinforcing its sovereign foreign policy. The statement comes after a recent incident where a visiting Chinese envoy was declared persona non grata for privately lobbying opposition lawmakers to switch diplomatic recognition from Taipei to Beijing, a move Paraguay condemned as an attempt to undermine its stance.</p>

          <h2>Report Highlights China's Growing Prowess and Cost-Efficiency in Pharmaceutical Innovation</h2>

          <p>A new report from Jefferies indicates that China's biotech industry is increasingly recognized for its innovation, cost efficiency, and accelerated development timelines. At the world's largest cancer research conference, nearly a third of drug candidate presentations involved Chinese companies, a dramatic increase from just one a decade ago. This has led multinational pharmaceutical firms to actively "shop" for Chinese assets, seeking partnerships to develop and market new drugs globally. These deals typically allow Chinese firms to retain rights in their home market while partners handle global trials and distribution.</p>

          <p>A new Photo Booth Museum has opened in the Silver Lake neighborhood of Los Angeles, capitalizing on the growing popularity of vintage analog photography among younger generations. The space, operated by the company Photomatica, features four restored analog photo booths, some dating back to the 1950s, alongside one digital machine. While retrofitted to accept modern payments, the analog booths use original chemical processing, providing an authentic, old-school experience. The for-profit venture aims to create a unique entertainment space that feels like a "Wes Anderson movie set" for visitors.</p>

          <p>Speculation about legendary football coach Nick Saban returning to the sidelines has intensified during SEC Media Days. Former Alabama quarterback Greg McElroy fueled the rumors by stating that a well-connected source is "adamant" that Saban is not finished with coaching. Ole Miss coach Lane Kiffin also predicted Saban would be back, either in college or the NFL, while LSU's Brian Kelly said it would be better for the sport if he returned. Saban, who retired over a year ago, has previously cited the chaotic nature of NIL and the transfer portal as reasons for his departure.</p>

          <p>Shares of fintech companies like Block and PayPal rallied on Monday, recovering from a previous slump caused by reports of JPMorgan Chase planning to charge for customer data access. Analysts from Evercore ISI and Morgan Stanley downplayed the threat, stating the potential fees would have a "negligible" impact and are far from a "business model-breaking" cost increase for large fintech platforms. The rebound was also supported by broader market momentum, including a record close for the Nasdaq and a rally in cryptocurrencies. The new fees would primarily affect smaller firms more dependent on direct bank data connections. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>The number of people experiencing homelessness in Los Angeles County has decreased by 4% to an estimated 72,308, marking the second straight year of decline. The results, based on an annual count, were hailed by Mayor Karen Bass as a sign that efforts to combat the crisis are creating a positive trend. The count revealed a notable 22% drop in chronic homelessness, though the unhoused population remains disproportionately composed of Black and Latino residents. While officials praised the progress from housing initiatives, some service providers cautioned that the small dip shows the crisis is far from over.</p>

Cramer suggested that the Trump administration's Federal Trade Commission appears more favorable to M&A activity than its predecessor.

The Home Office stated it now has sufficient information to make accurate and well-evidenced decisions, and that enforced returns could begin before the end of the year. The move affects over 7,000 Syrians who were left in limbo, unable to work or secure permanent housing. While refugee charities welcomed the end of the pause, they urged the government to assess each case carefully due to the continued instability in Syria.</p>

Massie's campaign announced it has over $1.7 million in cash on hand, after raising more than $584,000 in the last quarter. The impressive fundraising comes as he faces a primary challenge from a new super PAC, Kentucky MAGA, run by top Trump lieutenants. The effort to unseat Massie is seen as a clear warning to other Republicans who might consider defying the former president.</p>

While any change to a mutual or charter-based model is unlikely before 2030, the government is seeking a national debate on the Post Office's structure and future services, particularly its role in providing banking.</p>

The rise of universities like Tsinghua, Peking, and Zhejiang is attributed to decades of sustained investment in education and the successful recruitment of overseas talent. The article suggests that this trend represents a "brain gain" for China, partly at the expense of the United States. In 2018, only two Chinese universities were in the top 100; now, there are fifteen, highlighting a significant shift in the global academic landscape.</p>
