          <h2>Analysis Explores Reasons for Low Penalty Success Rate at Women's Euro 2025</h2>
          <div class="timestamp">2025-07-20 08:11:04 EDT</div>
        </div>
        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>The Women's Euro 2025 tournament has seen an unusually low penalty conversion rate of just 58.5%, sparking analysis into the contributing factors. Experts suggest a combination of increased pressure from the sport's growing popularity, more sophisticated data analysis allowing goalkeepers to anticipate shots, and the overall improvement in goalkeeping skills are key reasons. The article notes that while women's football has professionalized, penalty-taking techniques may still be evolving compared to the men's game. This trend highlights the shifting dynamics and rising standards within international women's football, where scoring from the spot is no longer a near-guarantee.</p>

          <p>Following a landmark court ruling, the Atlanta Police Foundation (APF) has released 287 pages of records related to the controversial "Cop City" police training center. The documents were obtained after a lawsuit by a news outlet and a research group, setting a potential precedent for the transparency of private police foundations nationwide. The records reveal the APF actively lobbied city officials to prevent a public referendum on the project, warning it could derail financing and damage the city council's credibility. This release provides new insight into the private foundation's efforts to influence public policy and suppress opposition to the contentious facility.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>A tsunami warning for Russia's Kamchatka Peninsula and a watch for Hawaii have been canceled after a series of five powerful earthquakes struck off the Russian coast. The largest quake registered a magnitude of 7.4 at a shallow depth, prompting initial alerts for potentially dangerous waves from the Pacific Tsunami Warning Center. Russian authorities also issued a warning, advising coastal residents to move away from the shore. Fortunately, there were no immediate reports of casualties or significant damage, and officials later confirmed that the tsunami danger had passed, bringing relief to the region.</p>

          <p>Amid the current earnings season, top-performing Wall Street analysts are recommending three specific stocks, looking beyond short-term challenges to focus on long-term growth potential. Analysts from Evercore and JPMorgan have expressed confidence in Uber Technologies (UBER), citing favorable demand trends and its expansion into robotaxi partnerships. They are also bullish on Alphabet (GOOGL) due to its solid fundamentals in Search and YouTube, and its role as a primary beneficiary of generative AI. Finally, Meta Platforms (META) is favored for its robust top-line growth, ongoing cost efficiencies, and strong competitive moat in the social media landscape. (not investment advice)</p>

          <h2>Analysis Explores Superman's Leftist Origins Amid Conservative Criticism of New Film</h2>

          <p>Recent conservative backlash against the new "Superman" film for portraying the hero as an immigrant overlooks the character's deeply leftist and socialist roots, according to comic book author Grant Morrison. Created in 1938 by the sons of Jewish immigrants, the original Superman was a "Champion of the Oppressed" who fought corrupt capitalists and tore down slums to demand better housing for the poor. This historical context reveals that Superman was conceived as a social justice warrior, a stark contrast to the purely patriotic figure he later became. The article argues that the character has always evolved to reflect the times.</p>

          <h2>China May Counter US Tech Restrictions by Fostering AI Cooperation with the Global South, Analysts Suggest</h2>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>According to policy analysts, China could effectively respond to U.S. technology restrictions by shifting its focus to building AI partnerships with countries in the Global South. A researcher from the South China University of Technology suggests that by promoting collaborative innovation and equitable technology sharing, Beijing can create an alternative to the U.S. strategy of "small yard, high fence" decoupling. This approach would involve delivering inclusive AI infrastructure, ensuring fair data access, and co-developing ethical frameworks that cater to diverse regional needs. Such a strategy would allow China to build a new sphere of technological influence.</p>

          <p>A new study from Common Sense Media reveals that nearly three-quarters of U.S. teenagers have used conversational AI companions for social activities like flirting, seeking advice, or just chatting. While over half use these tools regularly, the research indicates that the vast majority still prioritize and prefer interactions with their real friends. However, the study raises concerns, noting that a third of teens have discussed serious matters with AI instead of people and a quarter have shared personal information. The nonprofit recommends against their use by minors, citing risks to data privacy and social development.</p>

          <p>Following the unexpected retirement of veteran receiver Mike Williams, Chargers receiver Quentin Johnston is confident in his ability to fill the void and deliver for the team. After a rookie season marked by dropped passes, Johnston showed significant improvement last year, leading the team with eight touchdowns. Now, with an even greater opportunity, he says his confidence is at an all-time high, supported by coaches and teammates. The departure of Williams puts more pressure on the Chargers' young receiving corps, but Johnston appears ready to embrace a larger role alongside standout Ladd McConkey.</p>

          <p>This culture feature from The Atlantic presents a collection of films that its writers and editors argue are superior to the books they were based on. The selections include "Jurassic Park," praised for tightening the story and creating a perfect cinematic experience, and "The Talented Mr. Ripley," noted for its faster pace and exploration of the protagonist's psychology. Other films on the list are "Tinker Tailor Soldier Spy," "The Devil Wears Prada," "The Social Network," and "Clear and Present Danger." Each entry explains how the filmmakers elevated the source material, challenging the common refrain that the book is always better.</p>

          <h2>Analysis Suggests Australian Rugby Team's 'Desperation' May Not Be Enough to Overcome Lions</h2>

          <p>Following the British and Irish Lions' 27-19 first Test victory, much of the narrative has focused on the "desperation" of the Australian Wallabies to keep the series alive. However, this article questions how far desperation alone can carry a team that appeared outmatched for large portions of the game. While the Wallabies showed fight in the final 30 minutes, this was largely due to a period of uncharacteristic sloppiness from the Lions. The analysis suggests that if the Lions can maintain their early-game form, which was physically and creatively superior, they will likely win comfortably, as the Wallabies are an underdeveloped team.</p>

          <p>The UK's environment secretary has announced a new government plan to halve the number of sewage discharges into English and Welsh waterways by 2030, calling it a "water revolution." Acknowledging that the water sector is "broken" and the regulator Ofwat is "failing," the minister promised tougher measures, including potential prison sentences for non-compliant water company bosses. This marks the first time a clear target has been set on pollution spills, responding to widespread public outrage over the declining state of the nation's rivers and coastlines. The pledge comes ahead of a landmark review of the industry.</p>

          <p>China and Vietnam are scheduled to hold their first-ever joint army training exercise, a move that signals deepening military and economic ties between the two neighbors. The Chinese defence ministry announced the drill, themed around "joint border patrol training," will take place in China's Guangxi region, which borders Vietnam. This development occurs as the two nations mark their 75th anniversary of diplomatic relations and follows a visit by Chinese President Xi Jinping, who called for cooperation to counter "unilateral bullying." The closer defense cooperation is seen as a strategic response to ongoing trade tensions with the United States.</p>

          <p>A brown bear known as JJ4, which killed a 26-year-old jogger in the Italian Alps last year, has been successfully moved to a wildlife sanctuary in Germany's Black Forest. The relocation follows a lengthy and contentious legal battle, as an initial order to euthanize the bear was met with strong opposition from animal rights groups. The bear, which arrived safely, will now live in a specially constructed, secure enclosure. The case highlights the growing challenges of human-wildlife conflict in regions where animal populations, like the bears in Trentino, have been reintroduced and are expanding.</p>

          <h2>Fossil Find in China Suggests Ancient Flying Pterosaur Had a Herbivorous Diet</h2>
          <div class="timestamp">2025-07-20 06:00:14 EDT</div>
        </div>
        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>A rare fossil discovery in northeastern China is challenging previous assumptions about the diet of pterosaurs, the flying reptiles that lived alongside dinosaurs. A team of paleontologists found the stomach contents of a Sinopterus atavismus, a type of pterosaur, preserved for the first time. The stomach contained phytoliths, which are microscopic mineral deposits from plants, as well as small quartz crystals likely used as gastroliths to help grind tough vegetation. This evidence strongly suggests that this species was herbivorous, rewriting the menu for these ancient creatures and providing new insights into the ecosystems they inhabited millions of years ago.</p>
