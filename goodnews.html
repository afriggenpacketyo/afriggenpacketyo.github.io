          <p>This article explores the history of golf in the White House, focusing on how various presidents, including Donald Trump, have utilized the sport. For Trump, golf is more than just a pastime; it's integrated into his business and political mindset, using the course for meetings and negotiations, which contrasts with predecessors like William Howard Taft and Woodrow Wilson, who preferred to separate official duties from leisure. Dwight Eisenhower, despite facing criticism for his frequent play, installed putting greens at the White House and Camp David, while George W. Bush ceased golfing during the Iraq War to show solidarity with grieving families. The article highlights how golf has been both a source of relaxation and a subject of scrutiny for presidents over the past century. The history of golf and presidents is full of ironies, from presidents trying to avoid work on the course to having their golf game be the subject of jokes and ridicule. </p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>President Trump's goal to bring back manufacturing jobs faces challenges in the aviation industry, where a shortage of skilled workers persists. The industry is grappling with an aging workforce, with many aircraft mechanics nearing retirement and companies having offered buyouts during the COVID-19 pandemic, which has led to a significant loss of talent. To address this, airlines and manufacturers are trying to attract younger people through competitive wages, with potential earnings reaching $130,000 a year for experienced technicians. Despite these efforts, the industry faces difficulties in attracting geographically mobile workers, especially as demand for air travel and airplane production increases. The need to attract and retain skilled workers is essential to ensure the continued growth and safety of the aviation sector.</p>

          <p>Italians are participating in a two-day referendum on potential changes to citizenship and labor laws, initiated by an NGO-led campaign. The referendum includes questions on reducing the residency time required for non-EU citizens to apply for citizenship from 10 years to 5 years, which campaigners say would help integrate second-generation Italians. Voters will also decide on measures related to worker protections against dismissal, severance payments, and liability in workplace accidents. Prime Minister Giorgia Meloni's right-wing coalition is urging supporters to abstain from voting, hoping to prevent the referendum from reaching the required 50% turnout for the results to be binding.</p>

          <p>Tinder is testing a new feature allowing premium users to filter potential matches by height, sparking mixed reactions among daters. Some worry it may stifle connections, while others believe it could help shorter men find matches by avoiding women who only date tall men. Some users find height preferences to be superficial, while others find the feature to be helpful for finding compatible partners. Experts say the real issue with modern dating lies within the dating apps themselves, encouraging people to treat dating like picking something from a menu.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>This article discusses the phenomenon of "anticipatory compliance," where institutions preemptively comply with Donald Trump's agenda, and argues for a counter-strategy of "anticipatory noncompliance." Examples of anticipatory compliance include universities censoring course content and companies reducing DEI programs. The article highlights the historical dangers of such compliance, noting that it paves the road to autocracy, and praises the rise of anticipatory noncompliance, such as colleges pushing back against demands and states contesting the administration's interpretation of civil rights law. The author argues that restoring democracy requires a multi-faceted approach, including demonstrations, boycotts, litigation, and political organizing.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>A network of women in Latin America transformed safe, self-managed abortions by sharing information and providing support to women seeking to end their pregnancies. This movement began in the 1990s with the discovery of misoprostol, a drug that could be used to induce abortions safely outside of a medical setting. Activists established hotlines and accompaniment groups to provide information and support, helping women navigate legal restrictions and access safe abortion methods. These efforts led to significant legal changes, including the legalization of abortion in Argentina, Colombia, and Mexico, and demonstrated the effectiveness of self-managed abortion with proper support.</p>
