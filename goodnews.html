          <p>Markets in the Asia-Pacific region opened higher on Monday after China's central bank decided to keep its benchmark lending rates unchanged, a move that was widely anticipated by economists. This stability comes ahead of the release of key economic data, with analysts expecting a slight slowdown in China's third-quarter GDP growth compared to the previous quarter. Major indices in Japan, Hong Kong, and mainland China saw gains, following a positive close on Wall Street last Friday driven by a softening U.S. tone in trade talks. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>Preliminary results show that centrist candidate Rodrigo Paz has won Bolivia's presidential run-off election with over 54% of the vote, marking an end to two decades of rule by the leftist Movement Toward Socialism (MAS) party. The election was dominated by Bolivia's severe economic crisis, including a US dollar shortage and soaring inflation, which has crippled the economy. Both Paz and his right-wing opponent, Jorge Quiroga, campaigned on platforms of economic change, promising to attract foreign investment and pivot away from populist policies, signaling a major geopolitical shift for the nation.</p>

The presence of unmarked vehicles and recent immigration enforcement in other areas led to widespread online warnings. Officials stated the operation, which resulted in thirteen arrests, was a response to local criminal activity such as pickpocketing and drug sales, not federal immigration enforcement.</p>

          <p>Steven Qiu, founder of the leading LiDAR manufacturer RoboSense, asserts that a multi-sensor system incorporating LiDAR is essential for safe autonomous driving, directly challenging Elon Musk's advocacy for a vision-only system. Qiu argues that cameras alone cannot safely handle all edge cases, such as identifying stationary white cars or dark vehicles in tunnels, and are insufficient for achieving Level 3 or higher automation. While Musk has criticized LiDAR as expensive and unnecessary, Qiu notes that its cost has dropped dramatically, making it a viable and critical safety component for self-driving technology.</p>

          <p>A new Los Angeles museum exhibit titled "Monuments" features 18 decommissioned Confederate statues, including a massive monument of General Robert E. Lee that was melted down into bronze ingots. The exhibition aims to confront the historical narrative of the Confederacy, which curators argue was based on white supremacy and the defense of slavery. By displaying these controversial figures alongside contemporary art, the show challenges the lionization of Confederate leaders and explores the contested nature of American history, particularly at a time of renewed debate over these symbols.</p>

        </div>
        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>To combat workplace burnout and reclaim personal time, career experts advise employees to learn how to set firm boundaries with their bosses. A simple yet effective technique is to replace the phrase "I can't" with "I don't" when declining requests, as the latter is more definitive and less open to negotiation. This approach helps create clear, non-negotiable rules, such as "I don't attend meetings after 5 p.m.," allowing individuals to protect their time without appearing uncooperative. The advice comes as research shows a rising number of workers are experiencing extreme levels of stress.</p>

Key plans include the "Reform and Opening Up" policy of the 1980s, which transformed China into a manufacturing powerhouse and led to the "China shock" in Western economies. Later plans successfully targeted "strategic emerging industries" like green technology, giving China a near-monopoly on critical resources for electric vehicles and solar panels, fundamentally altering global supply chains and geopolitical power dynamics.</p>
