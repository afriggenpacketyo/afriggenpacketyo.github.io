          <p>Hinge Health, a digital physical therapy company, saw its shares rise in their New York Stock Exchange debut after raising $273 million in its IPO. The stock opened at $39.25, a 23% increase from its $32 IPO price. Hinge Health, founded in 2014, uses software to help patients treat musculoskeletal injuries, chronic pain, and post-surgery rehabilitation remotely. The IPO is being closely watched as an indicator of investor appetite for new health-tech solutions in a market that has been largely dormant since 2021.</p>

          <p>Bitcoin's price reached a new record high above $111,000, driven by increasing institutional ownership, corporate adoption, and easing trade tensions. Analysts attribute the rise to positive momentum, optimism about U.S. crypto regulation, and continued institutional interest. Despite a drop in U.S. equities, Bitcoin's price has diverged, suggesting investors are seeking alternative stores of value. The cryptocurrency has seen strong ETF inflows and increased holdings by public companies, supported by a pro-crypto agenda from the U.S. government. (not investment advice)</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Teachers and doctors in England have been granted a 4% pay rise following government acceptance of pay review body recommendations. Education unions welcomed the decision but warned of potential budget cuts for schools. Health unions expressed anger over a smaller 3.6% rise for other NHS staff, including nurses and midwives, while the British Medical Association plans to ballot resident doctors over possible strike action. The increases come after ministers accepted proposals from pay review bodies, which are tasked with recommending pay awards for around 45% of people working in the public sector.</p>

The program aims to mitigate exposure risks, particularly for children, and will run until December 2025.</p>
