          <p>England's cricket coach, Brendon McCullum, has stated that the team for the first Ashes Test against Australia, beginning November 21st, has not yet been finalized. One key position under consideration is the number three batter, with a choice between vice-captain Ollie Pope and 21-year-old newcomer Jacob Bethell. Bethell has shown significant promise, recently scoring his first professional century and being named to captain an under-strength side against Ireland. McCullum emphasized Bethell's bright future but confirmed the final decision on the Ashes XI will be made closer to the series in Australia.</p>

        </div>
        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>A report from the Crime Prevention Research Center suggests that President Trump's federalization of the Washington D.C. police force coincided with a significant reduction in homicides. The analysis highlights a 13-day period with zero homicides, an event with a low statistical probability of occurring naturally, especially during summer months. The article argues that since Black residents are disproportionately the victims of homicide in the city, they were the primary beneficiaries of this temporary drop in violent crime. The crackdown involved deploying the National Guard and federal law enforcement, resulting in over 1,900 arrests.</p>

          <p>China has announced an ambitious plan to become a global leader in the application of artificial intelligence within the energy sector by 2030. The National Development and Reform Commission (NDRC) aims to establish a framework for integrating AI by 2027, focusing on power grids and the coal, oil, and gas industries. The strategy includes developing at least five industry-specific AI models and launching over 100 pilot application scenarios. This initiative is part of a broader push to enhance efficiency, drive technological breakthroughs, and create a smart energy system tailored to China's national conditions.</p>

          <h2>Labor Economists Suggest AI's Current Impact on the Broader Job Market is Limited</h2>

        </div>
        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>While artificial intelligence is causing disruption in some areas, labor economists argue that its overall impact on the current job market remains relatively small and is secondary to broader economic uncertainty. According to an economist from the job site Indeed, most AI-related job losses have been concentrated within the tech industry, which constitutes a small fraction of the total workforce. A Stanford University study found that early-career workers in AI-exposed fields saw a 13% decline in employment, while more experienced workers were less affected. Experts suggest that rather than replacing workers, AI is more likely to augment human labor and increase demand for new AI-related skills.</p>

The "Among Friends — Unter Freunden" campaign aims to strengthen German-American dialogue amid strained political relations. Traveling from New York to Texas, the authors will engage with audiences in various settings, from pizzerias to bookshops, sharing their work and perspectives on contemporary social issues.

          <h2>Investors Weigh Risks and Opportunities as Demand for Nuclear Energy Surges</h2>

          <p>A renewed interest in nuclear energy, driven by the massive power requirements of AI and data centers, is prompting a surge in potential investment, though significant financial and political hurdles remain. The World Nuclear Association highlights that all economic sectors will require more electricity, positioning nuclear as a reliable, 24/7 power source. However, the sector faces challenges such as vast capital needs, long construction times, and regulatory uncertainty, making large-scale projects difficult to finance without government backing. The development of smaller, more scalable small modular reactors (SMRs) presents a promising future, but most are not expected to be commercially viable until 2030. (not investment advice)</p>

Shortly after being discovered, the mural was reportedly covered with plastic sheeting and protected by barriers, a common occurrence for valuable street art.</p>

          <p>Private equity firms are aggressively recruiting new talent, particularly for fundraising and investor relations roles, after a period of slower dealmaking. This hiring surge has intensified the competition for talent with Wall Street investment banks, which have historically been a primary source for junior analysts. Some banks, like Goldman Sachs and JPMorgan, have reportedly implemented new rules to curb poaching by private equity. The allure of private equity careers often lies in "carried interest," a share of fund profits that can significantly exceed traditional banking salaries and is taxed at a lower rate.</p>
