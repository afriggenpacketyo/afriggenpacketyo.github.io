          <p>Two separate sailing crews, totaling nine people, were rescued off the coast of Portugal after their vessels were attacked by orcas. The incidents occurred near Lisbon, with one attack happening off Fonte da Telha beach and the other in the Bay of Cascais. No injuries were reported, and rescue services successfully assisted both crews, towing one of the damaged boats to a nearby port. These events are part of a growing pattern of orca interactions with boats in the waters around the Strait of Gibraltar, Spain, and Portugal, where the marine mammals have been observed ramming and damaging vessels with increasing frequency in recent years.</p>

          <p>U.S. Treasury Secretary Scott Bessent announced that Washington and Beijing have reached a "framework" agreement regarding the ownership of TikTok's U.S. operations, potentially avoiding a nationwide ban. The deal, which still requires final approval from both President Trump and President Xi Jinping, aims to address national security concerns over the app's Chinese parent company, ByteDance. While details remain sparse, the agreement was reportedly reached during broader trade talks in Madrid. China's trade representative confirmed a framework exists but stated that no deal would be finalized at the expense of Chinese companies' interests, leaving the future of TikTok's powerful algorithm uncertain.</p>

          <p>With the Federal Reserve expected to cut interest rates, this article outlines three strategic places to move $10,000 to maximize returns before they decline. It suggests moving funds from traditional low-yield savings accounts into alternatives like a high-rate certificate of deposit (CD) to lock in a fixed interest rate for a set term. For those who need more liquidity, a high-yield savings account or a money market account are recommended, as they offer competitive variable rates, though these are expected to fall following the Fed's actions. The central advice is to act proactively to secure better earnings while current high rates are still available. (not investment advice)</p>

Under the deal, Nvidia is obligated to buy any of CoreWeave's unsold capacity through April 2032, signaling strong confidence in the AI market's continued growth. CoreWeave, which is backed by Nvidia, already relies heavily on its GPUs to serve clients like OpenAI, Google, and Microsoft. Since its IPO in March, CoreWeave's stock has tripled, pushing its market valuation to over $58 billion, highlighting the intense demand for AI computing power. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>The IRS deadline for third-quarter estimated tax payments is September 15, and experts advise that calculations may be more complex this year due to recent tax changes enacted by the Trump administration. These payments are typically required for income not subject to withholding, such as from self-employment, investments, or gig work. Tax professionals suggest that filers, especially those who could be affected by the new tax breaks, should review their obligations to avoid potential underpayment penalties. To meet safe harbor rules, taxpayers generally must pay at least 90% of their current year's tax liability or 100-110% of the previous year's, depending on their income. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>Tesla CEO Elon Musk has purchased approximately $1 billion worth of the company's stock, his first open-market buy since early 2020 and his largest ever by value. The significant insider acquisition was viewed by investors as a strong vote of confidence in the electric vehicle maker, causing Tesla shares to rise over 2%. The purchase comes as the company faces challenges, including slumping sales and concerns over Musk's political activities impacting the brand. This move is seen by some analysts as Musk doubling down on his vision to transform Tesla into a leader in artificial intelligence, autonomous driving, and robotics. (not investment advice)</p>

          <h2>Mortgage Interest Rates May Continue to Decline Amid Anticipated Federal Reserve Action</h2>
          <div class="timestamp">2025-09-15 14:26:14 EDT</div>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Mortgage interest rates, which have been on a gradual downward trend for much of the year, may see another drop this week as the Federal Reserve is widely expected to announce a rate cut. Lenders may preemptively lower their rates to remain competitive, especially with a high probability of at least a 25-basis-point reduction from the Fed. While this provides a potential opportunity for homebuyers, the article cautions that these trends can be volatile and that the lowest advertised rates are typically reserved for borrowers with excellent credit scores. Prospective buyers are advised to monitor the market closely and ensure their credit is in good standing. (not investment advice)</p>

          <h2>Analysis of Energy Production Costs Reveals Renewables as Most Affordable Option</h2>
          <div class="timestamp">2025-09-15 14:09:58 EDT</div>
        </div>
        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>An analysis using the Levelized Cost of Energy (LCOE) benchmark shows that renewable energy sources like onshore wind and utility-scale solar are the cheapest forms of energy to produce, even before accounting for government subsidies. According to a report from investment bank Lazard, onshore wind is the most affordable, followed by solar, while traditional sources like coal, natural gas, and nuclear power are significantly more expensive to generate. Experts note that while renewables have high upfront capital costs, their operational expenses are very low, unlike fossil fuels which are subject to volatile fuel prices. The report highlights the economic advantages of transitioning to cleaner energy sources.</p>

          <p>The United Kingdom will deploy RAF Typhoon fighter jets to help defend Polish airspace as part of a broader NATO mission to bolster its eastern flank. The move comes after Poland reported an incursion of 19 Russian drones into its territory last week, an incident that has significantly heightened regional tensions. The UK's jets will join aircraft from Denmark, France, and Germany in conducting air defense missions. UK Defence Secretary John Healey stated the deployment sends a clear message of unity and resolve to Moscow, describing Russia's actions as reckless and unprecedented in the context of the ongoing war in Ukraine.</p>
