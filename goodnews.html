          <p>The third round of the US PGA Championship at Quail Hollow was delayed due to adverse weather conditions, specifically the threat of lightning, which led to a temporary suspension of practice. The start was pushed back to 16:43 BST, and tee times were revised, with players now competing in threesomes off split tees. Max Greyserman was scheduled to hit the first shot, with Rory McIlroy and defending champion Xander Schauffele in the second group. The adjustments aimed to accommodate the revised schedule following the weather disruption.</p>

          <p>The release of a 2023 audio recording of President Joseph R. Biden Jr.'s interview with Special Counsel Robert K. Hur has reignited discussions about his mental and physical fitness for office. The recording captures Biden's halting speech and memory lapses, providing context for Hur's description of him as an "elderly man with a poor memory." The audio clip comes as a forthcoming book reveals new details about Biden's cognitive decline and the efforts of his advisers to suppress discussion of his limitations. This has prompted fresh recriminations among Democrats.</p>

He emphasizes that interacting with AI is akin to asking insightful questions and that prompting AI requires expertise and artistry. Huang's advice comes as few young Americans regularly use AI, despite its potential to transform job skills by 2030. Perfecting AI prompts is a valuable skill, and students should develop it to remain relevant in their careers, as it is important to consider the chatbot as a child when asking the AI questions to get the best response.</p>

          <p>Irenic Capital Management has acquired a significant stake in Couchbase, a cloud database platform for modern applications. The company's high growth has come at the expense of profitability, leading to operational inefficiencies. Irenic has two potential paths to create value: an operational restructuring to improve margins or exploring a sale of the company. Given Irenic's track record, a sale to a strategic or financial acquirer is more likely, allowing Couchbase to pursue organic growth away from public market pressures. Haveli Investments, a PE firm, is also a large shareholder, making a take-private transaction a viable option. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>The United States is finally turning the corner on the drug overdose crisis, with provisional figures showing a significant decline in deaths in 2024 compared to 2023. The drop of 27,000 deaths is the steepest single-year decline in 45 years, bringing overdose deaths back to pre-pandemic levels. Factors contributing to this decline include the increased availability of naloxone, telehealth access to addiction treatment, and opioid-settlement funds. However, deaths from stimulants like meth and cocaine are rising, and proposed budget cuts to naloxone distribution could hinder further progress.</p>

The UK already has similar agreements with countries like Australia. The UK's European relations minister confirmed the government was considering the scheme as part of a new partnership agreement with the EU.</p>

This technology, developed by the State Key Laboratory of Aerodynamics under the China Aerodynamics Research and Development Centre (CARDC), holds potential for extending the endurance of high-altitude, long-endurance (HALE) drones, which can already loiter at altitudes above 10,000 metres for 40 hours.</p>

Prindle underwent multiple surgeries, including a bypass surgery and muscle removal, to correct the condition and restore blood flow.
