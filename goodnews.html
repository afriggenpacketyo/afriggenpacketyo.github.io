        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>U.S. inflation experienced a slight dip in April, but economists and policymakers anticipate a resurgence in consumer prices due to President Trump's trade war. The Consumer Price Index (CPI) rose 2.3 percent year-over-year, the slowest pace since early 2021, with monthly prices up 0.2 percent. However, economists warn that the impact of tariffs will soon be felt, potentially driving inflation as high as 3.5 percent by year-end.

          <p>For Americans nearing retirement, high property values offer opportunities to leverage home equity for financial stability. Options include taking out a HELOC as a financial safety net, downsizing and investing the proceeds, refinancing the mortgage for cash, or using a reverse mortgage to create steady income. Experts recommend considering factors like interest rates, investment returns, and long-term financial goals when deciding how to tap into home equity.

        </div>
        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Inflation retreated again in April, driven by lower prices for consumer staples and other items, with the consumer price index (CPI) rising 2.3% year-over-year. Economists warn that tariffs imposed by President Trump could reignite inflation, potentially impacting the May CPI report. The article discusses how tariffs, being taxes on imports, are expected to be passed on to consumers via higher prices, and it also analyzes the potential impact of a temporary trade deal with China. The report notes that there may have been some early signs of tariff effects in the CPI, but the overall impact was muted.</p>

          <p>The Consumer Price Index (CPI) rose 2.3% in April, slightly below expectations but still above the Federal Reserve's target of 2%. Housing and energy costs were major drivers of inflation, while grocery prices saw a slight decrease. Economists are closely monitoring the potential impact of President Trump's tariffs on consumer prices, but the effects have not yet been fully realized in the data. With inflation expected to rise later in the year, the Fed may opt for fewer rate cuts in 2025, potentially delaying relief on borrowing costs for consumers and businesses.</p>

          <p>The Federal Trade Commission's (FTC) new rule on price transparency, known as the junk fees rule, will require businesses selling live-event tickets or short-term lodging to prominently show the total cost upfront, including all charges and fees. Experts say this is a win for consumers by providing more transparency, but it won't necessarily bring costs down.

          <p>General Motors (GM) has unveiled new, "groundbreaking" EV battery technology, aiming to be the first to market with lithium manganese-rich (LMR) prismatic battery cells. GM expects this new technology will reduce costs and boost profitability for its largest electric SUVs and trucks, targeting the Chevrolet Silverado and Escalade IQ beginning in 2028. The new batteries use more-prevalent, less-expensive minerals like magnesium instead of larger amounts of cobalt and nickel that are currently used in EV batteries from GM and other automakers.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>With credit card balances at record highs and interest rates nearing 22%, effective debt relief strategies are crucial. Options include debt consolidation, balance transfer cards, debt management plans, and debt settlement. Debt consolidation loans and HELOCs offer lower interest rates, while balance transfer cards can provide 0% promotional rates. Debt management plans involve working with a credit counselor, and debt settlement requires negotiating with creditors. Financial planning, budgeting, and exploring debt payoff methods like the avalanche or snowball are also essential.</p>
