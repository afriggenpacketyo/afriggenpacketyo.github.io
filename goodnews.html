          <p>The U.S. House of Representatives is set to vote on the GENIUS Act, a significant piece of legislation aimed at regulating cryptocurrency stablecoins. The bill's progress was temporarily halted by a rebellion from right-wing Republicans who sought to package it with other measures, including a ban on a central bank digital currency. After negotiations involving former President Trump, a deal was reached to advance the crypto bill separately, making it the first major digital asset legislation to be passed by a chamber of Congress. The bill aims to establish a much-needed regulatory framework for the burgeoning digital currency market.</p>

          <p>Charisma, often seen as an innate gift, can be understood as a combination of influence and affability, according to psychological research. This article delves into the components of this magnetic quality, noting that charismatic individuals effectively guide others while making them feel at ease. While traits like extroversion and attractiveness are correlated with charisma, evidence suggests it can be learned through specific verbal and nonverbal communication techniques. However, the article also cautions that extreme charisma can be counterproductive for leaders and is linked with self-consciousness, which may not lead to greater personal happiness.</p>

          <p>Disneyland is celebrating its 70th anniversary, marking seven decades since it revolutionized the amusement park industry. The Southern California theme park, which opened on July 17, 1955, is hosting summer-long festivities, including a new show featuring a lifelike animatronic of Walt Disney. Despite a famously disastrous opening day, the park grew into the world's second-most visited theme park, attracting over 17 million people in 2023. The article reflects on the park's history, its evolution with attractions like Star Wars: Galaxy's Edge, and its enduring cultural and economic impact.</p>

          <p>Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing Company (TSMC) announced it is accelerating its production schedule in the United States due to strong interest from its major American customers. The world's largest contract chip manufacturer is investing $165 billion in six fabrication facilities in Arizona, along with packaging plants and an R&D center. The company's CEO, C.C. Wei, confirmed the update during an earnings call where TSMC reported record profits. The move comes as the company navigates potential tariff impacts but has so far not seen changes in customer behavior.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Lena Dunham's new Netflix series, 'Too Much,' presents a starkly pragmatic and unromantic view of modern relationships, a departure from classic rom-coms. The show follows Jess (Megan Stalter), an American who moves to London and enters a relationship with Felix (Will Sharpe) that is built more on mutual need and inertia than passion. This article analyzes the series as a reflection of love in precarious economic times, where stability and practicality may outweigh traditional romance. The review notes the show's sitcom-like, low-fi British style and its exploration of how past relational trauma shapes the characters' present connection.</p>

          <p>Pharmaceutical giants Bristol Myers Squibb and Pfizer announced they will sell their blockbuster blood thinner, Eliquis, directly to patients at a more than 40% discount. The new program allows uninsured and self-pay patients to purchase the drug for $346 per month, bypassing pharmacy benefit managers and insurers. This move comes amid increasing pressure from the Trump administration to lower drug prices and threats of tariffs on imported pharmaceuticals. While the discounted price provides some relief, it is still significantly higher than what many insured patients pay and the price negotiated by Medicare for 2026.</p>

The company now expects adjusted earnings between $9 and $11 per share, narrowing a wider, more cautious range issued in April.

          <p>Following a record-breaking heat dome in June, a group of Democratic lawmakers is proposing legislation to classify extreme heat as a major disaster under the Stafford Act. This change would allow states and local governments to request federal funding from FEMA for heat-related emergencies, similar to hurricanes or floods. Proponents argue that heat causes more deaths than any other weather event, yet it is not explicitly listed as a qualifying disaster. The funding could be used for cooling centers, water infrastructure, and heat adaptation projects, though the bill faces political opposition.</p>

The small, native rodents have become a significant nuisance, with their extensive burrowing causing damage to sidewalks, lawns, and foundations throughout the city. With few natural predators in urban areas, the squirrel population has exploded, likely outnumbering the city's human residents. A local pest control expert leading the charge acknowledges the difficulty of the task, describing it as an uphill battle against a resilient and rapidly multiplying creature that some residents still find cute.</p>
