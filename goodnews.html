          <p>This article explores the use of GLP-1 drugs, initially for diabetes, as weight-loss medications and questions who should take them. It argues that the primary goal should be changes in health, not just weight, as GLP-1 drugs reduce visceral fat, which is linked to chronic diseases. The article highlights the need for better metrics than BMI, such as waist size and blood-lipid patterns, to determine who benefits most. While the Trump administration has not committed to Medicare coverage, the article suggests GLP-1s are not a panacea and require careful consideration of long-term effects and individual health profiles. </p>
