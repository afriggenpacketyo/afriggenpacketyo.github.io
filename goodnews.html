        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Cartier owner Richemont reported fiscal fourth-quarter sales surpassing analyst predictions, indicating continued spending by affluent consumers despite global economic uncertainties. The Swiss luxury group experienced a 7% year-on-year revenue increase at constant exchange rates, reaching 5.17 billion euros. While sales grew across most regions, Asia Pacific (excluding Japan) saw a decline, particularly in China, whereas Japan experienced significant growth due to strong domestic and tourist spending. Richemont's performance suggests resilience in the luxury sector, though macroeconomic factors continue to pose potential challenges.</p>

          <p>Japan's economy experienced a 0.7% annualized contraction in the first quarter of 2025, marking the first decline in four quarters due to weak consumer spending and increased imports. The government launched an economic security clearance system, raising privacy concerns as it expands classified information to include economic security matters. Additionally, a new law now allows preemptive cyberdefense measures, obliging key infrastructure operators to report cyber breaches. In other news, former Prime Minister Taro Aso will attend Pope Leo XIV's inaugural Mass, and Toyota plans to release a new EV with Subaru in 2026.</p>

          <p>An international research team conducted an extensive genetic analysis tracing human migration from Asia to the Americas, revealing that Native Americans descend from Asian populations, particularly from the West Beringian region. The study also indicated that early migrants to South America formed isolated groups due to environmental conditions. Published in Science, the article highlights the longest human trek originating from Africa, with evidence suggesting human presence in South America dating back at least 23,000 years. This research could provide insights into disease susceptibility and drug responses among indigenous populations.</p>

          <p>Scarlett Johansson is advocating for legislation to regulate AI companies' use of individuals' likeness and voices, citing past experiences where her voice and image were allegedly used without permission. In 2024, Johansson claimed OpenAI's CEO Sam Altman asked her to voice their Chatbot, but she declined, and the feature sounded eerily similar to her. The article details Johansson's concerns about AI's potential for exploitation and her efforts to establish boundaries. OpenAI later removed the voice and issued a statement saying it was never intended to resemble Johansson's.</p>

          <p>Japan experienced record foreign inflows into its equities and long-term bonds in April, as investors sought refuge from U.S. markets due to President Trump's trade policies. Overseas investors purchased 8.21 trillion yen worth of equities and long-term bonds, the largest monthly net inflow since 1996. This shift was attributed to changing investor outlooks on the U.S. economy, prompting diversification towards Japan. However, with the U.S. softening its trade stance, confidence in U.S. assets is getting restored, potentially impacting future inflows into Japanese markets.</p>

          <p>Japan's parliament enacted a law enabling preemptive acts of cyberdefense, granting the government the authority to monitor communications data and neutralize hostile servers during peacetime. The "active cyberdefense" law requires key infrastructure operators to report cyber breaches to the government. This change aims to establish a legal framework to counter cyberattacks following recent threats against airlines and banks. The government intends to fully implement these measures by 2027, reflecting Japan's ambition to enhance its cybersecurity capabilities to match those of the United States and major European nations.</p>
