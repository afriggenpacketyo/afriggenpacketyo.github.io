          <h2>Trump Nominates Dr. Casey Means as Surgeon General After Withdrawing Nomination of Dr. Janette Nesheiwat</h2>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>President Trump announced his intention to nominate Dr. Casey Means as the new Surgeon General, replacing his initial choice, Dr. Janette Nesheiwat. This decision followed scrutiny regarding Dr. Nesheiwat's qualifications and alignment with Trump's "Make America Healthy Again" (MAHA) agenda. Dr. Nesheiwat, a former Fox News contributor, will reportedly work with Robert F. Kennedy Jr. in another capacity within the Department of Health and Human Services. The move came after conservative activist Laura Loomer questioned Nesheiwat's ideological alignment with the president, and reports surfaced regarding the accuracy of her resume. The president said Dr. Means has impeccable MAHA credentials.</p>

          <p>President Trump stated that he would not consider lowering the United States' 145% tariffs on China in order to facilitate trade negotiations with Beijing. This announcement occurred just days before U.S. Treasury Secretary Scott Bessent was scheduled to meet with his Chinese counterpart in Switzerland to discuss trade and economic issues. China had previously expressed its firm opposition to Trump's tariff hikes. Trump defended his stance by saying that the U.S. was previously losing a trillion dollars a year, but now it is not losing anything.</p>

          <div class="timestamp">2025-05-07 17:34:57 EDT</div>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>As of Wednesday, May 7th, U.S. travelers are required to present a Real ID or another acceptable form of identification, such as a passport, at airport security checkpoints for domestic flights. Despite initial concerns about potential delays, many airports reported smooth operations on the first day of enforcement, with wait times remaining normal or even lower than usual. The TSA has deployed additional staff to assist travelers and clarify ID requirements. Officials still advise passengers to arrive at least three hours before their flights, especially if they do not yet possess a Real ID, and that people who aren't flying until later in the year can wait to make an appointment.</p>

          <p>Airports across the United States reported relatively few problems on the first day of Real ID enforcement, but one aviation expert anticipates that this calm will not last. Airport representatives from Houston, New York City, Philadelphia, Miami, Charlotte, Atlanta, and Boston all reported normal traffic flow and preparedness among travelers. However, former pilot Ryan Tseko predicts massive delays due to public unawareness and expects calls for further implementation delays. Tseko noted that many people, including students, may face significant travel disruptions due to the new requirements.</p>

        </div>
        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>President Trump's proposed budget includes a plan to cut funding for the Commodity Supplemental Food Program (CSFP), which assists low-income seniors, and replace it with "MAHA food boxes" sourced directly from farmers. The USDA suggests these boxes could potentially supplant or complement other USDA programs. Critics express concerns about the logistics of distributing perishable food and whether the boxes will meet seniors' needs, particularly regarding shelf-stable items. The MAHA initiative, championed by HHS Secretary Robert F. Kennedy Jr., aims to promote natural foods and reduce processed ingredients in government food programs.</p>
