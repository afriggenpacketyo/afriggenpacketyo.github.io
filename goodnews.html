          <p>Richard Grenell, the new president of the Kennedy Center appointed by President Trump, accused the center's previous management of "criminal" financial mismanagement, including "phantom revenue." He stated he would refer the matter to federal prosecutors. This comes as the Kennedy Center announced its upcoming season, which includes both union and nonunion Broadway productions. The inclusion of nonunion casts marks a shift from past practices and has sparked controversy among artists and unions, particularly after Trump purged the previously bipartisan board of members appointed by Democrats.</p>

          <p>The Department of Homeland Security (DHS) initiated "Project Homecoming," a program incentivizing illegal immigrants to self-deport by offering a $1,000 stipend and free flight back to their home country. The first flight transported 64 individuals to Honduras and Columbia. DHS Secretary Kristi Noem encouraged those in the country illegally to use the CBP Home App to arrange their departure, emphasizing the potential for future legal return. The program aims to save taxpayers money, as it is reportedly cheaper than the traditional arrest, detention, and deportation process.</p>

          <p>The Japanese government is set to launch research into offshore "blue carbon" initiatives, focusing on capturing carbon dioxide through cultivated sea plants and storing it in the deep sea. The project aims to accelerate decarbonization efforts, leveraging the high solubility of CO2 in water and the absorption capabilities of marine vegetation like mangroves and kelp. The Environment Ministry will collaborate with the Japan Agency for Marine-Earth Science and Technology and Eneos Corp. to study the behavior of seaweed at significant depths and assess the environmental impact of these carbon capture projects. Japan hopes to capture 1 million tons of CO2 by fiscal 2035 and 2 million tons by fiscal 2040 through blue carbon.</p>

          <p>Shares of Contemporary Amperex Technology (CATL), the world's largest battery manufacturer, experienced a significant surge during their Hong Kong trading debut, rising as much as 14%.

The company plans to allocate 90% of the raised funds to build its upcoming factory in Hungary, aimed at supplying batteries to European automotive clients. Despite facing challenges such as punitive tariffs on Chinese EVs and being placed on a U.S. watchlist, CATL's net profit increased by 15% year over year.</p>

          <p>China's central bank reduced its key lending rates for the first time in seven months, lowering the 1-year loan prime rate (LPR) to 3.0% and the 5-year LPR to 3.5%. This move aims to stimulate the economy, supported by a stronger yuan and easing trade tensions. The rate cuts are part of a broader stimulus package, including reductions to deposit rates and mortgage rates under the nation's housing provident fund. Economists anticipate further policy easing by the People's Bank of China (PBOC) to bolster economic activity. (not investment advice)</p>

          <h2>Trump Questions Biden's Cancer Diagnosis Announcement</h2>

Trump appeared to conflate the Gleason score ‚Äî a measurement of how aggressive cancer cells appear to be ‚Äî with the stage of Biden's cancer. Trump also said that he believed screening for prostate cancer was "standard" in physical exams.</p>
