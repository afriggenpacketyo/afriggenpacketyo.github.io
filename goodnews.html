          <p>Los Angeles Dodgers' two-way star Shohei Ohtani demonstrated significant progress in his return from elbow surgery, pitching two scoreless innings against the Kansas City Royals. During his outing, he threw the fastest pitch of his MLB career, a 101.7 mph fastball, while striking out one batter and allowing one hit. Despite his strong performance on the mound, Ohtani was hitless in four at-bats. The Dodgers ultimately lost the game 9-5, snapping their five-game winning streak.</p>

          <p>The UK government is launching a new initiative partnering with supermarkets and food manufacturers to encourage healthier eating and combat rising obesity rates. Under the plan, businesses will voluntarily find ways to make healthy options more appealing, such as through promotions, loyalty point incentives, or store layout changes. The policy, which is part of a broader 10-year NHS plan, aims to make healthy eating more accessible and reduce pressure on the health service. Critics note that similar voluntary programs have had mixed success in the past.</p>

          <p>Following a single-medal performance at the Paris Olympics, Japan's national swimming team is implementing a new training strategy to better prepare for the 2028 Los Angeles Games. The team recently lived together in a "virtual athletes' village" during a domestic championship, simulating the unfamiliar and challenging conditions of an Olympic environment. The goal is to help athletes, particularly younger ones, build resilience and team cohesion by facing logistical challenges like travel and shared living quarters. The experience has reportedly boosted team morale and motivation ahead of the upcoming world championships.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>According to American firm REalloys, China's recent halt on rare earth exports is fueling a global push to establish alternative production facilities, though the process will be expensive and lengthy. REalloys is planning a US$50 million facility in collaboration with a Canadian partner to produce high-performance magnet materials, sourcing ore from Brazil. Analysts suggest that creating a viable non-Chinese supply chain will require significant investment, as well as potential government subsidies and tariffs, to compete with China's long-standing market dominance in the critical minerals sector.

          <p>A new pilot program is being trialled in primary schools in Kent, England, to teach children as young as five about sun safety in an effort to reduce future skin cancer rates. The initiative teaches pupils how to read UV indexes, apply sunscreen correctly, and understand the risks of sun exposure. Melanoma, the most serious skin cancer, is linked to UV damage, and sunburn in childhood significantly increases later-life risk. The program, developed by the Melanoma Fund charity, aims to be rolled out nationwide by 2026, empowering children to protect their own skin.</p>

          <p>An estimated crowd of over 100,000 people participated in the Budapest Pride march, turning the event into a major protest against Prime Minister Viktor Orban's government. The large turnout was partly a reaction to a government attempt to ban the march under a controversial "Child Protection" law that equates homosexuality with pedophilia. Budapest's mayor, Gergely Karacsony, defied the ban, framing the event as a celebration of human rights and solidarity. Many attendees carried banners mocking Orban, transforming the Pride parade into a broader demonstration for freedom and against authoritarianism.</p>
