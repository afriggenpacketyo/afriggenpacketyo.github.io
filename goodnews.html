          <p>Jiangsu Hengrui Pharmaceuticals, China's largest drug maker by market value, saw its shares rise after announcing its fifth licensing deal of the year, significantly expanding its access to the Indian market. This agreement allows an Indian partner to develop and commercialize trastuzumab rezetecan, a cancer drug approved in China for lung cancer, in various global markets excluding the US, Canada, Japan, and several former Soviet nations. The deal involves an initial payment of US$18 million and potential future payments of up to US$1.1 billion based on regulatory and commercial targets. This article highlights Hengrui's dual strategy of independent research and open collaboration to accelerate its R&D achievements globally.</p>

          <p>Brazilian President Luiz Inácio Lula da Silva has indicated a renewed optimism for Ukraine-Russia peace talks, stating that both President Zelensky and President Putin appear "more willing to talk" than in previous meetings. Lula is actively reviving a joint Brazil-China peace plan, emphasizing the critical role of the United Nations in facilitating negotiations and regaining its position as a spokesperson for member states. This initiative follows a rare alignment between China and Brazil on a US-led ceasefire resolution at the Security Council. The article suggests a potential diplomatic turning point, despite Ukraine's previous dismissal of the six-point plan, which includes humanitarian access and civilian protection.</p>

          <p>Asia-Pacific markets largely rose in choppy trade, diverging from Wall Street's decline as investors continued selling major tech names like Nvidia and Oracle. Hong Kong's Hang Seng index saw gains with Chinese automaker Chery Automobile's strong debut, while Xiaomi shares also climbed after unveiling new devices. South Korean defense stocks continued their upward trend, and internet firm Naver surged following an investment announcement. Conversely, Taiwan's Taiex dipped, partly due to TSMC's decline after reports of Intel seeking investment from Apple, though a shift back to Intel chips is unlikely. This article provides a snapshot of diverse market movements across the region. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>Chery Automobile, China's largest vehicle exporter, saw its shares jump 11% in its Hong Kong debut after raising US$1.2 billion through an initial public offering. Despite canceling its planned listing ceremony due to a super typhoon, the automaker's stock traded strongly, reflecting its accelerating expansion in Vietnam, the Middle East, and Europe. While Chery faces significant tariffs on Chinese-made EVs in the US, Canada, and the EU, its strategy of building local manufacturing facilities in regions like the Middle East and Southeast Asia helps mitigate some of these risks.

          <p>A federal judge has ruled that the Trump administration cannot constitutionally require states to cooperate with immigration enforcement to receive Federal Emergency Management Agency grants. This decision, a setback for the administration's efforts to penalize "sanctuary" cities and states, sided with 20 mostly Democratic states that argued the policy unlawfully held critical disaster funding hostage. The judge deemed the policy "arbitrary and capricious and unconstitutional," citing potential irreparable harm to states' disaster response and public safety. This article highlights the ongoing legal battle over immigration policies and federal funding, with the Department of Homeland Security vowing to appeal.</p>

          <p>Nvidia's substantial investment in OpenAI, potentially reaching $100 billion, will largely be used by the AI startup to lease Nvidia's cutting-edge graphics processing units (GPUs) for its upcoming AI supercomputing facilities. This arrangement allows OpenAI, a non-investment-grade startup, to spread its costs over several years rather than upfront purchases, with Nvidia bearing more of the financial risk. While the investment helps OpenAI with various operational needs, the primary allocation is for compute, almost entirely directed at Nvidia's GPUs. This article highlights concerns among some analysts about the "circular nature" of such deals, questioning the sustainability of the AI boom despite the focus on driving real demand for services.

          <p>A recent Oxford Economics study reveals that Africa welcomed a record 9,516 megawatts of Chinese-made solar panels in the first seven months of this year, significantly accelerating the continent's solar energy capacity. This surge, primarily led by South Africa, Algeria, and Nigeria, is attributed to falling costs and massive energy plants developed by Chinese firms, such as PowerChina's 342MW De Aar Central Solar Power Plant. Given China's dominance in global solar technology production, these imports serve as a key indicator of Africa's rapid shift towards renewable energy. The article highlights a positive trend in sustainable development and energy access across the continent.</p>

          <p>The Los Angeles Dodgers' bullpen continues to struggle with a 4.33 ERA this season, rising to 5.69 in September, leaving manager Dave Roberts searching for trustworthy relief options. Closer Tanner Scott and top right-hander Blake Treinen have both faced significant difficulties, highlighting a depleted roster of reliable arms. In response, rookie pitcher Roki Sasaki has rejoined the active roster after a five-month shoulder injury absence, following successful minor league appearances and mechanical adjustments that restored his velocity and improved his pitch mix. The team hopes Sasaki can provide unexpected support in high-leverage situations as they approach the postseason, despite his limited experience.</p>

          <p>Facing economic headwinds from falling cranberry prices and rising costs, Massachusetts cranberry farmers are increasingly participating in a state program to restore unproductive bogs into wetlands. This initiative, part of the Massachusetts Division of Ecological Restoration's Cranberry Bog Program, pays farmers to convert their land, preserving it while yielding ecological benefits like water filtration, carbon storage, and storm resilience. Over 500 acres have been restored in the past 15 years, with another 500 planned, offering a way for a retiring generation of farmers to ensure their land is in good hands. This article highlights an innovative approach to land preservation and environmental restoration.</p>

          <p>Orange County officials are investigating their voter rolls to determine if any pets are registered to vote, following charges against a woman who allegedly registered her dog and cast ballots for it in two elections. The Board of Supervisors directed staff to cross-reference voter and pet registration data, aiming to restore public confidence in the election system. While some supervisors expressed concern over voter roll integrity, others emphasized increasing voter participation.

          <p>A 6.2-magnitude earthquake struck western and northern Venezuela, with its epicenter located at a depth of 7.8 kilometers near Mene Grande, an oil town in the state of Zulia. The tremor, which was also felt in neighboring Colombia and Caribbean islands like Aruba, caused buildings to shake and alarmed residents in cities including Caracas and Maracaibo. Despite the strong intensity, there were no immediate reports of any casualties or serious damage, a fortunate outcome given that about 80% of Venezuelans live in seismic zones.
