          <h2>FDA to Narrow Covid Vaccine Approvals, Requiring Trials for Younger Adults</h2>
          <div class="timestamp">2025-05-20 18:12:35 EDT</div>
        </div>
        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>The FDA will approve Covid vaccines for high-risk individuals but will require more clinical trials for healthy adults under 65 before wider use. Agency leaders cited uncertain benefits for younger people already vaccinated or previously infected, proposing trials where participants are randomly assigned the vaccine or a placebo. Some experts criticize the new criteria as overly restrictive, potentially limiting access for healthy individuals at high risk due to their jobs or other circumstances. The revised approvals process could impact insurance and public coverage, aligning with a recent decision to narrow eligibility for the Novavax vaccine. This article indicates a shift towards a risk-based approach to Covid vaccination, emphasizing the need for more data on low-risk individuals.</p>

          <p>Secretary of State Marco Rubio refuted claims that the U.S. is retreating from humanitarian and human rights commitments, arguing that China cannot replace the U.S. as a global aid leader.

          <p>Former President Joe Biden received his last prostate cancer blood test in 2014, according to a spokesperson, two days after revealing his aggressive form of prostate cancer. The spokesperson clarified that Biden had never been diagnosed with prostate cancer prior to Friday. Biden, who turned 72 in 2014, was within the typical age range for prostate cancer screenings at the time. Doctors often advise discontinuing routine testing after 70 or 75 due to the slow-growing nature of prostate cancer in older men and the potential risks of testing and treatment.</p>

          <p>Chinese investments in Europe rose by 47% in 2024, marking the first increase in nine years, with Hungary remaining the region's primary hub for Chinese capital.

Greenfield investments in Europe also increased, indicating a renewed interest in establishing new ventures. Despite the increase, investment rates remain below pre-2017 levels due to stricter EU screening mechanisms.</p>
