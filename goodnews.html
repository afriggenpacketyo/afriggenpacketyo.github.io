          <p>Tesla CEO Elon Musk reassured investors at Bloomberg's Qatar Economic Forum that he intends to remain at the helm of the electric vehicle company for the next five years, emphasizing the importance of maintaining sufficient voting control to prevent potential ousting by activist investors. Musk clarified that his motivation is not financial gain but rather ensuring reasonable control over Tesla's future, which comes after investor concerns about his dedication to Tesla, given his advisory role in President Donald Trump's Department of Government Efficiency. Despite a reported 20% drop in automotive revenue and a 71% decline in net income for the first quarter of 2025, Tesla shares saw a slight increase following Musk's statement.</p>

          <p>A new study casts doubt on the presence of flowing water on Mars, specifically challenging the interpretation of dark streaks seen on the planet's surface. Researchers used machine learning to analyze over 86,000 high-resolution satellite images of slope streaks, creating a global Martian map showing more than half a million such features. The analysis revealed that the slope streaks were not generally associated with factors suggesting a liquid or frost origin, and the slopes were more likely to form in places that had above-average wind speeds and dust deposition, likely pointing to a dry origin.</p>
