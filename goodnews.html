          <p>Shai Gilgeous-Alexander led the Oklahoma City Thunder to a 103-91 victory over the Indiana Pacers in Game 7 of the NBA Finals, securing the franchise's first title since relocating from Seattle. Gilgeous-Alexander capped off his MVP season with 29 points and 12 assists, while Jalen Williams added 20 points and Chet Holmgren contributed 18. The Pacers, who lost Tyrese Haliburton early in the game due to a leg injury, were unable to overcome the Thunder's strong second-half performance. This win marks the Thunder as the youngest team in nearly a half-century to win an NBA title. </p>

          <p>On the 80th anniversary of the Battle of Okinawa, volunteers like Takamatsu Gushiken continue to search for the remains of approximately 200,000 people killed during the three-month conflict. Gushiken, who has dedicated over four decades to this effort, seeks to return the remains to their families, expressing concern that many are buried under buildings, fields, jungles, and caves. Controversy has arisen over the quarrying of soil from southern Okinawa, the site of the bloodiest fighting, for the construction of a new U.S. air base. Gushiken and others view this as a desecration of the war dead, advocating for the preservation of these areas as peace memorials. </p>

          <p>French police are investigating a staged wedding at Disneyland Paris after staff became suspicious that the "bride" was a 9-year-old Ukrainian girl. A man reportedly hired the park for a private event involving hundreds of extras, leading staff to believe it could be an illegal child marriage. The girl's mother claimed she wanted her daughter to feel like a Disney princess for the day. Four people, including the "groom," the mother, and two others, were taken into custody as authorities investigate the circumstances of the incident.</p>
