        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>The pursuit of solid-state batteries, considered the 'holy grail' for electric vehicles (EVs), is gaining renewed momentum with major automakers and cell producers setting aggressive commercial production timelines. These batteries promise higher energy density, faster charging, and enhanced safety compared to current lithium-ion technology, potentially localizing production away from China. While semi-solid-state versions are bridging the gap, challenges like high production costs and battery degradation persist. Companies like Volkswagen, Mercedes-Benz, BYD, and Nissan are vying for leadership in this transformative technology. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>The Los Angeles Dodgers secured a 5-2 win against the Minnesota Twins, largely thanks to a power surge from Shohei Ohtani and Will Smith. Ohtani hit a two-run homer, his 35th of the season, while Smith contributed two solo blasts, marking his first multi-homer game since last July and raising his batting average to .327. Despite the team's recent offensive struggles, these emphatic hits provided crucial runs. However, the win was tempered by closer Tanner Scott leaving the game with a forearm injury, prompting concerns for the bullpen.</p>

          <p>Ana Schnabl, a writer from the Balkans, expresses frustration over Western publishers' expectation for her work to focus solely on war, trauma, or specific historical issues from her region. She argues that this tacitly assumes the Balkans is a 'lesser place' and limits the diversity of stories translated into English. Schnabl advocates for publishers to engage with narratives that challenge established perceptions, allowing Balkan authors to explore universal themes without being confined to a narrow, exoticized lens. The article highlights a broader issue of cultural representation in literature.</p>

Examples from Canada and China indicate significant movement in removing such barriers, while the European Union's focus on defense spending may be hindering similar progress.

          <p>Texas officials have significantly revised down the number of people missing after the deadly July Fourth floods along the Guadalupe River. Initially, over 160 individuals were reported missing, but most were tourists who had left the area without notifying authorities. Kerr County Judge Rob Kelly confirmed that only three individuals remain unaccounted for. The flash floods tragically killed at least 135 people, primarily in Kerr County, highlighting the rapid and destructive nature of the water. This revision follows a common pattern in disaster aftermaths where initial missing counts are often inflated.</p>
