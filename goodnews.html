          <p>China has rapidly transformed into a global leader in civil engineering, particularly in bridge construction, with projects that push the boundaries of structural design and materials science. By 2030, Chinese engineers are expected to complete several record-breaking bridges, including the Huajiang Canyon Bridge and the Zhangjinggao Yangtze River Bridge. These projects leverage precision survey methods, advanced modeling, and breakthroughs in materials science to overcome geographical challenges. The integration of artificial intelligence and automated construction equipment is also expected to enhance safety and efficiency in future bridge construction efforts.</p>

          <p>The Japanese government has initiated direct contract sales of government rice stockpiles to major retailers in an effort to reduce rising rice prices, aiming to bring them down to approximately 2,000 yen per 5 kilograms by early June. This move bypasses the traditional auction system, giving the government more control over pricing, and addresses public criticism over the ineffectiveness of previous measures. Farm Minister Shinjiro Koizumi emphasized the urgency of the situation, and the government plans to sell rice produced in 2021 and 2022 at around 11,556 yen per 60 kg, covering transportation costs to regional areas. Online sales are also being considered to broaden distribution.</p>

          <p>Tripadvisor's "Transparency Report 2025" indicates that approximately 8% of the 31.1 million reviews submitted in 2024 were identified as fake, more than double the rate in 2022. This increase is attributed to a more aggressive stance against incentivized reviews and improvements in Tripadvisor's detection systems. The company uses a three-pronged process involving auto-detection, human review, and community feedback to identify and moderate fake submissions. Boosting and member fraud constitute the majority of fake reviews, while paid reviews are considered more pernicious and often originate in Asia; Tripadvisor penalizes violators and uses various methods, including AI and behavioral biometrics, to catch fake reviewers.</p>

          <p>President Donald Trump announced a delay in the implementation of a threatened 50% tariff on goods from the European Union, pushing the start date from June 1 to July 9.

Trump stated that von der Leyen vowed to work rapidly towards a resolution. The delay aims to provide more time for the U.S. and EU to negotiate trade terms and potentially avert escalating trade tensions.</p>

          <p>Xu Lin, a former senior economic planner, has proposed that China should lower its annual GDP growth target to around 4% for the next five years, considering challenges such as a protracted rivalry with the United States and domestic structural issues. This recommendation contrasts with market estimates of around 4.5% annual growth from 2026-30. Xu emphasizes that prioritizing employment expansion and debt control would be more beneficial than pursuing a higher growth target, given China's shrinking population, falling savings rate, and other economic headwinds. Xu Lin is now academic director of the Pangoal Institution, a Beijing-based think tank, and also chairman of China-US Green Fund.</p>
