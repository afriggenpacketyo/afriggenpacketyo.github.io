          <p>Tesla has formally applied to test and operate its Robotaxi service in the Phoenix metropolitan area, a market where competitor Waymo has been established since 2020. The application covers operations with and without human safety drivers, marking a significant expansion of its autonomous vehicle ambitions beyond its current pilot program in Austin, Texas. This move underscores Tesla's strategy to catch up in the autonomous ride-hailing space using its camera-based system. The decision on the application is anticipated by the end of July.</p>

It details the events from the death of her boyfriend, Boston police officer John O'Keefe, in January 2022, through the investigation and two highly publicized trials.

          <p>The Department of Homeland Security has announced an end to the two-decade-old requirement for air travelers to remove their shoes at security checkpoints. The policy was enacted after the failed "shoe bomber" attempt in 2001 and became a symbol of post-9/11 security measures. An analysis in The Atlantic frames the reversal not as a result of technological advancement but as "populism theater," giving the public a convenience previously reserved for those in premium programs like TSA PreCheck. The article reflects on how the ritual became an accepted, if burdensome, part of the travel experience for a generation.</p>
