          <p>The Federal Communications Commission (FCC) has officially approved the $8 billion merger between Paramount Global and Skydance Media. This significant deal consolidates major media assets, including the CBS broadcast network, Paramount Pictures, and the Nickelodeon channel. As part of the approval, Skydance has committed to ensuring a diversity of viewpoints in its programming to address concerns about media bias. An independent third party will be hired to evaluate complaints and report directly to the new company's president.</p>

          <p>A car fire in an Arlington, Virginia, parking lot escalated into a dramatic explosion, which was captured on video. The Arlington Fire & EMS department identified the event as a Boiling Liquid Expanding Vapor Explosion (BLEVE) caused by the vehicle's fuel tank rupturing. The blast damaged at least three other cars, but fortunately, no injuries to the public or firefighters were reported. Officials have deemed the incident non-suspicious and are currently investigating the specific cause of the initial fire.</p>

          <p>McDonald's is set to test a new lineup of ten beverages in hundreds of its U.S. locations, aiming to attract younger consumers with bold and flavorful drink options. The new menu is inspired by learnings from the company's short-lived beverage-focused spinoff, CosMc's, which was discontinued earlier this year. Instead of separate stores, the drinks will be integrated into the main McDonald's menu, starting in restaurants across Wisconsin and Colorado. This move is part of a broader strategy to boost sales and capitalize on the growing demand for specialty drinks.</p>

          <p>House Speaker Mike Johnson has stated he is "absolutely convinced" that Republicans will expand their majority in the House of Representatives during the 2026 midterm elections. Despite historical trends where the president's party often loses seats, Johnson believes the GOP is well-positioned for offense, citing Democratic-held districts won by President Trump in 2024. He also pointed to the "One Big Beautiful Bill Act," predicting its tax cuts and other provisions will create economic benefits that voters will feel and reward.</p>

          <p>Researchers in China have successfully manufactured the world's largest barium gallium selenide (BGSe) crystal, a key component for developing powerful laser weapons. The 60-millimeter crystal is designed to convert laser beams into mid- to far-infrared frequencies, which are more effective for long-distance transmission through the atmosphere. This breakthrough could enable the creation of ground-based laser systems capable of targeting satellites. The material can also withstand significantly higher power levels than existing military-grade crystals, overcoming a major technical hurdle in laser weapon development.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>The demand for workers with artificial intelligence skills is increasing rapidly, according to a recent report from the Brookings Institution. Job postings that mention AI have grown at an average annual rate of nearly 29% over the past 15 years, significantly outpacing the overall economy. This trend reflects the growing integration of AI into various business sectors, with companies seeking talent for both specialized AI engineering roles and general positions that require AI literacy. Furthermore, jobs requiring AI skills offer a significant salary premium, averaging about 28% more than similar roles without such requirements. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>The Supreme Court has issued a temporary order that preserves the ability of individuals and groups to file lawsuits under Section 2 of the Voting Rights Act. The decision puts a hold on a ruling from the Eighth Circuit Court of Appeals, which had uniquely determined that only the U.S. Attorney General could bring such cases. The case originated from a North Dakota redistricting plan challenged by Native American tribes for diluting their voting power. While a temporary victory for the tribes, the future of this right remains uncertain as the court is set to rehear a separate, related case from Louisiana.</p>

          <p>Jeremy Corbyn, the former leader of the UK's Labour Party and current independent MP, is launching a new political party alongside fellow independent MP Zarah Sultana. The yet-to-be-named party aims to "take on the rich and powerful" and provide an alternative to what they describe as the controlling nature of Labour and the divisive politics of Reform UK. Corbyn stated the new organization will be community-led and grassroots-focused, contrasting it with the "top-down" structure of the current Labour Party. The move signals a formal split on the British left.</p>

However, he confirmed that negotiations are complicated by uncertainty surrounding the future format of the College Football Playoff. Riley supports a Big Ten proposal for four automatic qualifiers, which he believes would help preserve significant nonconference games like the one against Notre Dame. He stressed that while he values the tradition, his primary loyalty is to USC's best interests as scheduling and playoff structures evolve.</p>
