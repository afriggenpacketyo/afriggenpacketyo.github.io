          <p>A new Microsoft report on the occupational impact of generative AI suggests that blue-collar jobs are the most secure from being replaced by the technology. Researchers found that professions involving physical work, such as painters, nursing assistants, and automotive repairers, are least likely to be affected. In contrast, white-collar roles that involve information gathering and communication, like translators and writers, face the highest risk of AI adoption. The findings indicate a shift in job stability, with manual and trade-based careers showing more resilience in the AI era.</p>

The incident highlights the state's efforts to prevent forest fires, a campaign for which the Smokey the Bear image is iconic. The suspect was transported to jail, with criminal charges pending.</p>

As a domestique for his team, Jorgenson repeatedly sacrificed his own chances to support his team's leader, Jonas Vingegaard, in his battle against the dominant Tadej Pogačar. Despite battling bronchitis, his persistent efforts to wear down the race leader were instrumental in setting up a teammate for a prestigious final stage victory. The performance is highlighted as a powerful example of teamwork and self-sacrifice in professional sports.</p>

          <p>The United States and Pakistan have finalized a trade agreement that will see Washington assist in developing Pakistan's substantial oil reserves. US President Donald Trump announced the deal, which Pakistan's foreign minister confirmed would also result in lower tariffs on its exports to the US. The announcement came less than a day after Washington imposed a 25% tariff on India, Pakistan's regional adversary, for its trade with Russia. Details of the US-Pakistan agreement, including specific tariff rates and the oil companies involved, have not yet been fully disclosed.</p>

          <p>Malaysian airlines, including budget carrier AirAsia, are reportedly interested in purchasing China's domestically produced C919 passenger jet. According to Malaysia's transport minister, the interest is driven by a need to diversify aircraft procurement and find faster, cheaper alternatives to Boeing and Airbus, which currently have long delivery wait times. China has been actively promoting its Comac-built C919 as a competitive option in the global aviation market, particularly in Southeast Asia where air travel is growing rapidly. No confirmed deals have been announced, but commercial negotiations are being explored.</p>

          <p>India has strategically resisted rushing into a trade deal with the United States, despite President Trump imposing a 25% tariff on its goods. New Delhi's primary motivation is the protection of its large and politically influential agricultural sector from American competition, a red line in negotiations. Analysts note that India is pursuing a "multi-alignment" strategy by strengthening trade ties with other partners like the UK and the EU. This approach provides leverage and softens the economic blow from US tariffs, reflecting India's goal of maintaining strategic autonomy as a rising global power.</p>
