          <p>Amazon has introduced an advanced artificial intelligence agent within its Seller Assistant tool, designed to help third-party merchants manage their online businesses more efficiently. This new capability allows the AI to take direct action on a seller's behalf, such as coordinating inventory orders, implementing business growth plans, and resolving account issues. The company stated that the tool, which uses its Bedrock AI software, aims to free up merchants' time from tedious operational tasks so they can focus on product innovation. Amazon does not currently plan to charge sellers for using the enhanced AI assistant.</p>

          <p>In a direct comparison study, Eli Lilly's experimental oral medication, orforglipron, demonstrated superior performance in lowering blood sugar and promoting weight loss compared to Novo Nordisk's approved oral drug, Rybelsus. The late-stage trial involved patients with Type 2 diabetes, where the highest dose of Eli Lilly's pill reduced blood sugar levels more effectively and resulted in an average weight loss of 9.2%. These results position orforglipron as a strong future competitor in the lucrative market for GLP-1 drugs, which are increasingly sought after for both diabetes and obesity treatment. Eli Lilly plans to seek regulatory approval in 2026.</p>

          <p>A district court in Shanghai has partnered with a third-party institution to sell over 90,000 filecoins, a type of blockchain token, that were seized in criminal cases. The sale was conducted on a licensed cryptocurrency trading platform in Hong Kong, marking one of the first instances of a mainland Chinese court using an overseas crypto platform for such a transaction. The proceeds from the sale were transferred to a court-controlled bank account and will be allocated to the national treasury or used to refund victims. This action highlights the novel challenges Chinese courts face when handling digital assets. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>The American University of Beirut (AUB) is home to a thriving population of more than 1,000 cats, a tradition that began three decades ago as the institution took in animals abandoned during wartime. The university provides comprehensive care for the cats, including spaying, neutering, and vaccinations, and runs an adoption program for them. The sprawling, green campus offers a suitable environment for the felines, and their presence is a source of comfort for many students amid regional stress. The university requires students to treat the cats with kindness, allowing them to roam freely across the campus grounds.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>A sharp drop in mortgage rates to their lowest level since last October has triggered a massive 58% weekly spike in home loan refinance applications. According to the Mortgage Bankers Association, demand was particularly strong for larger loans and adjustable-rate mortgages, as homeowners rushed to secure lower borrowing costs. The average contract interest rate for a 30-year fixed-rate mortgage fell to 6.39%, invigorating the refinance market more than the home purchase market, which saw a modest 3% increase in applications. The decline in rates comes ahead of an anticipated interest rate decision from the Federal Reserve. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>China is actively monitoring its shipbuilding capacity to prevent over-investment and a potential glut in production facilities, according to the China Association of the National Shipbuilding Industry (CANSI). Despite the industry's strong performance and a 70% share of the global market, authorities are taking a cautious approach to ensure sustainable growth and avoid boom-and-bust cycles. In the first half of the year, Chinese shipbuilders recorded a 20.8% year-on-year revenue increase to 398.8 billion yuan. This strategy aims to balance the country's manufacturing strength with actual global demand for new vessels. (not investment advice)</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>This article delves into the psychology of why people enjoy acting unscrupulously within the structured confines of board games like Werewolf or Risk. Experts suggest that the low-stakes environment allows players to experience a "cheater's high" or the vicarious thrill of betrayal without real-world social consequences. This behavior doesn't necessarily reveal a hidden dark side but rather reflects a playful and competitive nature. While real-life relationships and personality traits can influence gameplay, the contained nature of a game allows for a temporary, socially acceptable form of sociopathic behavior that can even help practice skills like persuasion.</p>

          <p>Manchester United has announced record financial revenue of £666.5 million for the last fiscal year, despite the men's team finishing 15th in the Premier League, their worst result in decades. The record earnings were driven by a new shirt sponsorship deal with Snapdragon, which led to record commercial revenue, and record matchday income. Despite the high revenue, the club reported an overall loss of £33 million, though this was a significant reduction from the previous year.

          <p>This opinion article contrasts the current mainstream celebrity romance of Taylor Swift and Travis Kelce with the chaotic 1990s union of Carmen Electra and Dennis Rodman. It argues that while Swift and Kelce represent a conventional, widely accepted fairytale, Electra and Rodman provided a different kind of spectacle for those who felt like outsiders. Their relationship, marked by gender-bending fashion, public antics, and interracial dynamics, challenged norms and represented a more eccentric and provocative form of celebrity love. The author suggests their brief, volatile marriage was a cultural touchstone for misfits, offering a stark alternative to today's more polished celebrity narratives.</p>
