          <p>The White House has confirmed an unusual agreement where Nvidia and AMD will give the U.S. government 15% of their revenue from specific AI chip sales to China. In return, the companies receive export licenses for their H20 and MI308 chips, which were previously restricted under tighter controls. While analysts find the deal unconventional, investors view it as a net positive, as it restores access to the lucrative Chinese market, with 85% of revenue being preferable to none. The long-term implications remain uncertain, as this arrangement sets a new precedent for U.S. tech companies operating in China. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>Cannabis company stocks saw a significant rally after President Trump announced he is considering reclassifying marijuana from a Schedule I to a less restrictive category, such as Schedule III. Such a change would place cannabis in the same class as steroids and Tylenol with codeine, offering substantial benefits like revised tax regulations and increased investment appeal. While the president cannot unilaterally make this change, his public support has generated industry optimism for what could be a game-changing development for the estimated $80 billion market. Industry leaders believe the process could take about a year to complete if initiated. (not investment advice)</p>

Dohmke will remain until the end of the year to ensure a smooth transition, with GitHub continuing its mission under Microsoft's CoreAI division. Despite the competitive pressure, GitHub's AI-powered Copilot tool continues to grow, with 20 million users reported as of last month.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>President Trump provided his account of the negotiations with Nvidia, stating he initially demanded a 20% cut of the company's China-bound chip sales before settling on 15% after a direct talk with CEO Jensen Huang. He characterized the approved H20 chip as "obsolete," suggesting that China already possesses similar technology and that it poses no national security risk. Trump contrasted this with Nvidia's more advanced Blackwell chips, which he said he would not approve for export without significant performance reductions. This provides direct insight into the administration's rationale and transactional approach to the export controls. (not investment advice)</p>

The order was signed just hours before the previous pause on the tariffs was set to expire, preventing duties from reverting to their peak levels from April. This extension was the anticipated result of the most recent trade negotiations between U.S. and Chinese officials held in Stockholm. The two nations initially agreed to a tariff pause in May, providing a temporary reprieve in the ongoing trade dispute between the world's two largest economies. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>Financial markets have remained largely unfazed by the news that Nvidia and AMD will pay the U.S. government a 15% fee on AI chip sales to China. The consensus among investors and analysts is that retaining access to the vast Chinese market is the greater prize. As one analyst noted, receiving 85% of revenue is significantly better than receiving nothing, which was the case when exports were blocked. The fee, while substantial, is considered manageable for a company of Nvidia's scale, which projects revenues in the hundreds of billions, making the payment a calculated cost of doing business.

          <p>With rising living costs, some seniors may find a reverse mortgage to be a useful financial tool this August, according to a recent article. This option is particularly relevant for three groups: those on fixed incomes needing to supplement their budget, homeowners with significant equity but limited cash, and those who wish to age in place but need funds for home modifications. A reverse mortgage allows homeowners aged 62 and older to borrow against their home equity without making monthly payments. The funds received are tax-free and can provide a crucial financial cushion during retirement. (not investment advice)</p>
