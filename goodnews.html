          <h2>A Look Back at Why Donald Trump's Line of Steaks Failed in 2007</h2>
          <div class="timestamp">2025-07-06 18:00:00 EDT</div>

          <p>Before his presidency, Donald Trump ventured into the gourmet food business with "Trump Steaks," a brand that ultimately failed after just two months on the market in 2007. Despite being certified USDA Prime and supplied by a reputable source, the company struggled due to several factors. The steaks were sold exclusively through the Sharper Image catalog and QVC, limiting accessibility and failing to attract the retailer's typical customer base. Ultimately, poor consumer reviews citing a bland taste, grainy texture, and excessively high prices for a frozen product led to its swift demise.</p>

          <p>Lando Norris won his first British Grand Prix in a dramatic, incident-packed race marked by changing weather conditions. The McLaren driver celebrated his victory despite sustaining a cut on his nose when his trophy was accidentally knocked into his face. Norris inherited the lead after his teammate, Oscar Piastri, received a controversial penalty for a safety-car infringement, a decision that left Piastri furious. The win marks Norris's second consecutive victory, reducing his championship deficit to Piastri and providing a momentous occasion for the British driver in front of his home crowd at Silverstone.</p>

          <p>Wimbledon officials have issued an apology after the electronic line-calling system on Centre Court was mistakenly deactivated during a fourth-round match, resulting in three missed calls in a single game. The error occurred during a match between Anastasia Pavlyuchenkova and Sonay Kartal, with one particularly clear long ball not being called out, forcing a replayed point. Pavlyuchenkova, who went on to win the match, criticized the chair umpire for not making the call himself. The All England Club attributed the incident to human error, has reviewed its processes, and reaffirmed its confidence in the ball-tracking technology.</p>

          <p>The Los Angeles sports community is mourning the death of Rolando “El Veloz” González, a pioneering voice in Spanish-language sports broadcasting. Best known as the longtime announcer for the LA Galaxy, González's career spanned decades and was marked by his energetic and fast-paced narrating style, which earned him the nickname 'El Veloz' (The Swift). He was given his major break by legendary Dodgers announcer Jaime Jarrín during the 1984 Olympics. Colleagues and friends remember him not only for his professionalism and unique talent but also for his warmth and role as a mentor to a new generation of broadcasters.</p>

          <p>Canadian Prime Minister Mark Carney has indicated that a proposal for a new oil pipeline to the British Columbia coast is highly likely to be designated as a project of national importance. In an interview, Carney stated that while the proposal must come from the private sector, the economic opportunity makes such a project probable. This comes after Canada's Senate passed a bill to fast-track approvals for key natural resource and infrastructure projects. The move aligns with Canada's efforts to diversify its energy exports, as it currently sends approximately 75% of its exports to the United States.</p>

          <p>Arsenal has completed the signing of Spanish international Martin Zubimendi from Real Sociedad in a deal worth £60 million. The 26-year-old defensive midfielder is expected to be a key addition to the Gunners' lineup, likely joining Declan Rice and Martin Odegaard in a formidable midfield trio. Zubimendi, who has been praised for his tactical intelligence and ability to read the game, rejected a move to Liverpool last summer. His arrival is anticipated to fill the role previously held by Thomas Partey and strengthen Arsenal's squad as they challenge for domestic and European titles.</p>
