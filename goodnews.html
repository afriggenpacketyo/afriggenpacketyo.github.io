          <p>Chicago Cubs rookie Matt Shaw had an exceptional game against the New York Mets, shortly after facing criticism from Mets broadcasters for leaving the team to attend the memorial service for conservative influencer Charlie Kirk. The announcers had called his decision 'weird' and 'unprecedented' during a playoff race, but Shaw defended his choice, citing his shared Christian faith with Kirk. In the subsequent game, Shaw went 3-for-4 with a home run, contributing significantly to the Cubs' 10-3 victory. His performance on the field served as a powerful response to the off-field commentary.</p>

          <p>Apple's latest operating system, iOS 26, includes new features aimed at making iPhones more usable by tackling the deluge of spam calls and texts that plague users. A new AI-powered call screening feature, which is off by default, has Siri intercept calls from unknown numbers to ask for the caller's name and purpose before the phone rings. Additionally, enhanced text filtering automatically sorts messages from unknown senders and suspected spam into separate folders. While these tools offer more control, the article notes they also add complexity and may not be a perfect solution to the ever-growing problem of phone-based scams.</p>

          <p>In a notable moment for Manchester City, brothers Reigan and Jaden Heskey, the sons of former England international Emile Heskey, both made their first-team debuts in a Carabao Cup match against Huddersfield. Manager Pep Guardiola brought the two academy products onto the pitch in the second half of the 2-0 victory. Jaden, 19, is a midfielder, while his younger brother Reigan, 17, is a winger; both have been with City's youth setup since the age of eight. The event was celebrated by fans and the manager, who expressed pride in the club's ability to develop young talent from its academy.</p>

          <h2>Analysis of Student Data Suggests AI Has Changed Cheating Methods, Not Overall Rates</h2>
          <div class="timestamp">2025-09-25 06:05:00 EDT</div>
        </div>
        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Contrary to widespread panic, an education researcher argues that the introduction of generative AI tools like ChatGPT has not necessarily increased the overall amount of cheating among students, but has instead changed the methods they use. Citing survey data from before and after AI's prevalence, the article suggests that cheating rates have remained consistently high for decades, with AI now becoming another tool for academic dishonesty. The analysis highlights that students who now use AI to write entire papers might have previously used other methods, such as copying from online sources. The author calls for a nuanced conversation about why students cheat and how educational standards should adapt to a world with AI.</p>

          <p>Ticketmaster has agreed to provide clearer information about ticket prices following an investigation by the UK's Competition and Markets Authority (CMA) into the sale of Oasis reunion tour tickets. The inquiry was launched after fans complained about misleading 'platinum' tickets that were sold at significantly higher prices without offering extra benefits. While the CMA found no evidence of algorithmic 'dynamic pricing,' it criticized the lack of transparency in the tiered pricing system. Under the new agreement, Ticketmaster must provide more advance information on pricing structures and use more accurate labeling to avoid giving a false impression of a ticket's value.</p>

          <p>Zohran Mamdani, the Democratic nominee for New York City mayor, is leveraging the issue of high ticket prices for the 2026 FIFA World Cup to bolster his progressive campaign platform focused on affordability. By launching a petition against FIFA's pricing models, Mamdani is framing access to major sporting events as a kitchen-table issue, aligning with his broader policy goals. The article analyzes this as a shrewd political move, suggesting it represents a blueprint for left-leaning politicians to re-engage with sports, a cultural arena often dominated by conservative voices. It highlights a potential new way to connect with voters on issues of economic fairness.</p>

          <p>Millions of California residents will see a credit on their electricity bills this October as part of the state's biannual California Climate Credit program. The refund, which varies by utility provider, stems from the state's cap-and-invest program that requires large polluters to pay for their greenhouse gas emissions. For instance, Pacific Gas & Electric customers will receive a $58.23 credit, while Southern California Edison customers will get $56. This initiative aims to provide financial relief to ratepayers while funding the state's climate goals, with the credit amounts expected to increase in the coming years.</p>

          <p>Jean Mueller forged a remarkable and non-traditional path in astronomy, transitioning from a librarian to become the first female telescope operator at the prestigious Palomar Observatory.

Overcoming the historical gender barriers in the field, Mueller not only operated all three of the observatory's large telescopes but also made significant discoveries of her own, including 15 comets, 13 asteroids, and 107 supernovae.</p>

          <div class="timestamp">2025-09-25 05:08:00 EDT</div>
        </div>
        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>The term 'lavender marriage,' which historically described marriages of convenience for queer individuals, particularly in early Hollywood, to maintain a heteronormative public image, has found a new meaning on TikTok. A recent trend sees young people proposing platonic marriages to friends to gain financial stability, share living costs, and access benefits like health insurance, without the expectations of romantic love or sex. This modern reinterpretation reflects a broader cultural conversation among Gen Z about decoupling legal marriage from traditional romance, viewing it instead as a practical partnership based on mutual respect and shared goals.</p>
