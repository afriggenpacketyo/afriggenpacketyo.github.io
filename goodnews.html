          <h2>Ketamine's Growing Popularity Presents Therapeutic and Recreational Paradox</h2>
          <div class="timestamp">2025-06-06 06:30:00 EDT</div>
        </div>
        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Ketamine, initially synthesized in the 1960s as an anesthetic, is increasingly used for mental health treatment, especially for depression, with the FDA approving a ketamine-derived nasal spray in 2019. However, recreational use of ketamine is also on the rise, potentially leading to serious health consequences like kidney and liver damage. A study indicates an 82% increase in ketamine use between 2015 and 2019, followed by a 40% rise from 2021 to 2022, suggesting both clinical and recreational drivers behind the growth. While ketamine can be effective for depression under medical supervision, self-medication poses significant risks due to its addictive potential and potential for misuse.</p>

          <p>The article discusses the challenges of defining success for the United States men‚Äôs national team (USMNT) during the upcoming Concacaf Gold Cup. While winning the tournament is the expected goal, the absence of key players and the tournament's perceived lack of prestige make it difficult to gauge progress. The author suggests that a successful summer could involve identifying new depth pieces, cultivating a stronger team identity, and showcasing improved intensity. With several key players absent, the tournament offers an opportunity for new faces to emerge and make their case for inclusion in the World Cup team.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Archaeologists have uncovered what is believed to be the largest intact remains of an ancient Native American agricultural site in the eastern United States, located in northern Michigan. Using drone technology, researchers mapped over 300 acres of parallel rows of earthen mounds, revealing raised gardening beds used by ancestors of the Menominee Indian Tribe of Wisconsin. The scale of the agriculture is surprisingly vast for a region not considered a major population center, particularly given the challenging growing conditions and the availability of wild rice nearby. Experts emphasize the significance of the find, highlighting the collaboration between Menominee tribal members and archaeologists.</p>

          <p>Disneyland Resort will close its 'Monsters, Inc.' ride in early 2026 to make way for a new 'Avatar'-themed land in the Hollywood Backlot area.

          <p>A contributor offers unsolicited advice to Democrats on how to improve their standing with young male voters, suggesting they start by clearly defining "man" and "woman" and avoid misandry. The author recommends reconsidering open border policies, arguing they increase wage competition, and avoiding sacrificing American energy independence for climate alarmism. The piece argues that Democrats should focus on policies that allow young men to provide safety and security for their families.

The film stars Nick Kroll and Andrew Rannells as characters loosely based on Crano and Craig, and it follows the couple's journey to become fathers, including a heartbreaking experience with adoption fraud.

          <p>A Chinese-led team has discovered that ancient China was home to the earliest known matrilineal society, dating back around 4,500 years. The society, located in what is now Shandong, lasted 250 years and maintained a stable lineage through at least 10 generations. Scientists analyzed ancient DNA from 60 individuals to confirm the existence of a Neolithic society that traced its descent through the female line. The team's findings support the hypothesis that early matrilineal systems could emerge and persist in communities without strong mechanisms for wealth accumulation.</p>
