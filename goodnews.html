        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>The Group of Seven (G7) democracies have launched an action plan to mitigate risks in critical mineral supply chains, aiming to reduce over-reliance on China. The plan involves increased cooperation among G7 members and like-minded nations to safeguard economic security against nonmarket practices. Areas of cooperation include monitoring mineral shortages, coordinating responses to market disruptions, and diversifying mining, processing, manufacturing, and recycling efforts. The G7 leaders will develop a roadmap by the end of the year for standards-based markets for critical minerals, reflecting the true costs of extraction, processing, and trade.</p>

          <p>Several flights to and from Bali have been cancelled or delayed due to the eruption of Mount Lewotobi Laki-Laki in Indonesia. The volcano spewed an ash tower more than 11 kilometers into the sky, prompting authorities to raise the alert level and advise residents to avoid activities within a 7km radius of the crater. Air India, Air New Zealand, Jetstar, Juneyao Airlines, Singapore Airlines, and Virgin Australia have cancelled flights to and from Bali. There have been no reports of casualties, but the ash cloud poses a significant hazard to air travel.</p>

          <p>A federal judge appointed by Biden has issued a ruling to temporarily block the Trump administration's policy that only allows two genders, male and female, on U.S. passports. The Department of State had eliminated the "X" designation on passport applications, reversing a previous policy. The judge stated that the policy discriminates on the basis of sex and is rooted in prejudice toward transgender Americans. The ruling extends a previous order that temporarily suspended the policy for six individuals, now applying to all Americans.</p>

He suggests that Europe needs to grab the Nato steering wheel to ensure their own security in a world where the US is increasingly focused on China.</p>

          <p>OpenAI CEO Sam Altman stated that Meta has offered his employees significant bonuses, including signing bonuses of $100 million, in an effort to recruit them. These recruitment attempts reflect the intense competition for AI talent among tech companies. Altman's comments come after Meta invested $14.3 billion in data-labeling startup Scale AI and hired its top boss to lead its new superintelligence team. Meta, previously recognized for its open-source AI models, has faced staff departures and delayed launches of new AI models.</p>
