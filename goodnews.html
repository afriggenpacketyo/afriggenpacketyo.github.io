          <p>Colorado Buffaloes head football coach Deion Sanders has revealed he was diagnosed with high-risk, non-muscle invasive bladder cancer, for which he underwent treatment that included the removal of his bladder. Appearing with his medical team, Sanders emotionally announced that he is now considered cancer-free and will continue in his coaching role. His doctor explained the procedure involved robotically creating a new bladder from his intestines and confirmed a very good outlook with routine surveillance. Sanders, who kept his diagnosis private until now, stated he hopes his journey encourages others to schedule regular health checkups and be proactive about their well-being.</p>

          <p>Dodgers pitcher Yoshinobu Yamamoto delivered a masterful performance against the Cincinnati Reds, securing a 5-2 victory with a seven-inning, one-run outing where he struck out nine batters. After a shaky middle period of the season, Yamamoto appears to be returning to his dominant early-season form, effectively utilizing his full arsenal of pitches. He allowed only one run in the first inning before settling in and retiring 10 consecutive hitters at one point. The Dodgers' offense provided ample support, with key contributions from Mookie Betts, Shohei Ohtani, and Teoscar Hernández, highlighting the team's potent combination of strong pitching and hitting.</p>

The celebration will proceed along The Mall and conclude with a ceremony at the Queen Victoria Memorial, which will be broadcast live. The team's triumph, secured via a penalty shootout, marks the first time an English team has won a major tournament on foreign soil and was watched by over 16 million people in the UK.

          <p>Taiwan's President Lai Ching-te will no longer make a planned stopover in the United States on his way to South America, a decision that could ease tensions with Beijing and facilitate a potential meeting between Chinese President Xi Jinping and U.S. President Donald Trump. Washington reportedly informed Lai that a stop in New York would not be possible. The Taiwanese Presidential Office officially attributed the cancellation to ongoing typhoon recovery efforts and regional developments. This move is seen as a significant setback for Lai's Democratic Progressive Party and a concession that could improve the climate for high-level U.S.-China diplomatic engagement later this year.</p>

          <p>An ancient stone carving discovered near Zhaling Lake in China's Qinghai province may provide new insights into the legendary quest for immortality by Qin Shi Huang, the first emperor of a unified China. According to a researcher from the Chinese Academy of Social Sciences, the inscription details a journey to the source of the Yellow River. This artifact is described as the only known stone carving from Qin Shi Huang's era that remains at its original site and is the most complete example found to date. Its location and content are considered highly significant for understanding the historical ambitions and expeditions undertaken during his reign.</p>

          <p>President Trump's visit to his Scottish golf courses, while notionally private, has provided UK Prime Minister Keir Starmer with invaluable direct access to the American leader. The trip included one-on-one talks, a joint freewheeling press conference, and even a shared ride on Air Force One, allowing Starmer to build a personal rapport with the unpredictable president. For Downing Street, this access is seen as crucial for advancing UK interests, particularly regarding a collaborative approach to the Gaza crisis. The visit underscores the unique, and at times absurd, nature of Trump's diplomacy, blending personal business with high-stakes international affairs.</p>

          <p>California State Parks is launching a new lottery-style drawing system to improve access to campsites at three of its most popular campgrounds: Malibu Creek, Morro Bay, and McArthur-Burney Falls. The system aims to level the playing field for reservations, which previously would vanish within minutes of becoming available online six months in advance. Would-be campers can now enter a free drawing for a chance to book a site, with unsuccessful applicants gaining points to increase their odds in future lotteries. This change is part of a broader effort to reduce no-shows and make the state's sought-after outdoor destinations more accessible to the public.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>CNBC's Jim Cramer suggests that the stock market's lackluster response to the new U.S.-EU trade agreement is due to investors being preoccupied with more immediate concerns. He argues that Wall Street is currently focused on upcoming Big Tech earnings reports, a pivotal Federal Reserve meeting, and forthcoming employment data, pushing trade policy to the background. Cramer also notes a potential "tariff ennui," as investors have seen President Trump's pattern of threatening high tariffs before settling for a less severe deal. With other major trade negotiations still pending and a busy week of economic news ahead, the market is unlikely to react significantly to trade deals alone. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>As the MLB trade deadline approaches, the Los Angeles Dodgers are reportedly looking to acquire a position player to bolster their roster, with a focus on upgrading their outfield defense. One potential target is Minnesota Twins outfielder Harrison Bader, a premium defender who is also having a solid offensive season. The Dodgers' offensive slump in July has highlighted the need for support, but improving run prevention is seen as key to a deep playoff run. While the team's superstar core is expected to rebound, adding a player like Bader could provide crucial defensive stability and allow for strategic repositioning of other outfielders.</p>

          <p>The successful 2016 lawsuit by Terry Bollea, known as Hulk Hogan, against Gawker Media is remembered as a pivotal moment for digital-age privacy rights. The case, which resulted in a $140 million verdict for the publication of a surreptitiously filmed sexual encounter, did not set new legal precedent but served as a major cultural reset for the media. Legal experts note that it reinforced the limits of First Amendment protections, establishing that even newsworthy content can constitute an invasion of privacy if it involves graphic depictions. The verdict has had a lasting impact, teaching the public about their rights and making media outlets more cautious about publishing deeply personal information.</p>
