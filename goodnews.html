          <p>The U.S. Supreme Court has declined to lift a lower court's injunction against a controversial Florida law that criminalizes the entry of undocumented immigrants into the state. The decision keeps the law on hold while legal challenges proceed, affirming a district judge's ruling that the state law likely oversteps into the federal government's exclusive authority over immigration. The law, signed by Governor Ron DeSantis, imposes mandatory prison sentences and was challenged by the ACLU and other groups. This ruling represents a temporary setback for Florida's efforts to enforce its own stringent immigration policies, which have been part of a broader trend among several states.</p>

          <p>Amid historically high credit card debt and interest rates, many Americans are exploring debt relief options to manage their financial burdens. This article provides a breakdown of the primary strategies available, including their respective advantages and disadvantages. Options range from debt settlement, which can reduce principal but harms credit, to credit counseling and debt management plans that lower interest rates without reducing the balance. Other alternatives discussed are debt consolidation programs, temporary creditor hardship programs, and bankruptcy, each suited for different financial situations and carrying unique long-term consequences that borrowers should carefully consider before proceeding.

          <p>Pop star Olivia Rodrigo has been praised by her touring staff for providing free and accessible therapy services for the entire crew during her recent 102-date "Guts" world tour. Rhythm guitarist Daisy Spencer revealed that Rodrigo and her tour manager made the resource available, which she described as an unprecedented and highly utilized benefit. Rodrigo, whose father is a therapist, has been a vocal advocate for mental health since starting therapy herself at age 16. This initiative is part of a growing trend among musicians, like Lewis Capaldi and Ariana Grande, who are using their platforms to promote mental wellness and provide tangible support for their teams.</p>

          <p>Seven-time champion Novak Djokovic has advanced to the Wimbledon semi-finals after a challenging four-set victory over Italy's Flavio Cobolli. His win sets up a highly anticipated match against current world number one, Jannik Sinner. Sinner secured his spot by defeating American Ben Shelton in straight sets, despite concerns over an elbow injury sustained in a previous round. This will be a rematch of their French Open semi-final, which Sinner won, though Djokovic holds a winning record against him on grass. The victory marked Djokovic's 102nd match win at Wimbledon, a personal record for a single tournament.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>With federal student loan payments resuming and new legislation set to change repayment programs, borrowers are facing a new financial landscape. This article outlines five practical ways to make monthly payments more affordable before the new rules take full effect. Key strategies include enrolling in an income-driven repayment (IDR) plan to cap payments based on income and exploring temporary payment pauses like deferment or forbearance for short-term hardship. Other options discussed are refinancing for those with good credit, seeking employer or state repayment assistance, and setting up autopay to receive a small interest rate discount from servicers.

          <p>McDonald's is refreshing its menu by bringing back the popular Snack Wrap and introducing new limited-time offerings in an effort to attract inflation-weary customers. The fast-food giant has seen a decline in same-store sales and traffic among low-income consumers, prompting a renewed focus on value and fan-favorite items. The Snack Wrap returns on July 10 after a nine-year absence, alongside a new Spicy Egg McMuffin. The company is also emphasizing its McValue menu and adding new chicken items, moves that analysts see as a strategic response to economic pressures and increased competition in the fast-food industry.</p>

          <h2>Homeowners Advised to Weigh Options Between HELOCs and Home Equity Loans Ahead of Fed Meeting</h2>
          <div class="timestamp">2025-07-09 14:45:48 EDT</div>
        </div>
        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>With the Federal Reserve's next meeting approaching at the end of July, homeowners considering borrowing against their equity face a key decision between a home equity line of credit (HELOC) and a home equity loan. This article explains that a HELOC, with its variable interest rate, may be advantageous if rates are expected to fall, allowing borrowers to benefit from lower payments. Conversely, a fixed-rate home equity loan offers stability and predictable payments, which could be a safer choice if there is uncertainty or a possibility that rates might rise. The decision depends on a homeowner's risk tolerance and outlook on the future interest rate climate. (not investment advice)</p>

Analysts at Deutsche Bank have also named Honeywell a "catalyst buy idea," anticipating an earnings beat and an increased full-year outlook. The company's approach of setting achievable guidance is seen as a positive factor that could lead to continued growth and higher stock performance over time. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>A new HBO documentary, "My Mom Jayne," directed by her daughter Mariska Hargitay, offers a revised perspective on the life of 1950s Hollywood star Jayne Mansfield. The film challenges the common narrative of Mansfield as merely a "dime-store" Marilyn Monroe, instead portraying her as a shrewd and talented woman who navigated a restrictive studio system. While acknowledging her unfulfilled dramatic potential, the documentary dignifies her work and highlights her wit and charisma in comedies like "The Girl Can’t Help It." The film serves as both an affectionate tribute and a commentary on how Hollywood's narrow view of female stardom limited the careers of many talented women.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>The Volkswagen Group announced a significant 47% increase in the sale of its electric vehicles (EVs) during the first half of 2025, with 465,000 units sold globally. This surge in EV demand, particularly in Europe where sales grew by nearly 90%, helped the company achieve a slight overall increase in total vehicle deliveries. However, the company faced regional challenges, with sharp declines in sales in North America, attributed partly to new U.S. tariffs. In China, Volkswagen's EV sales also dropped by a third amid intense competition from domestic manufacturers, reflecting a difficult market for many foreign automakers. (not investment advice)</p>
