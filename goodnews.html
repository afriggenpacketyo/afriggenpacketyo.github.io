        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>State Farm customers in California will face a 17% increase in homeowners insurance premiums following a judge's ruling, granting the company a $400 million cash infusion to address financial distress caused by Los Angeles wildfires. The California Insurance Commissioner adopted the decision amidst backlash from fire survivors and state senators concerned about insurance payment delays. While the increase, effective June 1, is lower than State Farm's initial 21.8% request, it aims to balance the company's financial recovery with protecting policyholders and the insurance market's integrity. State Farm has also agreed to refrain from implementing new non-renewal programs through 2025, offering some stability to its customers.</p>

          <p>Sony Group shares saw a rise of over 2% amid volatile trading following the announcement of a 250 billion yen share buyback and operating income that surpassed estimates. The company's operating income for the last three months of the financial year reached 203.6 billion yen, exceeding analyst expectations but showing an 11% decrease from the previous year. Sony also detailed a partial spinoff of its financial unit, planning to distribute over 80% of shares to shareholders through dividends. However, the outlook for the current financial year was less optimistic, with forecasted operating profit growth of only 0.3% due to the estimated impact of U.S. tariffs (not investment advice).</p>

The demand for trusted advisors is high, with the number of family offices expected to increase significantly by 2030. However, family offices often prioritize trust and long-term relationships over other criteria, making hiring difficult. The wealthy are now offering higher compensation packages, including bonuses and co-investment opportunities, to attract and retain top talent. Young employees are often reluctant to work in family offices due to unclear corporate structures and the perception of it being a 'retirement job'.</p>

The proposed sale includes $1.32 billion for CH-47 F Chinook helicopters and $130 million for F-16 parts. Some Democrats have signaled potential hesitation due to concerns about the UAE's involvement in conflicts like the one in Sudan. Senator Chris Murphy has stated he will block arms sales to nations engaging in direct personal business with Trump, citing investments in Trump's crypto venture and the gift of a luxury Boeing 747-8 jumbo jet from Qatar.</p>

          <p>A group of white South Africans arrived in the United States as refugees under a program fast-tracked by President Trump, who claims they are victims of racist policies and genocide. However, this claim is disputed by South African officials and experts, who assert there is no persecution of white Afrikaners and that crime affects all races in South Africa. Critics argue that Trump is using the situation to position himself as a savior of white privilege and Christianity. The move has strained relations between the US and South Africa, especially after South Africa's lawsuit against Israel at the International Court of Justice.</p>

          <p>U.S. retail egg prices experienced a slight decline in April, falling from record-high levels earlier this year, but they remain significantly higher than previous years. The average price for a dozen Grade A eggs dropped to $5.12 after reaching $6.23 in March. Despite the decrease, egg prices are still approximately 79% higher than the same month last year due to a persistent bird flu outbreak that has decimated egg-laying hen populations. Experts predict that egg prices may continue to fall in the coming months as consumer demand decreases and bird flu outbreaks subside, but the virus's unpredictable nature could cause prices to rise again.</p>

          <p>President Trump received a warm and opulent welcome from Saudi Crown Prince Mohammed bin Salman, reflecting the amity between a royal family and presidential family with diplomatic and business alliances. Trump was escorted through Saudi airspace by fighter jets and greeted at the Royal Court with Arabian horses and musical horns. The Saudi royals, who understand Trump's tastes and desires, gave him a tour of the 'gallery of memories' showcasing the Saudi-American partnership. The visit underscores the strong relationship between the two countries and the business interests that bind them.</p>

          <p>Erik and Lyle Menendez have been resentenced to 50 years to life in prison, making them eligible for parole, marking a significant step in their decades-long effort to be released after 35 years behind bars. The brothers were initially sentenced to life without parole for the 1989 murders of their parents. A decision on their potential release must next be made by the state parole board, which will hold a hearing in the case next month. The district attorney had argued vehemently against a lower sentence, saying the brothers were not rehabilitated.</p>
