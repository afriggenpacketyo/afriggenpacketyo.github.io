          <p>In an economy with persistent inflation, certificates of deposit (CDs) offer a way for savers to protect their money's buying power with returns that can exceed the inflation rate. This article provides an overview of current CD interest rates as of July 2025, noting that online banks typically offer more competitive rates than traditional brick-and-mortar institutions. It also explains the phenomenon of an inverted yield curve, where short-term CDs currently provide higher returns than long-term ones. To maximize earnings, consumers are advised to compare rates from online banks and consider strategies like CD laddering. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>For taxpayers facing a debt with the IRS, deciding between handling it themselves or hiring a professional is a critical choice. This article suggests that a do-it-yourself approach may be sufficient for simpler cases, such as debts under $10,000, where an online payment plan can be established. However, for more complex situations involving debts over $10,000, unfiled returns, or IRS collection efforts like liens, enlisting a tax professional is highly recommended. Experts advise that a professional can negotiate better terms, explore more options like an offer in compromise, and prevent more severe financial consequences. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>Building an emergency fund is crucial for financial security, and a savings account is a safe vehicle for storing these funds while earning interest. As of July 2025, the national average savings rate is low, but high-yield savings accounts offer significantly higher returns, with top rates exceeding 4%. The article explains that online banks typically provide the best rates due to lower overhead costs and often have no minimum balance requirements or monthly fees. To secure a good rate, consumers are encouraged to choose a high-yield account, look specifically at online banks, and compare different options. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>Telehealth company Hims & Hers Health has announced its expansion into Canada, where it will offer a generic version of semaglutide, the active ingredient in popular weight-loss drugs Ozempic and Wegovy. The move comes as Novo Nordisk's patent for the drug is set to expire in Canada in January, opening the market to more affordable generic alternatives. This development follows Novo Nordisk's decision not to maintain its Canadian patent and its termination of a collaboration with Hims & Hers in the U.S. The Canadian market for these drugs is projected to grow substantially, attracting multiple generic manufacturers.

The "Double Hundred Plan" aims to boost sales for select brands on its platform through enhanced marketing, traffic, and service support. This move comes as the sector, with over 200 million daily orders, sees fierce competition from rivals Alibaba and Meituan, who recently engaged in a price war over discounted items. Alibaba also announced a 50 billion yuan subsidy program, signaling a further intensification of the competition for consumer loyalty in China's lucrative instant commerce space.</p>

          <p>Despite a strategic pivot towards boosting domestic consumption, China has pledged to maintain significant investment in large-scale infrastructure projects to drive economic growth. A top official from the National Development and Reform Commission stated that such investments are essential for improving livelihoods, especially as the country's per capita GDP has recently surpassed US$13,000. This approach revives a strategy previously used to navigate economic downturns, like the 2009 global financial crisis. However, this method has also been criticized for contributing to a substantial increase in debt, particularly from local government borrowing, a challenge Beijing continues to manage.</p>

          <p>Australia has implemented a pioneering climate visa program for citizens of Tuvalu, a low-lying Pacific nation existentially threatened by rising sea levels. The Falepili Union Treaty allows up to 280 Tuvaluans annually to live, work, or study in Australia, providing a dignified mobility pathway before climate change renders their homeland uninhabitable. This approach differs from traditional refugee status by being proactive and preserving agency, while also committing to recognize Tuvalu's sovereignty. The treaty has generated immense interest, with over 3,000 people already applying, and is being watched as a potential model for other climate-vulnerable island nations.</p>

          <p>A 5-year-old beagle named Freddie, who works for Customs and Border Protection at Dulles International Airport, is returning to duty two weeks after being kicked by a traveler. The dog, a rescue trained to detect prohibited agricultural items, sustained bruising but has fully recovered from what was described as a frightening incident. The traveler pleaded guilty to assaulting a police animal, was sentenced to time served, and ordered to pay the veterinary fees. Freddie, whose non-threatening appearance is an asset, has located thousands of pounds of prohibited items during his distinguished service.</p>

          <p>Small business owners facing financial headwinds and accumulating tax debt have several structured relief options available through the IRS. This article outlines key programs, such as business installment agreements, which allow for monthly payments, and an Offer in Compromise (OIC), which can settle debt for less than the full amount in cases of severe financial hardship. Other options include obtaining a temporary 'Currently Not Collectible' status to pause collections and requesting penalty abatement. Experts stress the importance of addressing tax debt proactively, especially payroll tax issues, to avoid severe consequences like asset seizure. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>In response to a swarm of over 1,700 tremors hitting the Tokara Islands, the Japanese government has approved significant upgrades to its national disaster plan. The focus is on preparing for the much-feared Nankai Trough earthquake, a magnitude-9 event that has an 80% chance of occurring in the next 30 years. The revised plan aims to reduce the projected death toll by 80% through infrastructure improvements like taller sea walls and tsunami refuge towers. However, experts emphasize that public education on rapid evacuation is even more critical, as the first tsunami waves could strike some coastal areas within minutes.</p>

          <p>A recent drop in mortgage interest rates to their lowest level in three months prompted a significant 9.4% jump in total mortgage application volume. Both applications for home purchases and refinancing saw a 9% increase for the week, indicating a strong response from homebuyers and homeowners to the more favorable borrowing conditions. The average loan size for a purchase application also decreased, suggesting that moderating home prices and increasing inventory are contributing to buyer demand. However, rates have begun to climb again, making this brief dip a potentially short-lived window of opportunity for prospective borrowers. (not investment advice)</p>
