          <p>Alaa Abdel Fattah, a leading British-Egyptian pro-democracy activist and political prisoner, has been pardoned and released after almost six years in an Egyptian prison. He was arrested in 2019 and convicted of "spreading false news," a charge widely seen as politically motivated. His release follows a request from the National Council for Human Rights and an extensive hunger strike by his mother that brought international attention to his case. While his family celebrates his freedom, his release highlights the ongoing detention of tens of thousands of political prisoners under President Sisi's government.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Zheng Yongnian, a prominent academic in China, is urging the country to develop its own unique foreign relations knowledge system, distinct from dominant Western international relations theories. In an interview with People's Daily, he argued that such a framework is strategically necessary for China to effectively explain its foreign policy and global role. This call aligns with Beijing's Global Governance Initiative, which promotes a multipolar world order based on sovereign equality and shared development. The move represents a push for intellectual autonomy and a rejection of viewing China's international actions solely through Western-centric concepts like realism or liberalism.</p>

          <p>The Detroit Lions secured a 38-30 victory over the Baltimore Ravens, driven by a powerful ground game and a relentless defense. Running backs Jahmyr Gibbs and David Montgomery each scored two touchdowns, contributing to Detroit's 224 total rushing yards. The Lions' defense was equally formidable, sacking Ravens quarterback Lamar Jackson seven times throughout the game. Despite a late touchdown from Baltimore, Detroit maintained control, converting a crucial fourth down late in the game to set up a game-sealing score. The win moves the Lions to a 2-1 record for the season.</p>

          <p>A new ITV drama titled "The Hack" will chronicle the UK's phone hacking scandal, starring David Tennant as the Guardian reporter who broke the story. Writer Jack Thorne, known for "Mr Bates vs The Post Office," praised the real-life journalists whose work exposed a troubling relationship between the press, police, and politicians. Thorne highlighted that unlike the Post Office story, which gained traction through dramatization, the phone hacking scandal was a case where journalism successfully held its own industry to account. The series aims to explore the complex details of the scandal from the perspective of both the investigating reporter and a police detective.</p>

          <p>France has officially recognized a Palestinian state, with President Emmanuel Macron declaring at the UN that "the time for peace has come." This move is part of a growing wave of recognitions from Western countries, including the UK, Canada, and Australia, aimed at advancing a two-state solution. The decision comes amid increasing international pressure on Israel regarding the humanitarian crisis in Gaza and settlement expansion. Israel has opposed such moves, arguing they reward Hamas for its October 7th attack. The U.S. did not attend a French-hosted summit on the issue, highlighting a diplomatic divide among G7 nations.</p>

          <p>The topic of decreased sexual desire after childbirth is explored, featuring insights from reality TV star Holly Hagan-Blyth and relationship experts. Hagan-Blyth shared her personal experience of losing her sex drive after having her son, which created a negative association with physical intimacy. Experts note that this is a common issue stemming from physical healing, drastic hormonal shifts, and the psychological adjustment to parenthood for both partners. They emphasize that open communication is crucial for couples to navigate this period, as it helps remove pressure and address mutual anxieties, reassuring partners that the change is not a reflection of their attractiveness.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>New York Democratic mayoral candidate Zohran Mamdani, who had withdrawn from an ABC town hall to protest Jimmy Kimmel's suspension, has agreed to participate now that the show is being reinstated. Mamdani had framed his boycott as a stand against corporate cowardice in the face of government pressure on free speech. His protest and the subsequent reversal occurred amid a contentious mayoral race where he holds a polling lead over opponents Andrew Cuomo and Eric Adams. The incident highlights the intersection of media freedom, corporate decision-making, and political campaigning in a high-stakes local election.</p>

          <p>A federal judge has ordered the Trump administration to restore $500 million in National Institutes of Health (NIH) research grants to UCLA, providing major relief to the university. The funds were part of a larger suspension of federal grants to the UC system, which the administration justified by citing allegations of antisemitism and other campus issues. The judge ruled that the mass termination of grants was likely illegal as it was done with non-specific form letters, violating the Administrative Procedure Act. This injunction is a significant victory for UC faculty who sued the administration, arguing the funding freeze caused irreparable harm to vital medical research.</p>

          <p>An ancient tradition known as "pannage" has begun in England's New Forest, involving the release of hundreds of pigs to roam the woodland. The practice serves an important ecological purpose: the pigs feast on fallen acorns, which are poisonous to the forest's free-roaming ponies and cattle. This centuries-old form of ecological stewardship, dating back to the 11th century, helps maintain the health of the forest and its other animal inhabitants. Officials remind visitors to drive carefully and keep a safe distance from the pigs during the season, which typically lasts until late November.</p>

          <p>The annual Fat Bear Week competition has commenced, with 12 brown bears from Alaska's Katmai National Park and Preserve vying for the title of the fattest bear. The online public vote celebrates the bears' successful pre-hibernation weight gain, a crucial factor for their winter survival. This event, which has grown from a single-day contest in 2014, allows people worldwide to learn about the park's ecosystem and its inhabitants via livestreams. For the bears, getting fat is essential, as they can add up to 700 pounds and rely entirely on these fat stores to survive the long hibernation period.</p>

          <p>NASA has introduced its 2025 class of ten new astronaut candidates, notable for being the first class to include more women than men. Selected from over 8,000 applicants, the group includes pilots, a geologist, an engineer, and a former SpaceX launch director. These candidates will undergo two years of rigorous training for future missions to the International Space Station, the Moon, and potentially Mars. The selection comes at an uncertain time for the agency, with budget cuts and the planned retirement of the ISS, but officials expressed confidence that the new astronauts will be part of America's return to the Moon.</p>

          <p>Disney has announced that "Jimmy Kimmel Live!" will return to the air, nearly a week after the show was suspended following comments the host made about the death of conservative activist Charlie Kirk. The suspension, which Disney said was to avoid "inflaming a tense situation," sparked a nationwide debate on free speech, drawing criticism from Hollywood figures and civil liberties advocates. The initial suspension came after the FCC chairman threatened to review ABC's broadcast licenses. While Disney has reversed its decision, some major affiliate station groups like Sinclair have stated they will not immediately resume airing the show.</p>

          <p>India is making a significant push to establish a domestic semiconductor industry with $18 billion in approved projects, aiming to reduce its reliance on imports and capture a share of the global market. The "Semiconductor Mission" seeks to build a complete supply chain, from design to fabrication and packaging, capitalizing on its large pool of engineering talent. However, the country faces steep challenges as a late entrant, including fierce competition and the need to develop a deep support ecosystem of suppliers and infrastructure. While progress has been made, experts say success will depend on overcoming logistical hurdles and creating sustainable, long-term policies. (not investment advice)</p>
