          <p>Stephanie Fagan and Jessica Pelley, childhood friends, were separated by the tragic murders of the Pelley family in 1989, an event that deeply impacted both of their lives. Jessica, who survived because she was at a sleepover, was moved away by relatives, cutting off contact with Stephanie, who mourned the loss of both the family and her friend. Years later, Stephanie diligently maintained the Pelley family's gravesite, hoping to reconnect with Jessica, while Jessica lived a difficult life in foster care, unaware that Stephanie was searching for her. The two finally reunited in 2009 through Facebook, rekindling their friendship and discovering a shared connection to the past, symbolizing resilience in the face of tragedy.</p>

          <p>Mahmoud Khalil, a Columbia University graduate and activist, was released from ICE custody in Louisiana following a federal judge's order and arrived in New Jersey to a welcoming crowd. Khalil's detainment, which lasted over 100 days, was attributed to his advocacy for Palestinian human rights, leading to accusations of baseless allegations by the Trump administration. Representative Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez condemned the detainment as a violation of Khalil's First Amendment rights and an affront to American values. The judge ruled that Khalil was not a threat or flight risk, allowing him to return to his family and continue his activism.</p>

          <p>A federal judge blocked the Trump administration from implementing significant cuts to research funding provided by the National Science Foundation (NSF). The ruling struck down a policy change that would have capped indirect costs for universities, potentially stripping them of tens of millions of dollars in research funding. The judge deemed the change arbitrary, capricious, and contrary to law, agreeing with the universities' argument that it threatened critical work in fields like artificial intelligence and cybersecurity. Similar caps placed on grants by the Energy Department and the National Institutes of Health have also been blocked by judges, highlighting concerns over the administration's approach to research funding.</p>

The State Department has also placed Israel under a Level 4 travel advisory, urging Americans not to travel there due to ongoing armed conflict and civil unrest. The evacuations reflect growing concerns about the safety and security of Americans in the region amid escalating tensions.</p>

          <p>Belarus released top opposition figure Sergei Tikhanovsky and more than a dozen other political prisoners following an appeal from the White House and a visit from President Trump's special envoy. Tikhanovsky's wife, Sviatlana Tsikhanouskaya, thanked President Trump for brokering the deal, and European politicians welcomed the news as a symbol of hope. The release came after years of imprisonment for Tikhanovsky, who had planned to run against Belarusian President Alexander Lukashenko in the 2020 election.

          <p>Social media is flooded with advice on lowering cortisol levels, a stress hormone, but experts warn that quick fixes often fail to address the root causes of stress. While cortisol plays a vital role in the body, too much can cause health problems, leading many to seek solutions online. Experts emphasize that simplistic solutions, such as cortisol cocktails and supplements, are unlikely to be effective and can prevent individuals from seeking proper medical treatment. Instead, addressing the underlying causes of stress through therapy, mindfulness, and lifestyle changes is recommended for long-term well-being.</p>
