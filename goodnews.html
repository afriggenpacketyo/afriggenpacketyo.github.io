          <p>Former President Donald Trump has publicly praised Muriel Bowser, the Democratic mayor of Washington, D.C., for her collaboration with his administration's federal crime crackdown. In a social media post, Trump claimed that their joint efforts have significantly reduced crime in the city, citing statistics showing sharp declines in carjackings and violent crime. He contrasted Bowser's cooperative approach with that of other Democratic governors and mayors, suggesting their resistance hinders crime reduction efforts. The praise comes as part of a broader initiative where Trump has threatened to deploy National Guard troops to other cities to address crime.</p>

          <p>Two-time champion Naomi Osaka has advanced to the quarter-finals of the US Open after securing a decisive victory over American third seed Coco Gauff. Osaka, who returned to professional tennis after giving birth in 2023, won the match with a convincing 6-3 6-2 scoreline in just over an hour. The 23rd-seeded player capitalized on an unsteady performance from Gauff, whose game appeared to lack confidence, particularly on her forehand. The win marks one of Osaka's most significant achievements since her return to the sport, demonstrating a return to formidable form on a major stage.</p>

The inquiry, triggered by a whistleblower, was led by Nestlé's chairman and lead independent director. Freixe, who had been with the company for nearly four decades and served as CEO for one year, will not receive an exit package. Philipp Navratil has been appointed as his successor.</p>

          <p>Premier League club Arsenal has completed the signing of defender Piero Hincapie from German club Bayer Leverkusen on a season-long loan. The deal includes an option for Arsenal to make the transfer permanent next summer for a reported fee of £45 million. The 23-year-old Ecuador international was a key part of Leverkusen's Bundesliga-winning squad last season. This move marks Arsenal's eighth signing of the summer transfer window, with manager Mikel Arteta highlighting Hincapie's physical presence and versatility as key assets that will strengthen the team's defensive options for the current season.</p>

          <h2>Film Review: Dwayne Johnson Portrays UFC Champion Mark Kerr in "The Smashing Machine"</h2>

          <p>A new film titled "The Smashing Machine," written and directed by Benny Safdie, chronicles the life of pioneering MMA and UFC champion Mark Kerr. The movie, based on a 2002 documentary of the same name, stars Dwayne Johnson in a dramatic role as Kerr, exploring the fighter's personal crisis following his first professional loss. The review praises Johnson's casting as the physically imposing athlete and notes the film's solid portrayal of his struggles with substance abuse and relationship anxieties. While the movie offers touching moments of vulnerability, the review suggests it doesn't fully explore its emotional themes or elevate itself beyond a conventional sports drama.</p>

          <p>Manchester United has made significant changes to its attacking lineup, with forward Rasmus Hojlund joining Italian champions Napoli on loan and winger Antony moving to Spanish club Real Betis in a permanent deal. Hojlund's loan includes a mandatory £38 million purchase clause for next summer. Antony's transfer is valued at £21.65 million, a substantial loss on the £81.3 million United paid for him in 2022. Both players struggled to find consistent form at Old Trafford and were deemed surplus to requirements by the club's management as part of a broader team overhaul.</p>

          <p>An article examines and refutes claims circulating on social media that former first lady Melania Trump worked as an escort before meeting her husband. These allegations, which first surfaced in 2016, have been determined to be unfounded. Melania Trump previously sued the Daily Mail and a U.S. blogger for defamation over these claims, resulting in settlements, retractions, and damage payments. The report also debunks the related assertion that she met Donald Trump at a party hosted by Ghislaine Maxwell, citing multiple sources that state they were introduced by a former modeling agent at a different event.</p>

          <p>European Ryder Cup captain Luke Donald has confirmed his team for the upcoming match at Bethpage, which includes 11 of the 12 players who secured victory in Rome two years ago. Despite the team's continuity, Donald warned against expecting a "rinse and repeat" strategy, emphasizing that playing on American soil presents a completely different challenge. He noted that Europe has not won an away Ryder Cup since 2012 and that the team must adapt its approach to handle the notoriously raucous New York crowd. Donald's wildcard picks included Shane Lowry, Jon Rahm, and Viktor Hovland.</p>

          <p>Celebrated Canadian author Margaret Atwood has responded to a new book ban in Alberta by releasing a satirical short story criticizing the policy. The provincial education ministry has ordered schools to remove materials with "explicit sexual content," a move that has led to the removal of Atwood's iconic novel, "The Handmaid's Tale," from some library shelves. Her new story humorously describes "very good children" who grow up without any biological realities, taking aim at the perceived puritanical nature of the ban. The protest highlights a growing cultural debate in Canada over censorship and intellectual freedom in schools.</p>

          <p>European stock markets started the month on a positive note, with the defense sector showing significant gains following a major international deal. The U.K. announced it had secured a £10 billion order from Norway for British-made Type 26 frigates, marking the U.K.'s largest-ever warship export deal. This news caused shares of defense contractor BAE Systems to rise, lifting the broader Stoxx Aerospace and Defense index. The health-care sector also performed well, with Novo Nordisk shares climbing after new data suggested its weight-loss drug Wegovy is highly effective in reducing heart disease risks.

          <h2>Study Reveals How Human Intervention Caused Diverging Body Sizes in Wild and Domestic Animals</h2>
          <div class="timestamp">2025-09-01 13:05:00 EDT</div>
        </div>
        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>A new study analyzing 8,000 years of animal bones has found that human activity, particularly during the Middle Ages, caused a significant divergence in the body size evolution of wild and domestic species. Researchers discovered that while wild animals like deer and foxes began to shrink due to habitat loss and intensified hunting, domesticated animals such as cattle and chickens grew larger. This change marks a departure from previous eras where both groups evolved in similar cycles. The findings illustrate the profound and lasting impact of human practices like selective breeding and land management on the natural world.</p>
