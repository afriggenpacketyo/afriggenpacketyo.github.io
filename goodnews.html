          <p>President Trump and Chinese Premier Xi Jinping have reportedly discussed a deal concerning the future of TikTok's U.S. operations, though their public statements suggest differing levels of agreement. While Trump indicated that Xi approved a deal that would see TikTok's U.S. business sold to American investors, Chinese state media characterized the conversation as Beijing welcoming negotiations. The core of the negotiations revolves around the ownership of TikTok's powerful algorithm, a point of contention for U.S. lawmakers concerned about national security and potential influence from the Chinese Communist Party. The leaders also agreed to meet at the upcoming APEC summit in South Korea.</p>

          <p>Tropical Storm Gabrielle has formed over the central Atlantic, becoming the seventh named storm of the 2025 hurricane season. The National Hurricane Center projects that the storm will strengthen into a hurricane by Sunday but is expected to remain over open waters. Its current forecast track shows it moving north of the Caribbean and away from any landmasses, though it could pass east of Bermuda next week. While Gabrielle's formation marks continued activity in the hurricane season, its current trajectory poses no immediate threat, providing a sense of relief for coastal communities that monitor these developments closely.</p>

          <p>Facing saturated markets and slowing economic growth in Europe and the United States, many Chinese companies are now turning their focus toward Southeast Asia. A major trade fair in Nanning is serving as a key platform for these exporters to connect with buyers from the region, which offers a large, youthful population and fast-growing economies. This strategic shift reflects a broader trend in global trade, as Chinese manufacturers seek new avenues for growth and expansion. Companies see the burgeoning Southeast Asian market as a land of significant potential, essential for their future success in an increasingly competitive global landscape.</p>

          <p>A federal judge has thrown out a $15 billion defamation lawsuit filed by Donald Trump against The New York Times, criticizing the complaint as an improper political document rather than a serious legal filing. The judge ruled that the 85-page lawsuit was excessively long and filled with language more suited for a political rally. While the dismissal was on procedural grounds, not the legal merits of the case, it represents a setback for Trump's legal actions against media organizations. Trump's legal team has been given 28 days to file a revised, more professional complaint that adheres to court standards.</p>

          <p>Reflecting on his nearly 25-year career, supermodel David Gandy has expressed serious concerns about the rise of artificial intelligence in the fashion industry. He joins over 2,000 other models in calling for government regulation to protect people's likenesses from being used by generative AI to create images without their consent. Gandy fears that this technology could make models, photographers, and other creative professionals redundant, ultimately damaging the industry's artistry. He also worries about the mental health impact of young people viewing AI-generated images of people who do not exist, stressing the need for clear rules.</p>

          <p>A recent wave of multibillion-pound investments from U.S. tech giants like Microsoft, Google, and Nvidia is fueling optimism about the United Kingdom's future as a global AI superpower. This "tech bromance" was highlighted during President Trump's state visit, with figures like Nvidia's Jensen Huang expressing extraordinary enthusiasm for the UK's research and development capabilities. While some critics worry about the UK becoming overly dependent on Silicon Valley, the influx of capital is seen as a significant boost for the economy. The investments are expected to sprinkle "Silicon Valley stardust" on the UK's scientific hubs and solidify its role in the global tech landscape.</p>

          <p>In a city with few consistent venues for Latinx comedians, the "Pupusas and Punchlines" comedy show has become a thriving cultural hub. Held weekly at a Salvadoran restaurant in Los Angeles, the show provides a platform for both established and up-and-coming comics to connect with an appreciative audience over food and shared experiences. Creator Justin Alexio started the event to counter the marginalization of Black and brown performers in mainstream comedy clubs. The show's success highlights a strong desire for community-focused entertainment where performers can freely joke about the immigrant experience and build their careers.</p>
