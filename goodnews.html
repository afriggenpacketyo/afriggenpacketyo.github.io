        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>A new study shows that the Galleri blood test can successfully detect more than 50 types of cancer, potentially revolutionizing early diagnosis and screening. In a trial involving 25,000 adults in North America, the test identified cancer in 62% of positive results, with over half of those cancers found at an early, more treatable stage. Crucially, three-quarters of the cancers detected, such as ovarian, liver, and pancreatic, currently have no routine screening programs. While researchers are optimistic about the test's potential, independent scientists caution that more data is needed from randomized trials to prove it reduces cancer mortality, with results from a large NHS trial expected next year.</p>

With 23 goals, Surridge is just behind Messi's 26 heading into the final regular-season game, where their two teams will face each other. The 27-year-old, who joined Nashville in 2023 after a career in England that included time at Nottingham Forest and Bournemouth, has found remarkable form in the US. His success, including a winning goal in the US Open Cup final, highlights his successful adaptation to a new league and his role in growing soccer's popularity in Tennessee.</p>

          <p>As the global market for pre-owned luxury goods grows at a rate three times faster than the primary market, robust authentication has become the new gold standard for resale platforms. With increasingly sophisticated "superfakes" entering circulation, companies like Singapore's Carousell and South Korea's Bunjang are investing heavily in verification technologies, combining expert appraisal with AI systems. This focus on building trust has fueled business growth, as consumers are willing to pay a premium for the assurance that their high-value purchases are genuine. The trend reflects a shift in consumer behavior, driven by affordability and the desire for rare or discontinued items. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>A 31-year-old woman from Newport, Wales, credits a mishap during a weekend trip to Butlin's with saving her life after it led to the discovery of a cancerous tumor on her kidney. Charlotte Morjaria sought medical attention for what she thought was a broken rib after being playfully picked up during a game, but a CT scan revealed a 7cm tumor she was completely unaware of. Her symptoms, including fatigue and back pain, had been masked by other factors. Following the accidental discovery, she underwent surgery to remove her kidney and has since been declared cancer-free, though she will require regular scans for the rest of her life.</p>

          <p>Chinese energy storage companies are rapidly expanding their overseas operations, leading to a surge in demand for executives to manage international projects. In the first half of this year, Chinese firms secured nearly 200 overseas orders totaling 186 gigawatt-hours, a year-on-year increase of over 220 percent, with most orders coming from the Middle East, Australia, and Europe. This global push has created a hot job market with attractive salaries for professionals with international experience in the sector. The trend reflects China's growing dominance in the global renewable energy supply chain and its strategic focus on capturing new markets abroad. (not investment advice)</p>

The 33-year-old Scottish athlete and Olympic bronze medallist noted that she has felt less pressure this year compared to the lead-up to the 2024 Paris Olympics. Potter has adopted a new coaching setup for the season and feels she has mentally and physically recovered from the intense demands of the previous Olympic cycle.

          <p>A man in Hampshire, England, discovered his family's secret history as one of pre-war Germany's wealthiest Jewish families after finding a hidden suitcase belonging to his late father. The contents revealed that his father, born Peter Eisner, was part of a family whose vast steel empire and assets, worth billions today, were systematically stolen under Nazi rule. The journey of discovery led Antony Easton to trace looted artworks and properties that were forcibly sold or transferred to a non-Jewish associate who never returned them. After a decade-long investigation, a Berlin museum has agreed to return a significant painting, marking a small restitution for the immense historical loss.</p>

          <p>The South African SUV market is experiencing a significant shift, with Chinese automotive brands seeing an 86 percent surge in sales volume in the first eight months of the year. This rapid growth, led by manufacturers like Chery and Haval, has increased the total market share for Chinese OEMs to 15 percent. While Japanese brands Toyota and Suzuki still hold the largest volumes, their market dominance is eroding as they both recorded a decline in market share during the same period. The trend indicates a growing consumer acceptance of Chinese vehicles in the region, altering the competitive landscape. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>Shohei Ohtani produced one of the greatest individual postseason performances in baseball history, leading the Los Angeles Dodgers to the World Series with a 5-1 victory over the Milwaukee Brewers. In the series-clinching game, Ohtani hit three home runs and, as the starting pitcher, struck out ten batters over six scoreless innings. His dominant display included becoming the first pitcher in MLB history to hit a leadoff home run and the 12th player ever to hit three homers in a postseason game. This tour de force performance emphatically ended a recent hitting slump and earned him the NLCS MVP award, cementing his team's return to the Fall Classic.</p>
