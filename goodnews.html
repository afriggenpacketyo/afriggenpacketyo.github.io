          <p>Former President Donald Trump recently directed public criticism at "Late Night" host Seth Meyers on social media, questioning NBC's decision to extend the comedian's contract through 2028. The article details the long-standing animosity between the two, which dates back to Meyers' jokes at the 2011 White House Correspondents' Dinner. It frames the incident within the broader context of late-night television's role as a platform for political satire and criticism of the current administration. Meyers has not yet publicly responded to the latest comments from the former president.</p>

          <p>Eighty years after the end of World War II, China is increasingly positioning itself as a key defender of the post-war international order, a role that contrasts with its portrayal as a revisionist power by some Western nations. The article reflects on the estimated 35 million Chinese casualties during the war, framing this sacrifice as foundational to Beijing's current diplomatic stance. It examines how China's growing global influence is often viewed as a challenge to the Western-led security framework. This analysis comes ahead of the 80th anniversary of Victory Day, a significant event for Chinese national identity and foreign policy.</p>

          <p>Nvidia announced second-quarter earnings and revenue that surpassed Wall Street expectations, forecasting continued sales growth above 50% for the upcoming quarter. Despite the strong performance driven by high demand for its AI infrastructure products, the company's stock experienced a slight dip in after-hours trading. This decline was attributed to data center revenue falling just short of analyst estimates for the second consecutive period. The report also highlighted that no H20 chips, designed for the Chinese market, were sold during the quarter amid geopolitical tensions. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>To mark the 70th anniversary of Emmett Till's murder, his family members and supporters are recreating the train journey he took from Chicago to Mississippi in 1955. The commemorative ride, organized by the Emmett Till Interpretive Center, includes his cousin Rev. Wheeler Parker, Jr., the last living eyewitness to his kidnapping. Till, a 14-year-old Black teenager, was brutally lynched after being accused of whistling at a white woman. His mother's decision to hold an open-casket funeral exposed the brutality of racial violence and is widely credited with galvanizing the Civil Rights Movement.</p>

          <p>U.S. Senator Alex Padilla of California avoided directly answering questions about a potential 2026 run for governor, stating his current focus is on a special election in November. This election will ask voters to approve a redrawing of the state's congressional districts, a move championed by Democrats to counter Republican-led redistricting efforts in other states like Texas. Padilla emphasized the national importance of the vote, framing it as a necessary action to prevent Republicans from what he termed 'rigging the system.' While he did not rule out a future gubernatorial campaign, he consistently redirected the conversation to the immediate political battle over district maps.</p>

          <p>Google's YouTube TV and Fox Corporation have agreed to a short-term contract extension, preventing a blackout of Fox channels for millions of subscribers. The previous agreement was set to expire, threatening viewer access to popular programming like Fox News and major sporting events, including the start of the college football and NFL seasons. The dispute centers on the programming fees Fox is demanding, which YouTube TV claims are significantly higher than those of comparable content providers. While the extension provides temporary relief, the two companies must still negotiate a new long-term agreement to ensure continued service.</p>

          <p>With a Federal Reserve interest rate cut appearing highly likely in September, savers with Certificate of Deposit (CD) accounts are advised to act strategically to lock in current high rates. The article suggests that savers should shop at online banks, which typically offer higher returns than traditional brick-and-mortar institutions. It also recommends carefully calculating how much money can be deposited without risking early withdrawal penalties. Finally, it advises securing the longest-term CD possible to maximize interest earnings over time and protect principal from future rate decreases and economic unpredictability.

          <p>Homeowners seeking financing may find September an opportune time to apply for a Home Equity Line of Credit (HELOC), according to a financial news article. With average interest rates lower than personal loans and credit cards, HELOCs currently represent one of the more affordable borrowing options. Furthermore, because HELOCs have variable rates, they could become even cheaper following an anticipated Federal Reserve rate cut later in the month. The article also notes that rising home equity levels provide a substantial funding source for borrowers, though it cautions against the temptation to overborrow. (not investment advice)</p>

The interim CEO attributed the sales slump to economic pressures on its customer base but also outlined corrective measures, including reintroducing petite sections and adjusting its coupon strategy.
