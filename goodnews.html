          <p>This article details the complex, behind-the-scenes negotiations among Senate Republicans that led to the passage of President Trump's $3.3 trillion legislative package. It traces the bill's origins from a policy retreat over a year ago to the final marathon voting session, highlighting internal party disputes over issues like Medicaid cuts. Key figures like Senators John Thune and Markwayne Mullin navigated disagreements with fiscal hawks and moderates to ultimately deliver the bill, which extends tax cuts and advances other conservative priorities.</p>

          <div class="timestamp">2025-08-10 10:00:00 EDT</div>
        </div>
        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>This literary analysis explores the work of novelist Muriel Spark, arguing that her reputation as a comic writer often obscures her significance as one of modern Britain's most important religious authors. A Catholic convert, Spark infused her novels with theological concerns, particularly the relationship between an omniscient God and humanity, which she communicated through narrative form rather than explicit content. The article examines how her life experiences, including working in wartime disinformation, informed her unique, darkly droll style and her enduring fascination with truth, fate, and judgment.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>This historical piece recounts the creation of the Cape Henry Lighthouse in Virginia, the first to be fully funded and constructed by the U.S. government. The contract was signed by Treasury Secretary Alexander Hamilton on March 31, 1791, marking a key moment in America's maritime history. The original stone tower guided ships for nearly 90 years before being replaced, standing as a testament to early federal infrastructure projects that established a network of lighthouses to ensure navigational safety along the nation's coasts.</p>

The experience proved transformative, allowing them to focus on their well-being, reassess their career priorities away from corporate pressures, and live more happily on a smaller budget.</p>

          <p>As generative AI empowers cyber attackers with sophisticated tools, corporations are responding by integrating autonomous AI agents into their cybersecurity defense forces. These AI "teammates" are being used to automate detection, analysis, and response to threats, freeing up human analysts to focus on more strategic work and helping to address the industry's talent shortage. While experts see this as an essential evolution to counter AI-driven attacks, they emphasize that the technology currently augments, rather than replaces, human cybersecurity professionals.</p>

          <p>Xenobe Purvis's debut novel, "The Hounding," is a wild and weird take on the historical witch story, set in 18th-century England. The book follows five mysterious sisters who are accused of transforming into dogs, exploring themes of how femininity itself can be perceived as a threat. Told from the perspective of outsiders, the novel directly engages with the subtext of witchcraft narratives, questioning why women's bodies and their perceived strangeness often provoke fear and animosity, though at times it can state its feminist themes too bluntly.</p>
