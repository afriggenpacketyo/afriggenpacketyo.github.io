          <p>The Hershey Company is implementing a low double-digit price increase across its candy portfolio, citing the unprecedented rise in global cocoa costs. The price of cocoa has soared due to poor weather conditions and crop diseases in West Africa, creating a global supply shortage. In response, Hershey plans to focus more on products that are less cocoa-intensive as part of a broader strategy to become a "snacking powerhouse." The company's share price increased following the announcement. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>At 45 years old, pitcher Rich Hill is set to tie an MLB record by playing for his 14th team when he starts for the Kansas City Royals. This milestone makes him the oldest pitcher to start a major league game since 2012. Hill's extensive 20-season career has included stints with numerous teams, notably a successful four-year period with the Los Angeles Dodgers from 2016 to 2019. Despite his age and a long career, Hill continues to perform, having demonstrated strong strikeout numbers in his recent triple-A starts.</p>

          <p>U.S. Special Envoy for the Middle East, Steve Witkoff, is scheduled to visit Europe to continue diplomatic efforts for a ceasefire and peace agreement in the Israel-Hamas conflict. Indirect negotiations are ongoing, with mediators awaiting Hamas's response to a new Israeli proposal for a 60-day truce, which includes a revised map for potential IDF withdrawal zones. The Trump administration is reportedly cautiously optimistic about a potential breakthrough that could lead to the release of Israeli hostages and Palestinian detainees. A key sticking point remains the presence of Israeli troops in Gaza during any truce period.</p>

          <p>Eighteen-year-old Findlay Curtis made a significant impact in his first competitive start for Rangers, scoring a crucial goal in a Champions League qualifier against Panathinaikos.

          <h2>Trump Considers Eliminating Federal Capital Gains Tax on Home Sales</h2>
          <div class="timestamp">2025-07-22 18:23:57 EDT</div>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>President Trump indicated he is considering the elimination of the federal capital gains tax on home sales, a move that would significantly alter real estate taxation. Currently, sellers can exclude up to $250,000 ($500,000 for joint filers) in profit from their taxable income, a figure unchanged since 1997. Proponents, like the National Association of Realtors, argue the current tax creates a "stay-put penalty," discouraging older homeowners from selling and thus limiting housing inventory. Critics, however, suggest that eliminating the tax would primarily benefit wealthy homeowners and could further inflate home values. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>The United States and Indonesia have agreed to a framework for a new trade deal that would see Jakarta eliminate most tariffs on American imports. Under the proposed agreement, the U.S. would set its tariffs on Indonesian goods at 19%, a rate significantly lower than the 32% initially planned under President Trump's broader tariff strategy. The deal also includes forthcoming commercial agreements for aircraft and energy products valued at billions of dollars. Final negotiations are underway to formalize the agreement, which aims to create more fair, balanced, and reciprocal trade between the two nations.</p>

          <p>President Donald Trump and Amazon founder Jeff Bezos met at the White House last week for a conversation that lasted over an hour, according to sources familiar with the matter. This meeting signals a significant warming of relations between the two, who were frequently at odds during Trump's first term. Bezos, who owns The Washington Post and rocket company Blue Origin, has reportedly been seeking to improve his relationship with the administration. The discussions are said to have included government contracts, as Bezos's companies, Blue Origin and Project Kuiper, compete with Elon Musk's SpaceX for government business.</p>

The 71-year-old undertook the strenuous hike in temperatures exceeding 90°F, prompting confusion and concern from fellow hikers and social media users. This is not the first time Kennedy's preference for exercising in denim has been noted, as he has previously been filmed working out and wading in a contaminated creek while wearing jeans.

          <p>Recently passed legislation signed by President Trump has created a new income-driven student loan repayment option called the "Repayment Assistance Plan" (RAP), set to be available by July 2026. The plan calculates payments based on a borrower's adjusted gross income, with payments ranging from 1% to 10% of earnings, and offers loan forgiveness after 30 years. As other existing repayment plans are phased out for new borrowers, RAP will become one of only two choices available. The plan includes a $50 monthly credit per dependent and a subsidy for those not making progress on their principal.</p>

The dominant trend has been frequent but lower-value acquisitions, as larger companies buy smaller startups to enhance their own capabilities. This pattern highlights a significant disparity between the massive capital flowing into the AI sector and the more limited opportunities for lucrative investor returns. (not investment advice)</p>
