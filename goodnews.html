          <p>Former President Donald Trump extended his well wishes to Joe Biden after Biden's office confirmed he was diagnosed with an aggressive form of prostate cancer with metastasis to the bone. Trump and his son, Donald Trump Jr., expressed their support for Biden's recovery on social media. Biden's team stated that the cancer appears to be hormone-sensitive, allowing for effective management, and that the former president and his family are reviewing treatment options with his physicians. </p>

          <p>A new factory in Arizona, built by Taiwanese company TSMC, is poised to produce the world's most advanced semiconductors in the US for the first time. President Trump has touted this as a win for his economic policies, attributing it to his threats of tariffs on Taiwan. However, the factory's reliance on global technologies and materials highlights the inherent contradiction in Trump's 'America First' approach, as the production of these advanced chips requires international collaboration and supply chains. The facility is seen as critical for US technological and economic supremacy over China, even as it depends on global partnerships.</p>

          <p>Nicusor Dan, a centrist mayor and former mathematics professor, won the presidential election in Romania, defeating George Simion, a nationalist aligned with President Trump. Simion, who had been seen as the front-runner, claimed electoral fraud and called for national protests. Dan's victory is expected to ease concerns about Romania joining Hungary and Slovakia in opposing aid to Ukraine and aligning with Moscow, while potentially inflaming Romania's nationalist camp. Dan campaigned as a moderate conservative committed to the European Union and NATO.</p>
