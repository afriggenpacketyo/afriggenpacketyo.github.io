          <p>President Trump announced a trade deal framework with the UK, emphasizing reciprocity and fairness. The agreement, the first of Trump's second term, aims to increase US access to the UK market, particularly for agricultural products. The UK will reduce non-tariff barriers and fast-track American imports. While details are still being finalized, the deal maintains a 10% tariff on UK imports but provides exemptions for the first 100,000 vehicles imported annually. This deal is considered a significant achievement for Prime Minister Starmer, potentially boosting trade and job creation between the two countries.</p>

The agreement could help buoy Britain's economic confidence, although challenges remain, including potential friction with EU trade relations and concerns from British farmers about agricultural imports.

          <p>Former President Joe Biden appeared on 'The View' and stated that President Trump has had 'the worst 100 days any president's ever had.' Biden took partial responsibility for Trump's victory, citing voter concerns about border security and the cost of living during his term. He expressed disappointment but not surprise at Vice President Kamala Harris's loss, attributing it to sexism. Biden defended his cognitive abilities and pushed back against reports of cognitive decline, while Jill Biden responded to accusations of isolating him from allies and the public.</p>

          <p>Stocks experienced a rise after President Trump announced a new trade agreement with the United Kingdom. The S&P 500, Dow Jones Industrial Average, and Nasdaq Composite all saw gains. The agreement includes increased market access for American exports, especially in agriculture, and the elimination of non-tariff barriers. While a 10% baseline tax on imports from Britain remains, the first 100,000 vehicles imported by British automakers will be subject to that rate. Analysts caution to expect continued market volatility amid ongoing trade negotiations with other countries.</p>

          <p>This BBC article breaks down the details of the US-UK tariff deal, clarifying it is not a full free-trade agreement but a reversal or cut of some tariffs on specific goods. The car tariff is reduced to 10% for a quota of 100,000 UK cars, and tariffs on steel and aluminum imports are scrapped. Pharmaceuticals remain an unknown factor, and there is no change to the UK's digital services tax on US firms. The article also notes that food standards will not be lowered as part of the deal.</p>

However, it won't discharge all obligations, such as child support, most taxes, and federal student loans. Chapter 13 bankruptcy involves a structured repayment plan over three to five years, allowing individuals to catch up on missed payments while discharging eligible unsecured debts at the end of the term.
