          <p>Oracle's stock price increased by 21% in extended trading, driven by the company's optimistic growth projections related to artificial intelligence. This surge occurred even though the database software maker's quarterly earnings and revenue narrowly missed consensus estimates. The company highlighted that its remaining performance obligation, a measure of future contracted revenue, has grown to $455 billion, bolstered by significant new AI-related contracts, including one with OpenAI. The strong investor confidence reflects the high demand for cloud infrastructure needed for AI workloads. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>Kansas City Chiefs head coach Andy Reid expressed confusion over an NFL rule that allowed a Los Angeles Chargers player to remain in a game after striking tight end Travis Kelce. The incident involved an open-handed blow to Kelce's head, which resulted in an unnecessary roughness penalty but not an ejection. According to the NFL rulebook, a closed-fist punch mandates disqualification, but an open-hand strike does not. Reid stated he did not understand the distinction in the rule and planned to seek further clarification from the league about the on-field decision.</p>

        </div>
        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>A recent analysis by the Tax Foundation indicates that a new tax law signed by President Trump will provide significant cuts, though the benefits will vary widely by state. Residents of high-income states like Wyoming are projected to receive the largest average tax reduction, while those in states with lower average incomes, such as Mississippi and West Virginia, will see smaller cuts. The law's provisions, including a higher cap for state and local tax deductions, favor wealthier households and those in high-tax areas. The full impact of these changes is expected to be reflected in tax filings for the 2026 calendar year.</p>

          <p>Google Cloud's chief, Thomas Kurian, detailed how the company is successfully generating billions in revenue from its artificial intelligence services through a multi-faceted monetization strategy. The approach includes consumption-based pricing for AI infrastructure, where customers pay per token used, and subscription models for services like Google Workspace and cybersecurity. Kurian also highlighted upselling as a key driver, noting that customers who adopt Google's AI tools tend to increase their overall spending on the platform.

          <p>Nottingham Forest has appointed Ange Postecoglou as its new head coach, moving swiftly after the departure of Nuno Espírito Santo. Nuno's 21-month tenure ended following public criticism of the club's transfer strategy and a reported breakdown in his relationship with the owner. Postecoglou, who previously managed Tottenham and has a prior relationship with Forest's owner, is tasked with building on the club's recent success, including its first European campaign in 30 years. The club's leadership has expressed confidence that the new manager can help them challenge for trophies and continue the progress made under previous leadership.</p>

          <p>The Nasdaq stock exchange is making a $50 million strategic investment in Gemini, the cryptocurrency exchange founded by Cameron and Tyler Winklevoss, ahead of Gemini's initial public offering. This partnership will enable Nasdaq to offer Gemini's crypto custodial services to its institutional clients and makes Gemini a distribution partner for Nasdaq's trade management system. The move comes as Nasdaq seeks a rule change from the SEC to permit the trading of tokenized stocks, signaling a deeper integration between traditional financial markets and the digital asset industry. The investment is separate from Gemini's planned IPO to raise up to $317 million. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>Iran and the International Atomic Energy Agency (IAEA) have signed an agreement in Cairo to resume cooperation, potentially relaunching inspections of Iran's nuclear facilities. The deal, backed by Egypt, comes after Iran suspended all cooperation with the UN watchdog following an air war with Israel and the U.S. in June. This development occurs as European nations move to reimpose sanctions on Iran for non-compliance with the 2015 nuclear agreement. The inability of IAEA inspectors to verify Iran's stockpile of near bomb-grade uranium since the conflict has been a source of serious international concern.</p>

          <p>Manchester City's Erling Haaland continues to set goalscoring records, recently netting his 48th goal in 45 games for Norway. However, an analysis of his performance suggests his phenomenal record is not primarily due to superior finishing ability alone. Data indicates that while his finishing is above average, his true genius lies in his physical attributes and intelligent movement, which allow him to consistently generate a high volume of high-quality scoring chances. Compared to other elite strikers, Haaland's ability to create better opportunities for himself is what truly sets him apart as one of the world's most formidable goalscorers.</p>

          <p>Cracker Barrel has announced it is suspending all restaurant remodels in response to negative customer feedback regarding its recent rebranding efforts. The controversy began when the company introduced a new, more modern logo that removed its iconic "Old Country Store" branding, a change that drew widespread criticism, including from President Donald Trump. After quickly reverting to its old logo, the company has now also halted plans to update its store layouts. The company stated it heard customers clearly and will maintain the traditional, vintage Americana aesthetic that patrons expect.</p>

          <p>Starbucks is rolling out its new "Green Apron Service" model, a major operational overhaul aimed at improving customer service speed and restoring pre-pandemic profit margins. Led by CEO Brian Niccol, the $500 million initiative involves increasing staffing, upgrading technology, and refurbishing stores to achieve a four-minute service target. While the changes are designed to boost sales through faster service and a better in-store experience, the significant investment has put pressure on the company's operating margins.

          <p>Despite a recent decrease from their peak, high-yield savings accounts continue to offer significantly better returns than traditional savings accounts, making them a potentially valuable tool for savers. A deposit of $40,000 in an account with a 4.35% APY could earn approximately $1,740 in interest over one year, assuming the rate remains constant. However, these accounts have variable rates that are expected to decline further following anticipated Federal Reserve rate cuts. Savers should weigh the benefits of high liquidity and strong returns against the potential for decreasing yields and consider alternatives like fixed-rate CDs. (not investment advice)</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>With mortgage rates at an 11-month low and expected to fall further, adjustable-rate mortgages (ARMs) are becoming an attractive option for some homebuyers. ARMs currently offer interest rates significantly lower than traditional 30-year fixed-rate loans, providing immediate cost savings. This loan structure allows borrowers to secure a lower rate for an initial period of several years, giving them time to gauge market trends and potentially refinance later if rates stabilize at a lower point. While not suitable for everyone, an ARM can offer protection against short-term rate volatility while providing a more affordable entry into homeownership. (not investment advice)</p>
