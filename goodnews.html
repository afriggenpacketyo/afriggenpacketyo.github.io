          <p>Boxer Julio C√©sar Ch√°vez Jr. and influencer-turned-boxer Jake Paul are set to face each other in a highly anticipated bout, with both fighters asserting the match is not staged. For the 39-year-old Ch√°vez Jr., the fight represents a crucial opportunity to revive his career after a period in rehab, and he expresses confidence in his superior boxing skills. Paul, who has faced criticism for his choice of opponents, sees this as another step toward establishing his legitimacy in the sport and predicts he will retire Ch√°vez Jr. Both men have dismissed speculation about a pre-arranged outcome, promising a genuine contest.</p>

        </div>
        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>A top economist from China International Capital Corporation argues that China possesses a significant advantage in the global race to develop stablecoins due to its established third-party payment systems. In a research note, Peng Wensheng stated that platforms like WeChat and Alipay function similarly to stablecoins, acting as extensions of legal tender with a 1:1 peg to fiat currency. He highlighted that these systems are supported by a mature regulatory framework and strict safeguards, with customer funds backed by central bank money. This perspective emerges as Chinese state media encourages policymakers to remain proactive in the evolving landscape of digital currency. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>Harvard University and the University of Toronto have developed a joint plan to allow certain international graduate students to study in Canada if they are barred from the United States. This arrangement for Harvard's Kennedy School of Government students to attend Toronto's Munk School comes in response to potential U.S. visa restrictions and a legal battle with the Department of Homeland Security. The Trump administration has moved to cut federal funding and scrutinize Harvard's international student program amid campus protests. The contingency plan aims to provide stability for students and ensure they can continue their education despite the uncertain U.S. policy environment.</p>

          <p>The UK government has announced plans to scrap 201 organizations within the National Health Service (NHS) in England as part of a new 10-year health strategy. Among the bodies to be abolished are Healthwatch England, a patient advocacy group, and the National Guardian's Office, which supports whistleblowers. Health Secretary Wes Streeting stated the move aims to simplify a complex system and focus resources on frontline care, creating "more doers and fewer checkers." The strategy also includes a trial scheme linking hospital funding to patient satisfaction ratings, a move that has drawn both cautious support and concern from healthcare leaders.</p>

          <p>A research team from China's Nankai University has successfully completed the world's first human trial of a brain-computer interface (BCI) implanted through a patient's blood vessels. This minimally invasive technique, which avoids the open-skull surgery used by companies like Elon Musk's Neuralink, was used to help a paralyzed patient regain limb movement. Surgeons inserted a stent electrode into the patient's intracranial vasculature through a neck vein, a procedure that reportedly reduces risk and recovery time. The breakthrough represents a significant advancement in neurotechnology and could position China as a leader in less invasive BCI applications.</p>

          <p>The Los Angeles Dodgers defeated the Kansas City Royals 5-4, extending their winning streak even as manager Dave Roberts believes the team is not yet playing its best baseball. Shohei Ohtani sparked the offense with his 29th home run of the season and a crucial RBI triple, while Max Muncy contributed a two-run homer. However, the team's performance was marred by a shaky start from pitcher Dustin May and defensive errors. The game was ultimately decided by a game-ending double play with the bases loaded in the ninth inning, allowing the Dodgers to grind out a win and take sole possession of the best record in the majors.</p>

Sources close to the player have also dismissed suggestions that Acheampong is frustrated at the club, noting he signed a new five-year contract last year.

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>A new study from the Japan Institute for Health Security indicates that consuming a traditional Japanese-style diet is associated with a lower rate of depressive symptoms among working-age people. The research, which surveyed nearly 12,500 employees, found that those who regularly ate foods like rice, miso soup, fish, soy products, and seaweed were less likely to report symptoms of depression. Researchers controlled for other potential influencing factors and suggested that specific nutrients in the diet, such as omega-3 fatty acids, may contribute to improved mental well-being. The institute hopes the findings can inform public health measures.</p>
