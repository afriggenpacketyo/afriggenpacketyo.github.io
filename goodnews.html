          <p>Japan's Nikkei 225 index achieved a new record high, closing at 45,754.93 for its sixth consecutive session of gains, while the Topix index also set a new benchmark. In contrast, other markets across the Asia-Pacific region showed mixed results, diverging from Wall Street trends as investors sold off technology stocks like Nvidia. Hong Kong's Hang Seng Index experienced a slight decline, while mainland China's CSI 300 saw an advance. The varied performance reflects differing regional economic signals and investor responses to U.S. market movements. (not investment advice)</p>

The breakthrough came after Turkish police matched her fingerprints in a national database, which was then confirmed with a DNA match from a relative in Russia.
