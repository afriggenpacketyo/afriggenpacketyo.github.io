          <p>Shares of Intel increased by 7% following reports that the Trump administration is considering taking a government stake in the semiconductor company. This potential investment aims to bolster domestic chip manufacturing, a key priority for the administration, and would help fund new Intel factories in Ohio. The move is part of a broader trend of increased government involvement in key industries to enhance U.S. technological independence and national security. While Intel has not confirmed the discussions, the news provided a significant boost to its stock, which has been recovering from a difficult previous year. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>David Zervos, chief market strategist at Jefferies and a potential candidate for Federal Reserve chair, has publicly advocated for aggressive interest rate cuts. He argues that current monetary policy is too restrictive and that a significant reduction, such as a half-percentage point cut, is needed to stimulate the labor market and prevent an economic slowdown. Zervos joins a growing list of potential nominees who believe the Fed should act decisively to ease financial conditions, a stance that aligns with pressure from President Trump. He stated that concerns about recent inflation data should not deter the central bank from its course. (not investment advice)</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>The average interest rate for a 30-year mortgage has fallen to 6.58%, its lowest point since October 2024, providing some relief for potential homebuyers and those looking to refinance. This decline comes amid growing expectations that the Federal Reserve may soon cut its benchmark interest rate to stimulate the economy. Future rate movements will likely be influenced by key economic data, including upcoming reports on unemployment and inflation scheduled for early September. The Fed's next policy meeting on September 17 is being closely watched, as any decision to cut rates could lead to further reductions in mortgage costs. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>Welsh winger Louis Rees-Zammit is returning to rugby union, signing with the Bristol Bears for the 2025-26 season after an 18-month endeavor to build a career in the NFL. The 24-year-old, known for his speed and try-scoring ability, was part of the training squads for the Kansas City Chiefs and Jacksonville Jaguars but did not play in a regular-season game. Before his American football venture, Rees-Zammit was a standout player for Gloucester and earned 32 caps for Wales. His return to the sport is highly anticipated, with Bristol's director of rugby describing him as a "world-class player" who aligns with the team's dynamic, attacking style.</p>

          <p>The choice of Alaska as the location for the summit between President Trump and President Putin is strategically significant for both geographical and historical reasons. The location is relatively close for Putin, avoiding travel over "hostile" nations, while also being far from the conflict in Ukraine, aligning with Russia's goal of dealing directly with the U.S. Historically, Alaska was a Russian colony before being sold to the United States in the 19th century, giving the site a unique connection for both nations. The state's military infrastructure, a remnant of the Cold War, also provides a secure and well-equipped venue for the high-stakes diplomatic talks.</p>

          <p>At MIT's Computer Science and Artificial Intelligence Lab, scientists are developing more sophisticated AI for humanoid robots to enable them to perform tasks in complex, human-centered environments. Led by Professor Daniela Rus, the team is training robots by collecting data from humans performing everyday actions, such as preparing a drink. By using sensors to capture human motion and force, researchers can teach robots nuanced physical skills, like how tightly to grip an object. The goal is to move beyond simple, repetitive industrial robots and create machines that can safely and effectively assist with household chores or in medical settings.</p>

          <p>Phil Knight, the co-founder of Nike, and his wife Penny are donating $2 billion to the Knight Cancer Institute at Oregon Health and Science University. The gift is reported to be the single largest donation ever made to a U.S. university or health institution. This substantial contribution will be used to advance a revolutionary approach to cancer research, diagnosis, and patient care, building on a previous challenge where the Knights matched $500 million in fundraising. The Knights are renowned philanthropists, and this historic donation aims to accelerate the work of cancer research pioneer Dr. Brian Druker and transform the future of cancer treatment.</p>

          <p>German soccer champion Bayern Munich has ended its controversial "Visit Rwanda" shirt sponsorship deal, citing a "strategic evolution" rather than directly addressing human rights concerns. The club had faced significant pressure from fans and activists over its commercial ties to Rwanda, whose government is accused of funding the M23 rebel group in the Democratic Republic of Congo. While the prominent branding will be removed, Bayern will maintain a relationship with the country by focusing on youth football development through its academy in Kigali. Experts suggest the move was forced by public criticism, highlighting the complex intersection of sports, finance, and geopolitics.</p>

Diagnosed with Stargardt disease at age 9, Colton has consistently defied limitations, learning to snowboard and completing the Boston Marathon with the help of sighted guides. For the Kilimanjaro ascent, she will be guided by two close friends who she trained, and they will join an exhibition of eleven blind climbers. Colton and her friends also co-founded a nonprofit, the Vorden Initiative, to educate sighted individuals on how to become effective allies and guides for people who are blind.</p>

          <h2>A Closer Look at Palantir's Explosive Growth Driven by Government Contracts and AI Demand</h2>
          <div class="timestamp">2025-08-14 13:38:56 EDT</div>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Data analytics and AI software company Palantir has experienced a phenomenal surge since its 2020 public listing, with its stock growing over 1,700%. A significant driver of this growth has been its lucrative contracts with the U.S. government, particularly the military, which accounted for 55% of its revenue last quarter. The company recently surpassed a $430 billion market valuation, a figure that dwarfs many tech giants with far greater revenues, reflecting immense investor confidence in its AI capabilities. While U.S. commercial revenue is also growing rapidly, the company's high valuation has led to a premium stock price. (not investment advice)</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>For the first time since 2018, boys in the UK have achieved a higher percentage of top A-level grades (A* or A) than girls, with boys at 28.4% compared to girls' 28.2%. This reversal is partly attributed to the increasing popularity of STEM subjects like mathematics, which are taken by a significantly higher proportion of boys and tend to yield more top grades. While more girls take A-levels overall, the gender divide in subject choice, particularly the growing dominance of boys in mathematics, appears to have influenced the overall results. Meanwhile, subjects in the arts and humanities have seen a continued decline in popularity among students.</p>

          <h2>Exploring the Evolving and Subjective Definition of the Term 'Genius'</h2>
          <div class="timestamp">2025-08-14 13:25:36 EDT</div>
        </div>
        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>The concept of "genius" has long fascinated society, yet its definition remains elusive and has shifted significantly over time. Originally referring to a person's guiding spirit, the term evolved in the 19th century to describe individuals with extraordinary, seemingly inexplicable talent. This shift coincided with scientific attempts to explain genius through heredity, leading to the problematic field of eugenics, which often carried racial biases. The article argues that proclaiming someone a genius is deeply subjective, and that historical context, social conditions, and sheer luck play a crucial role in success, complicating any simple definition based on innate ability alone.</p>
