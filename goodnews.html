          <p>A recent survey in Japan reveals that nearly 30% of individuals in common-law relationships avoid legal marriage due to the country's law requiring couples to share a surname. The rate is higher among those in their 20s, with over 60% expressing willingness to marry if separate surnames were permitted. This law, unique globally, faces opposition from conservative politicians concerned about traditional family values. Common-law couples in Japan lack legal marriage benefits like tax deductions and inheritance rights, impacting an estimated 1.22 million people.</p>
