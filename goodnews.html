          <p>The long-postponed deadline for Real ID enforcement at U.S. airports has arrived, with passengers showing up early and prepared. While the Transportation Security Administration (TSA) stated that full enforcement would begin, the Homeland Security secretary indicated that those without compliant IDs would still be allowed to fly after additional screening. Travelers at LaGuardia, Chicago Midway, and Newark Liberty International Airport experienced varying levels of preparedness and wait times, with some facing extra screening due to non-compliant IDs. The Port Authority of New York and New Jersey increased staffing to facilitate the transition.</p>

          <p>Rep. Elise Stefanik questioned Haverford College President Wendy Raymond about disciplinary actions taken against campus antisemitism since the Hamas attack on Israel. Raymond denounced statements from a student group as "repugnant" but avoided detailing specific disciplinary measures. Stefanik pressed further, referencing past resignations of university presidents who failed to answer similar questions directly. Raymond eventually confirmed that some disciplinary actions had been taken, but refused to discuss individual cases, leading to further criticism from Stefanik.</p>

        </div>
        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>A new study draws parallels between the origins of the Covid-19 and SARS pandemics, suggesting both originated in the wildlife trade. Researchers analyzed the genomes of the coronaviruses responsible for both outbreaks, finding that both viruses likely jumped from bats to wild mammals in southwestern China before being sold in city markets. This conclusion contrasts with the politically charged "lab leak" theory, which the White House has promoted. The study highlights the risks associated with selling wildlife in urban centers, with some scientists warning that such practices could lead to future pandemics.</p>

          <p>Federal judges in New York and Colorado have blocked the Trump administration from deporting migrants under the Alien Enemies Act, deeming the president's proclamation unlawful. The rulings challenge the administration's claim that the gang Tren de Aragua constitutes an "invasion" or "predatory incursion" justifying the use of the act. The judges emphasized that the administration failed to demonstrate the existence of a war, invasion, or predatory incursion, and that migrants are entitled to due process. The decisions follow similar challenges nationwide and highlight concerns over the administration's immigration policies.</p>

          <p>Cory Bowman, the half-brother of Vice President JD Vance, has advanced to the general election in the Cincinnati mayoral race. Bowman, a Republican-backed candidate, secured the second-highest number of votes in Tuesday's primary, positioning him to challenge the Democratic-aligned incumbent, Aftab Pureval. Bowman's campaign is centered around money management, public safety, infrastructure improvements, lowering property taxes, and protecting children. While Bowman acknowledges Vance as an "incredible role model," he emphasizes his focus on the specific needs of Cincinnati.</p>
