        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>A federal judge has issued a preliminary injunction ordering the Department of Health and Human Services (HHS) to cease sharing Medicaid enrollees' personal data with immigration officials. The ruling sides with 20 states that sued to block the data transfer, with the judge noting that using the information for immigration enforcement threatens to disrupt the Medicaid program. The court found that the administration upended longstanding policies protecting patient data without a reasoned decision-making process. This legal challenge is part of a broader conflict over the use of government data for the administration's expanded immigration enforcement and deportation initiatives.</p>

          <p>The arrival of Presidents Trump and Putin in Anchorage for a summit on the Ukraine war has elicited a range of reactions from local Alaskans. The meeting has drawn protests, particularly from residents with Ukrainian heritage who view Putin as a war criminal and are saddened by the exclusion of Ukraine's president. Conversely, other locals, including fishermen and military veterans, express hope that the direct talks could finally lead to an end to the destructive conflict. The summit's location holds historical significance, as the U.S. purchased Alaska from Russia in 1867, adding a unique context to the high-stakes diplomatic event.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Following a massive summer spending spree that could exceed £300 million, Liverpool has dramatically raised expectations for manager Arne Slot's second season. The acquisition of high-profile talent, including a £116m deal for Florian Wirtz, has shifted the club's outlook from a transitional phase to demanding immediate success. After winning the Premier League title last season, the significant investment means that anything less than a serious challenge for both domestic and Champions League titles would be viewed as a failure. This places immense pressure on Slot to integrate the new players quickly and deliver more major trophies.</p>

          <p>A federal judge has struck down the Trump administration's guidance that threatened to strip federal funding from schools and universities with diversity, equity, and inclusion (DEI) programs. The ruling found that the Department of Education's memos, which broadly interpreted a Supreme Court ruling on admissions, were unlawful because they were implemented without proper procedure. The judge stated that the guidance created a "sea change" in how educational practices are regulated and produced a chilling effect on educators' constitutionally protected speech. This decision marks a significant victory for educational institutions and advocates who challenged the policy as an overreach of government authority.</p>

          <p>In response to high rates of public harassment, Surrey Police have launched the "Jog On" campaign, which uses plain-clothed female officers to catch and educate perpetrators. The undercover officers go on runs in targeted locations to identify individuals who catcall or shout sexually suggestive comments from vehicles. Uniformed officers are stationed nearby to intercept the individuals and educate them on the impact of their behavior. The initiative was prompted by a county survey where 94% of female residents reported experiencing harassment, highlighting the prevalence of this under-reported issue and the need for proactive policing.</p>

          <p>SpaceX has started offering commercial payload services to Mars and has signed its first client, Italy's space agency (ASI), which plans to send scientific experiments to the Red Planet. The announcement signals a new phase in the commercialization of interplanetary travel, with SpaceX President Gwynne Shotwell inviting others to book their own trips. This move comes despite the fact that SpaceX's massive Starship rocket, which is essential for Mars missions, has not yet been rated for crewed flight and has experienced multiple failures during test launches. No timeline for the first commercial Mars flight has been provided.</p>

          <p>The International Court of Justice (ICJ) has issued a historic advisory opinion stating that countries have a legal obligation to protect the environment from greenhouse gas emissions. The ruling suggests that government actions supporting fossil fuels, such as licensing and subsidies, could be considered an "internationally wrongful act." While the opinion is non-binding, some financial analysts believe it is a watershed moment that requires investors to re-evaluate assets tied to the fossil fuel industry due to increased litigation and policy risk. Others are more skeptical of its immediate market impact, pointing to its advisory nature. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>A children's playground in Wooler, England, has been declared safe and reopened after a seven-month closure for the removal of 177 World War II-era practice bombs. The ordnance was discovered by a contractor installing new play equipment, prompting a large-scale excavation by a specialized disposal team. The bombs, which were not live but contained a small charge, were found carefully stacked in rows. Historical evidence suggests the park was the site of a military ordnance depot during the war, and the devices were likely buried deliberately as part of post-war disposal efforts and forgotten for decades.</p>

          <p>Reform UK leader Nigel Farage has formally written to the Prime Minister requesting the ability to appoint peers to the House of Lords. In his letter, Farage argues that a "democratic disparity" exists because his party, which received over 4.1 million votes in the last general election, has no representation in the upper chamber. He contrasts this with smaller parties like the Green Party and Plaid Cymru, which have appointed peers. Appointments to the House of Lords are made at the discretion of the prime minister, who is not constitutionally required to grant such requests from opposition parties.</p>

          <p>The American Heart Association and the American College of Cardiology have released their first new hypertension guidelines since 2017, with a stronger emphasis on limiting alcohol and sodium intake. The updated recommendations advise clinicians to recommend lifestyle changes for individuals with stage 1 hypertension, a shift toward earlier intervention. For alcohol, the guidelines state that complete avoidance is best, but men should have no more than two drinks per day and women no more than one. The advice continues to stress the importance of a heart-healthy diet, such as the DASH plan, and regular exercise.</p>

          <p>With one in three adults reporting insomnia, this article outlines several evidence-based and popular methods for improving sleep, especially during disruptive summer heatwaves. Key recommendations include getting at least 30 minutes of daily exercise to increase melatonin production and reduce stress. It is also advised to avoid caffeine within nine hours of bedtime and to reduce screen time before sleep, as bright screens can interfere with sleep cycles. While less scientifically proven, the "4-7-8" deep breathing technique is also presented as a widely used method for calming anxiety and promoting faster sleep.</p>

          <p>Japan's economy expanded by 0.3% in the second quarter of 2025, surpassing forecasts and showing resilience in the face of new U.S. trade tariffs. The growth was primarily fueled by a strong rebound in exports, particularly in the key automobile sector, which helped to narrow the country's trade deficit. On an annualized basis, the economy grew by 1%, more than double what economists had predicted. Despite the positive figures, analysts caution that a renewed slowdown is possible in the coming quarters as the full impact of tariffs could soften investment and corporate profits.

          <p>The series finale of "And Just Like That" concludes the story of Carrie Bradshaw by leaving her single, an ending that one article argues is a more authentic and fitting conclusion than the original "Sex and the City" provided. After becoming a widow and navigating a failed rekindled romance, Carrie embraces the idea that she may be on her own, finding fulfillment not in romantic love but in her enduring friendships and her own independence. This resolution is seen as a powerful affirmation of the show's central theme: that the most important and lasting soulmates in a person's life can be their friends.</p>
