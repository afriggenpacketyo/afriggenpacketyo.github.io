          <p>In Hawaii, scientists are using drones to release male mosquitoes infected with Wolbachia bacteria into forests to combat avian malaria, a disease devastating native honeycreeper bird species. The male mosquitoes, which don't bite, mate with local females, resulting in eggs that don't hatch, thereby reducing the mosquito population. This innovative approach aims to protect endangered bird species threatened by climate change, which is allowing mosquitoes to spread to higher elevations. The effort is led by a coalition of organizations known as Birds, Not Mosquitoes, and the technique has been successful in controlling mosquito-borne diseases in humans elsewhere.</p>

          <p>CBS News sources report that President Trump rejected an Israeli proposal to assassinate Iran's Supreme Leader Ayatollah Ali Khamenei. The discussion between Trump and Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu reportedly occurred after Israel's recent large-scale attack on Iran. While Netanyahu avoided directly confirming or denying the report, he stated that Israel does what it needs to do, focusing on nuclear and military targets rather than political leaders. Trump warned Iran against retaliating against U.S. targets and suggested that a deal between Iran and Israel is possible, citing his past success in de-escalating conflicts.</p>

          <p>U.S. Steel shares experienced a rally after President Trump approved the company's merger with Japan's Nippon Steel, subject to a national security agreement. The agreement includes a golden share for the U.S. government, granting the president significant control over the company's decisions. All regulatory approvals have been received, and the transaction is expected to be completed promptly, pending customary closing conditions. Typically, golden shares allow the holder veto power over important decisions the company makes. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>The Boston Red Sox have traded All-Star slugger Rafael Devers to the San Francisco Giants, sending Jordan Hicks, Kyle Harrison, James Tibbs III, and Jose Bello to Boston. Devers, who signed a 10-year contract in 2023, had a strained relationship with the Red Sox after being asked to move to designated hitter. The Giants, seeking a left-handed power bat, hope Devers will significantly impact their lineup and help them contend for a World Series title. This move is reminiscent of past Red Sox trades involving star players like Mookie Betts and Nomar Garciaparra.</p>

          <p>Competition between China and the United States is intensifying, leading to a reshaping of global supply chains and potential benefits for eight developing countries. Malaysia, Vietnam, Mexico, Turkey, Thailand, Indonesia, India, and Brazil are poised to benefit from the relocation of manufacturing from China due to lower labor costs and strong trade ties with Western markets. This shift is driven by Washington‚Äôs push for ‚Äúfriendshoring‚Äù and the ‚ÄúChina+1‚Äù strategy, as well as Chinese firms exploring lower-cost regions. The US National Security Strategy and China's Five-Year Plan highlight the competitive dynamics between the two countries.</p>

          <p>Donald Trump's second term has presented Vladimir Putin with unexpected challenges, despite initial expectations of a strengthened relationship. Trump's efforts at rapprochement have disrupted Russia's propaganda apparatus and foreign policy strategy, forcing the Kremlin to portray Washington as a rational negotiating partner. Putin has had to improvise, competing with Zelensky to convince the White House of the other's unreasonableness. Trump's economic policies, including tariff wars, have intensified fiscal pressure on the Kremlin, while his desire for a settlement between Russia and Ukraine has created a complex dynamic for Putin.</p>
