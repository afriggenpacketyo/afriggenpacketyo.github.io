          <h2>Bestselling Author Scott Galloway Criticizes "Follow Your Passion" Career Advice</h2>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Self-made millionaire and author Scott Galloway argues that the worst career advice, often given by the already wealthy, is to "follow your passion." Instead, he advises combining one's talents with what is financially viable, emphasizing that success often comes from enduring rejection and pivoting when necessary. Galloway's own journey from a Morgan Stanley analyst to a successful entrepreneur illustrates this principle. Mastercard CEO Michael Miebach echoes this sentiment, suggesting young people find the intersection of their passion, their skills, and what the world needs.</p>

          <p>FC Barcelona has reportedly initiated talks to sign Manchester United forward Marcus Rashford, who has indicated a desire for a new challenge. The proposed deal is structured as an initial loan with an option to buy, which would be financially beneficial for Manchester United as they look to manage their wage bill. Rashford, 27, has been training separately from the main squad and was not given a squad number for the new season. The move would see him join the Spanish champions, a destination he has previously expressed interest in.</p>

          <p>China is escalating its efforts to combat the smuggling of strategic minerals, stating that the situation remains "severe" and vowing to maintain a high-pressure approach to enforcement. A special operation launched in May has led to multiple arrests, with authorities noting that smugglers are using increasingly covert tactics, such as false declarations and transshipment through third countries. The government plans to establish a new joint enforcement center to coordinate export controls on dual-use items. This move is aimed at preventing the illegal outflow of critical resources and related technologies.</p>

This development follows a recent agreement on a trade negotiation framework between the two nations.

          <p>A recent Charles Schwab survey found that Americans, on average, believe they would need a net worth of $839,000 to feel financially comfortable. However, financial experts caution that net worth is just one, often misleading, metric of financial health. They argue that focusing on a single number is less useful than understanding one's cash flow and aligning spending with personal values and goals. True financial comfort, the article suggests, comes from having a plan that covers essential needs, savings, and investments, rather than chasing an arbitrary net worth target.

Experts clarify that there is no evidence to support this association; in fact, ultraviolet (UV) radiation is the primary cause of melanoma, and sunscreen is a key protective measure. The rising incidence of skin cancer is attributed to factors like better diagnostics, increased sun exposure, and historically less effective sunscreen formulations.
