          <p>Liu Huaqing, the former commander of the Chinese navy, is lauded as a visionary technocrat and strategist who orchestrated the comprehensive modernization of China’s naval forces to world-class standards. Born in rural Hubei in 1916, Liu joined the Red Army at 13 and participated in the Long March before being transferred to the newly established PLA Navy in 1952, where he first encountered the sea. His distinguished career saw him rise through the ranks, with international commentators often comparing his strategic acumen to that of 19th-century American naval theorist Alfred Thayer Mahan. Liu's profound influence laid the intellectual and practical groundwork for China's ambitious "blue sea strategy."</p>

          <p>The annual Orionid meteor shower is set to reach its peak around October 22nd, promising a spectacular display of bright, fast-moving meteors visible until November 7th. These meteors, originating from debris left by Halley's Comet as Earth passes through its orbit, burn up in our atmosphere, creating distinctive, long streaks of light. Stargazers can anticipate approximately 15 meteors per hour during the peak, with some appearing as brilliant "fireballs" brighter than Venus. For the best viewing experience, finding a dark spot away from city lights, after midnight, and looking towards the constellation Orion with the naked eye is highly recommended.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>India's traditional Diwali gold rush is undergoing significant changes this year as soaring gold prices, exceeding $1,440 for 10g, influence consumer behavior. While the auspicious nature of buying gold during Dhanteras ensures continued demand, customers are now either purchasing smaller quantities or opting for lighter, more elaborate-looking designs with reduced gold content. A notable trend indicates more buyers are acquiring gold and silver for investment purposes rather than solely for jewelry, a shift reflected in bullion market data and record inflows into exchange-traded funds (ETFs) and digital gold. The Reserve Bank of India is also substantially boosting gold demand to diversify its foreign exchange holdings. (not investment advice)</p>

          <h2>U.S. Sees Significant Decline in Fentanyl Overdose Deaths Through Harm Reduction Strategies</h2>
          <div class="timestamp">2025-10-17 19:42:24 EDT</div>
        </div>
        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>The U.S. is experiencing a remarkable reversal in its fentanyl epidemic, with fatal overdoses plummeting by approximately 25% in 2024, saving nearly 30,000 lives. This dramatic decline is largely attributed to a comprehensive embrace of harm reduction strategies, including innovative law enforcement assisted diversion (LEAD) programs that guide substance users towards recovery, rather than criminalization. Increased access to medication-assisted treatment (MAT) like methadone and buprenorphine, the widespread availability of Naloxone to reverse overdoses, and a generational shift among young people avoiding opioids are all contributing factors. Opioid settlement funds are also being strategically directed towards prevention, treatment, recovery, and harm reduction efforts, signaling sustained commitment.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>In a rare public rebuke, the Los Angeles City Council directed City Attorney Hydee Feldstein Soto to withdraw her appeal against a federal judge's order prohibiting the LAPD from targeting journalists with crowd control weapons. This move, preceding "No Kings" demonstrations, highlights growing tensions between the city attorney's office and elected officials over litigation strategy and rising legal payouts. Council members emphasized protecting First Amendment rights, citing a lawsuit from the LA Press Club that provided video evidence of LAPD officers violating guidelines by shooting journalists with "less lethal munitions." The council's action underscores a commitment to press freedom and accountability for police actions, despite the city attorney's arguments about officer safety.</p>

          <h2>Viral "6-7" Phrase Disrupts Classrooms, Becomes Generational Code Word for Teens</h2>

        </div>
        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>The seemingly nonsensical phrase "6-7" has become a widespread viral trend among kids and teens, disrupting classrooms and baffling adults, prompting some schools to ban it. Originating from Philadelphia rapper Skrilla's song "Doot Doot (6 7)," the phrase gained momentum on social media without an inherent meaning, allowing youth to infuse it with their own playful energy. Psychologists suggest its longevity stems from teachers getting involved, as kids enjoy having a secret code that adults cannot easily ban or understand, making it a game. This trend highlights how social media quickly amplifies generational phrases, offering a lighthearted outlet amidst broader societal pressures.</p>

          <p>A man nicknamed "Postal Malone" due to his striking resemblance to the singer Post Malone has been arrested in Orange County for a string of package thefts. Jacob Daniel Rodriguez, 45, was apprehended after being suspected of stealing multiple packages from an Irvine apartment community, where he was captured on camera. Authorities had previously posted photos of the suspect, noting his distinctive facial and hand tattoos, similar to the actual Post Malone, whose real name is Austin Post. The Irvine Police Department celebrated the arrest on social media, using puns related to the singer's song titles, signaling a positive resolution for community safety and an end to the "running in circles" caused by the burglaries.</p>

          <p>Billionaire Salesforce CEO Marc Benioff publicly apologized for his earlier comments supporting President Trump's deployment of National Guard troops to San Francisco, now stating he no longer believes such intervention is necessary. His initial remarks, which suggested a need for more police, sparked widespread backlash due to federal laws restricting domestic troop deployment for law enforcement purposes. Benioff, who primarily resides in Hawaii, walked back his stance after engaging with local officials and San Franciscans, emphasizing the importance of collaborative efforts for city safety. This apology comes as city and state leaders, including Governor Gavin Newsom, have refuted Trump's claims of rampant crime in San Francisco, touting declining statistics.</p>

          <p>A new study reveals exciting results for the Galleri blood test, which can detect over 50 types of cancer, potentially revolutionizing early diagnosis and treatment. The trial, involving 25,000 adults in North America, successfully identified a wide range of cancers, three-quarters of which currently lack screening programs, with over half detected at an early, more treatable stage. The test accurately identified cancer's origin in 9 out of 10 cases and correctly ruled out cancer in over 99% of negative results. While more research is needed to confirm its direct impact on mortality, these impressive findings suggest a major future role in widespread cancer screening and early intervention.</p>

          <p>Credo, a 17-year-old semiconductor company, has seen its market value surge to nearly $25 billion, driven by its distinctive $500 purple active electrical cables (AECs) becoming a critical component in the burgeoning AI boom. These specialized copper cables, used to connect powerful GPUs in massive supercomputing facilities like Elon Musk's xAI data center, offer superior reliability compared to fiber optics, preventing costly "link flaps" that can shut down entire data centers. Analysts project the AEC market to reach $4 billion by 2028, with Credo holding an impressive 88% market share. The company is benefiting from "insatiable demand" from hyperscalers like Amazon and Microsoft, with significant revenue growth anticipated. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>Lamborghini's CEO, Stephan Winkelmann, announced the luxury carmaker is delaying its full transition to an all-electric future, opting to continue utilizing internal combustion engines for at least another decade. Citing a perceived waning enthusiasm for electric cars among high-end buyers, the company will instead focus on plug-in hybrids, believing customers still desire the "sound and emotion" of traditional motors. This strategic pivot means a long-planned all-electric model, the Lanzador, may become a plug-in hybrid, and the all-electric successor to the Urus is now not expected before 2035. Lamborghini, as a low-volume manufacturer, contends its environmental impact is limited despite global pressure to cut emissions.</p>

        </div>
        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>This opinion article advocates for Hong Kong's Northern Metropolis to transcend its initial purpose as a housing and industrial zone, evolving into a "cradle for culture" within the Greater Bay Area (GBA). The author argues that with sophisticated technological and network infrastructure already prevalent in the GBA, the focus should shift from merely boosting connectivity to understanding its cultural purpose and influence. By prioritizing innovation and cultural development over property-led growth, the Metropolis could aspire to compete for global cultural influence, much like Hollywood or K-pop. This forward-looking vision positions Hong Kong to become a significant exporter of cultural content, leveraging its unique regional position.</p>
