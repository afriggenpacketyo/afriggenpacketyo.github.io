          <p>Japan's 50th and final H2A rocket successfully lifted off from Tanegashima Island, marking the end of the vehicle's 24-year service in the nation's space program. The rocket, developed by Mitsubishi Heavy Industries and JAXA, deployed a government satellite designed to monitor greenhouse gases. The H2A series, which had a 98% success rate, is being replaced by the more cost-effective H3 rocket. This final mission concludes a significant chapter in Japan's aerospace history, paving the way for its next generation of space exploration vehicles.</p>

          <p>Twelve years after walking onto the Wembley pitch as a nine-year-old mascot, Jonathan Rowe scored the winning goal for England in the European Under-21 Championship final against Germany. The Marseille forward, who overcame significant injuries and a challenging move to French football, came off the bench to secure a dramatic 3-2 victory in extra time. His journey from a humble youth player at AFC Wembley and the Norwich City academy to a national hero highlights a story of perseverance.

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>A team of astronomers has discovered mysterious, ancient radio signals that traveled for 10 billion years to reach Earth from the galaxy cluster SpARCS1049. The signals originate from a "mini-halo," a vast cloud of high-energy particles and magnetic fields, which has never been observed at such a great distance before. This discovery, made using the LOFAR radio telescope, challenges previous understandings of the early universe. Scientists believe the energetic particles could have been generated by supermassive black holes or cosmic particle collisions, suggesting these processes were shaping galaxies much earlier than previously thought.</p>

          <p>Despite the Los Angeles Dodgers' 9-5 loss to the Kansas City Royals, Shohei Ohtani had his best outing on the mound since returning from Tommy John surgery. In two sharp innings, he threw the hardest pitch of his MLB career at 101.7 mph and effectively used his off-speed pitches, retiring the side in the second. Although his workload is still being carefully managed, Ohtani's performance demonstrated his dominant potential as a pitcher. The rest of the Dodgers' pitching staff struggled, and the offense was quiet until a late rally, but Ohtani's progress was the game's most significant takeaway.</p>

Speaking at a summit, the former head of AI at Microsoft noted that the gap in chip production is a major challenge for China. However, he highlighted the success of Chinese start-ups like DeepSeek, which have achieved competitive results with top U.S. models using far less computing power.

The plaintiffs sued Trump over statements he made during a 2024 presidential debate, which they claim were false and defamatory. In her ruling, Judge Wendy Beetlestone stated that Pennsylvania's Anti-SLAPP law, which Trump's legal team invoked to protect free speech, does not apply in federal court.

          <p>A new study of the ancient city of √áatalh√∂y√ºk in Turkey suggests it may have been a matriarchal society ruled by females over 9,000 years ago. After analyzing DNA from more than 130 skeletons buried under the city's houses, researchers found that genetic connections were primarily traced through the female line. This indicates that upon marriage, men likely moved into their wives' households, and female offspring remained connected to their family homes. The findings, which also show preferential treatment for females in grave goods, challenge traditional assumptions about patrilineal structures in ancient societies.</p>
