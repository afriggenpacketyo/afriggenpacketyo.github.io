          <p>Former Vice President Kamala Harris has officially announced she will not be a candidate for governor of California in the upcoming election. In a statement, she mentioned a period of deep reflection led to her decision, stating her public service will continue outside of elected office for now. This move clears a potential frontrunner from the race to succeed Governor Gavin Newsom and keeps open the possibility of another presidential campaign in 2028. Harris also hinted at a need for new methods and thinking within the Democratic party following her 2024 election loss.</p>

          <p>With the Federal Reserve deciding to keep its benchmark interest rate paused, borrowers facing high-interest debt, particularly on credit cards, are unlikely to see relief soon. Financial advisors suggest this is a critical time for individuals to explore debt relief options to regain financial stability. Recommended actions include conducting a thorough budget review to identify savings, understanding the risks and benefits associated with options like debt management programs, and addressing the root causes of debt accumulation. These proactive steps can help borrowers manage their financial health while waiting for potential future rate cuts. (not investment advice)</p>

        </div>
        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>U.S. Treasury yields increased following the Federal Reserve's decision to maintain its current interest rates and a report showing stronger-than-expected economic growth in the second quarter. The Fed's rate-setting committee, the FOMC, voted 9-2 to hold the rate, with the two dissenting members favoring a cut. Fed Chair Jerome Powell stated that policymakers will monitor the inflationary impact of tariffs before making future decisions, emphasizing no commitments have been made for the next meeting in September. The economic data and the Fed's cautious stance contributed to the upward movement in bond yields. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>A bill aimed at banning members of Congress, their spouses, the president, and the vice president from trading individual stocks has successfully passed through a Senate committee. The legislation, championed by Republican Senator Josh Hawley, received bipartisan support from Democrats on the panel, moving it to the Senate floor for a full vote. The Honest Act, as it is now called, would require officials to divest from individual stocks, allowing investments only in diversified funds or Treasury bonds. President Trump expressed conceptual support for a congressional ban but did not endorse this specific bill, which would not apply to the executive branch until after his term.</p>

          <p>Life sciences company Danaher has seen its stock price rise following a better-than-expected second-quarter earnings report, prompting questions about the rally's sustainability. The company has faced headwinds from a slow recovery in China, post-pandemic order adjustments, and U.S. tariff policies. While Danaher raised its full-year earnings guidance and showed improvement in its bioprocessing segment, challenges remain, particularly with declining sales in China due to procurement policy changes. Analysts suggest that while the quarter was a positive step, a sustained rally for the sector may still be a couple of quarters away. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>Residents in states including California, Colorado, Texas, New Mexico, and Kansas should prepare for an increase in tarantula sightings as the spiders' annual mating season begins. From late evening to early dawn during September and October, thousands of male tarantulas, which can reach the size of a baseball, will emerge to search for mates. These spiders are generally secretive and timid, rarely biting humans unless provoked. Experts advise that if a tarantula is spotted, it's best to observe it from a distance, as they play a role in the ecosystem by controlling insect populations.</p>

          <p>President Donald Trump has stated that trade talks with China are "moving along well" and expressed confidence that the two nations will achieve a "very fair deal." He offered no specific details on the progress or a timeline for a potential agreement to pause or roll back tariffs. This optimistic comment comes amid ongoing economic friction, with recent data showing a 24% year-on-year decline in Chinese exports to the U.S. in the second quarter of 2025. Negotiators from both countries have described recent discussions as "constructive," but they have publicly diverged on the timing of any potential tariff pause.</p>

The $1.3 billion mission aims to provide unprecedented data on natural and manmade disasters like earthquakes, floods, and melting glaciers. Orbiting from pole to pole, NISAR will use two different radar frequencies to create detailed maps of the Earth's surface every 12 days, regardless of weather conditions. This launch represents the largest space collaboration between the U.S. and India, with its data intended to benefit the entire global scientific community.</p>

          <p>Tsunami alerts that were issued across the Pacific have been largely scaled back after an 8.8 magnitude earthquake struck off Russia's Kamchatka Peninsula. The powerful quake initially prompted evacuation orders for over two million people in Japan, Russia, and Hawaii, but the resulting waves were less destructive than feared. Hawaii experienced waves up to 1.7 meters, and some minor flooding was reported, but the warning was later downgraded to an advisory. While some coastal areas in California and Russia saw notable surges, no severe damage or injuries were reported, and most residents were cleared to return home.</p>

          <p>As Americans struggle with record-high credit card balances, credit card debt forgiveness programs can offer a path to relief by reducing the total amount owed. However, not everyone is eligible for these programs. The article explains that the strongest candidates are typically those facing genuine financial hardship, such as job loss or major medical expenses, which they can document. Borrowers with significant amounts of unsecured debt (often over $10,000) and those who have already fallen behind on payments are also more likely to successfully negotiate a settlement with creditors.</p>

          <p>A recent underwater expedition has revealed extensive communities of tubeworms and mollusks flourishing more than 31,000 feet deep in the Pacific Ocean's Kuril–Kamchatka and Aleutian trenches. These findings challenge previous assumptions about the limits of life in such extreme, high-pressure environments. Scientists believe these creatures survive not on nutrients trickling down from above, but on chemicals produced by microbes that process carbon accumulated in the trenches over time. The discovery suggests that such complex ecosystems in the deepest parts of the ocean may be more widespread than previously thought.</p>
