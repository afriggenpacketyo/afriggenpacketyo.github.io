          <p>Shenzhen-based UBTech Robotics, a leading Chinese manufacturer of humanoid robots, is planning to raise approximately $307 million through a new share placement in Hong Kong. The funds are intended for general business operations, development, and debt repayment as the company continues its fundraising efforts since its late 2023 listing. This move will dilute the company's existing share capital by about 6.39 percent. Following the announcement, the company's shares experienced a notable drop in morning trading.

          <p>The UK government is set to announce its first-ever sanctions targeting people-smuggling operations, a key part of Prime Minister Keir Starmer's strategy to curb illegal Channel crossings. The measures will freeze the assets of and impose travel bans on gang leaders, corrupt officials, and companies supplying equipment like small boats. Foreign Secretary David Lammy stated the goal is to disrupt the criminal gangs profiting from vulnerable migrants. This new approach aims to tackle immigration crime where traditional law enforcement has been unable to reach.</p>

          <div class="timestamp">2025-07-22 00:00:45 EDT</div>
        </div>
        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>In a personal essay, writer Ana Schnabl critiques the expectation from Western publishers that authors from the Balkans must focus on themes of war, trauma, and regional tragedy. She recounts being advised by a US publisher to write about "problematic" or "traumatic" aspects of her culture to appeal to American readers. Schnabl argues this pigeonholes writers and reinforces a perception of the Balkans as a "lesser place" defined by its historical suffering. She calls for publishers to embrace a wider diversity of stories from the region, beyond those that simply serve an explanatory or didactic purpose.</p>

          <p>The British government has announced "substantial changes" to the compensation program for victims of the infected blood scandal, which affected an estimated 30,000 people. The move follows a highly critical report from the public inquiry chair, who described the scheme's management as "profoundly unsatisfactory." Key changes include allowing compensation to be passed to a victim's estate if they die before a claim is settled. While victims' groups cautiously welcomed the changes, they noted that some key issues, such as compensation levels for hepatitis victims, still require further consultation.</p>

          <p>The recent sighting of Eurasian otters in the waters of Indian-administered Kashmir has thrilled wildlife conservationists, as the species was long believed to be extinct in the region. The reappearance of these otters, which are classified as "near threatened," is seen as a positive indicator of improved aquatic habitat quality and reduced poaching. However, the presence of the semi-aquatic mammals has made some local villagers wary, with some fearing the animals despite assurances from wildlife officials that they pose no threat to humans.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>This opinion article argues that while widely criticized, Donald Trump's universal tariffs may have an unintended positive consequence. The author suggests that the economic pressure from these tariffs is compelling countries like Canada and China, as well as the European Union, to confront and dismantle their own long-standing internal trade barriers. These domestic protectionist policies have been a significant drag on their economies. The tariff crisis, therefore, could be inadvertently spurring valuable and overdue economic reforms and liberalization in these nations. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>Universal Music Group (UMG), the world's largest music company, has confidentially filed to sell shares on a U.S. stock exchange. The company, which represents stars like Taylor Swift and Drake and is already listed in the Netherlands with a valuation near €50 billion, is seeking a dual listing. The move has been encouraged by major investors like Bill Ackman's hedge fund, who believe a U.S. listing will enhance the company's value and trading liquidity. The potential offering is still subject to review by the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission. (not investment advice)</p>

In response, King's children supported transparency but cautioned that the files must be viewed in the context of the FBI's relentless surveillance campaign against their father. The family has long disputed the official conclusion that Ray acted alone.</p>

The top executive in Kerr County, the hardest-hit area, stated that only three individuals remain unaccounted for. Most of those reported missing were tourists who had left the area and returned home without checking in. The flash floods killed at least 135 people in the state, with the fast-moving water washing away buildings and vehicles along the popular Guadalupe River.</p>

          <p>Singer-songwriter Billy Joel says he is feeling "good" two months after announcing his diagnosis with Normal Pressure Hydrocephalus (NPH), a rare brain condition. Speaking on a podcast, the 76-year-old musician noted he still struggles with his balance but that the condition feels less severe than the "brain disorder" label suggests. Joel was forced to cancel numerous tour dates in May after doctors advised that recent performances had exacerbated his condition. NPH involves a build-up of fluid in the brain and can affect mobility, vision, and hearing.</p>
