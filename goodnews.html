          <p>International Business Machines (IBM) saw its shares fall in extended trading despite reporting second-quarter financial results that surpassed Wall Street's expectations for both earnings and revenue. The company's revenue grew by nearly 8% year-over-year, a significant acceleration from the previous quarter, with strong performance in its software, consulting, and infrastructure segments. IBM reaffirmed its full-year forecast for revenue growth and free cash flow, signaling confidence in its business trajectory. The market's negative reaction occurred even as the company continues to benefit from its focus on hybrid cloud and artificial intelligence. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>The Trump administration has introduced a new AI Action Plan designed to maintain U.S. leadership in the field by accelerating innovation and infrastructure development. The plan includes over 90 federal policy actions, such as fast-tracking the construction of data centers and semiconductor plants, and removing regulations perceived as obstructive. It also aims to establish rules for government contractors to eliminate "ideological bias" in AI and create AI export packages for U.S. allies. The administration's stated goal is for the United States to decisively win the global AI race and solidify its position as the leader.</p>

          <p>Alphabet reported second-quarter earnings and revenue that exceeded analyst expectations, driven by strong performance in its search, advertising, and cloud divisions. The company's overall revenue grew 14% year-over-year, with Google Cloud revenue increasing by 31%. However, Alphabet also announced it is raising its projected capital expenditures for 2025 by $10 billion, to a total of $85 billion, to fund its expansion in artificial intelligence. The increased spending reflects the growing demand for its cloud and AI services, as products like AI Overviews and the Gemini app show significant user growth. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>Meta has rolled out new safety features for its platforms, including Instagram, to better protect teen users from potentially exploitative content and interactions. The updates include enhanced direct messaging protections, such as providing more context about unknown accounts and allowing users to block and report in a single action. The company also revealed it recently removed nearly 135,000 Instagram accounts for sexualizing children and an additional 500,000 linked accounts. This initiative comes amid increasing pressure from policymakers and proposed legislation like the Kids Online Safety Act, which aims to hold social media companies more accountable for child safety.</p>

          <h2>Comparing Potential Interest Earnings of a 6-Month CD and a High-Yield Savings Account</h2>

          <p>This article provides a comparative analysis for savers deciding between a 6-month certificate of deposit (CD) and a high-yield savings account for a $10,000 deposit. While a high-yield savings account offers flexibility with its variable rate and accessible funds, a CD provides a guaranteed, fixed return but requires locking the money away for a set term. Based on current rates, the 6-month CD would earn slightly more interest, and that return is guaranteed, unlike the savings account rate which is likely to fall. The article concludes that for those who can afford the lack of liquidity, a CD offers a more certain and potentially higher return. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>NASA has successfully launched the twin TRACERS satellites aboard a SpaceX Falcon 9 rocket to study the interaction between the solar wind and Earth's magnetic field. This interaction creates space weather, which can disrupt satellites, power grids, and communication systems. The identical satellites will fly in tandem, allowing researchers to precisely measure how energy from the sun couples with Earth's magnetosphere, driving phenomena like the aurora. The mission aims to improve understanding and prediction of space weather events, ultimately helping to protect critical infrastructure on Earth and astronauts in space. The launch also deployed several other small research satellites.</p>

          <p>The new movie 'The Fantastic Four: First Steps' is reviewed as a refreshing departure from modern superhero epics, embracing a staid, retro tone reminiscent of classic science fiction. Set in an alternate, Atomic Age-inspired universe, the film skips the origin story and presents the heroes as settled adults, with Pedro Pascal and Vanessa Kirby leading the cast. The review praises the movie's deliberate pacing, sleek visuals, and emotionally credible performances, highlighting its focus on character over chaotic action. By valorizing the team's inherent "lameness" instead of trying to make them cool, the film is seen as restoring dignity to the characters and offering a mature, grown-up blockbuster.</p>

          <p>The price of gold has experienced a dramatic increase, rising over 42% in the past year to more than $3,400 per ounce, with experts predicting it could reach $4,000 in 2025. This surge is largely driven by investors seeking a reliable hedge against persistent inflation, reaffirming gold's traditional role as a store of value. The article notes that while gold is known for portfolio protection, its recent appreciation has also made it a profitable asset. It advises that despite the high price, there are still accessible ways to invest, such as through fractional bars or dollar-cost averaging, while reiterating the standard advice of limiting gold to 10% of a portfolio.

          <p>Republican Congressman Mike Lawler has announced he will not run for governor of New York in 2026, opting instead to seek reelection for his Hudson Valley House seat. Lawler, whose district is considered a key battleground, stated that maintaining the Republican House majority is critical for the economy. The decision follows speculation and a social media post from former President Trump endorsing Lawler for reelection, seen by some as an effort to clear the GOP gubernatorial field for Rep. Elise Stefanik. In his announcement, Lawler immediately pivoted to criticizing potential NYC mayoral candidate Zohran Mamdani, introducing a bill to probe one of his policy proposals.</p>

The Maryland judge's order provides Abrego Garcia, who was wrongfully deported to El Salvador earlier this year, crucial due process protections against being swiftly removed from the U.S. again.

          <p>The Trump administration's new AI Action Plan reflects a strategy of deregulation and accelerated development, heavily influenced by supportive Silicon Valley executives. The plan aims to remove "bureaucratic red tape" to help U.S. companies compete globally, particularly against China, by streamlining processes like data center permitting. This pro-growth approach contrasts with the previous administration's focus on potential risks and has been praised by some tech leaders for its positive mission. However, it has drawn criticism from civil rights and environmental groups who fear it prioritizes corporate interests over public welfare and environmental protection.</p>
