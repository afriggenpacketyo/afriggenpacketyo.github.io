          <p>The U.S. Attorney for New Jersey, Alina Habba, dismissed the federal trespassing charge against Newark Mayor Ras Baraka, who was arrested during an Immigration and Customs Enforcement facility visit. Habba stated the dismissal was "for the sake of moving forward" as Baraka is running for governor. Simultaneously, Habba charged U.S. Rep. LaMonica McIver with assaulting and interfering with law enforcement during the same visit. Baraka and McIver have been critical of the ICE facility, citing safety concerns, while Habba invited Baraka to tour the facility, asserting the government has nothing to hide.

          <p>A Lufthansa flight from Frankfurt to Seville experienced a critical situation when the co-pilot became incapacitated while the captain was outside the cockpit in February 2024. The report from Spain's Ministry of Transport and Sustainable Mobility revealed the plane flew unsupervised for approximately 10 minutes with the autopilot engaged. The captain was unable to re-enter the cockpit immediately due to security protocols, but the co-pilot eventually opened the door after the captain used the emergency code. A doctor on board diagnosed the co-pilot with a possible heart condition, and the flight was diverted to Madrid, landing safely with no further incident.

          <p>A divided panel of the 4th Circuit Court of Appeals sided with a 20-year-old Venezuelan man, identified as "Cristian," who was seeking to return to the United States after being deported to El Salvador. The court upheld a previous order directing the Trump administration to facilitate his return, stating that his removal violated a class action settlement. Cristian was deported after President Trump invoked the Alien Enemies Act, but the court found this to be a breach of the 2024 settlement agreement, which guaranteed his asylum application would be adjudicated on its merits. The dissenting judge argued that returning Cristian would be futile, given his alleged gang affiliation and felony drug conviction.</p>

          <p>President Donald Trump signed the Take It Down Act into law, which aims to combat online sexual exploitation, including the use of AI to create fake images. The bill makes it a federal crime to knowingly publish or threaten to publish intimate images without consent and requires websites to remove such material within 48 hours of a request. First Lady Melania Trump, who advocated for the bill, called it a ‚Äúnational victory‚Äù that will protect children from online exploitation. The law received bipartisan support but has faced criticism from free speech advocates who fear it could lead to censorship and government monitoring.</p>

Homeland Security Secretary Kristi Noem stated that those who do not utilize the program will face fines, arrest, and deportation. This initiative, part of President Trump's crackdown on illegal immigration, aims to provide a smoother alternative to forcible deportations, though other deportation policies have faced legal challenges and criticism.</p>

          <p>Scientists are engaged in a global race to determine why our Universe exists, with teams in the US and Japan constructing advanced detectors to study sub-atomic particles called neutrinos. The current model of the Universe's creation cannot explain the existence of planets, stars, and galaxies. The US-led Deep Underground Neutrino Experiment (Dune) in South Dakota and the Japanese-led Hyper-K experiment aim to examine the differences between neutrinos and anti-neutrinos, which could explain why matter prevailed over anti-matter after the Big Bang. The experiments promise transformative insights into the fundamental nature of the Universe and humanity's place within it.</p>

          <p>The Post Office has agreed to compensate hundreds of former sub-postmasters after accidentally leaking their names and addresses on its corporate website, which occurred in June of last year. Individual payouts of up to ¬£5,000 will be awarded, with the potential for higher sums for those who pursue further claims. The data breach involved the personal details of 555 victims of the Horizon IT scandal. The Post Office has apologized and stated it is working in full cooperation with the Information Commissioner's Office, with a law firm securing the payouts on behalf of the affected sub-postmasters.</p>
