He credits a conversation with a youth manager at age 14 as a turning point that focused him on football and away from a self-destructive path. Rooney reflects on the sacrifices his parents made, the challenges of his managerial career at clubs like Derby County and Birmingham, and his commitment to providing honest, unfiltered analysis in his new media role.

          <p>The Los Angeles Dodgers secured a crucial 3-2 victory over the San Diego Padres, moving back into a tie for first place in the National League West. The win snapped a four-game losing streak and came despite losing third baseman Max Muncy to the injured list before the game. Pitcher Clayton Kershaw delivered six strong innings, and the often-struggling bullpen successfully protected a narrow late-game lead. The victory provided a much-needed boost for the team, which had been in a slump after previously holding a significant lead in the division.</p>

          <p>An agreement has been reached between Washington D.C. and the Trump administration, allowing Police Chief Pamela Smith to retain command of the city's police force. The deal came after the city filed a lawsuit to block an order from Attorney General Pam Bondi that would have placed the head of the DEA in charge. While a judge noted the mayor must follow White House directives for federal purposes under the Home Rule Act, she affirmed that this does not grant the administration full operational control. The new arrangement makes the DEA head an intermediary rather than a commander.</p>

          <p>Following a federal court hearing, the Department of Justice has agreed to reverse its takeover of the Washington, D.C. police department and rewrite a directive concerning local cooperation with immigration authorities. The agreement ensures that D.C. Police Chief Pamela Smith remains in command, after the city sued the Trump administration over an order appointing the DEA administrator as emergency police chief. The court challenged the administration's legal basis for assuming full operational control, prompting a compromise where the federal official will act as an intermediary instead.</p>

          <p>San José has announced the completion of the first accessory dwelling unit (ADU) in California that can be legally sold as a condominium, separate from the main property it accompanies. This development comes a year after the city passed a pioneering law to allow such sales, a move aimed at creating more accessible homeownership opportunities. Officials hope this new type of "starter home" will be replicated across the state to help address the housing crisis. ADUs, or "granny flats," have become increasingly popular and now account for about one-fifth of California's new housing growth.</p>

          <p>Arnald Gabriel, a 100-year-old U.S. Air Force veteran and former conductor, has honored a contract he signed over two decades ago to conduct the Wheaton Municipal Band on his 100th birthday. Due to declining health, Gabriel could not travel to Illinois, but he fulfilled his commitment by conducting the band remotely from his home in Virginia. The contract was originally drawn up as a hopeful gesture by the band's current conductor, Bruce Moss, in the early 2000s. Gabriel, who believes one's word is their bond, led the musicians perfectly, demonstrating his enduring dedication to his promise.</p>

          <h2>New Study Suggests Salton Sea Shoreline Is Not the Primary Source of Regional Air Pollution</h2>

          <p>A new report indicates that dust from the exposed shoreline of the Salton Sea contributes less than 1% of the small particle air pollution in California's Coachella and Imperial valleys. For years, dust control projects at the sea have been the focus of efforts to combat high rates of asthma and respiratory illness in the region. The study's authors suggest that since pollution comes from numerous sources like agriculture and diesel exhaust, a more effective strategy may be to focus on protecting people where they are exposed, such as by providing air filters for homes and schools.</p>

          <p>British Member of Parliament Afzal Khan has resigned from his role as a trade envoy to Turkey after facing criticism for a personal visit to the self-declared Turkish Republic of Northern Cyprus. The UK does not officially recognize the territory, and his meeting with Turkish-Cypriot leader Ersin Tatar was condemned by the Cypriot government. Khan stated the trip was paid for personally to visit family and was unrelated to his official duties. However, he chose to step down to avoid distracting from the government's work on securing trade deals.</p>

          <h2>Indian Clinical Trials Indicate Mangoes May Benefit People with Type 2 Diabetes</h2>

          <p>Recent clinical trials in India are challenging the conventional wisdom that people with diabetes should avoid mangoes. The studies found that consuming a controlled amount of mango in place of other carbohydrates, like bread, actually improved several key metabolic health markers. Participants with type 2 diabetes showed better fasting glucose levels, reduced insulin resistance, and smaller post-meal blood sugar fluctuations. Researchers emphasize that the key is moderation, suggesting that mangoes can be part of a prescribed diet without being detrimental and may even offer benefits when consumed responsibly.</p>

          <h2>New Mural in Redondo Beach Depicts Kobe Bryant in a Dodgers Jersey, Sparking Conversation</h2>

          <p>A new mural celebrating the Dodgers' 2024 World Series championship has generated discussion for its unique tribute to Kobe Bryant. The artwork, located in Redondo Beach, portrays the iconic image of Bryant celebrating, but alters his Lakers jersey to a Dodgers one. The artist, Gustavo Zermeño Jr., explained that the choice was made to honor Bryant's "Mamba mentality" while keeping with the mural's Dodgers theme, as the restaurant chain it adorns features a Kobe mural at each location. While some fans have questioned the change, others see it as a fitting tribute to a Los Angeles icon who supported all the city's teams.</p>
