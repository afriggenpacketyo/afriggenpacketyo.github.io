        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>A new genetic study has traced the origins of Indigenous Americans to migrants from modern-day Russia who arrived in the Americas between 20,000 and 30,000 years ago. The study, published in Science, suggests that the languages and traditions of Indigenous groups can be traced back to these early settlers. Researchers sequenced the genomes of over 1,500 individuals from 139 ethnic groups in Eurasia and the Americas, revealing genetic variations that provide insights into population history, migration, and adaptation. The findings corroborate existing archaeological evidence and highlight the genetic diversity within Indigenous groups, including adaptations to extreme environments.</p>

          <p>The Supreme Court has blocked the Trump administration from deporting a group of Venezuelan migrants accused of being members of a violent gang under a centuries-old wartime law. The ruling indicated that a majority of the justices were skeptical of whether the migrants had been afforded enough due process protections. The justices sent the case back to an appeals court to examine claims by the migrants that they could not be legally deported under the Alien Enemies Act, and to consider how much notice the government should be required to provide migrants so they have an opportunity to challenge their deportations.</p>
