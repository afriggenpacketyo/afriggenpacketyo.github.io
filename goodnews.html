          <p>Australia's cricket team defeated the West Indies by 176 runs to complete a 3-0 series sweep in Jamaica. The West Indies were bowled out for just 27 runs, the second-lowest total in Test cricket history and their worst since 1955. Australian pace bowler Mitchell Starc was instrumental in the victory, taking six wickets for nine runs in his 100th Test match. His performance included the fastest five-wicket haul ever recorded in Test cricket, contributing to the decisive win.</p>

          <p>The Trump administration announced a new plan to supply Ukraine with advanced weaponry through NATO member countries, who will purchase the arms from the U.S. and then transfer them to Kyiv. President Trump stated that "top-of-the-line weapons" worth billions would be quickly sent to support Ukraine's defense against Russia. Concurrently, he threatened to impose 100% secondary tariffs on any country trading with Russia if a peace deal is not reached within 50 days. The move aims to bolster Ukraine's military capabilities while shifting the financial burden to European allies.</p>

          <p>The U.S. dairy industry has voluntarily committed to removing synthetic dyes from ice cream, an announcement supported by the Trump administration. Health Secretary Robert F. Kennedy Jr. highlighted the move as part of a broader effort to eliminate harmful chemicals from food. Over 40 ice cream companies have agreed to the change, and the FDA has approved a new plant-based blue dye derived from gardenias. This industry-led initiative aligns with the administration's pattern of favoring voluntary agreements over regulations.</p>

          <p>The city of San Francisco is rolling out Microsoft's Copilot generative AI for its 30,000 government workers, including nurses and social workers. Mayor Daniel Lurie announced the initiative, positioning the city as a leader in leveraging AI to improve public services and efficiency. The move follows a successful six-month pilot program where AI tools reportedly saved employees up to five hours per week on administrative tasks. The city will use the technology, powered by OpenAI's GPT-4o, at no additional cost under its existing Microsoft license.</p>

          <p>Reddit is introducing mandatory age verification for UK users attempting to access mature content, in order to comply with the country's new Online Safety Act. Starting July 14, users will need to confirm they are over 18 using a third-party service, Persona, which will verify age via a selfie or government ID. The platform stated it will not store the photo, only the user's verification status and date of birth. This move comes ahead of the July 25 enforcement date for the new rules, with UK regulator Ofcom expecting other platforms to follow suit or face significant fines.</p>

          <p>President Trump's pledge to facilitate new weapons for Ukraine, funded by NATO allies, represents a major development in his administration's policy toward the conflict. This move ensures that vital U.S. military equipment, potentially including Patriot air defense systems, can continue to flow to Kyiv without direct American financing. The deal is seen as a political victory for NATO's Mark Rutte, who helped broker the arrangement. While the plan provides a crucial lifeline for Ukraine, the accompanying 50-day deadline for a ceasefire before tariffs are imposed on Russia's trade partners adds a layer of uncertainty to the new strategy.</p>
