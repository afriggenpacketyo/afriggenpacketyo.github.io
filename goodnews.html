          <p>President Trump announced a delay in imposing 50% tariffs on all imports from the European Union until July 9, providing more time for trade negotiations. This decision follows Trump's frustration with the EU's slow trade concession offers during a 90-day negotiation window. The initial tariff threat raised concerns about an economically destabilizing trade war with one of the world's largest economies. Trump's move injects uncertainty into the global economy, as economists warn that tariffs and related uncertainty are slowing business investment and disrupting supply chains.

          <p>China's ambassador to Australia has criticized the Australian government's plan to end a Chinese firm's control of the Darwin Port, calling the move "questionable." The ambassador stated that Landbridge Group, the Chinese company, has made significant investments in the port and contributed to the local economy. He argued that it is ethically questionable to reclaim the port once it becomes profitable after initially leasing it when it was unprofitable. The ambassador expressed hope that Australia would view the project objectively and foster mutual trust between the two countries.</p>

Hong Kong universities are offering facilitation measures to safeguard the rights of students and scholars. This initiative aims to capitalize on the potential boon for foreign institutions looking to attract talent, as Harvard faces challenges to its competitiveness.</p>

          <h2>Sleep Aids Brain Repair by Clearing Free Radicals</h2>

          <p>A Chinese study reveals that sleep helps the brain clear harmful oxygen-derived free radicals that accumulate during wakefulness. The research found that hydrogen peroxide (H‚ÇÇO‚ÇÇ), a reactive by-product of metabolism, acts as a molecular signal to trigger sleep and restore balance in the brain. Excess buildup of free radicals disrupts sleep quality and sparks inflammation, providing insights into age-related insomnia and degenerative conditions. The study opens pathways for therapies targeting oxidative stress to combat sleep disorders, identifying molecular changes in the brain during sleep.</p>

          <h2>Memorial Day's Original Meaning in Times of Crisis</h2>

          <p>The author reflects on the original meaning of Memorial Day, inspired by Frederick Douglass's Decoration Day address, emphasizing remembrance of the purposes for which soldiers died, particularly the preservation of democracy. Drawing parallels to the Civil War era, the essay argues that democracy is once again under threat from autocratic leaders and internal challenges to the rule of law. The author urges readers to honor the sacrifices of those who fought to preserve the Union by actively upholding the principles of freedom and democracy in the face of contemporary threats.</p>
