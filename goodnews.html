          <p>Patricia Krenwinkel, a 77-year-old former member of the Manson family, has been recommended for parole after being convicted of seven counts of murder in 1971. A California panel determined that Krenwinkel, who was part of the infamous Manson crew, poses a minimal risk of reoffending if released. This recommendation marks a significant step in her potential release after decades of incarceration. The decision reflects the panel's assessment of her rehabilitation and current risk level.</p>

          <p>Kesha replaced the cover art for her single "Delusional" after facing criticism for initially using an AI-generated image, explaining that she wanted to highlight the undervaluation of artists. The new cover features a photo of Kesha taken by Brendan Walter, and she credited her "incredible team of humans" for their work. Kesha emphasized the importance of living in alignment with her integrity and recognized that AI should be used as a tool, not a replacement.

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>The sale of single-use disposable vapes is now prohibited across the UK, aiming to safeguard children's health and protect the environment. While shops can still sell rechargeable or refillable devices, the ban targets disposable vapes, which have been identified as a key factor in the rise of youth vaping. Retailers violating the ban in England and Wales could face fines, while health experts emphasize the need for further regulation to address youth vaping. Vaping is considered less harmful than smoking, but long-term risks are still unknown, according to the NHS.</p>

          <p>The FDA approved Moderna's new COVID-19 vaccine, mNexspike, for adults 65 and older and those 12-64 with health conditions, but is not a replacement for the company's existing shot. This vaccine requires a lower dose, refining its immune target and adding a new tool to help protect people at high risk. The approval is based on a study comparing the new low-dose vaccine with Moderna's existing vaccine, which found the new vaccine was safe and at least as effective. The approval also comes as the CDC changes its recommendation to children for COVID-19 vaccine under Health Secretary Robert F. Kennedy Jr.'s directive.</p>
