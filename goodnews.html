        </div>
        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Denmark has substantially lowered its 2025 economic growth forecast to 1.4% from an earlier 3%, largely due to a slowdown in the pharmaceutical sector, particularly concerning Novo Nordisk. The economy ministry highlighted increased competition in the weight loss drug market, a significant drop in U.S. exports after a late 2024 surge, and the lingering uncertainty from U.S. tariffs as primary contributors to this revised outlook. Despite the downward adjustment, the ministry maintains that Denmark's economy remains robust, characterized by high employment rates and an inflation forecast below 2%. This re-evaluation underscores the profound impact of global market dynamics and trade policies on national economic projections, especially for export-dependent sectors like pharmaceuticals.

          <p>Tottenham Hotspur is reportedly close to securing a 60 million euro (£51.8 million) deal for RB Leipzig attacker Xavi Simons, with the Netherlands international having already completed his medical in England. The 22-year-old, a product of Barcelona's La Masia academy, is expected to finalize the transfer within 24 hours, adding to Spurs' summer acquisitions. Simons previously impressed during loan spells at PSV and Leipzig, where he scored 22 goals and provided 24 assists in 78 games. This move highlights the continued high demand for young talent in European football, with Spurs aiming to bolster their attacking options.</p>

          <p>Starting January next year, all young children in England and Wales will be offered a free chickenpox vaccine through the NHS, administered as two doses at 12 and 18 months, combined with the MMR jab. This initiative aims to protect youngsters from severe complications, reduce lost income from parents taking time off work, and is supported by the Joint Committee on Vaccination and Immunisation. While the UK has lagged behind other countries in offering this jab, experts now dismiss previous concerns about increased shingles cases. A catch-up campaign for slightly older children is also planned, with Scotland and Northern Ireland expected to follow suit.</p>

          <p>Manchester United has turned down midfielder Kobbie Mainoo's request to leave the club on loan, signaling their high valuation of the 20-year-old and desire for him to compete for a first-team spot. Mainoo, who played a full match in a recent EFL Cup defeat but was an unused substitute in Premier League games, is reportedly concerned about his playing time. Head coach Ruben Amorim views him in direct competition with captain Bruno Fernandes for an advanced midfield role, a situation that presents a challenge for the young England international. Despite his contract running until 2027, negotiations for an extension have stalled amidst these developments.</p>

This meeting underscored the leaders' commitment to their partnership as central to Europe's future, despite a political crisis in France. Concurrently, Germany's foreign minister met counterparts in Copenhagen to bolster support for Ukraine following recent heavy Russian airstrikes and discuss new EU measures against Russia. Domestically, Germany also advised its citizens to leave Iran due to potential retaliation over triggered UN sanctions, while reports indicated most German hospitals are in financial trouble and the average retirement age has climbed.</p>

          <p>YouTube and Fox have successfully reached a new distribution agreement, ensuring that Fox News, Fox Sports, and other Fox channels will remain available on YouTube TV. The deal follows intense negotiations and a short-term extension that averted a potential blackout for millions of subscribers. YouTube, owned by Alphabet, had previously stated that Fox was demanding significantly higher payments than comparable content partners. The resolution prevents disruptions to major sporting events, including anticipated college football and the upcoming NFL season, much to the relief of fans and the satisfaction of FCC chair Brendan Carr.</p>

          <p>British tennis player Jacob Fearnley exited the US Open after a straight-sets loss to Alexander Zverev, reflecting on the valuable lessons learned, including the mind games employed by top players. Fearnley noted Zverev's deliberate tardiness before the match, a tactic he also experienced with Novak Djokovic, suggesting it's a common practice among elite competitors. Despite showing flashes of talent, Fearnley struggled with consistency and double faults, acknowledging the psychological challenges of playing on big stages against seasoned opponents. As a professional for just 14 months, he views this experience as crucial for addressing shortcomings and developing his game.</p>

          <p>A delegation of senior U.S. Senators, led by Republican Roger Wicker, has arrived in Taiwan to underscore the long-standing partnership and security agreement between the two nations. The visit, occurring as both Taiwan and China seek trade deals with the U.S., aims to assess the island's defense needs, with Wicker vowing to enhance provisions for Taiwan in the upcoming National Defense Authorization Act. Beijing, which claims Taiwan as its territory, firmly opposes such official exchanges, condemning Washington and Taipei's growing relations. The trip also addresses concerns in Taipei regarding the Trump administration's willingness to defend the island against potential invasion.</p>

          <p>Indian Prime Minister Narendra Modi's visit to China for the Shanghai Cooperation Organization summit marks his first in seven years, signaling a potential thaw in relations strained by past border clashes and economic imbalances. Despite deep-seated suspicion in India, economic challenges like U.S. tariffs are pushing both nations towards reluctant cooperation. India faces a widening trade deficit with China and relies heavily on Chinese raw materials and components for key industries, including EVs. While the summit might not resolve long-standing disputes or China's close ties with Pakistan, Modi's presence suggests a willingness to find common ground amidst shifting global supply chains and a need for market access.</p>

The endeavor comes as Roscosmos faces significant funding shortages and has lost 180 billion rubles since Russia's 2022 invasion of Ukraine, leading to severed ties with the European Space Agency.
