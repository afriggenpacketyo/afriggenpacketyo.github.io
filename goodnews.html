          <p>The June CNBC Fed Survey reveals that respondents anticipate weaker economic growth and higher inflation compared to earlier forecasts, with 71% expressing uncertainty about trade policy. Despite a decrease in the probability of a recession to 38%, GDP growth is projected to be only 1.13%. While 54% of respondents expect a new trade deal with China within five months, concerns remain about tariffs causing sustained inflation. The Federal Reserve is expected to maintain current rates at the June meeting and implement two rate cuts later in the year, with a potential funds rate of 3.9% by year-end.

These accounts, similar to 529 college savings plans, offer tax-deferred growth and qualified withdrawals taxed as long-term capital gains. Eligibility requires the child to be a U.S. citizen at birth and both parents to have Social Security numbers. While proponents highlight wealth-building opportunities, some experts argue that universal savings accounts would be a simpler alternative. (not investment advice)</p>
