          <h2>Newcastle United Initiates Negotiations with Southampton for Goalkeeper Aaron Ramsdale</h2>
          <div class="timestamp">2025-07-28 10:12:34 EDT</div>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Premier League club Newcastle United has started discussions with Southampton to acquire England international goalkeeper Aaron Ramsdale. The move could be either a loan or a permanent transfer, though the Championship club reportedly prefers a sale. This development follows Newcastle's recent attempt to sign James Trafford, which was thwarted when Manchester City activated a matching rights clause. The potential signing would reunite Ramsdale with his former manager Eddie Howe and provide competition for Newcastle's current first-choice keeper, Nick Pope, as the club prepares for Champions League football.</p>

          <h2>Rare 4,000-Year-Old Handprint Discovered on Ancient Egyptian 'Soul House'</h2>
          <div class="timestamp">2025-07-28 10:03:30 EDT</div>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Researchers at Cambridge University have found a remarkably complete 4,000-year-old handprint on an ancient Egyptian artifact. The print was discovered pressed into the clay of a "soul house," a ceramic model of a building placed in tombs during the Middle Kingdom period (2055-1650 B.C.E.). Curators have described the discovery as "rare and exciting," believing the print was left by the craftsperson who made the object before the clay dried. The soul house, along with its unique human touch from the past, will be a featured item in an upcoming exhibition at the Fitzwilliam Museum.</p>

While EU leaders hailed the deal for bringing "stability," it has drawn sharp criticism from some European political and business figures who argue Brussels conceded too much. Critics, like Hungarian Prime Minister Viktor Orban and French Prime Minister Francois Bayrou, labeled the deal a "submission" and "disaster," noting the EU failed to secure a lower 10% rate.

The arrival of stars like Caitlin Clark has accelerated the league's popularity, culminating in a new media rights deal valued at over $2 billion. Despite this boom, players currently receive less than 10% of the league's total revenue, a stark contrast to the roughly 50% share seen in the NBA and other major male sports leagues. As the players' union negotiates a new collective bargaining agreement, the debate centers on whether their compensation should reflect the league's massive new value.</p>

          <p>According to Harvard associate professor Alison Wood Brooks, a simple yet powerful way to become more influential and likeable at work is to practice active listening. This involves more than just hearing; it requires demonstrating engagement by asking thoughtful follow-up questions or paraphrasing what the other person has said. This technique, which Brooks calls a "superhero move," shows competence, builds trust, and demonstrates empathy, making you more likeable to colleagues and managers. Research confirms that people who ask more questions are perceived more positively, which can correlate with better job performance reviews.</p>
