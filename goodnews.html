          <p>McDonald's is bringing back the Snack Wrap to its U.S. menus starting July 10, 2025, after a nine-year absence. The wrap, consisting of a tortilla filled with chicken, lettuce, and cheese, was discontinued in 2016 due to kitchen complexity. The revived Snack Wrap will feature fried chicken and come in Ranch and Spicy flavors, simplified for faster service. McDonald's acknowledged fan demand on social media and thanked them for resurrecting the menu item.</p>

          <p>Milwaukee Bucks' Damian Lillard playfully responded to teammate Kyle Kuzma's boxing challenge on social media.

Lillard is currently recovering from Achilles surgery, adding a layer of jest to the playful exchange between the teammates. The event is light-hearted and friendly.</p>

          <p>The USDA has put its demand for sensitive data on food stamp recipients on hold after a lawsuit alleged the directive violated privacy laws. The agency had requested states turn over data of SNAP recipients, including names, birth dates, and Social Security numbers. The USDA official said the agency has not yet begun collecting the personal data and instructed EBT Processors to refrain from sending any data until procedural steps were completed. This delay is a temporary win for privacy advocates.</p>
