          <h2>Singapore's Inflation Rate Drops to 0.6% in July, Lowest Since Early 2021</h2>
          <div class="timestamp">2025-08-25 01:25:21 EDT</div>
        </div>
        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Singapore's inflation rate unexpectedly eased to 0.6% in July, marking its lowest point since January 2021 and falling below economists' forecasts. Core inflation, excluding private transport and accommodation, also dipped to 0.5%, driven by reduced prices in retail, other goods, electricity, and gas. The Monetary Authority of Singapore (MAS) anticipates continued moderate inflation in the near term, citing easing global crude oil prices and contained food commodity price hikes. Domestically, slower nominal wage growth and productivity increases are expected to contribute to a moderation in unit labor costs. This trend supports the central bank's earlier policy easing measures implemented this year to address weaker economic growth projections amidst a challenging global trade environment, which has placed Singapore's economy on a path of slower growth.</p>

Dowman's debut included winning a penalty, showcasing his significant potential and generating widespread excitement. Rooney emphasized the importance of enjoying the journey and making the most of the experience, predicting a massive and bright future for the young winger who is already a talking point in the football world.</p>

          <p>Shares in China's state-backed Dongfeng Motor Group surged to an eight-year high after its parent company announced plans to take the automaker private in a deal reportedly valued at $7 billion. The Wuhan-based firm is also preparing to spin off and list its electric-vehicle unit, VOYAH, in Hong Kong. This move follows a State Council directive for restructuring major state-owned carmakers to enhance competitiveness. Despite a challenging industry landscape and a nearly 15% drop in total vehicle deliveries, sales of pure electric and plug-in hybrid models climbed 33%, with the VOYAH series seeing an 84.8% increase.</p>

          <p>Hong Kong's Hang Seng Index surged over 2% on Monday, nearing a four-year peak, leading an Asia-wide market rally that saw strong gains across mainland China, Taiwan, South Korea, Japan, and Australia. The Hong Kong market's performance was primarily fueled by a robust tech sector boost, with companies like Nio and semiconductor manufacturer ASMPT seeing significant increases, and Chinese property developers also contributing. This widespread positive market reaction follows Federal Reserve Chair Jerome Powell's dovish remarks at Jackson Hole, signaling potential interest rate easing next month. Analysts suggest maturing time deposits could shift into equities, sustaining momentum and potentially triggering capital rotation from the U.S. to China, further driving recent equity gains.</p>

          <p>Britain's national pastime of complaining about the weather is addressed with an interactive tool, "Cooler Than Me?" The feature allows users to compare their local weather forecast with cities across the world, offering a light-hearted way to explore global climates. This playful approach helps determine if the sun truly shines brighter elsewhere or if the UK's "green and pleasant land" holds its own against international locales. The tool aims to engage users with real-time weather data and perhaps even inspire them to become "the BBC's next star meteorologist" by providing a fun, comparative perspective on global climates, encouraging a deeper look at meteorological patterns.</p>

          <p>China's central bank set the yuan's daily reference rate against the U.S. dollar at its strongest level in over nine months, reaching 7.1161 per dollar. This significant upward adjustment follows Federal Reserve Chair Jerome Powell's dovish remarks at the Jackson Hole conference, which increased bets on a September interest rate cut by the Fed. The offshore yuan also climbed to its strongest level since late July, reflecting the impact of the U.S. dollar index falling to a four-week low. Analysts now see a September Fed rate cut as "almost locked in," with focus shifting to the scale and pace of future easing. (not investment advice)</p>

Developed in collaboration with Tsinghua University and the Aerospace Information Research Institute, this innovative system resembles an airship and is designed to provide power solutions for remote locations and disaster zones where conventional power supplies are inadequate or unavailable. An earlier, smaller iteration, a 30-meter-long white airship, successfully ascended to an altitude of 1,000 meters and transmitted electricity to the ground in January, proving the technology's feasibility at a smaller scale. This advancement positions China at the forefront of novel wind energy solutions.</p>

This next-generation "offer and order management" technology aims to offer more personalized and flexible booking processes, enabling easier changes and refunds, and allowing airlines to sell hotels, car rentals, and other services directly.

          <p>Hong Kong-listed shares of Chinese electric carmaker Nio surged as much as 14.84% on Monday, extending a seven-session rally, with its U.S.-listed shares also climbing significantly. This strong performance follows the company's unveiling of its latest ES8 SUV, priced at 308,800 yuan ($43,000) under a battery subscription plan, making it one of Nio's most affordable models compared to its premium offerings. The subscription plan lowers upfront costs and allows battery swaps or upgrades, with deliveries for the new ES8 set to begin in late September. Nio, traditionally targeting the high-end market, is now launching cheaper brands like Onvo and Firefly to capture a broader customer base in China's intensifying EV sector.</p>

          <p>Jim Cramer outlines his "Monday playbook" following a significant stock market rally, driven by Federal Reserve Chair Jerome Powell's dovish signals on interest rate cuts. He attributes the Fed's shift to a dramatic deceleration in hiring, which outweighed concerns about tariffs. Cramer notes that the market's previous downward trend was a miscalculation by "too-smart-for-school hedge funds" who underestimated Powell's commitment to data. He advises focusing on housing, mergers and acquisitions, and IPOs as bullish narratives, while cautioning against enterprise software and certain auto/pharma stocks. Cramer also discusses the Intel saga and the president's influence on the market, predicting continued volatility but overall market strength. (not investment advice)</p>
