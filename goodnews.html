          <p>The Japanese government is launching offshore "blue carbon" research to capture carbon dioxide using cultivated sea plants and store it in the deep sea, aiming to accelerate decarbonization efforts. The government hopes marine vegetation like mangroves and kelp will play a key role in mitigating climate change due to their high CO2 absorption capacity. The Environment Ministry will commission studies to assess the environmental impact of such projects, with a goal to capture 1 million tons of CO2 by fiscal 2035 and 2 million tons by fiscal 2040. This initiative reflects Japan's commitment to achieving net-zero emissions by 2050.</p>

          <p>Shares of Contemporary Amperex Technology (CATL), the world's largest battery manufacturer, jumped over 18% in their Hong Kong trading debut, driven by investor confidence in the company's potential to capitalize on the electric vehicle boom. CATL's IPO raised HK$35.7 billion ($4.6 billion), reportedly making it the largest offering this year globally. The company plans to use 90% of the funds to build a factory in Hungary, aimed at supplying batteries to European automotive clients like Stellantis, BMW, and Volkswagen. The company's expansion into Europe comes amid increased scrutiny from the U.S. and EU, which have placed punitive tariffs on EVs made in China.</p>
