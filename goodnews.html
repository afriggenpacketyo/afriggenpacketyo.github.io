          <p>This article discusses the efforts to conserve jaguars in Sonora, Mexico, by changing their image from threats to valuable ecosystem members. The Northern Jaguar Project (NJP) compensates ranchers for jaguar sightings on their land, creating a financial incentive for protecting the cats and their prey. This program, called Viviendo con Felinos, has expanded the protected area for jaguars and shifted local attitudes toward coexistence. The article highlights the cultural shift among ranchers who now appreciate the role of jaguars in the ecosystem, contributing to the stability, if not growth, of the jaguar population in the region.</p>

          <p>UK health officials have detected West Nile virus in UK mosquitoes for the first time, though they emphasize the risk to the general public remains very low. Fragments of the virus were found in mosquitoes collected in Nottinghamshire in 2023. While the virus can cause serious illness in some individuals, most infected people experience minor or no symptoms. Health authorities attribute the detection to climate change and other factors pushing mosquito-borne diseases further north. There have been no human cases of West Nile virus acquired within the UK to date.</p>

          <p>Major American retailers are facing challenges as they navigate the financial impact of President Trump's tariffs while attempting to avoid public conflict with the White House and alienating customers. Companies like Target and Home Depot are trying to mitigate tariff effects through supplier negotiations and product selection adjustments, rather than broad price increases. This follows warnings from Walmart about potential price hikes and criticism faced by Amazon and Mattel for considering tariff-related cost adjustments. The situation highlights the delicate balance retailers must strike between managing costs and maintaining customer loyalty amid ongoing trade tensions.</p>

          <p>Senate Republicans are attempting to overturn California's law phasing out gas-powered vehicles by 2035, utilizing the Congressional Review Act, which allows Congress to strike down regulations with a simple majority. Democrats argue this move undermines the Senate filibuster and prioritizes the oil industry over public health. Republicans contend they are protecting the Senate's power and preventing a nationwide electric vehicle mandate. The House has already voted to overturn the waivers, setting up a contentious battle in the Senate over environmental policy and Senate rules.</p>
