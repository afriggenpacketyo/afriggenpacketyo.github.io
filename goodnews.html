          <p>Susan Stamberg, celebrated as one of NPR's "founding mothers," has passed away at 87, leaving an indelible legacy on public radio and journalism. She began her career at NPR cutting tape, a pioneering move for women in broadcasting at a time when commercial networks rarely hired them, before becoming a distinguished host of flagship programs like All Things Considered and Weekend Edition. Colleagues fondly remember her as a tough, authentic, and insightful storyteller who passionately explored culture, science, and the human side of politics with remarkable grace. Her enduring influence is symbolically honored at NPR's headquarters, where her recorded voice continues to announce elevator floors, serving as a constant reminder of her foundational contribution to the network.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>A federal appeals court has upheld its block on President Trump's deployment of National Guard troops in the Chicago area, though the service members can remain under federal control. The 7th Circuit Court of Appeals unanimously determined that the Trump administration presented "insufficient evidence" to justify federalizing the Guard under Title 10, which requires a "rebellion or danger of a rebellion" or an inability of regular forces to execute laws. This ruling comes after Illinois and Chicago sued, arguing the deployment was unlawful in response to immigration protests. The court found that while demonstrations occurred, they did not impede federal officers' ability to perform their duties.</p>

          <p>Canadian Prime Minister Mark Carney anticipates meeting with senior Chinese leaders soon, signaling a broader re-engagement with Beijing, but has not committed to lifting tariffs on Chinese electric vehicles (EVs). Ottawa is meticulously evaluating the broader implications of such a decision, carefully considering its complex relationship with the United States and ongoing trade negotiations. China's ambassador has explicitly linked the removal of canola duties to Canada lifting its EV tariffs, creating a significant economic and political dilemma between the interests of western Canadian canola producers and Ontario's vital auto sector. Carney's administration faces the delicate challenge of navigating a fine diplomatic balance between these two major global economic powers.</p>

          <h2>Trump Administration Announces Major Reductions in IVF Drug Costs</h2>
          <div class="timestamp">2025-10-16 17:03:21 EDT</div>
        </div>
        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>President Trump announced significant reductions in the cost of in vitro fertilization (IVF) drugs, attributing the decrease to new price negotiations with EMD Serono, a major fertility drug manufacturer. The administration projects a 73% drop in the per-cycle cost of these drugs, which are considerably more expensive in the U.S. compared to global averages. This effort also encourages employers to offer supplemental fertility insurance, aiming to make IVF more accessible for millions of Americans. However, this move does not fully deliver on Trump's earlier campaign promise for complete IVF coverage by insurance or the federal government, and the total impact on overall IVF cycle costs is still being assessed.

          <h2>Lewis Hamilton Calls Christian Horner to Ferrari Rumors 'Distracting'</h2>

          <p>Lewis Hamilton, the acclaimed Formula 1 driver, has labeled recent reports linking Christian Horner to a potential future team principal role at Ferrari as "distracting." Horner, who was dismissed from his Red Bull team principal position in July after a period of competitive decline and internal strife, reportedly settled his employment for a substantial 60 million euros. Hamilton explicitly stated he would not "entertain rumors" when pressed about the story's truth or the idea's suitability for Ferrari. This speculation underscores the persistent leadership changes and the intense media scrutiny prevalent within the highly competitive and high-stakes environment of Formula 1 racing, often creating unnecessary noise for drivers.</p>

          <h2>Dietitians Advise Caution on Protein Powder Boom Amidst Whole Food Preference</h2>
          <div class="timestamp">2025-10-16 16:41:29 EDT</div>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>The demand for protein has soared, with 61% of US consumers increasing their intake last year, fueling a booming $114 billion industry heavily promoted by social media influencers. While protein is an essential nutrient vital for building muscles, bones, and supporting hormone health, dietitians warn that "wellness culture" often significantly overestimates daily needs. Experts emphasize that whole foods are the ideal source, as protein powders and supplements are often unnecessary for average exercisers and can contain unsafe levels of lead, as found in a recent Consumer Reports investigation. They strongly advise limiting powder intake to occasional use and prioritizing diverse, nutrient-rich food sources for optimal health.</p>

          <h2>Film Review: "Black Phone 2" Deemed a Dull and Uninspiring Horror Sequel</h2>
          <div class="timestamp">2025-10-16 16:35:13 EDT</div>
        </div>
        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>The film review for "Black Phone 2" critically dismisses the horror sequel as "dreadfully boring" and a "snooze," asserting it utterly fails to come to life or match the impact of its predecessor. Despite the return of Ethan Hawke's masked serial killer, the Grabber, the article finds the plot, primarily set within dream sequences and drawing heavily from "Nightmare on Elm Street," to be monotonously one-note and utterly uninspiring. The review notes the film's surprising piety and Christian themes awkwardly juxtaposed with its violence, concluding that the sequel fails to justify the Grabber's return. The reviewer suggests that this iteration marks the character's last hurrah, hoping for an end to the "drudgery."</p>

          <h2>Apple's AirPods Live Translation Feature Faces Real-World Challenges and Inaccuracies</h2>

        </div>
        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>An article critically examines Apple's new "Live Translation" feature for AirPods, highlighting its significant practical shortcomings in real-world scenarios. The author experienced considerable difficulties with ambient noise, persistent lagging translations, and inaccurate interpretations of Mexican Spanish vocabulary, despite the feature being advertised as "transformational." The AirPods' microphones consistently struggled with background sounds, leading to constant warnings and severely disrupting the flow of natural conversation. The article also questions Apple's optimization for Spain's Spanish over the more prevalent Mexican and Latin American variants, suggesting that the technology, while conceptually promising, currently flattens human communication rather than genuinely enhancing it due to its practical limitations.</p>

          <p>The University of Southern California (USC) has definitively rejected the Trump administration's controversial education compact, which offered priority research funding to universities aligning with a conservative vision for higher education. Interim President Beong-Soo Kim stated that tying research benefits to such an agreement would fundamentally "undermine the same values of free inquiry and academic excellence" that the compact purportedly aims to promote. The compact, also rejected by MIT and Brown, included contentious demands like a specific definition of gender, restricted foreign student enrollment, a tuition freeze, and mandated SAT/ACT scores. California Governor Gavin Newsom had previously threatened to withhold state funding from any university that accepted the compact.</p>
