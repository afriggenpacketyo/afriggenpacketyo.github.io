          <p>President Trump announced that the U.S. will double its tariffs on steel and aluminum imports to 50% to bolster the domestic steel industry and decrease reliance on China. Trump stated that $14 billion would be invested into the area's steel production through a partnership between US Steel and Japan's Nippon Steel, promising no layoffs or outsourcing and a $5,000 bonus for every US steelworker. While a local union member expressed optimism, economists warn that Trump's tariffs have largely led to global economic chaos and worsened relations between the U.S. and other countries, especially China. The announcement comes amid a court battle over the legality of some of Trump's global tariffs, which an appeals court has allowed to continue. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>A commercial truck carrying an estimated 250 million bees overturned in northwestern Washington state, resulting in the release of the insects. Authorities are urging people to avoid the area to prevent swarming, while bee experts are assisting with the clean-up. The goal is to allow the bees to return to their hives and find their queen bee, saving as many as possible. Honeybees play a key role in pollination and food production, pollinating over 100 crops, and their decline due to insecticides, parasites, climate change, and lack of food supply poses a threat to agriculture and food security.</p>

          <p>President Trump lauded Nippon Steel Corp. for its commitment to invest $14 billion in United States Steel Corp. and protect American jobs. Speaking at a U.S. Steel plant in Pennsylvania, Trump called the Japanese company a "great partner" and announced he will raise tariffs on steel imports to 50 percent. Trump emphasized that U.S. Steel will maintain all its existing operating blast furnaces at full capacity for a minimum of 10 years, and that the deal will ensure all U.S. Steel workers keep their jobs and all the company's facilities in the country remain open and thriving. Trump's remarks came after he unexpectedly indicated that Nippon Steel's blocked bid to take over U.S. Steel had been cleared.</p>
