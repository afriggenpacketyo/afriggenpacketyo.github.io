          <h2>Homeland Security Ends Mandatory Shoe Removal for All US Airport Travelers</h2>
          <div class="timestamp">2025-07-08 18:16:09 EDT</div>
        </div>
        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>The Department of Homeland Security has officially ended the mandatory shoe removal policy at all U.S. airport security checkpoints, effective immediately. Secretary Kristi Noem announced that advancements in layered security, including new technology and the implementation of REAL ID, have made the nearly two-decade-old rule obsolete. While most travelers can now keep their shoes on, some individuals may still be asked to remove them for additional screening. The agency is also planning a pilot program for more streamlined checkpoints in the future, further aiming to improve the passenger experience while maintaining security standards.</p>

          <h2>French Intelligence Chief Assesses Recent Strikes "Extremely Delayed" Iran's Nuclear Program</h2>
          <div class="timestamp">2025-07-08 18:15:00 EDT</div>
        </div>
        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>According to France's intelligence chief, Nicolas Lerner, recent American and Israeli strikes on Iranian nuclear facilities have "extremely delayed" Tehran's nuclear program by many months. In his first public remarks on the matter, Lerner stated that each stage of the program was "very seriously damaged." He also noted that while a small portion of Iran's highly enriched uranium was destroyed, the majority remains in the hands of Iranian authorities. The assessment comes as Iran has suspended its cooperation with the International Atomic Energy Agency, limiting international oversight of its remaining nuclear stockpile.</p>

        </div>
        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Brazil and China have signed a memorandum of understanding to study the feasibility of a massive transcontinental railway project. The proposed railway would stretch approximately 4,500 kilometers, connecting Brazil's Atlantic coast with a Pacific port in Peru. If constructed, the corridor could significantly reshape South American trade by shortening shipping times to Asia by up to 12 days compared to routes using the Panama Canal. The agreement currently covers technical, environmental, and economic studies, which are expected to take up to five years to complete for the multi-billion dollar project.</p>

          <p>A recently passed bill, touted as eliminating federal income taxes on Social Security, does not actually repeal the tax but instead introduces a new temporary deduction for seniors. The legislation creates a "bonus" deduction of up to $6,000 for individuals over 65 with incomes below $75,000, and up to $12,000 for eligible couples. While the White House claims this will result in nearly 90% of beneficiaries paying no federal tax on their benefits, policy experts clarify the relief comes from the new deduction, not a change to how benefits themselves are taxed. The deduction is set to expire at the end of 2028. (not investment advice)</p>

The sale is part of a pre-arranged plan announced earlier this year, under which Bezos intends to sell up to 25 million shares through May 2026.

          <p>Researchers have discovered the severed bow of the USS New Orleans, a famed U.S. warship, resting nearly 700 meters deep in the Solomon Islands. The bow was torn off by a Japanese torpedo during the Battle of Tassafaronga in November 1942, an attack that killed over 180 crew members. Despite the catastrophic damage, the remaining crew heroically saved the ship, which was later fitted with a new bow and returned to service. The discovery was made during seafloor mapping operations and confirmed by international experts who identified distinctive features of the wreckage.</p>

          <p>An Iranian woman who has lived in the U.S. for 47 years was released from an ICE detention center following a significant community and political effort. Mandonna "Donna" Kashanian, 64, was suddenly detained at her New Orleans home despite having no criminal record and regularly checking in with immigration authorities for decades. A letter-writing campaign from her neighbors highlighting her community service drew the attention of House Majority Leader Steve Scalise, who intervened with the Trump administration. Her case highlights the precarious situation of many long-term residents without formal legal status amid heightened immigration enforcement.</p>

          <p>With a Federal Reserve meeting approaching at the end of July, savers are being encouraged to strategically lock in high certificate of deposit (CD) rates before a potential shift in the interest rate climate. The article suggests that individuals should carefully calculate how much they can deposit for a specific term to avoid early withdrawal penalties. To find the best returns, savers should shop at online banks, which typically offer higher rates than traditional brick-and-mortar institutions. Once a high-rate CD is found, it's crucial to lock it in promptly to protect earnings against possible future rate cuts. (not investment advice)</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>The new "Superman" movie, directed by James Gunn, reboots the hero as an earnest but somewhat obtuse figure, played by David Corenswet. The film pivots away from recent cynical takes on the character, aiming for a more sincere, if slightly goofy, tone where idealism is "the real punk rock." The plot is described as impatient and crowded, juggling Lex Luthor's schemes, a host of other DC characters, and the director's signature comedic style. While entertaining, the review suggests the film's tone shifts recklessly and struggles to be earnest, resulting in a hero who is more overwhelmed than inspiring.</p>

          <p>A U.S. Department of Justice and FBI review has concluded that Jeffrey Epstein did not possess a so-called "client list" that could implicate high-profile associates in his crimes. The investigation also reaffirmed the official finding that Epstein died by suicide in his jail cell, directly contradicting widespread conspiracy theories about his death. According to the memo, investigators found "no credible evidence" that Epstein blackmailed prominent individuals and uncovered no information that would warrant new investigations into uncharged third parties. The findings were met with skepticism by some who had anticipated major new revelations.</p>
