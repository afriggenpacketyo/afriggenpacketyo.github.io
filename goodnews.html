          <h2>Japan Implements Revised Rice Stock Sales to Lower Prices</h2>
          <div class="timestamp">2025-05-26 09:39:00 EDT</div>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Japan has initiated direct contract sales of government rice stockpiles to major retailers, aiming to reduce soaring rice prices. Farm Minister Shinjiro Koizumi seeks to lower prices to around 2,000 yen per 5 kilograms by early June, releasing rice produced in 2021 and 2022. This move bypasses the auction system, which was seen as contributing to price increases, and includes online sales considerations to broaden distribution. The agriculture ministry has also established a special response team to address high rice price issues, reflecting public concern over rising costs.</p>

          <p>Retail investors have successfully bought the dip in the stock market, earning significant returns as institutional investors reduced their exposure. Despite $74 billion flowing out of equity mutual funds and ETFs in April, retail investors have poured over $50 billion into equities since April 8, driving a rapid market rebound. Analysts suggest retail investors benefit from a longer time horizon compared to institutional investors, who often face pressure to meet short-term benchmarks. Data indicates that investors who bought the dip between April 3 and May 9 earned a nearly 12% return (not investment advice).</p>

        </div>
        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>When hiring a roofing company, it's important to know whether they use in-house crews or subcontractors. In-house crews are full-time employees, often undergoing background checks and training, which can ensure consistent quality and accountability. Subcontractors offer flexibility and potentially lower costs, but the quality of work can vary. Reputable companies using subcontractors should carefully screen and maintain long-standing relationships with their crews. The choice depends on individual priorities, such as budget, timeline, and the importance of knowing who is performing the work.</p>

          <p>Sexual orientation is diverse and not a choice, developing during puberty through a combination of biological and psychosocial factors. Experts say that no one chooses their sexual orientation, and it is stable for life. Same-sex orientation accounts for approximately 3-5% of the population across cultures. Despite increasing acceptance, homosexuality remains punishable in many countries, highlighting the need for unprejudiced debate and support for individuals. Hormones and social influences play a role, but there is no single cause or "homosexuality gene."</p>
