          <p>The San Diego County Water Authority and the Metropolitan Water District of Southern California have settled a 15-year legal battle over water costs. The agreement establishes a fixed price for delivering water supplies and allows the Water Authority to sell supplies to MWD or other member agencies. Leaders from both agencies emphasized that ending the litigation will enable greater collaboration and improve their finances. This resolution is expected to provide greater fiscal certainty and new opportunities to move water to communities that need it most.</p>

          <h2>Trump Administration Reverses Some USDA Office Closures in California</h2>
          <div class="timestamp">2025-06-02 17:20:31 EDT</div>

          <p>The Trump administration has reversed its decision to close eight California outposts of the U.S. Department of Agriculture (USDA), following pressure from Democratic lawmakers. The lawmakers argued that the closures would severely hamper USDA's ability to support farmers imperative to California's agricultural success. The reversal excludes the office in Mt. Shasta, which remains under discussion, and the USDA maintains its commitment to optimizing building capacity and reducing inefficiencies. This decision reflects the importance of these offices to California's agricultural sector and the potential impact of their closure on farmers and rural communities.</p>
