        </div>
        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>The Food and Drug Administration will permit use of Covid vaccines by adults over 65 and those with certain medical conditions in the fall, but may require additional studies before approving the shots for healthy Americans younger than 65. The FDA will demand robust, gold-standard data on persons at low risk. The new recommendations mark a departure from the previous policy of offering annual Covid shots to everyone 6 months and older. Some experts worry the new criteria will deny many people who want to be vaccinated, potentially leading to more unnecessary deaths.</p>

          <p>President Donald Trump announced plans for the "Golden Dome" missile defense shield, aiming to expand the country's air defense system by the end of his term. The ambitious project, intended to protect against catastrophic attacks, faces logistical and financial hurdles. Experts estimate the project could cost far more than Trump's proposed $175 billion, with the Congressional Budget Office suggesting it could reach $542 billion. The system is designed to intercept missiles from any location, including space, and is being overseen by Gen. Michael Guetlein of the Space Force.</p>

          <p>Toyota announced that the top-selling RAV4 SUV in the United States will be exclusively offered as a hybrid model starting in 2026. This redesign marks the first time the RAV4 will eliminate a traditional gas engine, opting for hybrid and plug-in hybrid options. The decision is driven by growing customer demand and the popularity of hybrid models, with electrified vehicle sales accounting for 43.1% of Toyota's U.S. sales in 2024. Despite tariffs imposed by President Trump on imported vehicles and auto parts, Toyota aims to continue growing its hybrid offerings.</p>

          <p>Scientists predict that the Axial Seamount, an underwater volcano located 300 miles off the Oregon coast, is likely to erupt later this year. The volcano, which last erupted in 2015, is showing signs of increased activity, but scientists say the eruption poses no danger to people on land. The first sign of an eruption will be a sharp increase in the number of earthquakes around the volcano, caused by magma moving toward the surface. Scientists will continue to monitor the volcano using the Regional Cabled Array.</p>

          <p>George Wendt, best known for his role as Norm Peterson on the hit sitcom "Cheers," has died at the age of 76. Wendt, a Chicago native, earned six consecutive Emmy nominations for his portrayal of the beer-quaffing barfly. The article highlights Wendt's career, from his start sweeping floors at Second City to becoming a beloved television personality. On the surface, there was nothing remarkable about the Norm character, except perhaps for his general indolence and taste for suds, but as a regular guy among regular guys, he was highly relatable to countless fans of the show.</p>

          <p>Taku Eto has resigned as Japan's farm minister following backlash over his remark that he does not buy rice because he receives it from supporters. Prime Minister Shigeru Ishiba has decided to appoint former environment minister Shinjiro Koizumi to replace Eto as agriculture minister. The controversy dealt a fresh setback to Ishiba ahead of a House of Councillors election this summer, with public support for his Cabinet plunging to its lowest level since he took office late last year. Eto's gaffe came shortly after the Ministry of Agriculture, Forestry and Fisheries decided to release additional rice from its emergency stockpiles until July.</p>

Despite the positive results, the company's remaining performance obligation and next-gen security ARR outlook were unchanged, leading to investor disappointment.
