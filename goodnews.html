          <p>Eutelsat shares experienced a significant increase after the European satellite operator revealed a capital raise of 1.35 billion euros, supported by the French state and other investors. The capital increase, along with debt refinancing, aims to bolster Eutelsat's Low Earth Orbit (LEO) capabilities, focusing on business-to-business and business-to-government operations. The French state is set to become Eutelsat's largest shareholder, holding 29.99% of capital and voting rights, followed by India's Bharti Space Limited at 18.7%. Eutelsat has also secured a 10-year deal with the French armed forces for priority-access space resources on its OneWeb LEO satellite constellation, positioning itself as a strategic player in military communications and cyber-resilience. </p>

          <p>MPs are set to decide on the future of a bill that could legalize assisted dying in England and Wales, with a final stage vote in the House of Commons. The Terminally Ill Adults (End of Life) Bill, introduced by Labour MP Kim Leadbeater, proposes allowing terminally ill individuals to end their lives under specific conditions, including being over 18, living in England or Wales, and having a prognosis of fewer than six months to live. The bill has undergone revisions, including replacing the High Court judge approval with a three-person panel and clarifying palliative care options. The Isle of Man passed its Assisted Dying Bill in March 2025, while Jersey is also considering similar legislation.</p>
