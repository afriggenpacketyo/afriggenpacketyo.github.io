          <p>Republican Senator Thom Tillis of North Carolina has emerged as a prominent critic of his party's major spending bill, arguing it breaks President Trump's promise not to cut Medicaid. In a forceful speech, Tillis stated that the legislation would lead to devastating funding cuts in his state, affecting hundreds of thousands of residents. Despite his opposition and retirement announcement, he has assured colleagues he will not surprise or undermine the Republican conference. Tillis claims his analysis, supported by bipartisan and non-partisan state groups, shows a potential $26 billion cut for North Carolina, a figure he says the Trump administration has dismissed without providing contrary evidence.</p>

          <div class="timestamp">2025-06-30 16:29:03 EDT</div>
        </div>
        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>For homeowners with significant equity, a Home Equity Line of Credit (HELOC) presents a timely borrowing option this July due to several favorable conditions. With interest rates on HELOCs having decreased from their recent highs, they offer a more affordable way to access large sums of money compared to other forms of credit. The approval process is often faster than for unsecured loans, as the home serves as collateral, and the variable rates could become even more advantageous with anticipated Federal Reserve rate cuts later this year. A key benefit is the flexibility to draw funds as needed and only pay interest on the amount used, which is particularly useful in the current transitional economy. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>The White House has announced that the U.S. pilots who conducted the recent bombing mission on Iranian nuclear facilities will be honored guests at the upcoming July 4th celebration. The event, hosted by President Trump, will also feature a flyover of B-2 Spirit bombers, the same type of aircraft used in the strikes against Iran's Fordo and Natanz uranium enrichment sites. The operation involved a 36-hour round-trip flight from Missouri and was described by the administration as a major success in setting back Iran's nuclear program. While preliminary intelligence suggested a modest setback, some officials now claim new information indicates the program was delayed by years.</p>

          <p>The Home Depot has announced its intention to acquire GMS, a major distributor of building products, in a deal valued at approximately $4.3 billion. This strategic move is part of Home Depot's broader effort to capture a larger share of the professional contractor market, which provides a more consistent revenue stream than typical consumer sales. The acquisition will be carried out by Home Depot's subsidiary, SRS Distribution, which will purchase all GMS shares for $110 each. The deal also effectively ends a potential hostile takeover attempt of GMS by billionaire Brad Jacobs's company, QXO, solidifying Home Depot's expansion into the professional supply sector.</p>

          <p>Dating app Tinder is piloting a new mandatory identity verification feature called Face Check for new users in California to combat fraud and increase platform safety. The feature requires users to take a short video selfie, which is then analyzed to confirm they are a real person and that their face matches their profile photos. This initiative aims to address the rise of romance scams and fake profiles, which have become a significant problem on dating platforms. While photo verification was previously an optional feature, this pilot makes it a required step for account creation in the state, though Tinder has not yet announced plans for a wider rollout.</p>

          <p>After a significant price surge over the past 18 months, the price of gold is expected to remain relatively stable throughout July. Key economic factors that typically influence gold, such as inflation and interest rates, are not anticipated to see major shifts. With inflation holding steady and the Federal Reserve likely to keep interest rates paused until at least September, major price fluctuations are unlikely. While unpredictable geopolitical tensions remain a wildcard that could drive investors toward the safe-haven asset, the current outlook suggests a period of consolidation for the precious metal's price.

After Trump threatened to raise tariffs and called off trade deal negotiations, Canadian Prime Minister Mark Carney informed the White House that the tax would be dropped. The White House hailed the decision as a "big victory" for American tech companies and workers. The proposed 3% tax on Canadian revenue would have affected giants like Amazon, Meta, and Google, and was expected to generate billions in revenue for Canada, which now says its preference is for a multilateral agreement.
