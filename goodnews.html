          <p>Plaid Cymru leader Rhun ap Iorwerth has declared his party is prepared to replace the long-dominant Welsh Labour party in the upcoming Senedd election. In a speech at the party's annual conference, he positioned Plaid Cymru as a government-in-waiting, promising "new energy and new ideas." The strategy aims to present the party as the primary alternative to both Labour, which has governed Wales since 1999, and the rising Reform UK party, in an effort to attract a broader base of voters.</p>

          <p>A woman whose body was discovered on a remote beach in the Netherlands in 2004 has finally been identified as 35-year-old German citizen Eva Maria Pommer. The breakthrough came after a renewed appeal on German television as part of Operation Identify Me, an international police initiative. This campaign uses public appeals and shares Interpol data to solve cold cases involving unidentified women, and Pommer's case marks its fourth successful identification, bringing long-awaited answers.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>A collaborative team of scientists from China and Spain has discovered that adding salt to ice enables it to produce electricity when subjected to non-uniform strain, such as bending. This phenomenon, known as flexoelectricity, generates an electrical response comparable to specialized ceramic materials. The finding opens up the possibility of developing novel, low-cost, and clean energy sources that could be harnessed in cold environments, representing a creative approach to power generation.</p>
