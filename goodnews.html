          <p>A growing number of Gen Z consumers are rejecting mass-produced, disposable "fast furniture" in favor of secondhand items, driven by environmental awareness and a desire for unique pieces with history. This trend pushes back against an industry where millions of tons of furniture, often made from non-recyclable composite materials, end up in landfills annually. Platforms like Facebook Marketplace are seeing a surge in use as younger buyers seek sustainability, affordability, and a more personal connection to their home decor, viewing the restoration of old items as an investment in their personal story.</p>

          <p>Former U.S. President Joe Biden has begun radiation and hormone therapy to treat an aggressive form of prostate cancer that was first diagnosed in May. According to his spokesperson, the cancer had metastasized to the bone, prompting the current treatment plan. The statement noted that the cancer is considered "hormone-sensitive," which generally indicates a higher likelihood of responding effectively to treatment, and that Biden is reportedly "doing well" as he undergoes the five-week course of radiation.</p>
