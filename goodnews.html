          <p>Chery Automobile, a major Chinese car manufacturer, intends to launch its initial public offering (IPO) in Hong Kong during the third quarter of this year, according to Chairman Yin Tongyue. The company aims to leverage Hong Kong as a hub for its global market ventures, emphasizing the city's advantages in manufacturing, research and development, and data management. Chery's IPO is projected to raise approximately US$1.5 billion, with China International Capital, Huatai Securities, and GF Securities acting as joint sponsors for the listing.

This initiative aims to reduce reliance on foreign uranium imports and compete with China's rapid expansion in nuclear power. President Trump signed executive orders to quadruple domestic nuclear energy production by 2050, requiring the construction of at least 10 large nuclear reactors by 2030. The move comes as data centers, particularly those supporting AI, are expected to consume a significant portion of U.S. energy in the coming years.</p>

          <p>UK Chancellor Rachel Reeves has unveiled new spending plans that prioritize the National Health Service (NHS) and housing, with an additional ¬£29 billion per year allocated to the NHS in England.

However, some departments, including the Foreign Office and the environment department, will face budget squeezes. The government hopes these investments will stimulate economic growth and improve public services, while the opposition criticizes the plans as fiscally irresponsible.</p>

          <p>Chinese court astronomers recorded detailed observations of a nova, or dying star's explosion, in 1408, according to a recently rediscovered report. The astronomers described the star as being the size of a cup-shaped oil lamp, with a pure yellow color, and noted that it remained stationary for 10 days. This discovery confirms that the event was a nova rather than a comet or meteor and provides unprecedented details about the star's size and brightness. The findings, reported by researchers from China, Germany, and Chile, help to narrow down the star's possible position.</p>

The 86 million-year-old skeletons belong to the closest known ancestor of all tyrannosaurs, including the iconic T.rex. This discovery sheds light on how tyrannosaurs evolved from small hunters to formidable giants with powerful jaws, allowing them to dominate North America and Asia until the end of the dinosaur era.

          <p>A federal judge has ruled that the Trump administration cannot deport or detain Mahmoud Khalil, a Columbia University activist arrested by immigration officers in March.
