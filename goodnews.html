          <p>Two-time Super Bowl champion Eli Manning shared a humorous story about his mentorship of New York Giants rookie quarterback Jaxson Dart, who also attended Ole Miss. After offering to help the rookie with football or life advice, Manning was surprised when Dart's first request was for help securing a reservation at a highly exclusive five-star restaurant. Manning good-naturedly declined, telling Dart that being his personal reservations agent was "not part of the deal" and that such perks must be earned. The anecdote highlights the dynamic between the veteran legend and the young player he is guiding.</p>

          <p>Liverpool's new striker, Hugo Ekitike, has quickly become a fan favorite at Anfield following his £70 million transfer from Eintracht Frankfurt. His impressive start, including three goals in five league wins, has given manager Arne Slot a welcome selection dilemma, especially with the presence of British record signing Alexander Isak. Ekitike's seamless transition to the Premier League is marked by his clinical finishing, strong work ethic, and ability to trouble defenses. His performance in the 2-1 Merseyside derby win against Everton further solidified his status, showcasing the depth of attacking talent Liverpool now possesses.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>The UK's Liberal Democrat party has proposed using the Civil Contingencies Act, a law typically reserved for wartime and national emergencies, to address the country's asylum application backlog. Home affairs spokeswoman Lisa Smart stated this would enable the rapid establishment of temporary "Nightingale processing centres" and the doubling of asylum caseworkers to 4,000. The party argues this decisive action is necessary to clear the backlog of approximately 70,500 cases, reduce the costly use of hotels for housing asylum seekers, and create a more humane system. The plan is part of the party's broader focus on law and order at their annual conference.</p>

          <p>Red Bull's Max Verstappen claimed pole position for the Azerbaijan Grand Prix after an exceptionally turbulent qualifying session that was halted by a record six red flags. The session was repeatedly interrupted by crashes, including from McLaren's Oscar Piastri and Ferrari's Charles Leclerc in the final part of qualifying. Verstappen managed to set the fastest time in the last few minutes of the restarted session, outpacing Williams' Carlos Sainz, who will start second. The chaotic conditions led to a mixed-up grid, with championship contender Lando Norris starting ninth and Lewis Hamilton failing to advance past the second qualifying segment.</p>

          <p>The stock market reached new all-time highs this week, with the S&P 500 and Nasdaq gaining 1.2% and 2.2% respectively. The rally was largely driven by the Federal Reserve's decision to cut its benchmark interest rate by a quarter point, with signals of more potential cuts in 2025. In tech news, CrowdStrike's stock surged after the company presented a strong long-term financial outlook, while Nvidia announced a major partnership with Intel to develop AI systems. Apple also saw its stock jump as the new iPhone 17 lineup launched to positive demand indicators and an upgraded price target from JPMorgan. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>An elderly British couple, Peter and Barbie Reynolds, have returned to the United Kingdom after being detained by the Taliban in Afghanistan for nearly eight months. The couple, who had lived and run a charitable training program in the country for 18 years, were released following negotiations brokered by Qatar. They were reunited with their daughter in Doha before flying to London's Heathrow Airport. The Taliban claimed the couple had broken Afghan laws but never specified the charges, while the family had expressed grave concerns about their health during their detention.</p>

          <p>The Trump administration has utilized new executive powers to block U.S. Steel from shutting down its plant in Granite City, Illinois, which would have affected nearly 800 workers. The intervention was made possible by a "golden share" agreement, a condition of the recent $14.1 billion takeover by Japan's Nippon Steel, granting the White House veto power over major strategic decisions like plant closures. After Commerce Secretary Howard Lutnick warned the company against the closure, U.S. Steel reversed its decision to idle the facility. This action marks the first use of these national-security-related powers and underscores the administration's increasing direct involvement in corporate operations.</p>

She explained her decision to re-enter the public sphere with a 2014 essay was motivated by a desire to help others, particularly young people, who face online humiliation. Lewinsky discussed how cultural perspectives have shifted since the 1990s, with younger generations now viewing her story through a lens of power dynamics. She emphasized the importance of telling one's own story to counter false narratives and heal from public trauma.</p>

          <p>A nearly two-hour phone call between Chinese President Xi Jinping and U.S. President Donald Trump has raised hopes for improved bilateral relations, though significant friction points remain. Both leaders described the conversation as productive, with Trump announcing plans for a meeting at the upcoming APEC summit and a potential visit to China early next year. The discussion covered key issues such as trade and the control of TikTok. However, analysts caution that major challenges, including tensions over the South China Sea, Taiwan, and potential U.S. tariffs related to China's purchase of Russian oil, could still undermine this positive momentum.</p>

          <p>The United States has noticeably reduced its public announcements of warship transits through the sensitive Taiwan Strait since President Trump returned to office. While such operations were regularly publicized under the previous administration as a show of support for freedom of navigation, only three have been known to occur this year, confirmed only after media inquiries. Beijing has historically criticized the "public hype" surrounding these transits. Chinese observers suggest this shift is likely a tactical change to lower tensions rather than a substantive alteration of U.S. policy, as the military operations themselves are continuing.</p>

For many, the lower tuition fees in Europe, which average around $9,000 per year, are a primary motivator to avoid substantial student debt.

This rare condition is caused by narrowed arteries restricting blood flow to the small intestine, leading to intense pain after meals.
