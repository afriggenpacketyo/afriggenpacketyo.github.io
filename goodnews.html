          <p>For the eighth consecutive year, Finland has been named the happiest country in the world, a distinction Finns themselves often find puzzling. According to the World Happiness Report, the ranking is based on life satisfaction rather than daily expressions of joy. Experts suggest Finnish contentment stems from a strong social fabric, high levels of trust, and robust public services like free libraries that provide universal opportunities. This societal structure, supported by high taxes that citizens willingly pay, combined with a deep connection to nature and traditions like saunas, fosters a sense of security and well-being.</p>

          <p>Actress Michelle Pfeiffer, 67, has revealed that becoming a grandmother last year has reignited her love for acting and changed her approach to her work. Speaking on a podcast, she explained that having a grandchild has made her want to be more present, freeing her from the deep, prolonged immersion she previously dedicated to her roles. Pfeiffer feels this more relaxed process has paradoxically made her a better actor. Currently juggling multiple projects, including a "Yellowstone" spinoff, she says she enjoys her craft more now than ever before and is grateful for the busy schedule.</p>

          <p>Hurricane Imelda has been downgraded to a post-tropical storm after lashing Bermuda as a Category 2 hurricane with powerful winds and heavy rain. The worst of the storm has passed the archipelago, and forecasters expect the system to continue weakening as it moves further into the Atlantic Ocean. While a hurricane warning was dropped, a tropical storm warning remained in effect for the islands early Thursday. The National Hurricane Center noted that swells generated by Imelda and the remnants of Hurricane Humberto are still likely to cause life-threatening surf and rip currents along much of the U.S. East Coast.</p>

The tool is designed to provide customers with personalized product recommendations and streamline purchasing through chat interactions. While the assistant will be free for businesses to use within Meta's own apps like Facebook and Instagram, there will be a fee for integration on external sites powered by platforms like Shopify.

          <p>A Norco man has been sentenced to 16 years to life in prison for starting the 2024 Line and Bacon fires in San Bernardino County, which burned 44,000 acres. Justin Halstenberg, 35, was convicted on nine counts of arson for the blaze that injured six firefighters and damaged or destroyed seven structures. Investigators were able to link Halstenberg's truck to the fire's origin point using an automatic license-plate reader, leading to his arrest five days after the fires began.

          <p>McLaren's Oscar Piastri, the current Formula 1 championship leader, stated he has learned valuable "lessons on risk" following a challenging race weekend at the Azerbaijan Grand Prix. Piastri crashed in practice, qualifying, and then again on the first lap of the main race, allowing his competitors to narrow his lead in the title standings. Heading into the Singapore Grand Prix, he acknowledged that such weekends are unaffordable in a tight championship fight but emphasized that no revolutionary changes are needed. He plans to stay focused on the successful strategies that have worked for most of the season.</p>

          <p>A research team from Purdue University is planning an expedition to a remote Pacific island to investigate if an underwater object is the lost aircraft of Amelia Earhart. The "visual anomaly," identified in satellite imagery from 2020 in a lagoon on Nikumaroro, has been visible in photos since 1938, a year after Earhart's disappearance. The team will use sonar and magnetometers before attempting to dredge the object, with researchers citing "very strong" evidence that it could be Earhart's Electra 10E plane. This development follows a recent order from President Trump to declassify all government records related to the famed aviator's final flight.</p>

          <p>Despite President Trump's recent order to declassify records, the enduring mystery of Amelia Earhart's 1937 disappearance is rooted more in public appetite for conspiracy than in evidence. The article argues that the most credible explanation remains that Earhart and navigator Fred Noonan ran out of fuel and crashed into the Pacific. It details how myths of her being a spy captured by the Japanese were fueled by wartime propaganda and financially motivated efforts, including from her own husband. The piece contends that focusing on these hoaxes obscures her true legacy as a pioneering aviator who championed women's roles in fields dominated by men.</p>

          <p>With gold prices reaching multiple record highs in 2025, investors are questioning whether it remains a smart investment. The surge is attributed to global uncertainty and strong central bank purchasing, with some analysts predicting prices could climb even higher. Persistent inflation, which erodes the value of cash, strengthens the case for gold as a traditional hedge. Furthermore, in a volatile economic landscape marked by geopolitical tensions and the current government shutdown, physical gold can serve as a key diversification tool and a safe-haven asset in a portfolio.

          <p>Warren Buffett's Berkshire Hathaway has agreed to purchase OxyChem, the petrochemical subsidiary of Occidental Petroleum, in a cash deal valued at $9.7 billion. This marks Berkshire's largest acquisition since 2022 and utilizes some of the nearly $344 billion in cash the conglomerate currently holds. Occidental plans to use $6.5 billion of the proceeds to reduce its debt, a move its CEO says will allow the company to restart its stock buyback program. Berkshire Hathaway already owns a significant 28.2% stake in Occidental Petroleum, and the deal is expected to close in the fourth quarter.</p>

          <p>This article challenges the common misconception known as "low-price bias," where investors mistakenly believe a low-priced stock has greater upside than a high-priced one. It argues that a company's underlying value, growth prospects, and fundamentals are far more critical than its nominal share price. Using the example of choosing between International Paper and a much higher-priced Nvidia in late 2023, the article demonstrates how focusing on valuation over share price would have yielded significantly higher returns. The piece emphasizes that investors must recognize and correct for such cognitive biases to make sound decisions. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>As the S&P 500 approaches all-time highs, some financial experts are advising investors to reconsider the passive "set-it-and-forget-it" investment strategy. They argue that the index's market-cap-weighted nature has led to heavy concentration in a few large technology stocks, reducing its diversification benefits and increasing volatility risk. Instead of relying solely on S&P 500 funds, advisors suggest alternatives like total market index funds, which include small- and mid-cap stocks, or equal-weight S&P 500 funds. The goal is to build a more balanced portfolio that can better withstand periods of underperformance in large-cap equities. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>PepsiCo is accelerating its transition to natural colorants for its food and beverage products in response to growing consumer rejection of artificial dyes. The company, which makes Gatorade, Cheetos, and Mountain Dew, aims to replace synthetic colors in about 40% of its U.S. product line. The process is complex, requiring years of research to find stable, flavor-neutral natural alternatives like paprika, turmeric, and purple sweet potatoes. Tostitos and Lay's will be among the first brands to complete the shift, as PepsiCo balances the demand for natural ingredients with consumers' expectations for the familiar appearance of its iconic products.</p>

          <p>German Unity Day, celebrated on October 3rd, commemorates the formal reunification of East and West Germany in 1990. This date was chosen over November 9th, the day the Berlin Wall fell, to avoid conflicting with the solemn anniversary of the 1938 Nazi pogroms. The holiday marks the end of four decades of division that began after World War II. While official celebrations are held, the day is generally observed quietly by most Germans, and recent polls suggest that a sense of division still persists, particularly regarding economic disparities between the former East and West.</p>

          <p>Robinhood CEO Vlad Tenev believes the tokenization of real-world assets like stocks and bonds onto blockchains is an inevitable trend that will eventually encompass the entire financial system. Speaking at a conference, Tenev predicted that most major markets will establish regulatory frameworks for tokenized assets within the next five years. He cited stablecoins as an early example and noted that his company already offers tokenized U.S. stocks to European customers, which he expects to become the standard for international investors. Tenev anticipates that the crypto and traditional finance worlds will fully merge, increasing market efficiency. (not investment advice)</p>
