          <h2>Lifestyle Expert Offers Strategies to Reduce Workplace Stress and Prevent Burnout</h2>
          <div class="timestamp">2025-08-28 17:11:20 EDT</div>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>As mentions of burnout among employees reach their highest level since 2016, a lifestyle expert suggests practical ways for workers to reduce on-the-job stress. Recommendations include strategically managing energy by tackling demanding tasks in the morning and simpler ones, like emails, later in the day. The expert also advises building "micro routines" with small, joyful activities like doodling or listening to music to decompress at one's desk. A crucial component to avoiding burnout is setting boundaries and learning to occasionally say "no," emphasizing the importance of prioritizing self-care to be effective for others.</p>

          <p>A federal judge in New York has denied Saudi Arabia's motion to dismiss a long-running lawsuit filed by families of 9/11 victims, allowing their case to move forward. The plaintiffs allege that the Saudi government provided material support to some of the al Qaeda hijackers, a claim the kingdom has consistently denied. The ruling cites "reasonable evidence" regarding the roles played by individuals with alleged ties to the Saudi government in assisting two of the hijackers before the attacks. This decision marks a significant procedural victory for the families in their decades-long pursuit of holding the nation accountable.</p>

          <p>Kansas City Chiefs star Travis Kelce has voiced his opinion on the Cleveland Browns' quarterback situation, urging the team to start rookie Shedeur Sanders. Speaking on his podcast, Kelce argued that starting Sanders would generate significant excitement among fans and viewers, stating, "Give the people what they want." Sanders is currently third on the depth chart behind veteran Joe Flacco and fellow rookie Dillon Gabriel. The debate follows a rough preseason performance by Sanders that has sparked conspiracy theories and criticism of the Browns' coaching staff for allegedly not putting him in a position to succeed.</p>

Despite the positive results, the company maintained its cautious full-year forecast, citing uncertainty around the potential impact of tariffs on consumer behavior and its business. Management noted that while customers are resilient, they remain deal-focused in the current economic environment. (not investment advice)</p>

The White House press secretary noted that the final details of the agreement are still being finalized by the Department of Commerce. Zinser also suggested that Intel might seek outside investment for its foundry business, which manufactures chips for other firms, to help fund its future growth. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>Average interest rates for home equity loans have fallen to 8.22%, their lowest level in 2025, making them a more attractive option for homeowners seeking financing. This article explores the benefits of securing such a loan now, beyond just the lower rate. With homeowner equity at a record high, there is a substantial amount available to borrow. Furthermore, the fixed-rate nature of these loans offers protection against future market uncertainty, and the interest may be tax-deductible if the funds are used for eligible home improvements, providing additional financial advantages.

          <p>Amazon is integrating fresh groceries into its same-day delivery service, allowing Prime members in over 1,000 cities to order perishable items alongside other goods for unified delivery. The expansion leverages the company's existing network of same-day fulfillment centers, which have been retrofitted with temperature-controlled environments to handle fresh food. This strategic move aims to increase convenience and close the competitive gap with traditional grocers like Walmart and Kroger. While analysts note that the initial selection of grocery items is limited, Amazon plans to expand the service to more markets by the end of the year.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>A new analysis indicates that more Americans are choosing to stay in their current jobs as the labor market cools, marking a significant shift from the "Great Resignation" era. The rate of job changes has fallen considerably from its 2022 peak and is now only slightly above pre-pandemic levels. Concurrently, the median pay increase for those who do switch jobs has decreased, suggesting that the power dynamic is shifting back from employees to employers. This trend, coupled with a slowdown in overall hiring, points to a more stagnant labor market that could potentially dampen consumer spending growth. (not investment advice)</p>
