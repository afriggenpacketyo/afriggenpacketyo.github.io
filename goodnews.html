          <p>A 36-year-old mountain biker from Angus, Scotland, has successfully completed an eight-and-a-half-year challenge to cycle down all 282 of the country's Munro mountains. Sean Green is believed to be only the second person to achieve this feat, which involved carrying his bike to each 3,000-foot summit before riding down. The semi-professional cyclist described the logistical challenges and the significant time commitment, often involving 12 to 16-hour days including travel, as the most difficult aspects of his quest. The article provides context on "Munro bagging," a popular mountaineering challenge inspired by Sir Hugh Munro.</p>

          <p>Deutsche Bank reported a second-quarter net profit of 1.485 billion euros, surpassing analyst expectations and marking a significant turnaround from a loss in the same period last year. The German lender confirmed it is on track to meet its full-year targets, with strong performance in its fixed income and currencies division offsetting a decline in its origination and advisory unit. The bank's CFO noted that euro strength against the U.S. dollar impacted results, and acknowledged sluggish loan growth amid market uncertainty. The report also touches on the broader European economic context, including potential U.S. tariffs. (not investment advice)</p>

          <h2>China to Issue Subsidy Vouchers for Seniors to Boost Elderly Care Consumption</h2>
          <div class="timestamp">2025-07-24 01:19:47 EDT</div>
        </div>
        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>China's government is planning to provide monthly electronic coupons to its senior citizens to help cover the costs of elderly-care services, a rare instance of direct fiscal support from Beijing. The policy aims to alleviate the financial strain on families, reduce precautionary savings, and stimulate consumption in the elder-care sector. The subsidies, ranging from 500 to 800 yuan per month, will be available to seniors assessed as moderately to completely disabled. This move is part of a broader effort to strengthen the social safety net as China grapples with a rapidly aging population and seeks new economic growth drivers.</p>

While Spain is competing in its first-ever Euros final, reigning champions England have reached their third consecutive major final despite a challenging tournament. Both teams are familiar with each other's strengths, setting the stage for a competitive and hard-fought conclusion to the championship.</p>

          <p>After a decade-long legal fight, former traders Tom Hayes and Carlo Palombo have had their convictions for manipulating the Libor inter-bank lending rate overturned. The ruling raises questions about the possibility of compensation and whether seven other traders jailed for similar offenses will now be able to appeal their own convictions. The case has also prompted calls from senior politicians for a public inquiry into the scandal, particularly focusing on the role of senior bank management and the Serious Fraud Office's investigation methods. The decision could have significant legal and financial repercussions for those involved in the original prosecutions.</p>

          <p>China and Russia have relaunched their joint maritime research missions for the first time since before the pandemic, signaling deepening scientific cooperation. A team of 25 researchers has set sail from Vladivostok on a 45-day expedition to study the effects of climate change on deep-sea environments in the Bering Sea and the northwestern Pacific. The mission, the ninth of its kind between the two nations, will focus on understanding ocean evolution and climate feedback systems over the past 126,000 years. The resumption of these surveys underscores a shared commitment to marine science and may reflect broader geopolitical alignments, including ambitions in the Arctic.</p>

          <p>The MLS All-Star game, which saw the league's stars defeat a team from Mexico's Liga MX 3-1, provided entertainment but also highlighted a growing debate about its relevance. The absence of the league's biggest star, Lionel Messi, who could face a suspension for skipping the event, has intensified questions about the game's format and purpose. MLS Commissioner Don Garber acknowledged the need to re-evaluate the event to keep it competitive and engaging for players and fans, especially as the league seeks to grow its viewership. The article suggests that while the event is a fixture of American sports culture, it may need to evolve to remain meaningful.</p>

          <p>A major study published in The Lancet suggests that walking 7,000 steps per day is linked to a significantly reduced risk of major health issues like cancer, dementia, and heart disease. This more attainable target challenges the widely promoted but less evidence-based goal of 10,000 steps, which originated from a 1960s marketing campaign. Researchers analyzed data from over 160,000 adults and found substantial health benefits starting from around 4,000 steps, with many benefits leveling off after 7,000. The findings may encourage more people to use step tracking as a practical way to improve their physical and mental well-being.</p>

          <p>A rare violet sea snail, Janthina janthina, has been discovered on a La Jolla beach, a species not typically seen in Southern California. An oceanography student from Scripps Institution of Oceanography found the creature, which is known for its vibrant purple shell and bubble raft that keeps it afloat in the open ocean. These snails usually inhabit warmer subtropical seas, and their appearance often coincides with warmer offshore water moving toward the coast. While a direct link to climate change is not confirmed, researchers will be monitoring for more sightings if warm water trends continue, highlighting potential shifts in marine ecosystems.</p>

SK Hynix's dominance in the HBM market has allowed it to challenge rival Samsung, and the firm expects strong demand to continue as tech companies invest heavily in AI infrastructure.

          <p>San Francisco Giants' Rafael Devers made a surprising admission after his debut at first base, stating that he prefers playing a defensive position over being a full-time designated hitter. This marks a significant change from his time with the Boston Red Sox, where he was adamant about exclusively handling DH duties and publicly rebutted proposals to play in the field. Devers explained that playing defense keeps him more active and mentally engaged in the game, rather than constantly thinking about his next at-bat. He contributed two hits in the Giants' 9-0 victory over the Atlanta Braves.</p>
