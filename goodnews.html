          <p>Chevron plans to decrease its share buybacks to between $2.5 billion and $3 billion in the second quarter, a reduction from the $3.9 billion repurchased in the first quarter, due to falling oil prices influenced by Trump's tariffs and OPEC+ production plans. While maintaining its overall repurchase guidance of $10 to $20 billion for the year, the company's net income declined by over 30% to $3.5 billion. An analyst at RBC Capital Markets noted that this decision reflects a proactive approach to a deteriorating macroeconomic environment, preparing for potential future challenges in the oil market.

          <p>Exxon Mobil reported first-quarter earnings that surpassed Wall Street estimates, although profits declined compared to the previous year due to falling crude oil prices driven by concerns over Trump's tariffs. The company's CEO, Darren Woods, acknowledged the market's volatility, attributing lower earnings to weak oil prices despite strong demand, but volume growth in the Permian Basin and Guyana combined with cost-cutting measures largely offset lower earnings from weak oil prices. Exxon's global production business saw a 19% increase in earnings, with U.S. production profits soaring by over 70%, while the company returned $9.1 billion to shareholders through dividends and share repurchases.

          <p>The U.S. economy added 177,000 jobs in April, surpassing expectations despite worries about the impact of President Trump's tariffs, with the unemployment rate remaining steady at 4.2%.

Average hourly earnings rose by 0.2% for the month, and this solid report has led traders to delay expectations for an interest rate cut until July, reflecting the economy's resilience despite trade-related uncertainties.</p>

          <p>The Federal Reserve is preparing for President Trump's tariffs to potentially hinder economic growth and increase inflation, which could delay interest rate cuts. Despite solid job growth and a stable unemployment rate, the central bank is concerned about the impact of tariffs on business investments, hiring, and consumer sentiment. Officials are debating whether the expected rise in consumer prices will be temporary or lead to persistent inflation, emphasizing the importance of containing tariff-related price pressures to maintain a healthy labor market.
