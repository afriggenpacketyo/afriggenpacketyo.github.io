          <p>The JBJ Soul Kitchen, a restaurant initiative run by Dorothea Bongiovi and her husband, rock star Jon Bon Jovi, offers meals to patrons regardless of their ability to pay. With four locations in New Jersey, guests can either make a suggested donation or volunteer their time in roles like serving or dishwashing to cover their meal. The model is designed for empowerment rather than charity, also providing community outreach to help patrons with housing and healthcare. The restaurant has earned high praise for its food quality, ranking in the top 1% of businesses on TripAdvisor.</p>

          <p>While global attention on falling birth rates often centers on East Asia, Latin American nations like Chile are also experiencing significant declines in fertility. This article explores the trend by investigating the personal decisions and societal factors contributing to Chile's plummeting birth rate. The report from Chile's capital aims to provide a deeper understanding of this demographic shift, which has wide-ranging implications for the country's future economy and social structure. It highlights a complex issue that extends beyond commonly discussed regions.</p>

          <p>Apple's stock experienced a significant rally, marking one of its best weekly performances in a decade after the company committed to a $100 billion investment in U.S. manufacturing, easing tensions with the Trump administration over tariffs. Meanwhile, reports suggest the administration is planning a massive stock offering for government-controlled mortgage giants Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac, a deal that could be historically large. Major banks like Goldman Sachs and Wells Fargo are reportedly in discussions with the White House about the potential offering. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>The European Union has sanctioned an Indian refinery, Nayara Energy, for processing Russian crude oil, as part of its latest measures against Russia. While this has caused friction, experts believe it is largely symbolic and will not derail the ongoing EU-India free trade agreement negotiations. In fact, the larger threat of potential U.S. tariffs on Indian goods under the Trump administration may be pushing India to seek a more stable economic partnership with the EU. This dynamic could inadvertently benefit the EU and align with its goal of reducing Russia's oil revenue.</p>

          <p>A team of archaeologists from East Carolina University has discovered four shipwrecks at a historic site in North Carolina, one of which is believed to be the Spanish privateer ship La Fortuna. The ship exploded and sank during an attack on a colonial port in 1748. Wood samples suggest the vessel was built with materials from Spanish Caribbean colonies, and its location is near where a cannon from the ship was previously found. The other wrecks include a potential colonial flatboat, and the discoveries are expected to provide new insights into the area's maritime history.</p>

          <h2>England Cricketer Chris Woakes Considers Risking Rehab Over Surgery for Ashes Fitness</h2>

          <p>England cricketer Chris Woakes is contemplating forgoing surgery on a dislocated shoulder in favor of rehabilitation to be fit for the upcoming Ashes series against Australia. The all-rounder sustained the injury during the final Test against India but still bravely came out to bat in the final moments. While surgery would mean a recovery time of three to four months, potentially causing him to miss the Ashes, a rehab-focused approach could see him return in about eight weeks. Woakes stated that this could be a risk he is willing to take for the team.</p>

          <p>The Hubble Space Telescope has captured the clearest image yet of 3I-Atlas, the third known interstellar object to visit our solar system. Traveling at 130,000 mph, the comet poses no threat to Earth and will make its closest approach to the sun in late October. The new observations have helped narrow down the size of its icy core to no more than 3.5 miles across. While most scientists are studying its natural characteristics, some have raised questions about its unusual brightness and trajectory, suggesting it warrants monitoring for signs of artificial technology.</p>

          <p>Independent MP Rupert Lowe admitted he mistook a team of charity rowers for "illegal migrants" and reported them to authorities. Lowe posted a picture on social media of a boat off the Norfolk coast, claiming it was a dinghy of migrants arriving in Great Yarmouth. It was later revealed the boat contained a crew rowing from Cornwall to Scotland to raise money for motor neurone disease research. After learning of his mistake, Lowe apologized for the false alarm and pledged to donate £1,000 to their charity, while the rowers said they found the situation "hilarious."</p>

          <h2>Reflecting on Virginia Woolf's 'Mrs. Dalloway' at its Centennial</h2>

          <p>As Virginia Woolf's novel "Mrs. Dalloway" turns 100, this article reflects on its enduring relevance, particularly as a masterpiece of the midlife crisis. The book, which unfolds over a single day, juxtaposes the life of its high-society protagonist with that of a war veteran suffering from what is now known as PTSD. The author notes that while they first read the book in college, its themes of mortality, regret, and the affirmation of life resonate differently and more deeply with age. The article suggests the novel's power lies in its ability to reward rereading at various stages of life.</p>

          <p>Nearly 24 years after the September 11th terrorist attacks, New York City's chief medical examiner has identified the remains of three more victims, bringing the total number of identified individuals to 1,653. The identifications were made possible by significant advances in DNA extraction and testing technology from bone fragments recovered at the World Trade Center site. Officials and family members expressed that this ongoing work honors the promise to identify every victim, providing a measure of closure to families even decades later.</p>
