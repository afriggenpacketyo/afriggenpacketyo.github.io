          <p>The British foreign intelligence service, MI6, has launched a secure portal on the dark web to recruit new agents, with a particular focus on individuals in Russia. The initiative, named "Silent Courier," aims to make it easier for people with sensitive information to contact UK intelligence securely, thereby strengthening national security. This move follows a similar strategy employed by the U.S. Central Intelligence Agency (CIA) to target potential Russian informants. The Foreign Office stated that the technology will bolster MI6's efforts to stay ahead of adversaries in an evolving global landscape.</p>

He believes that excelling on the court is the most authentic way to attract fans and business opportunities, a strategy that has served him well throughout his 18-year career. Durant and his business partner have built a diverse investment portfolio by focusing on relationships rather than chasing opportunities in specific markets. He emphasized that the NBA's global platform is powerful enough for any player who consistently performs.</p>

          <p>The Federal Trade Commission, along with seven states, has filed a lawsuit against Ticketmaster and its parent company, Live Nation Entertainment, alleging illegal ticket resale practices. The suit claims the companies colluded with scalpers to unlawfully purchase tickets, thereby inflating profits and harming consumers. The FTC accuses Ticketmaster of using "bait and switch" pricing and "triple dipping" by collecting fees from brokers and consumers in both primary and secondary markets. The legal action seeks an injunction to halt these practices, which allegedly cost fans millions of dollars annually.</p>

          <p>Chipmaker Nvidia has announced a landmark $5 billion investment in its rival Intel, alongside a collaboration to develop custom chips for AI data centers and personal computers. This partnership provides a significant boost for Intel, which has struggled financially while Nvidia has dominated the AI chip market. The move comes just a month after the Trump administration took a 10% stake in Intel to bolster the U.S. semiconductor industry. The collaboration aims to fuse Nvidia's AI computing architecture with Intel's widely used CPU ecosystem, potentially reshaping the competitive landscape. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>An analysis of President Trump's state visit to the UK suggests that while he was personally charmed by the royal pageantry and developed a warm rapport with Prime Minister Keir Starmer, Britain's ability to influence U.S. policy remains limited. Despite the amicable atmosphere, key disagreements on issues like Palestinian statehood persisted, with a White House official frankly stating the visit would have no impact on U.S. policy. The trip successfully demonstrated a strong personal relationship between the leaders, allowing Starmer to disagree with Trump without severe diplomatic repercussions, but it did not translate into tangible policy shifts for the UK.</p>

          <p>A jury has acquitted Brayan Ramos-Brito, a Los Angeles protester who was charged with assaulting a U.S. border patrol agent during a demonstration against immigration raids. The verdict is a setback for federal prosecutors, as the defense successfully cast doubt on the credibility of the agents' testimony, including that of a senior border patrol chief. Witness footage showed an agent forcefully shoving the defendant but did not capture the alleged assault. The case highlighted factual discrepancies in official reports and brought scrutiny upon the aggressive prosecution of protesters.</p>
