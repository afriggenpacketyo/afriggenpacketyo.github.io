          <p>Iran and the International Atomic Energy Agency (IAEA) have signed a technical agreement aimed at resuming cooperation, including the potential for renewed inspections of Iran's nuclear facilities. The deal was announced after a meeting in Cairo and described by IAEA Director General Rafael Grossi as "a step in the right direction." This development occurs amid heightened tensions, as European nations have threatened to reimpose UN sanctions over Iran's non-compliance with the 2015 nuclear accord. Iranian officials warned that any "hostile act," such as new sanctions, would terminate the agreement.</p>

          <p>This opinion article proposes that China's Greater Bay Area, including Hong Kong, is uniquely positioned to host the 2036 Summer Olympics in a cost-effective and sustainable manner. By leveraging existing world-class sports facilities in cities like Shenzhen, Macau, and Guangzhou, the region could avoid the massive construction costs that often burden host cities. The article suggests that Hong Kong's iconic harbor could serve as a scenic backdrop for temporary venues for events such as the triathlon. The area's highly developed and integrated transportation network would also ensure athletes could be housed within a short commute of their competition venues.</p>

          <p>Dodgers pitcher Roki Sasaki has re-entered the conversation for a spot on the team's postseason roster following an impressive rehabilitation start for the Triple-A Oklahoma City team. In his outing, Sasaki pitched four shutout innings and consistently threw over 100 mph, demonstrating a significant recovery from the shoulder impingement that placed him on the injured list. While a starting role is unlikely, his performance suggests he could be a valuable asset in the bullpen. Manager Dave Roberts acknowledged that "anything's possible" as the organization evaluates its options for the increasingly competitive postseason pitching staff.</p>

          <p>Democrat James Walkinshaw is projected to win the special election for a congressional district in Northern Virginia, further tightening the Republican majority in the U.S. House to 219-213. Walkinshaw, a Fairfax County supervisor and former chief of staff to the late Rep. Gerry Connolly, defeated Republican Stewart Whitson in the reliably Democratic district. Key issues in the race included President Trump's cuts to the federal workforce, a significant concern in a district where many residents are government employees. His victory continues a trend of Democrats overperforming in recent special elections across the country.</p>

          <p>Oracle's stock surged dramatically in after-hours trading after the company released a surprisingly strong forecast for its cloud infrastructure and artificial intelligence businesses, overshadowing a miss on current quarterly earnings. The company projected its cloud infrastructure revenue will jump 77% this fiscal year and continue to grow exponentially, reaching $144 billion within five years. This massive growth trajectory is fueled by several new multibillion-dollar contracts, including a significant deal with OpenAI. Analysts on the earnings call expressed astonishment at the figures, describing them as momentous and indicative of a seismic shift. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>The Swedish online lender Klarna has priced its initial public offering at $40 per share, exceeding its initial target range and valuing the company at approximately $15 billion. The company, known for its "buy now, pay later" services, raised $1.37 billion, with the majority of the funds going to existing shareholders. The successful pricing reflects a strong market appetite for technology IPOs and will test investor confidence in Klarna's strategic shift towards becoming a broader digital retail bank.

          <p>A new blood test capable of detecting key biomarkers for Alzheimer's disease is being trialed across the UK, with the potential to significantly improve diagnostic accuracy and speed. The test, which measures a protein called p-tau217, could increase the accuracy of early-stage diagnosis from 70% to over 90%. Over 1,000 patients at 20 NHS memory clinics will participate in the study, which aims to assess the test's effectiveness within a real-world clinical setting. If successful, this relatively inexpensive test could become a standard diagnostic tool, replacing more invasive and less accessible methods.</p>

Governor Michelle Lujan Grisham announced the expansion of an existing program that had already made childcare free for families earning up to 400% of the federal poverty level. The initiative has been credited with reducing poverty and increasing financial stability for thousands of families in one of the country's poorest states. The expanded program is expected to save families an average of $12,000 per child annually and is being hailed as a potential model for the nation.</p>

          <p>The public bus system in Akron, Ohio, has received a national award for mass transit system of the year after a successful overhaul that led to a 24% increase in ridership. The transformation was driven by a commitment to listening to passenger feedback, which resulted in redrawn routes, increased bus frequency, and seven-day-a-week service. Led by a CEO who regularly rides the buses to engage with the community, the Metro system implemented these significant improvements without a budget increase. The agency's success is being highlighted as a model for how public transit can thrive by prioritizing the needs of its users.</p>

          <p>The UK's Financial Conduct Authority (FCA) has proposed a plan that would allow banks and payment providers to remove the current £100 cap on contactless card transactions. If implemented, the change would permit unlimited payments via a simple tap, aligning card payments with the unrestricted limits already available through digital wallets on smartphones. The FCA stated that card issuers would be responsible for fraud and would only permit higher-value payments for transactions deemed low-risk. Despite consumer concerns about security, the regulator argues the move reflects evolving payment habits and would reduce "payment friction" for shoppers.</p>
