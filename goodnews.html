          <p>The United States and China have reached an agreement to cut reciprocal tariffs for 90 days, aiming to de-escalate trade tensions that have roiled markets and raised recession fears. Treasury Secretary Scott Bessent announced that both sides will reduce tariffs by 115%, resulting in a 10% reciprocal tariff rate. The agreement also includes the removal of countermeasures by China and the establishment of a mechanism for ongoing discussions. This temporary measure is intended to provide a basis for broader trade negotiations and prevent further escalation of the trade war, which had created an embargo-like situation according to Bessent.</p>

Key measures include tightening visa requirements for skilled workers, expanding eligibility for high-potential individuals, and doubling the time immigrants must live in the UK before applying for permanent residency. The plans also involve abolishing a dedicated visa for social care providers and increasing English language requirements for work visas.

To get good images from 4o, users should work around content filters by asking for styles reminiscent of specific artists and then requesting a "style transfer". Detailed prompting strategies, such as asking the AI to consider what makes an image evocative or challenging it on capturing an artist's genius, can significantly improve results. The article emphasizes the importance of structured thinking and multiple drafts for achieving quality AI-generated art.</p>
