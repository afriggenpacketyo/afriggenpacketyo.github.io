          <p>Senate Republicans are largely aligning with President Trump's handling of the conflict between Israel and Iran, expressing trust in his judgment regarding potential U.S. involvement. While some within Trump's MAGA base are divided on further intervention, citing his campaign promise to avoid foreign wars, key Republicans like Sen. Lindsey Graham endorse the use of force if diplomacy fails to prevent Iran from obtaining nuclear weapons. Democrats, in contrast, advocate for congressional approval before any military action and emphasize de-escalation efforts. Despite differing views, most Republicans agree with Trump that Iran must not possess nuclear capabilities.</p>

          <p>The Buss family has reportedly agreed to sell a controlling interest in the Los Angeles Lakers to Mark Walter, the current owner of the L.A. Dodgers. Walter, CEO of Guggenheim Partners, will assume majority ownership, while Jeanie Buss will retain the title of governor, representing the team in league matters. The sale is valued at approximately $10 billion, surpassing the previous record for a sports team sale. Aside from the Dodgers, Walter also owns the Los Angeles Sparks and has interest in Premier League soccer club Chelsea.</p>

          <p>Karen Read was found not guilty of second-degree murder in the death of her Boston police officer boyfriend, John O'Keefe, after a retrial. The jury also acquitted her of vehicular manslaughter while intoxicated and leaving the scene of the collision, but convicted her of operating a vehicle under the influence of alcohol (OUI). The verdict followed a first trial that collapsed due to a hung jury. Read's defense argued she was framed, while prosecutors claimed she intentionally ran over O'Keefe. Read received a one-year probation order for the intoxication charge, avoiding prison time.</p>

          <p>Russian President Vladimir Putin stated that Iranian society is consolidating around its leadership, in response to questions about possible regime change in Tehran. His comments come as Trump considers joining Israel's bombardment of Iranian nuclear sites. Putin emphasized the need for all parties to seek ways to end hostilities, ensuring both Iran's right to peaceful nuclear power and Israel's security. He noted that Iran's underground uranium enrichment facilities remain intact and that he has been in contact with both Trump and Netanyahu to convey Moscow's ideas for resolving the conflict.</p>

          <p>AstroAI is recalling approximately 249,100 minifridges due to a fire and burn hazard. The electrical switch in the refrigerators can short circuit, posing a risk of fire and burns. The Consumer Product Safety Commission (CPSC) has received numerous reports of the minifridges emitting smoke, burning, melting, or catching fire, with two incidents causing over $360,000 in property damage. Consumers are urged to immediately stop using the recalled fridges and contact AstroAI for a replacement product. Disposal of the recalled minifridges should be in accordance with local waste disposal procedures.</p>

          <p>Millions more households in Britain will receive ¬£150 off their energy bills this winter as the government expands eligibility for the Warm Home Discount. The changes eliminate property size and energy score qualifications, benefiting an additional 2.7 million homes, including nearly a million households with children. Energy companies will fund the discount, potentially leading to a slight increase in bills for all customers, though the government claims savings from cutting energy company expenditures will offset this rise. The scheme aims to provide additional support to those struggling with energy costs, though some argue it still excludes vulnerable individuals.</p>

Supporters of Read gathered outside the courthouse, celebrating the verdict. The defense had argued that Read's vehicle did not hit O'Keefe, and instead, he was attacked by a dog and beaten by others before being left in the snow. The first trial ended in a mistrial due to a hung jury.</p>

          <p>The FDA has approved lenacapavir for HIV prevention, with clinical trial data suggesting that just two injections a year provide near-complete protection against HIV infection. The drug offers a more convenient alternative to the current standard of care, a daily pill called Truvada. The twice-yearly injection could reach more people, particularly those who face stigma for taking a daily medication. The high cost of the drug, roughly $28,000 a year, could limit access. Lenacapavir's power to prevent infection lies in its ability to disrupt the virus's capsid, preventing replication for about six months.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>The FDA has approved Gilead's twice-yearly antiviral injection, Yeztugo, for preventing HIV, a milestone that some experts say could help end the decadeslong epidemic. In clinical trials, the injection was capable of virtually eliminating new HIV infections when taken every six months. The annual list price of Yeztugo is $28,218 in the U.S. before insurance. The drug could help address the fact that HIV continues to disproportionately impact people of color, gay and bisexual men, and transgender women. The launch of the injectable drug faces potential challenges, including proposed cuts to federal funding for HIV prevention efforts.</p>
