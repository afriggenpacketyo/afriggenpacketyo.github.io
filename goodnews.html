The surge was reportedly fueled by positive sentiment surrounding U.S.-China trade negotiations, with President Trump indicating that talks were progressing well. The positive market movement was also influenced by a framework deal concerning the divestment of Chinese-owned TikTok, adding to investor optimism in the region. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>A federal appeals court has upheld a lower court's decision to temporarily prevent President Trump from firing Federal Reserve Governor Lisa Cook. The ruling came just before a crucial meeting where the Fed is expected to vote on interest rates, a subject on which Trump has been pressuring the central bank. The court found that removing Cook, based on unproven allegations of mortgage fraud from before she joined the board, would likely violate the Federal Reserve Act's provisions designed to ensure the bank's independence from political influence.</p>

          <p>In his new memoir, Oscar-winning music producer Mark Ronson focuses on his formative years as a highly sought-after DJ in 1990s New York City, a period before his mainstream fame. The book serves as a tribute to an era when he played for icons like Prince and Mariah Carey, navigating the vibrant and sometimes seedy club scene that shaped his musical instincts. Ronson reflects on how the control of the DJ booth provided a refuge from a chaotic childhood and how those skills later translated to his successful career as a producer.</p>

          <h2>Experts Offer Practical Strategies for Autumn Home Decluttering</h2>
          <div class="timestamp">2025-09-15 20:20:13 EDT</div>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>As autumn approaches, many people feel the urge to tidy their living spaces, a process that psychologists say can reduce stress. Experts advise starting small, such as with a single drawer, to avoid feeling overwhelmed and to plan ahead for where discarded items will go, whether to charity, recycling, or for sale. A key principle is to prioritize quality over quantity by keeping items that are genuinely uplifting, and to distinguish between true sentimental value and simple nostalgia for the past.</p>

Ali's story illustrates the immense personal and bureaucratic challenges faced by those seeking safety in the U.S., highlighting a system strained by a shortage of judges and shifting administrative priorities.</p>

          <p>The FDA is re-evaluating the risks and benefits of menopause hormone therapy, considering the removal of "black box" warnings about stroke, dementia, and breast cancer from some treatments. Many doctors now believe the risks, established by a flawed 2002 study focused on older women, were overstated and that the therapy is safe and effective for many. More recent research indicates that factors like a woman's age at the start of treatment and the delivery method can significantly mitigate risks, prompting a potential shift in official guidance.</p>

He argued that these companies continue to be strong investments due to their great management, massive cash reserves, and enormous scale, which makes them difficult to challenge. Citing their strong balance sheets and capacity for innovation, Cramer believes these companies remain compellingly valued and are positioned for future success despite their already immense gains.

          <p>President Trump has suggested that U.S. companies should move from reporting their earnings every quarter to a semi-annual schedule, a proposal the Securities and Exchange Commission is now reportedly reviewing. Trump argued the change would save companies money and allow management to focus on long-term strategy rather than short-term profits, contrasting it with what he described as China's long-term business view. While some business leaders like Warren Buffett have previously criticized the focus on quarterly guidance, supporters of the current system argue it provides crucial transparency for investors.

          <p>Scientists from UCLA and the Bay Foundation are releasing a nontoxic, fluorescent pink dye into the waters near the Santa Monica Pier to study ocean circulation. The goal is to understand how a man-made breakwater constructed in the 1930s may be trapping pollutants and contributing to the area's notoriously poor water quality. By tracking the movement of the dye, researchers hope to gather data that could lead to solutions for the beach, which frequently appears on lists of California's most polluted coastal areas.</p>

          <p>The Trump administration has announced a "framework" for a deal that would allow TikTok to continue operating in the United States, avoiding a potential ban. The initial ban was prompted by concerns over the app's Chinese parent company, ByteDance, and the potential for data harvesting and propaganda by the Chinese government. While the full details are not yet public, any agreement would require the sale of TikTok to a U.S.-based owner to address these national security concerns.</p>
