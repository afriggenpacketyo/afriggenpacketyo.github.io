          <p>The Sports Bra, a women's sports bar in Portland, Oregon, has gained popularity since opening in 2022, aiming to provide a space where women's sports are prominently displayed and celebrated. Founder Jenny Nguyen envisioned a place where young girls could feel a sense of belonging in sports, with the goal of inspiring future generations. The bar's success reflects a growing interest in women's sports, but Nguyen emphasizes that there is still work to be done in achieving equality for female athletes, particularly in areas like media coverage and compensation. The article notes that the number of women's sports bars in the United States is expected to quadruple by the end of the year.</p>

          <p>In an effort to save endangered water voles in Wales, conservationists are feeding them edible glitter to track their movements. Water vole populations have declined by 90% in the past 30 years, prompting the Wildlife Trust to seek innovative tracking methods. By using different colors of glitter, conservationists hope to identify family territories and their ranges. This tracking data will inform habitat adjustments, such as removing invasive conifers and fencing off riverbanks, to help the species disperse and thrive. The article highlights the seriousness of the conservation efforts and the potential life-saving impact of this intervention.</p>

          <p>Palaeontologists are investigating a mass grave in Alberta, Canada, containing thousands of Pachyrhinosaurus fossils to determine how these dinosaurs died. The site, nicknamed the "River of Death," is believed to be one of the largest bone beds in North America, offering a unique snapshot of a single community of animals. Researchers hypothesize that a flash flood wiped out a migrating herd of Pachyrhinosaurus, with the fast-flowing water churning up sediment and bones. The article also discusses the discovery of Edmontosaurus bones in the area, contributing to a broader understanding of the ancient ecosystem. The findings will be featured in the BBC series 'Walking With Dinosaurs'.</p>

          <p>China's retail sales growth slowed in April, signaling ongoing concerns about consumption in the world's second-largest economy. Retail sales rose 5.1% year-on-year, missing analysts' estimates, while industrial output grew 6.1%, exceeding expectations despite U.S. tariffs. The National Bureau of Statistics acknowledged external uncertainties but emphasized the resilience of China's economy, particularly in diversifying exports to Southeast Asian countries. Automobile sales showed minimal growth, and the real estate sector continued to struggle, indicating domestic demand remains weak.
