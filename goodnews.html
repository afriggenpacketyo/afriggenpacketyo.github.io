          <h2>China's Military Newspaper Discusses Ethical Concerns of Humanoid Combat Robots</h2>
          <div class="timestamp">2025-07-10 04:28:55 EDT</div>
        </div>
        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>An article in the People's Liberation Army (PLA) Daily, China's official military newspaper, has called for ethical and legal research into the use of humanoid robots in combat to avoid moral dilemmas. The authors noted that militarized robots would violate Isaac Asimov's first law of robotics, which prohibits harming humans, suggesting the laws need amendment for military applications. They proposed that combat robots should be programmed to obey, respect, and protect humans in accordance with the laws of war. This reflects growing internal discussions within the PLA about the future of autonomous warfare.</p>

        </div>
        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>The UK and France are reportedly close to a new deal to manage migrant crossings, which would involve France taking back a number of individuals who cross the English Channel in small boats. In exchange, the UK would accept a similar number of asylum seekers from France who have legitimate reasons to come to Britain, such as family connections. The initial pilot scheme is expected to be small-scale, leading critics to question its effectiveness as a short-term deterrent. The success of the agreement will ultimately be judged on whether it can be scaled up to significantly reduce crossing numbers.</p>

          <h2>New 'Superman' Film Explores Themes of Kindness and Universal Morality, Sparking Political Debate</h2>
          <div class="timestamp">2025-07-10 03:01:00 EDT</div>
        </div>
        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>The upcoming 'Superman' film, directed by James Gunn, is generating political debate for its focus on what the director calls "universal morality" and "human kindness" rather than American exceptionalism. Gunn stated the film portrays a battered hero symbolizing a country that still stands for goodness, which has led some right-wing commentators to criticize the character as "woke." The article explores the history of Superman as a character created by Jewish immigrants to defend the weak, and how his identity as an "undocumented alien" resonates with current debates on immigration and politics.</p>

          <p>Researchers at Johns Hopkins University have developed a robot capable of autonomously performing a realistic gallbladder surgery with 100% accuracy. The system, powered by machine learning architecture similar to ChatGPT, can adapt to unexpected situations and learn from voice commands, mimicking a human surgeon's expertise. This represents a significant advancement from previous robotic surgeries, moving toward autonomous systems that can operate in the unpredictable environment of a real patient. While the procedure took longer than a human surgeon, the results were comparable in quality.</p>

          <p>A former official from China's central bank has argued that the yuan possesses the qualities to become a safe-haven currency, citing the country's institutional credibility and strong macroeconomic fundamentals like low inflation and large foreign reserves. The analysis, published in the Hong Kong International Finance Review, suggests the yuan has shown resilience and reduced sensitivity to risk during recent global stress events. This perspective contributes to the ongoing debate over the internationalization of the yuan as confidence in the U.S. dollar is tested by debt risks and protectionist policies.

          <p>The market for weight-loss drugs in China is rapidly expanding, with analysts valuing it at a potential US$150 billion as dozens of domestic producers compete for market share. This growth mirrors trends in the West, driven by rising obesity rates, celebrity endorsements, and the approval of more effective medications. Innovent Biologics, a Jiangsu-based company, was the first Chinese firm to receive approval to market a weight-loss drug in the country. The article highlights the significant economic potential and burgeoning competition within this nascent but fast-growing pharmaceutical sector in China. (not investment advice)</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Vienna is often cited as a prime example of successful housing policy, with its social housing stock accounting for 43% of all units in the city and serving a wide range of income levels. This system, which originated in the 1920s, keeps rent levels significantly lower than the private market and helps dampen private rents as well. Financed partly by a levy on employee salaries, the model has remained stable despite some privatization pressures. While the system faces challenges regarding accessibility for newcomers, it demonstrates that long-term political commitment can make housing more affordable and prioritize it as a basic need.</p>

          <p>A team of scientists at the Beijing Institute of Technology has created the world's first cyborg bee by developing an ultralight brain controller. The device, weighing only 74 milligrams, is strapped to a bee's back and uses three needles to send electronic pulses to its brain, effectively commanding its flight path. In tests, the bee obeyed commands to turn, advance, or retreat with 90% accuracy. This breakthrough in miniaturized neural interfaces could pave the way for new applications in fields like search and rescue, surveillance, and environmental monitoring.</p>

Goals from Denis Bouanga, Nathan Ordaz, and Javairo Dilrosun secured the crucial points for the club. The team faces a demanding calendar for the rest of the season, but the front office is expected to be active in the upcoming transfer window to strengthen the roster. The departures of key players have opened up designated player spots and salary cap space, providing resources to address needs on both offense and defense.</p>

          <p>A large section of the iconic Sycamore Gap tree, which was illegally felled in September 2023, has been installed as a permanent public memorial in Northumberland. The trunk is now the centerpiece of an exhibition at The Sill National Landscape Discovery Centre, near where the beloved tree stood for centuries. The installation, designed after public consultation, allows visitors to touch and interact with the wood and is surrounded by benches inscribed with messages of hope and remembrance from the public. The display aims to provide a place for reflection and honor the tree's significance.</p>

          <p>To combat persistent labor market pressures, the Chinese government has introduced a one-time subsidy for companies that hire unemployed young people aged 16 to 24. Employers who sign formal contracts and make social insurance contributions can receive up to 1,500 yuan (US$209) per new hire. This measure, effective until the end of the year, is part of a broader effort to stabilize employment amid sluggish economic growth and intense domestic competition. Additionally, China's top economic planner has allocated more funds to its "work-for-relief" public works program to generate more jobs. (not investment advice)</p>
