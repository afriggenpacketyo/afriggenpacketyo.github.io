          <p>U.S. Border Patrol agents discovered and disabled a nearly 3,000-foot-long narcotics smuggling tunnel connecting Tijuana and San Diego. The tunnel, found in early April, ran under part of the Otay Mesa Port of Entry and was equipped with lighting, electrical wiring, ventilation, and a track system. Authorities found the entrance in a house in Tijuana, recently covered with new tile, and plan to fill the tunnel with concrete to prevent future use. Since 1993, over 95 tunnels have been decommissioned in the San Diego area, as officials continue to strengthen border security.</p>

          <p>Nippon Steel's top executive, Eiji Hashimoto, expressed confidence that the U.S. government's role in its $14.1 billion buyout of U.S. Steel will not impede the U.S. unit's business operations. Despite conditions like significant investment in U.S. Steel and a golden share for the U.S. government, Hashimoto believes the deal is rational and ensures profitability for both companies. The acquisition will make Nippon Steel the world's fourth-largest steelmaker, expanding its global capacity and presence in overseas markets. The U.S. government expects Nippon Steel to maintain and expand production capacity at U.S. Steel, creating jobs and reducing the U.S. deficit (not investment advice).</p>

          <p>Businesses are increasingly using "tariff engineering" to lower duties amid rising tariffs, by changing product materials or dimensions to fit into different tariff classifications. This legal practice involves altering items so they qualify for lower rates under the harmonized system code. Companies like Columbia Sportswear and Converse have successfully implemented strategic product tweaks to save on tariff costs. The article notes that while some sectors can easily implement tariff engineering, more heavily regulated sectors face challenges due to extensive validation and approval processes.
