        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>OpenAI CEO Sam Altman has unveiled a plan for an unprecedented $850 billion infrastructure expansion to build a network of massive AI data centers. The project, a partnership with Oracle, Nvidia, and SoftBank, aims to generate 17 gigawatts of power to meet the soaring computational demands of artificial intelligence. While acknowledging concerns about a potential market bubble and the circular nature of the financing, Altman insists the buildout is necessary to support the exponential growth in AI usage and capability. The first of these mega-facilities is already being developed in Abilene, Texas.</p>

          <p>The recent rally in artificial intelligence-related stocks has cooled, with major players like Oracle and Micron seeing some profit-taking after significant gains in September. This pullback has contributed to a broader market slide from recent record highs. In other tech news, Meta CEO Mark Zuckerberg announced that Instagram has surpassed 3 billion monthly active users, joining Facebook and WhatsApp at this milestone. The platform's growth is attributed to the success of its short-form video feature, Reels, and the use of AI to enhance its content recommendation systems. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>Residents in San Rafael, a city in the San Francisco Bay Area, are being warned about an unusually aggressive squirrel that has attacked multiple people. At least two individuals required emergency room treatment for bites and scratches after unprovoked attacks by the animal. Officials have posted flyers to alert the community, and wildlife experts speculate the squirrel's behavior may stem from being fed by humans when it was young, causing it to lose its natural fear. Experts remind the public not to feed wild animals and have noted that squirrels are not typically carriers of rabies.</p>

          <p>European Commission President Ursula von der Leyen has signaled a softer diplomatic approach towards China, calling for engagement based on "mutual understanding" to address ongoing trade disputes. This shift in tone comes as the European Union seeks Beijing's cooperation on major global issues, including the war in Ukraine and climate change. Previously, the EU has used more assertive language regarding China's export controls and market access policies. In response, Chinese Premier Li Qiang called for both powers to maintain strategic independence and demonstrate responsibility amid increasing global instability.</p>

          <p>Labubu dolls, collectible rabbit-like monster plushes, have become a viral fashion accessory, leading high-end luxury brands to collaborate on premium versions of the toy. Originally priced at $27, customized Labubus have fetched tens of thousands at auction, and brands like Moynat are launching their own collections featuring the character. This trend reflects a broader strategy by luxury houses like Omega and Loewe to use popular characters to engage younger, digitally-savvy consumers. These collaborations aim to create cultural relevance and emotional connection, tapping into a desire for unique, identity-reflecting items over traditional status symbols.</p>

          <p>Betty Reid Soskin, the nation's oldest park ranger until her retirement at 100, celebrated her 104th birthday at the Bay Area middle school named in her honor. Soskin is renowned for her work at the Rosie the Riveter National Historical Park, where she shared the often-overlooked stories of African Americans during World War II. Born to a Louisiana Creole family, she was also an activist against Jim Crow laws in the East Bay. Her life story of continued public service and impact, particularly after the age of 50, serves as an inspiration to the students and community celebrating with her.</p>

          <p>In an effort to boost sales of its F-150 pickup truck, Ford Motor is offering special financing programs to consumers with subprime credit scores. The promotion provides lower interest rates, typically reserved for buyers with higher credit ratings, to make the vehicles more affordable and reduce inventory levels. While such programs can increase sales, they also carry a higher risk of loan defaults, particularly in an uncertain economy. Sales of F-Series trucks, a key indicator of demand among skilled laborers and small businesses, have recently slowed after a period of growth.</p>

Before launching ZenBusiness, which provides AI-powered software for legal compliance, she and her co-founder spent nearly a year interviewing entrepreneurs to understand their primary challenges. This process revealed that their target market should be first-time business owners, a crucial pivot from their initial idea. Hemmati stresses that being open to adapting a business model based on direct customer input is often the key differentiator between success and failure.</p>

          <p>The New York City Police Department is using drones to detect and prevent "subway surfing," a dangerous activity that has led to 16 deaths in the last three years. Drones patrol train routes, and if someone is spotted riding on top of a car, a team is dispatched to the next station to safely remove them. The program was initiated after a rise in fatalities, including that of 15-year-old Zackery Nazario, whose mother is now suing social media companies for allegedly popularizing the trend. The NYPD reports that the drone initiative has already helped save over 200 people, mostly teenagers.</p>

          <p>The Financial Industry Regulatory Authority (FINRA) has approved a rule change that eliminates the $25,000 minimum equity requirement for pattern day traders. This rule, established during the dot-com bubble to curb excessive risk-taking, required traders making four or more day trades in five days to maintain the minimum balance. The new regulation, pending SEC approval, will instead base intraday buying power on margin requirements for specific positions, making active trading more accessible to investors with smaller accounts. The change reflects the evolution of trading technology and could increase activity for retail-focused brokerage platforms.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Following the Federal Reserve's recent rate cut, the average 30-year mortgage rate has fallen to a three-year low of 6.13%, providing significant savings for homebuyers. For a $250,000 mortgage, the monthly principal and interest payment is now approximately $1,520, which is about $150 less per month compared to the rates seen at the beginning of the year. This reduction in borrowing costs has spurred an increase in mortgage applications from both new buyers and existing homeowners looking to refinance. Over the full 30-year term, the lower rate translates to a total interest savings of around $54,000.</p>

          <p>A family has shared that their son, diagnosed with nonverbal autism, began speaking just days after starting an off-label treatment with leucovorin, a drug typically used to mitigate chemotherapy side effects. The drug, a derivative of folic acid, is being studied by pediatric neurologist Dr. Richard Frye as a potential treatment for a subset of children with autism who may have a blockage in folate transport to the brain. While preliminary studies have shown positive effects on speech, more research is needed for FDA approval. A primary obstacle is the lack of financial incentive for pharmaceutical companies to fund trials for an inexpensive, generic drug.</p>

          <p>Following a meeting with Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy at the UN, U.S. President Donald Trump appeared to reverse his previous stance on the war, stating that Ukraine is in a position to "WIN all of Ukraine back." This marks a significant departure from his earlier suggestions that Kyiv would need to cede territory for a peace deal. Zelenskyy praised the meeting as productive and described Trump as "well-informed," viewing the shift as a potential game-changer. While the statement was met with cautious optimism in Ukraine, it remains unclear if this rhetorical change will translate into a concrete policy pivot from the White House.</p>
