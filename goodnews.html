        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>A military parade in Washington, D.C., commemorating the Army's 250th anniversary on June 14, coinciding with President Trump's 79th birthday, is projected to cost between $25 million and $45 million. The parade will feature over 100 vehicles, thousands of soldiers, and potentially 50 helicopters, requiring coordination with the FAA. Abrams tanks will also be included, with metal plates laid on the streets to prevent damage. While the White House claims the cost will be shared, some Democrats criticize the event as a wasteful display of ego, reminiscent of a previously canceled Veterans Day parade due to high costs.</p>

          <p>The World Bank has cleared Syria‚Äôs $15.5 million debt following payments from Saudi Arabia and Qatar, enabling the country to receive grants for reconstruction and economic recovery. This move follows President Trump's decision to lift sanctions on Syria and his meeting with Syria‚Äôs new president, Ahmed al-Shara, signaling a shift in U.S. policy and easing Syria's diplomatic isolation. Despite ongoing challenges including infrastructure damage and sectarian violence, there is growing confidence among international investors, highlighted by an $800-million deal with DP World to develop the port of Tartus. The World Bank's initial efforts will focus on expanding access to electricity to spur economic activity.</p>

          <p>President Trump's recent trip to the Middle East was characterized by a focus on securing financial agreements with countries like Qatar, Saudi Arabia, and the UAE, encompassing investments, arms deals, and Boeing plane purchases. However, the trip was overshadowed by Qatar's gift to Trump of a 747 aircraft to replace Air Force One, a gesture that has drawn criticism from various political factions. The acceptance of the plane raises concerns about violating the Emoluments Clause of the Constitution and the potential costs of refurbishment and security upgrades. Despite the controversy, Trump's visit avoided public conversations about democracy or human rights, prioritizing transactions over principles.</p>

          <p>Supreme Court Justice Amy Coney Barrett questioned U.S. Solicitor General John Sauer on whether the Trump administration would consistently adhere to federal court precedent during oral arguments regarding birthright citizenship. Barrett pressed Sauer on the administration's willingness to disregard rulings from lower courts, specifically citing the Second Circuit Court of Appeals' decision on Trump's birthright citizenship order. The exchange sparked debate, with some viewing Barrett's skepticism as a check on executive power, while others criticized her perceived lack of loyalty to the president who appointed her. The court's decision could hinge on the votes of Barrett and Justice Neil Gorsuch.</p>
