          <p>President Trump announced that Elon Musk will be concluding his official role in the Trump administration but hinted at continued collaboration. Musk's tenure as head of the Department of Government Efficiency (DOGE) is ending due to legal limits for his "special government employee" designation. During his time at DOGE, Musk claims to have overseen $175 billion in savings through various measures. Despite criticism from Democrats, markets reacted positively to Musk's return to the private sector, with Tesla shares rising. </p>

          <p>Coastal rail service linking Orange and San Diego counties is set to resume on June 7 after nearly six weeks of repairs to reinforce tracks threatened by landslides and coastal erosion. The California Coastal Commission approved emergency construction, including the placement of 5,900 tons of boulders and 240,000 cubic yards of sand to stabilize the rail line. The Orange County Transportation Authority estimates the total cost of the projects at $300 million. Recurring interruptions have plagued the rail line, which has operated for over 125 years, due to eroding bluffs in San Clemente.</p>
