          <p>Apollo, a U.S. asset management firm, is set to provide a ¬£4.5 billion loan to the Hinkley Point C nuclear project in the UK to address a funding shortfall. This private capital investment aims to support the construction of two nuclear reactors, the first to be built in Britain in decades. China General Nuclear Power Corp (CGN) halted its funding in late 2023, leaving EDF to finance the project alone, with the first reactor expected to be online in 2029. The Hinkley Point C project is expected to generate electricity for around six million homes when complete, highlighting the UK government's commitment to nuclear energy despite controversies.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>States are increasingly offering tax breaks to attract data centers, resulting in the forfeiture of hundreds of millions of dollars in tax revenue. These exemptions benefit tech giants like Amazon, Meta, and Google, but watchdog groups question the tradeoffs, citing low job creation and high electricity consumption. A CNBC analysis found that 42 states provide full or partial sales tax exemptions to data centers, with 16 states granting nearly $6 billion in exemptions over the past five years. Some states, like Virginia, classify the exemption as a "moderate economic benefit" despite the lost revenue. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>A new PBS documentary, *Caregiving*, explores the historical context behind the lack of resources and support for family caregivers in America. The film traces the evolution of caregiving policies, from early 20th-century almshouses to the exclusion of domestic workers from Social Security benefits and Medicare's decision not to cover long-term care. Activists are now trying to craft a new era of caregiving policy, with some signs of progress, including proposed tax credits for family caregivers. The director noted the overwhelming response they received when announcing the project, highlighting the urgent need for this story to be told.</p>

          <p>Multiple analysts predict that Bitcoin's value could nearly double by the end of 2025, potentially reaching $200,000. Bernstein calls its year-end estimate "high-conviction and conservative," while Standard Chartered analysts foresee a series of sharp increases. Bitwise analysts estimate Bitcoin's fair value at $230,000 but expect it to reach $200,000 by year-end, and 21Shares strategists also anticipate the cryptocurrency hitting this mark. Factors supporting this increase include rising U.S. fiscal debt, shifting ETF flows from gold to Bitcoin, and cooler inflation potentially leading to reduced interest rates.

        </div>
        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Despite claims of a rightward shift among Gen Z voters, recent data suggests this may be a misinterpretation of a one-off election event. While young adults voted for Trump at a higher rate in 2024 compared to 2020, they have not become more likely to identify as conservative or hold broadly conservative views. In fact, young adults have become less likely to identify as conservative since 2008, and their positions on specific political issues are mostly more liberal than previous generations. The shift appears to be driven by young independent voters who broke for Trump in 2024 due to dissatisfaction with the economy.</p>
