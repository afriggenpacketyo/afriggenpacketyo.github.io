          <p>Australian stocks experienced a downturn after Prime Minister Anthony Albanese secured a second term, signaling policy continuity amid global economic uncertainties. The S&P/ASX 200 index decreased, reversing previous gains, while the Australian dollar strengthened against the U.S. dollar. Meanwhile, most Asian markets were closed for holidays, and oil prices fell after OPEC+ agreed to increase production. U.S. futures also dipped, contrasting with Wall Street's strong performance the previous week. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>As egg freezing becomes more popular, experts like Vardit Ravitsky caution against over-reliance on the procedure, citing costs and no guarantees. Egg freezing cycles can cost upwards of $12,000, with added storage and fertilization fees. There are also risks for women who get pregnant later in life. Critics also suggest some companies offer egg freezing to retain female employees. Ravitsky suggests society should make it easier for women to have babies younger.</p>
