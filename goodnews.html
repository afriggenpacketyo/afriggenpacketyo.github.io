          <p>In a significant show of unity, several European and NATO leaders will join Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy for a meeting with U.S. President Donald Trump. This collective visit is seen as an effort to support Zelenskyy and ensure Europe's voice is heard in any peace negotiations concerning the war with Russia. The move follows a previous tense encounter between Trump and Zelenskyy and aims to prevent Ukraine from being pressured into an unfavorable deal, especially after Trump's recent summit with Vladimir Putin. Key figures like the European Commission President and NATO's Secretary-General have confirmed their attendance.</p>

          <p>This opinion piece reflects on the nature of peace, contrasting the conditional peace offered by the world with the steadfast peace offered by faith in God. The author recounts a personal experience during a flight delay at a tense airport, where the calmest person was a baby being nursed by its mother. This observation serves as a metaphor for finding tranquility and security through a connection with a higher power, even amidst chaos and uncertainty. The article encourages readers to exchange anxiety for a deeper, more resilient form of peace that is not dependent on external circumstances, but on trust and faith.</p>

          <p>Hurricane Erin, the first hurricane of the 2025 Atlantic season, has been downgraded to a Category 3 storm after briefly reaching Category 5 intensity. While it is not currently forecast to directly impact the United States, the storm is bringing heavy rain and strong winds to the Virgin Islands, Puerto Rico, and the Turks and Caicos Islands, where a tropical storm warning is in effect. The National Hurricane Center noted the storm is undergoing an "eyewall replacement cycle," which can cause temporary weakening before possible re-intensification. Forecasters are closely monitoring its path as it moves west-northwest over the Atlantic.</p>

          <p>Thorne Island, a derelict Napoleonic fort off the coast of Pembrokeshire, Wales, has been renovated into a luxury party venue and is now on the market for £3 million. The new owner, Mike Conner, purchased the abandoned property in 2017 and spent nearly five years and a significant investment to make it habitable, overcoming challenges like having no running water or electricity. Originally built in the 1850s to defend against French naval attacks, the historic fort now features 40 beds, en-suite bathrooms, and its own nightclub. The unique property offers a secluded, off-grid experience with panoramic sea views.</p>

          <p>A 46-year-old man was rescued in a dramatic helicopter operation after being trapped behind a powerful waterfall in California for two days. Ryan Wardwell was rappelling down a series of waterfalls known as the Seven Teacups when the river's strong currents pushed him off his lines and into a cave behind the cascade. After he was reported missing, search teams used a drone to locate him and a California Highway Patrol helicopter crew successfully hoisted him to safety. Wardwell was treated for dehydration and minor injuries before being reunited with his family, concluding what the local sheriff's office called a "stunning survival story."</p>

          <p>As the total cost of college approaches $100,000 per year at some institutions, a small number of U.S. schools offer a completely free education. This article highlights nine such colleges, including Berea College, College of the Ozarks, and the various U.S. military academies. While these institutions eliminate the financial burden of tuition, they often have highly selective admissions and may require students to participate in work programs or commit to years of military service after graduation. This model provides an alternative path for students concerned about affordability, though it comes with unique commitments.</p>

          <p>German Chancellor Friedrich Merz is confirmed to be among the European leaders accompanying Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy to Washington for peace talks with U.S. President Donald Trump. The delegation, which also includes leaders from France, the EU, and NATO, aims to discuss security guarantees and continued support for Ukraine. The gathering underscores European determination to remain involved in diplomatic efforts, particularly after a recent U.S.-Russia summit in Alaska that excluded Ukrainian representatives. Meanwhile, Russia has reportedly briefed allies like Turkey and Hungary on its own talks with the U.S.</p>

          <p>Indonesia is set to become the latest country to airdrop humanitarian aid into the Gaza Strip as the humanitarian crisis deepens amid expanding Israeli military operations. The coordination for the aid drop was reportedly requested at a high political level, with Israel's Prime Minister having invited any willing nation to participate in such efforts. So far, several countries, including Jordan, Egypt, the UAE, and multiple European nations, have conducted airdrops to deliver food and supplies to the besieged enclave. This move by Indonesia, a predominantly Muslim country, adds to the international effort to alleviate suffering in Gaza.</p>

          <p>Through a special visa program supported by Mexican state officials, elderly parents from Zacatecas were able to reunite with their son in California for the first time in nearly 25 years. The son, José Antonio Rodríguez, left Mexico as a young man and, being undocumented, could not return to visit his family. The emotional reunion in East Los Angeles highlights the profound and prolonged separation experienced by many immigrant families. The program provides a rare opportunity for these families to reconnect, though the U.S. approved only a small number of the visa applications submitted this year.</p>

          <p>A wildlife photographer in Lithuania was stunned to discover that his trail camera had captured footage of a brown bear, a species once thought to be extinct in the country. The sighting in the Šalčininkai district is one of several recent appearances that suggest the large mammal is returning to the local ecosystem. Conservationists are thrilled by the news, as the presence of a predator like the brown bear can be a key indicator of a healthy and thriving environment. The unexpected appearance highlights the value of trail cameras in monitoring wildlife and documenting the recovery of rare species.</p>

          <p>A rare humpback whale has been spotted off the coast of Kent in the UK, an exciting development for marine biologists and conservationists. The sighting, reported to the Kent Dolphin Project, provides further evidence of the species' recovery after being pushed to the brink of extinction. Humpback whales play a vital role in ocean ecosystems by regulating prey populations and contributing to carbon sequestration. While the return of these whales is a positive sign, threats such as ghost netting, ship strikes, and warming sea temperatures remain significant concerns for their long-term survival in the region.</p>

          <p>This article examines the transformation of a former industrial area in Washington, D.C., into the thriving neighborhood of NoMa, short for "north of Massachusetts Avenue." Originally known as "Swampoodle," the area's redevelopment since the 1990s has turned it into a prime example of a "YIMBY" (Yes In My Back Yard) urban development success. By embracing new construction and increased housing density, NoMa has become a vibrant community, offering a case study in how pro-housing policies can reshape and revitalize underutilized urban zones. The rebranding and development strategy successfully attracted new residents and businesses to the area.</p>

Hui, a former lawmaker, was facing criminal charges related to the 2019 pro-democracy protests and was one of several activists targeted by police with bounties for their arrest. In a social media post, Hui expressed gratitude to the Australian government for the protection but also conveyed his sadness at being a political refugee unable to return to his hometown.

          <p>New Zealand's national rugby team, the All Blacks, have returned to the top of the world rankings for the first time in four years after a 41-24 victory over Argentina. In their Rugby Championship opener, the All Blacks withstood a second-half comeback from the Pumas to secure the win. The victory, combined with South Africa's loss to Australia, was enough to push New Zealand back into the number one spot. Despite a spirited effort from Argentina after halftime, late tries from New Zealand sealed the match, extending the Pumas' winless streak against the All Blacks on home soil.</p>
