          <p>U.S. President Trump announced "great progress" in Ukraine peace negotiations following a meeting between his envoy, Steve Witkoff, and Russian President Vladimir Putin in Moscow. The Kremlin described the talks as "constructive," with both sides exchanging signals about potential strategic cooperation. This development comes just before a Trump-imposed deadline for a ceasefire, with the White House stating Trump is open to meeting with both Putin and Ukrainian President Zelensky. Despite the positive tone, expectations for a swift resolution remain low as Russia continues its attacks on Ukraine.</p>

          <p>Following pressure from the Trump administration, Apple has announced it will increase its investment in the United States by an additional $100 billion. The commitment, unveiled at the White House, is aimed at boosting the company's domestic supply chain and encouraging the production of Apple components within the U.S. As part of the investment, Apple plans to build new data centers and a smart glass production line in Kentucky. The move is seen as an effort by the tech giant to avoid potentially high tariffs on its products. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>A UK charity regulator has cleared Prince Harry of bullying allegations related to Sentebale, the African charity he co-founded. The investigation found no evidence of systemic bullying or misconduct by the Duke of Sussex, though it criticized all parties for allowing the internal dispute to become public. In a strongly worded statement, a spokesperson for Harry noted the findings but expressed disappointment that the charity's chair, who made the initial claims, would not face consequences for the damage caused. The dispute led to Harry and his co-founder resigning from their patron roles in March.</p>

          <p>For savers considering where to place a significant deposit like $10,000, the choice between a 6-month Certificate of Deposit (CD) and a money market account presents a key trade-off between rate security and liquidity. While current rates are comparable, a 6-month CD locks in its rate, guaranteeing a predictable return and protecting against potential future rate cuts by the Federal Reserve. A money market account offers more flexibility for withdrawals but has a variable rate that could decrease. This article suggests a CD may offer slightly higher and more secure earnings in the current economic climate. (not investment advice)</p>
