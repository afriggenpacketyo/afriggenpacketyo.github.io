          <p>The Dalai Lama has announced that the tradition of his reincarnation will continue after his death, ending years of speculation that he might be the final one. In a statement, the 90-year-old spiritual leader asserted that the process of finding his successor must follow Buddhist traditions and be managed by his Gaden Phodrang Trust. He implicitly warned China against meddling in the succession, a process Beijing claims it has the sole authority to approve. This decision is politically significant for Tibetans seeking to preserve their cultural and religious identity under Chinese rule.</p>

          <p>Spanish banking giant Santander has announced a ¬£2.65 billion deal to acquire its rival TSB, a move that could see the TSB brand vanish from UK high streets. If the deal is approved, Santander intends to integrate TSB into its UK group, which would create Britain's third-largest bank by personal current accounts. While the integration promises efficiency savings, it also raises concerns about potential job losses and branch closures, particularly in back-office roles and areas where both banks currently operate. The deal is expected to be finalized in early 2026. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>A new version of President Trump's major domestic policy bill includes a provision to increase tax credits for semiconductor manufacturers from 25% to 35%. This measure is designed to further incentivize companies like Intel, TSMC, and Micron to build and expand advanced chip manufacturing facilities within the United States. The proposed expansion builds upon the 2022 CHIPS and Science Act, reflecting Washington's ongoing strategy to strengthen the domestic semiconductor supply chain and reduce reliance on Asia.

          <p>Borussia Dortmund has advanced to the FIFA Club World Cup quarter-finals after a 2-1 victory over Monterrey, with Serhou Guirassy scoring both goals. The German club will now face Real Madrid in the next round. However, the highly anticipated matchup between brothers Jobe and Jude Bellingham will not occur, as Dortmund's Jobe Bellingham received his second yellow card of the tournament, resulting in a suspension for the upcoming game. Dortmund manager Niko Kovac expressed disappointment for the 19-year-old but noted the brothers are young and will have future opportunities to play against each other.</p>
