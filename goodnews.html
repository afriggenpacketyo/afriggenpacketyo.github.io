          <h2>Chinese Tourists in Japan Shift Towards Experiential Travel</h2>

          <p>Chinese tourism to Japan has rebounded past pre-pandemic levels, but with a shift in travel preferences. Instead of large group tours and shopping sprees, travelers now seek immersive experiences related to Japanese cuisine, culture, and scenery. This trend is driven by Chinese travelers in their 30s and 40s, many of whom have visited Japan before and are now choosing family trips with their children over group tours. The Japan National Tourism Organization is adapting its marketing strategies to better target this evolving demographic, including opening accounts on Chinese social media platforms. Despite a brief dip in tourism from Hong Kong due to concerns about a manga predicting a major disaster, overall visitor numbers continue to rise. The strong rebound indicates that the Japanese tourism industry is successfully adapting to changing consumer demands.</p>

          <p>Japan's chief tariff negotiator, Ryosei Akazawa, reported progress in tariff talks with U.S. officials, aiming for a potential deal as early as next month. After meeting with U.S. Treasury Secretary Scott Bessent and Commerce Secretary Howard Lutnick in Washington, Akazawa stated plans for another round of negotiations before the G7 summit in mid-June. Akazawa reiterated Japan's demand for the United States to remove all additional tariffs on Japanese imports, emphasizing that Tokyo's stance remains unchanged. The Japanese team has presented proposals including increased purchases of U.S. corn and soybeans and cooperation in resurrecting the U.S. shipbuilding capacity.</p>

          <p>A U.S. Marine, Sergeant Major Jody Armentrout, restrained a man who allegedly tried to open an emergency exit door mid-flight on a plane traveling from Tokyo to Houston. Armentrout noticed the man acting suspiciously and intervened when he saw him grab the emergency exit door. With the help of a passenger and flight attendants, Armentrout subdued the man and secured him with zip ties for the remainder of the flight. The flight was diverted to Seattle-Tacoma International Airport, where the man was taken to a local hospital for medical evaluation, and a second unruly passenger was removed for punching a bathroom door.</p>

          <p>China is upgrading its traditional mining industry with advanced technologies, including driverless electric vehicles, as seen in the Yimin open-pit coal mine in Inner Mongolia. The mine has deployed a fleet of 100 photovoltaic-battery-powered, self-driving trucks, representing the world‚Äôs largest deployment of autonomous electric mining trucks. This move addresses a shortage of drivers and improves safety in dangerous driving conditions, aligning with China‚Äôs push to digitally transform its coal industry. The Yimin mine is among the first to develop "intelligent coal mines" following guidance issued in 2020 by central government agencies.</p>

          <p>An appeals court refused to freeze a California judge's order halting the Trump administration from downsizing the federal workforce, which means that Department of Government Efficiency-led cuts remain on pause for now. The administration had sought an emergency stay of an injunction issued by U.S. Judge Susan Illston of San Francisco in a lawsuit brought by labor unions and cities, including San Francisco and Chicago. The judge's order questioned whether President Trump's administration was acting lawfully in trying to pare the federal workforce. The appeals court wrote that the Executive Order at issue far exceeds the President's supervisory powers under the Constitution.</p>

          <p>Loretta Swit, best known for her role as Maj. Margaret Houlihan on the TV series "M*A*S*H," has died at her home in New York City at the age of 87. Swit starred on stage and screen, but she was perhaps best known for her long-running role as the head nurse who was a foil to Alan Alda's Capt. Benjamin Franklin "Hawkeye" Pierce on "M*A*S*H," which aired for 11 seasons on CBS, from 1972 to 1983. Swit won two Emmys for her performances on "M*A*S*H" and was nominated eight other times for her work on the show. Her portrayal of Margaret 'Hot Lips' Houlihan was groundbreaking, bringing heart, humor, and strength to one of television comedy's most enduring roles.</p>
