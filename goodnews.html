          <p>The head of the UK's university admissions service, Ucas, predicts a record number of 18-year-old domestic students will secure their first-choice university placement, even if they narrowly miss their A-level grades. This flexibility stems from universities seeking financial stability from three-year UK undergraduates due to a decline and increased uncertainty in international student enrollment. Consequently, fewer spots are expected to be available through the clearing process, as more initial offers are likely to be accepted.</p>

          <p>Italy has approved the construction of the Strait of Messina Bridge, a $15.5 billion project that will connect Sicily to the mainland and become the world's longest suspension bridge. The project, which has been debated for decades, is designed to handle 6,000 cars per hour and 200 trains daily. Despite its approval, the bridge faces significant opposition due to concerns over environmental impact, potential co-opting by organized crime, and the region's seismic activity.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>New archaeological research indicates that survivors of the AD 79 Mount Vesuvius eruption, along with other settlers, returned to live in Pompeii. Evidence suggests a "precarious" settlement, akin to a camp, existed among the ruins until the 5th century. These inhabitants likely lived in the upper floors of buried structures, scavenging for valuable materials in the devastated city. This discovery challenges the long-held belief that the site was completely abandoned, revealing a previously overlooked chapter of Pompeii's history.</p>

          <p>Brian Robbins, the co-CEO of Paramount Global and head of its film studio, has stepped down from his position just before the finalization of the company's takeover by Skydance Media. The move was anticipated as Skydance had already announced its new leadership team, which will not include Robbins. During his tenure, Robbins oversaw major franchises like "Mission: Impossible" and the studio's highest-grossing film, "Top Gun: Maverick." His departure is part of a broader leadership shakeup as the entertainment giant transitions to new ownership.</p>

          <p>This article analyzes the potential returns on a $10,000 deposit in either a 6-month Certificate of Deposit (CD) or a money market account in the current interest rate environment. While both offer similar high rates now, the CD provides a fixed, guaranteed return, making it a more predictable option. Given that interest rates are expected to be cut later in the year, the variable rate of a money market account will likely decline, making a 6-month CD the potentially higher-earning and more secure choice for savers.
