          <p>In a Nations League semifinal match, Portugal secured a 2-1 victory against Germany at Bayern Munich's Allianz Arena, despite Germany's Joshua Kimmich marking his 100th appearance with an assist. Kimmich expressed disappointment in the team's performance, citing a lack of energy and activity on the ball as contributing factors to the loss. Cristiano Ronaldo, playing his 220th game for Portugal, scored the winning goal, marking his 137th international goal and overshadowing Kimmich's milestone.

          <p>Palisades Charter High School held its graduation ceremony at the Hollywood Bowl after a fire damaged their school earlier in the year. The event was bittersweet for students, as it was not held at their beloved Stadium by the Sea, but they were grateful for the opportunity. The ceremony featured speakers such as Steve Kerr and Billy Crystal, who emphasized the students' resilience in the face of adversity. The Hollywood Bowl was offered to the school at a reduced cost, and the event proceeded with traditional graduation elements, celebrating the graduates' achievements.</p>

          <p>A Chinese study of dinosaur feather fossils trapped in Burmese amber has provided new insights into the evolution of flight feathers, an essential step that allowed early birds to surpass their dinosaur relatives in conquering the skies. Researchers from the Chinese Academy of Sciences conducted a detailed structural study of feathers dating back 99 million years to the Cretaceous period. The study suggests that the development of feathers that generate thrust and lift was crucial for the evolution of birds, distinguishing them from most feathered dinosaurs that lacked the same flying capabilities.</p>

          <p>UK scientists have discovered that the first bacteria our bodies encounter after birth may protect against dangerous infections. The study showed that beneficial bacteria could halve the risk of young children being admitted to the hospital with lung infections. Researchers analyzed stool samples from over 1,000 newborns and tracked their health for two years, finding that Bifidobacterium longum had a protective effect. The exact mechanism is still being investigated, but it's believed that these bacteria or their byproducts interact with the immune system and influence its maturation.</p>

          <p>The upcoming NBA Finals between the Oklahoma City Thunder and the Indiana Pacers marks a generational shift, with both teams primarily composed of Gen Z players. Led by stars like Shai Gilgeous-Alexander and Tyrese Haliburton, these young teams represent a new blueprint for the league, moving away from the era of super teams. The Thunder, with an average age of 24.148, and the Pacers, at 25.263, are among the youngest teams in NBA history to reach the championship. Both teams have built their rosters through strategic draft picks and trades, connecting with younger fans through social media.</p>

          <p>Women who are trying to conceive, are pregnant, or are breastfeeding are being advised to stop using weight-loss injections due to potential harm to the unborn baby. Drug safety experts in the UK have expressed concerns about the use of GLP-1 medicines like Wegovy and Mounjaro, emphasizing that the effects on unborn babies are unknown. The Medicines and Healthcare products Regulatory Agency (MHRA) recommends using contraception while taking these medications and for a period afterward. There are also concerns that the growing popularity of these injections means many women are not getting proper medical advice.</p>
