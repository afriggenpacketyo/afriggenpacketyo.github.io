          <h2>Fed's Bostic Favors Limited Rate Cuts Amid Inflation Concerns</h2>
          <div class="timestamp">2025-05-19 09:59:17 EDT</div>
        </div>
        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Atlanta Fed President Raphael Bostic indicated he prefers only one interest rate cut this year, balancing potential inflation pressures with recession worries. Bostic noted that tariffs have been larger than anticipated, potentially impacting inflation expectations. He expressed concern about inflation, highlighting the movement of expectations in a "troublesome way," which could complicate the Fed's mandate to support stable prices and maximum employment. The tariff landscape has shifted since President Donald Trump took office, with a 90-day pause on tariffs for most countries and a separate truce with China, though tariffs remain higher than pre-Trump levels.

          <p>Warren Buffett will no longer take the stage at Berkshire Hathaway's annual shareholder meeting, passing the tradition to his successor, Greg Abel.

          <p>Britain and the European Union have reached a landmark agreement aimed at enhancing security cooperation and reducing trade barriers introduced by Brexit. The deal includes provisions for British citizens to use electronic gates in Europe, easier pet travel, and the resumption of British meat product sales in the EU. A key aspect involves allowing European boats access to U.K. fishing waters until June 30, 2038, in exchange for reduced trade barriers for British food products. The agreement also includes plans for a "youth experience" program to facilitate travel and work opportunities for young Europeans in Britain and vice versa.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>The CNBC Investing Club is increasing its stake in GE Vernova, an energy equipment manufacturer, taking advantage of a market pullback. The decision follows a recent U.S. credit rating downgrade by Moody's and an overbought signal from the S&P Short Range Oscillator. The Investing Club believes GE Vernova will benefit from increased investment in reliable power and grid infrastructure, driven by data center expansion, manufacturing activity, and the rise of electric vehicles. Additionally, the company is expected to benefit from trade deals and Saudi Arabia's commitment to purchase $14 billion worth of gas turbines and energy solutions. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>Prime Minister Keir Starmer is wagering that the public is ready to move past Brexit with a new agreement aimed at smoothing relations with the EU. The deal focuses on reducing friction within existing parameters rather than reopening fundamental questions about membership in the single market or customs union. While the Conservatives have criticized the deal as a "surrender," the Labour government believes it reflects a pragmatic approach to improving the UK's relationship with the EU. The success of this strategy hinges on whether the opposition parties campaign heavily against the deal, indicating continued controversy over Brexit.</p>
