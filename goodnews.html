          <p>Manchester United's Bruno Fernandes is reportedly considering a lucrative offer to join Saudi Pro-League club Al-Hilal, with his representatives already in discussions with the club. While Fernandes remains committed to his responsibilities as captain, he has not guaranteed his future with Manchester United, leading to speculation about his departure. Manchester United is said to be relaxed about the situation, knowing that selling Fernandes could provide funds to reshape the squad. Fernandes has been a key player for Manchester United, but former skipper Roy Keane has criticized his lack of discipline.</p>

          <p>A new report from WWF highlights the importance of UK saltmarshes as vital "sinks" that lock away climate-warming greenhouse gases in layers of mud. The charity is calling for these muddy, tidal habitats to be added to the official UK inventory of carbon emissions and removals. Saltmarshes capture carbon in the soils, making them as important for climate mitigation as trees. The UK has lost about 85% of its saltmarshes since 1860, with many drained for agriculture.</p>
