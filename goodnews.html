          <p>The Buss family has reportedly agreed to sell a controlling interest in the Los Angeles Lakers to Mark Walter, the owner of the L.A. Dodgers, in a deal valued at $10 billion, making the Lakers the most valuable sports franchise globally. Jeanie Buss will remain as governor, representing the team in league matters, while Walter, also involved with the Professional Women's Hockey League, Los Angeles Sparks, Chelsea, and Cadillac Formula 1 racing team, will assume majority ownership. Magic Johnson, previously a part-owner, congratulated Jeanie Buss and praised Walter's accomplishments with the Dodgers. This comes after the Lakers acquired Luka Donƒçiƒá in a stunning trade, marking another significant event for the franchise. The team's record stands at 2236-1467 with 11 NBA titles since the Buss family's acquisition in 1979.</p>

          <p>The State Department has introduced new guidelines for enhanced social media screening of international student visa applicants, requiring them to set their accounts to "public" and look for signs of "hostility" toward the U.S. Officials will be looking for any indications of negativity toward American citizens, culture, government, institutions, or founding principles. This effort aims to ensure proper screening of individuals entering the country and enhance the safety of the U.S. and its universities. Counselors are already advising foreign students to remove potentially problematic posts from their social media profiles.</p>

          <p>A federal appeals court has ruled that American taxpayers will not fund President Donald Trump's appeal in the $83 million defamation case brought by E. Jean Carroll. The court denied Trump's request to have Justice Department lawyers represent him in the appeal, which stems from Trump's denial of Carroll's accusation of sexual assault. DOJ lawyers had argued that the alleged conduct fell within his presidential role, but the court disagreed. Oral arguments in Trump's appeal are scheduled for June 24.</p>

          <p>Trent Alexander-Arnold's debut for Real Madrid saw a shaky start but improved performance as the game progressed. He was caught out of position multiple times early on but contributed to Madrid's goal by intercepting a pass and passing to Gonzalo Garcia. By halftime, his passing accuracy was second only to Vinicius, and he played further forward in the second half. He finished the game with more crosses, entries into the final third, and passes in the final third than any of his teammates, though he also lost possession more than anyone else.</p>

After scratching the ticket, he showed it to his wife, who informed him of the true amount, but remained skeptical. Brown plans to pay off his house and put the rest of the winnings into a trust.</p>

          <p>Hundreds of endangered northern tidewater gobies were released back into Topanga Lagoon in Malibu, five months after being rescued from the Palisades fire. The fish were evacuated in January to protect them from habitat destruction and potential sediment runoff caused by the fire. The lagoon has since recovered, creating a suitable environment for their return, and the fish had even grown "chubby" at the aquariums where they were temporarily housed. The repatriation marks a positive moment amidst environmental and social upheaval, highlighting the importance of preserving biodiversity.</p>

          <p>An additional 2.7 million households in Britain will receive ¬£150 off their energy bills this winter as the government changes the rules on who qualifies for the Warm Home Discount. The qualification about property size, type, and home energy score is being scrapped, extending the discount to more homes, including almost a million households with children. While debt charities and energy groups have welcomed the move, some say the scheme still leaves out some of those most at risk. The bill for expanding the Warm Home Discount will be paid by energy companies and could be passed on through the Standing Charge.</p>
