          <p>A wellness trend encouraging people to jump 50 times immediately after getting out of bed is gaining viral traction on TikTok. Popularized by creator Kathryn Smith, the practice is promoted as a simple, accessible way to increase blood flow, raise body temperature, and boost energy and mood to start the day. A wellness expert noted that the trend's appeal lies in its low-effort nature compared to more traditional workouts, making it an easy way to incorporate morning movement, though caution is advised for those with pre-existing health conditions.</p>

          <p>President Trump is planning to attend a meeting of generals and admirals called by Defense Secretary Pete Hegseth at Quantico. The gathering is considered unusual due to its large scale and the short notice on which it was called, bringing in senior military leaders from around the world. While the White House has not commented, the meeting has drawn attention for its rarity, though regularly scheduled meetings with military leadership are common.</p>

          <p>In a close referendum, Swiss voters have narrowly approved a government plan to introduce a voluntary electronic identity card system. The proposal passed with 50.4% of the vote, a much tighter margin than polls had predicted. This revised plan, which keeps data storage decentralized on users' smartphones and under government control, was designed to address privacy concerns that led to the rejection of a similar proposal in 2021.</p>
