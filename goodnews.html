          <p>UK-based AI startup Nscale has rapidly emerged as a key player in the artificial intelligence infrastructure market, securing close to $700 million from Nvidia and a five-year, $6.2 billion agreement with Microsoft and Aker. The company, which spun out of a cryptocurrency mining infrastructure firm, is now partnering with Nvidia, Microsoft, and OpenAI to develop hyperscale AI infrastructure in Europe, including a supercomputer in the UK. Nscale aims to address Europe's computing capacity shortage and fragmented market, with plans to deploy hundreds of thousands of Nvidia GPUs by 2027. This rapid expansion positions Nscale as a significant force in the global AI landscape, attracting substantial investment and strategic alliances.</p>

          <p>Chinese telecommunications giant Huawei announced plans to launch its "Atlas 950 SuperCluster" next year, utilizing in-house Ascend chips and claiming it will be the world's most powerful AI computing system. This development directly challenges Nvidia, as China pushes for self-reliance in advanced semiconductors amid ongoing US export restrictions. The system groups numerous homegrown chips to achieve high computing capabilities, with a more advanced Atlas 960 version planned for 2027 supporting over 1 million Ascend chips. Huawei's announcement aligns with China's emphasis on domestic chip technologies, underscoring its ambition to become a global AI leader despite potential exaggerations of its technical prowess.</p>

          <p>Novo Nordisk announced that late-stage trial results for its once-daily oral semaglutide pill, dubbed the "Wegovy pill," showed "significant" weight reduction comparable to its injectable counterpart. The Oasis 4 trial reported an average weight reduction of 16.6% after 64 weeks in patients with obesity or overweight and comorbidities. This development intensifies the race for an oral obesity treatment, offering patients an alternative to injections. The pill is currently under FDA review, with a decision expected in the fourth quarter, and aims to be manufactured entirely in the U.S. It offers a competitive profile against rivals like Eli Lilly's Orforglipron.</p>

          <p>Japan's Nikkei 225 index rose 1.13% to a fresh record high, driven by real estate and technology sectors, as Asian markets reacted to the Federal Reserve's expected 25-basis-point rate cut. The Fed framed the cut as "risk management" and indicated two more reductions this year, with further cuts in 2026 and 2027, but none in 2028. Other Asian markets traded mixed, while the Bank of Japan is anticipated to keep its policy rates steady. The article notes that while Japan's exporters received some relief from potential tariffs, they could still be impacted by a future slowdown in global trade. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>Pitcher Blake Snell delivered his best performance as a Dodger, throwing seven scoreless innings with a season-high 12 strikeouts, leading his team to a 5-0 victory over the Philadelphia Phillies. Manager Dave Roberts showed unusual trust, allowing Snell to finish the seventh inning after two walks, a decision Snell rewarded by striking out the final batter. This dominant outing provided a crucial boost for the Dodgers, who are aiming to defend their World Series title, especially as their bullpen has faced recent struggles. Snell's command and effective breaking pitches were key to his success in this playoff-type game.</p>

          <p>The European Union and China parliaments are set to hold their first joint session in seven years on October 16 in Brussels, signaling a remarkable turnaround in their strained relations. This meeting follows months of efforts to lift mutual restrictions, including sanctions exchanged in 2021 over alleged human rights abuses in Xinjiang. The agenda is pending confirmation, with a German lawmaker leading the European side. This initiative aims to establish a biannual exchange, with MEPs planning a return visit to Beijing in May 2026. The resumption of parliamentary dialogue marks a significant diplomatic thaw between the two major powers.</p>

          <p>Tropical Storm Gabrielle has formed in the central Atlantic, ending an unusual nearly three-week drought of storms during the peak hurricane season. The storm, with sustained winds of 50 mph, is forecast to become a hurricane by Sunday as it moves northwest. While direct US impacts are not expected, it may churn up surf on the East Coast next week. The article highlights that this season's quiet period, the second since 1950, was due to dry, stable air and stronger-than-usual wind shear, despite warm ocean temperatures. This development marks a shift in an uncharacteristically calm hurricane season.</p>

          <p>Saudi Arabia and Pakistan have signed a strategic mutual defense pact, agreeing to consider an attack on one as "an aggression against both," thereby deepening their decades-long security partnership. This enhanced agreement comes as Gulf Arab states express growing wariness about the reliability of the United States as a security guarantor, particularly after Israel's attack on Qatar. The pact follows a tense conflict between Pakistan and India, where Saudi Arabia reportedly played a de-escalating role. This move solidifies a significant regional alliance, impacting geopolitical dynamics and security in the Middle East and South Asia.</p>

          <p>In an excerpt from her new book "107 Days," former Vice President Kamala Harris reveals that Pete Buttigieg was her "first choice" for a 2024 running mate, but she deemed the pairing too risky for America. Harris writes that Buttigieg "would have been an ideal partner — if I were a straight white man," citing the challenges of asking America to accept a Black woman married to a Jewish man. She ultimately chose Minnesota Gov. Tim Walz after Joe Biden dropped out of the race. The article highlights the complex considerations of identity politics in presidential campaigns.</p>

          <p>Following the US Federal Reserve's first interest rate cut of the year, analysts anticipate China's central bank (PBOC) will engage in moderate monetary easing, supporting the yuan. The Fed's 0.25 percentage point cut provides more room for looser monetary policy in China. Experts forecast a smaller rate cut from the PBOC compared to the Fed this year, which is expected to narrow the interest rate gap and ease capital outflow pressures on the yuan. This article suggests a cautious and strategic approach by China to its monetary policy in response to global economic shifts. (not investment advice)</p>

NASA confirmed the issue was resolved, explaining that an early warning system initiated shutdowns due to a conservative safeguard in software settings. The cargo ship, carrying over 11,000 pounds of equipment and supplies, including spare parts and holiday treats, is now expected to arrive Thursday morning. This maiden flight of the upgraded Cygnus XL, which is longer and carries more cargo, marks a significant milestone for Northrop Grumman's resupply missions.</p>
