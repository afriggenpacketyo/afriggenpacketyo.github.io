          <p>A significant heat wave is forecasted to sweep across the eastern United States, bringing several days of record-high temperatures. The National Weather Service has issued extreme heat alerts for over 140 million Americans, with the total number affected by heat advisories rising to 200 million. Potential daily record highs are predicted for parts of the Rockies and Plains, with temperatures in the 90s expected to reach the mid-Atlantic and Northeast. The heat wave is expected to shift into the Midwest and Ohio Valley by the end of the weekend and arrive in the Northeast and mid-Atlantic on Sunday, lasting through the first half of next week. The National Weather Service warns of a "High Risk" of extreme heat in parts of the Northeast, with temperatures forecast to be well into the 90s or even triple digits. The simplest way to avoid heat-related illnesses is to stay out of the sun and avoid extended time outdoors in extreme temperatures, experts say. The article provides maps illustrating the forecast highs across the country and their departures from average temperatures.</p>

          <p>Photographer Miora Rajaonary's project, Sahy Rano, features portraits of eight women to raise awareness of female genital schistosomiasis (FGS), a neglected tropical disease affecting millions in Africa. The women, who contracted FGS through contact with infected water, wear traditional Malagasy face masks to emphasize their courage in breaking taboos. The painted backdrop and laundry rope in the photos symbolize the women's connection to water and their daily lives. The exhibit aims to highlight the underdiagnosed disease and its impact on women's sexual and reproductive health.</p>

          <p>A federal appeals court has blocked a Louisiana law requiring the Ten Commandments to be displayed in public school classrooms, deeming it unconstitutional. Civil liberties groups argued the mandate violates the separation of church and state and would isolate non-Christian students. Republicans have supported the law, claiming the Ten Commandments are historically significant and foundational to U.S. law. The state plans to appeal the ruling, potentially taking it to the U.S. Supreme Court. The article examines the ongoing debate over religion in public schools and the legal challenges to such mandates.</p>
