          <p>Veteran England midfielder Jordan Henderson has signed a two-year contract with Premier League club Brentford following his departure from Dutch side Ajax. The move marks a return to English football for the 35-year-old, who is renowned for his 12-year, trophy-laden tenure at Liverpool. This signing follows brief, less successful spells at Al-Ettifaq in Saudi Arabia and then Ajax, and comes after he received an England national team recall in March.</p>

          <p>The price difference between Hong Kong-listed H-shares and mainland-listed A-shares for dual-listed Chinese firms has reached its smallest point since June 2020. This convergence is attributed to a weaker US dollar prompting global investors to diversify into Hong Kong, alongside strong buying from mainland investors seeking exposure to China's tech sector. Analysts suggest Hong Kong stocks remain attractive due to their valuation and expected capital inflows. (not investment advice)</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Reddit is introducing age verification for UK users to restrict access to mature content, aligning with the country's new Online Safety Act. The platform will use a third-party service, Persona, to verify age via selfies or government ID, with Reddit only retaining the user's verification status and date of birth. While regulator Ofcom supports the move, critics raise concerns about user privacy, data collection, and the potential for circumvention of the new measures.</p>

          <p>The rescheduled Women's Africa Cup of Nations (WAFCON) is underway in Morocco, showcasing top talent but also highlighting persistent off-field problems that hinder its potential. Issues include last-minute scheduling, the use of smaller stadiums, and financial disputes, such as those affecting the South African team's preparations. While the prize money has increased, it still lags significantly behind the men's tournament and other women's continental championships, reflecting a wider pay gap and lack of support in the women's game.</p>

          <p>Following the conclusion of the inaugural expanded Club World Cup, FIFA is reportedly considering further expansion to 48 teams for the 2029 edition and is facing calls from some clubs to hold it biennially. Despite initial criticism, the tournament proved commercially successful, generating $2.1 billion in revenue, largely due to a significant prize fund and a major global broadcast deal. However, concerns over player welfare and a packed football calendar remain unresolved, with the players' union having filed a legal complaint.</p>

          <p>The UK government is introducing a new grant scheme to encourage the adoption of electric vehicles (EVs), offering discounts of up to £3,750 on eligible cars costing less than £37,000. The £650 million program is part of the government's push to ban the sale of new petrol and diesel cars by 2030. While the automotive industry has welcomed the move, critics and consumers point to the insufficient number of public charging points as a major barrier to widespread EV adoption.</p>

Since they began working together, Scheffler switched to a mallet putter and improved his green reading, leading to a dominant season with seven wins, including his second Masters. Kenyon, who has coached multiple major winners, helped Scheffler rise from outside the top 150 in putting to inside the top 15, solidifying his position as the world's best player.</p>

          <p>A U.S. appeals court has issued a temporary stay, preserving protections for nearly 12,000 Afghans that were set to expire under a Trump administration decision. The administration had moved to end Temporary Protected Status (TPS) for Afghans, which allows them to work legally and shields them from deportation. Immigrant advocacy groups sued to block the move, arguing it is not safe for Afghans to return, and the court's intervention keeps the protections in place for at least another week while it considers the case.</p>

          <p>Norway has become a global leader in the transition to electric vehicles (EVs), with over 93% of new car sales in 2025 being electric. This success is attributed to long-standing government policies, including significant tax exemptions for EVs, higher taxes on polluting cars, and heavy investment in a robust public charging infrastructure. As a result, EVs are now a common sight, contributing to cleaner air and quieter cities, particularly in the capital, Oslo, which serves as a model for other nations.</p>
