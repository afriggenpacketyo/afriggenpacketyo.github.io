          <p>This article discusses how Hong Kong can contribute to defending the rules-based international order amidst significant global shifts, particularly concerning the evolving relationship between the United States and China. It notes that some Western perspectives view China's economic practices as disruptive, citing an imbalance where China produces excessively while consuming too little, leading to manufacturing overcapacity. The article suggests Hong Kong, with its unique position and understanding of both Western and Chinese systems, can play a crucial role in mediating and promoting a more balanced global economic order. The author emphasizes the importance of Hong Kong leveraging its strengths to foster international cooperation and uphold the principles of fair trade and mutual respect.</p>

          <p>Oliver Widger, an Oregon man, completed a weeks-long sailing journey to Hawaii with his cat, Phoenix, after quitting his job and using his retirement savings. Widger, who gained a large online following documenting his trip, was greeted by cheering fans and Hawaii's Governor Josh Green at the Waikiki Yacht Club. Widger's decision to pursue his dream was motivated by a diagnosis of Klippel-Feil syndrome, a condition that carries a risk of paralysis, and a desire to escape his disliked managerial job. His journey was not without challenges, including a rudder failure, but he also experienced moments of tranquility and connection with nature.</p>

          <p>The Japanese government is planning to improve the working conditions and salaries of chefs at its overseas diplomatic missions to attract talent amid growing global interest in Japanese cuisine. The annual salary for these chefs will increase to over 6 million yen ($41,000), up from the current average of 4 to 4.5 million yen, and they will also have the option of government-covered rented accommodation. Foreign Minister Takeshi Iwaya emphasized the significant role chefs play in hosting foreign dignitaries and promoting Japanese food, referring to them as "food diplomats."</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>South Western Railway (SWR) has been renationalized, marking the first train company to return to public ownership under the Labour government. The government describes the move as a "new dawn for rail," focusing on improving services and reinvesting profits into infrastructure, though it stopped short of promising lower fares. Unions have voiced concerns regarding outsourcing to private companies, while the opposition Conservatives are urging Labour to fulfill their promises. SWR trains will now be managed by the Department for Transport (DfT) Operator and integrated into Great British Railways (GBR), pending parliamentary approval.</p>

          <p>Nigel Farage's Reform UK party has pledged to fully reinstate winter fuel payments to pensioners and abolish the two-child benefit cap if they gain power, intensifying the policy divisions within the Labour party. The party plans to fund these policies by reducing net-zero projects and eliminating hotels for asylum seekers. This announcement follows mounting pressure on Prime Minister Sir Keir Starmer to address cuts to winter fuel payments and reconsider the two-child benefit cap, a policy introduced in 2017 that restricts benefits for families with more than two children.</p>

          <p>Swarms of midges have become a significant nuisance at the World Exposition in Osaka, causing discomfort to visitors and raising concerns about potential health issues. The small flies have been found on the walls and pillars of the Grand Ring, forcing people to swat them away to avoid swallowing them. While these midges don't bite, inhaling dead ones can trigger asthma and allergic reactions, prompting organizers to take action by spraying insecticide, treating areas with growth inhibitors, and installing insect repellent lights.</p>

          <p>Susan Brownmiller, a feminist author and activist, passed away at 90, leaving behind a legacy marked by her influential book "Against Our Will: Men, Women and Sexual Assault."

It offered a comprehensive history of sexual assault across centuries and examined its use as a wartime tactic, significantly impacting society's attitude toward sexual assault and leading to legal reforms.</p>
