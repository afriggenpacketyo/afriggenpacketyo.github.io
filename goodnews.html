          <p>The Wimbledon 2025 men's final will feature a highly anticipated match between the world's top two players, Italy's Jannik Sinner and Spain's Carlos Alcaraz. Their rivalry is being hailed as a defining duel for the current generation of men's tennis, possessing the talent, personality, and high-stakes encounters reminiscent of the legendary Federer-Nadal era. This championship showdown is a direct rematch of their recent classic at the French Open, where Alcaraz emerged victorious after a grueling five-set battle. The article explores their contrasting on-court personas—Sinner's stoicism versus Alcaraz's expressive energy—and the immense excitement their competition generates for the sport's future.</p>

          <p>Erik and Lyle Menendez, who are serving sentences for the 1989 murders of their parents, have achieved a significant legal victory ahead of their August parole hearing. A Los Angeles judge has ordered the state to justify why certain evidence was excluded from their trial, including a letter alleging sexual abuse by their father and an affidavit from a former boy band member claiming he was also sexually assaulted by Jose Menendez. This court order represents a prima facie showing that the brothers may be entitled to habeas relief, a major development in their decades-long claim that they acted in self-defense.</p>

          <p>Bronny James had a notable performance in the NBA Summer League, scoring 14 points in a Lakers victory while his father, LeBron James, watched and offered advice from a courtside seat. Throughout the game, LeBron could be seen and heard instructing his son on specific plays, encouraging him to be more aggressive and make decisive moves. Bronny responded to the coaching, executing key plays including a three-pointer shortly after his father yelled "Knock it down!" The article highlights the unique father-son dynamic on display and Bronny's solid contributions on both offense and defense during the game.</p>

          <p>The United Kingdom continues to experience its third heatwave of the year, with temperatures expected to reach 31C on Sunday. On Saturday, Scotland, Wales, and Northern Ireland all recorded their warmest day of the year so far. Amber heat health alerts remain active for southern and eastern England, warning of potential health impacts, particularly for the elderly and those with pre-existing conditions. The heatwave has prompted hosepipe bans and wildfire warnings, but relief is expected as a cooler weather system is forecast to bring rain and lower temperatures to most of the country starting Monday.</p>

          <h2>Study Suggests China's Tibetan Mega-Dam May Increase Water Flow to India in Dry Seasons</h2>
          <div class="timestamp">2025-07-13 00:00:09 EDT</div>
        </div>
        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>A new scientific study indicates that China's controversial mega-dam project in Tibet may not cause the droughts in India that were initially feared. By analyzing data from two existing upstream dams, researchers found that water flows downstream actually increased during dry seasons. The study observed that low flows in February rose by over 50 percent, suggesting that the dams help regulate water levels by releasing stored water. This finding provides a new perspective on the potential hydrological impact of China's massive infrastructure projects on neighboring countries, countering some of the prevailing concerns about water scarcity.</p>

          <p>Start-up companies are developing lab-grown cheese using precision fermentation to produce casein, the key protein in milk, without involving animals. Firms like UK-based Better Dairy are creating products like cheddar that they claim taste like the real thing and melt well, aiming for a market launch in the next few years. However, they face significant challenges, including a recent decline in plant-based cheese sales, consumer concerns about ultra-processed foods, and high initial costs. Despite these hurdles, producers believe they can overcome the quality gap of current vegan cheeses and eventually compete with traditional dairy on price and taste.</p>
