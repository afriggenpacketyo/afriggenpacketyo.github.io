          <p>The UK has finalized its largest-ever warship export agreement, a £10 billion deal to supply Norway with at least five Type 26 anti-submarine frigates. The warships will be constructed at BAE Systems' shipyards in Glasgow, supporting an estimated 4,000 UK jobs and strengthening NATO's northern maritime capabilities. This strategic partnership aims to create a combined fleet to counter Russian submarine activity in the North Atlantic. The deal was secured over competing bids from France, Germany, and the United States, marking a significant win for the British defense industry. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>At 39 years and 239 days old, Brighton's James Milner has become the second-oldest player to score a goal in the Premier League, converting a penalty in a 2-1 victory against Manchester City. This achievement adds a unique bookend to his career, as he was also the second-youngest scorer back in 2002 with Leeds United. The goal marked his first in six years and highlighted his remarkable longevity and fitness in top-flight football. Teammates and pundits praised Milner's experience and character, calling him a "legend of the game" for his sustained high-level performance.</p>

          <p>A U.S. federal judge has issued a temporary restraining order preventing the Trump administration from deporting 10 unaccompanied migrant children back to Guatemala. The ruling came after advocacy groups argued the planned removals would violate U.S. laws that provide specific protections for vulnerable children arriving at the border without guardians. The administration had recently established an agreement with Guatemala to facilitate such deportations. The judge's 14-day order blocks the immediate transfer of the children, aged 10 to 17, to immigration enforcement for removal.</p>

          <p>During informal talks, European Union foreign ministers brainstormed new measures to support Ukraine, signaling a potential long-term strategic shift. Among the ideas discussed were secondary sanctions targeting Russia's trading partners and establishing "safe haven" production sites for Ukrainian arms on EU soil. Ministers also revisited the contentious idea of seizing frozen Russian central bank assets to fund Ukraine's reconstruction, a move that could mark a significant turning point in economic pressure. Additionally, a proposal to move the EU's military training mission onto Ukrainian soil in the event of a ceasefire gained broad support.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>A massive restoration project off the coast of Southern California has successfully revived a vital kelp forest that had declined by 80%. Led by The Bay Foundation, the 13-year effort involved divers using hammers to smash and remove 5.8 million voracious purple sea urchins from an 80-acre area. The urchin population had exploded due to an ecological imbalance, creating "urchin barrens" where kelp could not grow. With the urchins cleared, the kelp has returned rapidly, restoring critical habitat for over 800 marine species and demonstrating a successful model for ecosystem recovery.</p>

The jackpot has been growing since May 31, marking the sixth time the prize has surpassed the billion-dollar threshold.

          <p>A pet sitter in Llanharan, Wales, had a surprising experience when the pregnant Labrador she was watching went into labor a week earlier than expected. Rhian Boxall was looking after Tilly, her brother's dog, who was only expected to have about six puppies but ended up giving birth to fourteen over a 15-hour period. With the dog's owner on holiday abroad, Boxall and her family managed the delivery, successfully saving twelve of the pups, including one born outside that required warming with a hairdryer.
