          <p>A small plane carrying skydivers crashed shortly after takeoff from Cross Keys Airport in Williamstown, New Jersey, injuring all 15 people on board. The pilot reported engine trouble and attempted to return to the airport but was unsuccessful, crashing in a wooded area. Miraculously, there were no fatalities, though some injuries were reported as critical, and several passengers were covered in jet fuel. The same aircraft was involved in a 2023 incident where its nose landing gear collapsed upon landing.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Following a strong June jobs report, market analyst Jim Cramer argued that the data validates the Federal Reserve's decision to hold off on interest rate cuts, despite pressure from President Trump. The better-than-expected payroll growth and lower unemployment rate suggest the economy remains robust, negating the need for immediate stimulus. The article also notes that in an overbought market, investors might consider trimming profits from strongly performing stocks like Broadcom or certain bank stocks. (not investment advice)</p>

          <div class="timestamp">2025-07-03 11:15:00 EDT</div>
        </div>
        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>This article reflects on the long-standing historical trend of older generations expressing concern and sometimes disdain for the habits and values of younger people. Using examples from a 1925 Atlantic article about the perceived delinquencies of youth to more modern anxieties, the author examines the line between empathetic observation and condescending judgment. The piece advocates for writing about generational shifts with humility, recognizing young adults as people navigating the unique challenges and opportunities of their time rather than as a monolithic group to be scrutinized.</p>

          <p>Seven-time champion Novak Djokovic secured a decisive victory over British player Dan Evans in the second round of Wimbledon, winning in straight sets 6-3, 6-2, 6-0. Djokovic delivered a masterful serving performance, preventing Evans from gaining any momentum in what could be the veteran's final appearance on Centre Court. The win marks Djokovic's 99th match victory at the tournament as he continues his quest to equal Roger Federer's record of eight Wimbledon men's singles titles and secure a 25th major championship.</p>

          <p>In a sign of de-escalating trade tensions, the United States and China have taken steps to ease certain export hurdles. The U.S. government has revoked a licensing requirement for major producers to ship ethane to China, a move that allows for the resumption of a key energy export. Concurrently, German company Siemens confirmed it has made its software fully available again to Chinese clients. These actions follow high-level talks and indicate concrete progress in clearing pathways for strategic goods between the two economic powers.</p>

The second habit is to practice living in retirement by doing a trial run of the planned budget and lifestyle to ensure it is sustainable and fulfilling. Finally, successful early retirees regularly review and adapt their plans to adjust for changing market conditions and personal circumstances. (not investment advice)</p>

According to insurance experts, projects that reduce risk are most effective, such as a full roof replacement with impact-resistant materials. Upgrading old electrical and plumbing systems to prevent fires and water damage, installing a monitored security and fire alarm system, and adding storm shutters in hurricane-prone areas can also result in significant discounts from insurers.</p>

The vessel, owned by the Gulf Clan cartel, was empty but believed to be on a trial run, representing a significant technological evolution in drug trafficking methods. This new generation of unmanned subs is harder for authorities to detect and track, and it eliminates the risk of crew members being captured and cooperating with law enforcement.</p>
