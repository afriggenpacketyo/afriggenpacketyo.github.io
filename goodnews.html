          <p>Collaborative design software company Figma has filed for an IPO, planning to trade on the New York Stock Exchange under the ticker symbol "FIG." The move follows a terminated $20 billion acquisition by Adobe, which resulted in a $1 billion fee paid to Figma. The company reported strong growth, with first-quarter revenue up 46% to $228.2 million and a significant increase in high-value customers. The filing details CEO Dylan Field's vision for the company to "take big swings" as a public entity, including potential future acquisitions and investments.</p>

          <p>Two-time Oscar-winning composer Alexandre Desplat is scoring the new film ‚ÄúJurassic World: Rebirth,‚Äù following in the musical footsteps of his idol, John Williams. In a recent interview, Desplat discussed the challenge and honor of building upon Williams' iconic themes, a task he also undertook for the ‚ÄúHarry Potter‚Äù series. He explained that director Gareth Edwards encouraged him to create memorable, catchy motifs in the style of Williams, an art he feels is becoming rare in modern Hollywood. Desplat, known for his work with directors like Wes Anderson and Guillermo del Toro, is also preparing for his North American conducting debut at the Hollywood Bowl.</p>

          <p>Dating app Tinder is implementing mandatory facial recognition scans for all its users in California to enhance safety and combat the rise of scams and fraudulent accounts. The "Face Check" feature requires users to submit a short video selfie, which is then used to verify their identity against their profile photos and check for duplicate accounts. This move comes as romance scams have become increasingly prevalent, costing victims over $1.1 billion in the U.S. last year. While Tinder has offered optional verification tools before, making this feature mandatory aims to deter bad actors who typically avoid such measures.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Clean energy stocks experienced a jump after a proposed tax on solar and wind projects was removed from the Senate's version of the Republican spending bill. The tax, which would have applied to projects using components from foreign entities like China, was projected to cost the industry up to $7 billion. While its removal provided relief, the bill still phases out key investment tax credits for renewables, a move industry groups warn will undermine America's manufacturing and energy leadership. Despite the partial victory, clean energy associations described the overall bill as a step backward for U.S. energy policy. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>After nearly two decades of failed relocation efforts, the FBI has announced it will move its headquarters to the Ronald Reagan Building in Washington, D.C. The Bureau has been housed in the J. Edgar Hoover building since 1975, but that facility has been plagued by structural problems. The move to the nearby Reagan Building, previously home to USAID, was described by FBI Director Kash Patel as the most cost-effective solution. This decision finalizes a long-running debate over the headquarters' location, which included previous plans under the Biden administration to move it to Maryland.</p>

          <p>A company named ZymoChem is tackling the environmental impact of disposable diapers by creating a biodegradable alternative to a key plastic component. Using a fermentation process similar to brewing beer, the startup converts sugar from corn into a bio-based, biodegradable super absorbent polymer (SAP), which constitutes a large portion of a typical diaper. The company claims its product is nearing cost parity with traditional fossil-based polymers. ZymoChem's materials can be used as a drop-in ingredient for other manufacturers and have attracted investment from companies like Lululemon for use in bio-based nylon apparel.</p>

          <p>Spanish banking giant Santander has announced a ¬£2.65 billion deal to acquire British bank TSB from its current owner, Sabadell. If the deal is approved by shareholders, Santander intends to integrate TSB into its UK group, which could lead to the disappearance of the TSB brand from High Streets. Santander has a history of absorbing the brands of banks it acquires, such as Abbey and Alliance & Leicester. The takeover would create the UK's third-largest bank by personal current accounts, but a spokeswoman did not rule out job cuts and branch closures due to role duplication.</p>

The sale of the once $6 billion company, which filed for Chapter 11 bankruptcy in March, raised significant privacy concerns over its 13 million customers' genetic data. The judge approved the deal, noting that Wojcicki's repurchase of the business she started would honor customers' rights and improve privacy practices. The company struggled with recurring revenue and a 2023 data breach that compromised millions of user accounts.</p>

          <p>Indiana Fever superstar Caitlin Clark, who received a record number of fan votes for the WNBA All-Star game, finished ninth in voting by her fellow players. Despite the low player ranking, Clark will serve as a team captain, an honor determined solely by fan votes. The discrepancy has fueled the narrative that some WNBA players are jealous of the attention Clark receives. However, the voting process, where players select four guards, means Clark was left off many ballots rather than being explicitly ranked ninth. Clark's weighted score, combining fan, media, and player votes, still secured her a spot as an All-Star starter.</p>

The company argues that AI models have been scraping content without limit, depriving creators of traffic and ad revenue.
