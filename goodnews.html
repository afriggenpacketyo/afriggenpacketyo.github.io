        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>The UK state pension is projected to increase by 4.7% next year, potentially adding over £500 annually for new pensioners. This rise is attributed to the "triple lock" policy, which ensures the state pension increases by the highest of 2.5%, inflation, or average earnings growth. Recent data from the Office for National Statistics showed total pay, including bonuses, grew by 4.7% for the three months to July. This adjustment, introduced in 2011, affects nearly 13 million recipients, aiming to maintain pensioner purchasing power amid economic shifts. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>The UK is preparing for President Donald Trump's state visit, which is expected to offer a welcome distraction from Prime Minister Keir Starmer's mounting domestic political difficulties. Trump, an Anglophile and admirer of the Royal family, will be hosted by King Charles III and Queen Camilla at Windsor Castle, with trade talks scheduled with Starmer focusing on new deals and tariff reductions. The visit aims to leverage the "special relationship" and secure economic benefits, with the UK hoping to finalize agreements on steel and aluminum exports. Starmer's Labour Party faces low approval ratings and recent cabinet reshuffles.</p>

          <p>Women's rugby teams are increasingly using advanced methods, including daily questionnaires and dedicated apps, to track players' menstrual cycles, recognizing it as the "fifth vital sign." This practice allows for tailored adjustments to training, nutrition, and recovery to mitigate period symptoms like fatigue and cramps, which commonly affect athletic performance. Experts emphasize that regular cycles indicate overall health, guiding coaches to adapt intensity and support players with specific dietary needs or supplements like "Sylvia's Cramp Cocktail." The goal is to maximize performance while ensuring player well-being and confidence, even though direct links between cycles and injury risk remain unestablished.</p>
