          <p>Welsh scrum-half Tomos Williams has been forced to withdraw from the remainder of the British and Irish Lions tour of Australia due to a hamstring injury. The injury occurred during the team's victory over Western Force, where Williams had scored a try before being substituted. Lions tour manager Ieuan Evans described the news as "desperately sad," praising Williams as an "exemplary Lion." Scotland's Ben White has been called up to the squad as his replacement, leaving flanker Jac Morgan as the only Welsh player remaining on the tour.</p>

          <p>Manchester City manager Pep Guardiola has voiced concerns that the expanded 32-team Club World Cup could "destroy" his team's 2025-26 season due to the demanding schedule. He stated he is trying not to think about the potential for player exhaustion to avoid anxiety. Guardiola acknowledged similar past arguments made by former Liverpool manager J√ºrgen Klopp about player welfare but noted that as a manager, he must follow the rules set by governing bodies like FIFA. City is set to play Al-Hilal in the tournament, which adds to an already congested fixture list for top clubs.</p>

After gaining sufficient weight and demonstrating natural survival behaviors, the cub was released in a remote part of the Santa Ana Mountains. The center is currently caring for two other orphaned cubs with the same goal of returning them to their natural habitat.</p>

          <p>The search for the Tasmanian tiger, or thylacine, declared extinct in 1986, has become a passionate obsession in Australia, with thousands of reported sightings. Enthusiasts use trail cameras and forensic-style methods to search for evidence of the creature's survival in the wild. Simultaneously, a high-profile de-extinction project, backed by $15 million in funding, is underway at the University of Melbourne. Scientists there aim to edit the DNA of the thylacine's closest living relative, the dunnart, to effectively bring the predator back into existence, though some experts remain skeptical about the project's feasibility.</p>

          <p>China has officially lifted its blanket ban on Japanese seafood imports, which was imposed in August 2023 in response to the release of treated radioactive water from the Fukushima nuclear plant. The decision follows months of monitoring and sampling that Chinese authorities said "showed no abnormalities." The move is seen as an effort by Beijing to improve diplomatic ties with Tokyo amid its ongoing trade disputes with the United States. While the general ban is lifted, restrictions will remain on food imports from 10 Japanese prefectures, including Fukushima. (not investment advice)</p>
