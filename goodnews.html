          <h2>Trump's Proposed Budget Bill Aims to Provide Tax Relief for Seniors</h2>
          <div class="timestamp">2025-05-17 10:38:08 EDT</div>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>House Ways & Means Committee Chairman Jason Smith argues that President Trump's budget bill, utilizing the budget reconciliation process, will provide significant tax relief for American seniors. The bill includes a $4,000 tax deduction for Americans aged 65 or older with incomes below $75,000 for single filers and $150,000 for joint filers, effectively eliminating Social Security taxes for low-income and middle-income seniors. While direct changes to Social Security are prohibited under reconciliation rules, this deduction aims to provide comparable relief on yearly tax returns, ensuring seniors receive much-needed tax relief. The White House has endorsed the plan, highlighting it as a fulfillment of promises to seniors who have faced economic challenges.</p>
