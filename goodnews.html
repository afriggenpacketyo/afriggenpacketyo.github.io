          <p>In the Yorkshire Dales, archaeologists have uncovered the remains of an auroch, an extinct breed of large wild cattle from the Bronze Age, inside a cave near Ingleborough. The discovery was part of a larger project exploring the prehistoric use of the region's cave systems, which also found evidence of Neolithic human burials. This finding provides new insights into the long history of farming and human activity on the land. The project underscores the vital role that recreational cavers play in making significant archaeological finds in inaccessible underground locations.</p>

          <p>More than £100 million in prizes from the UK's government-backed Premium Bonds savings program are currently unclaimed, prompting criticism that the operator, NS&I, isn't doing enough to locate winners. The 2.5 million unclaimed prizes include eleven awards of £100,000 each. Critics argue the process for tracing accounts is overly difficult, especially for those who were gifted bonds as children or only possess old paper records. NS&I states it has paid over 99% of winners and provides a tracing service, but some customers report frustrating, bureaucratic experiences.</p>

          <p>Transportation Secretary Sean Duffy, who also serves as interim NASA administrator, is set to announce an expedited plan to develop a nuclear reactor on the moon. The directive aims to advance fission surface power to support a future lunar economy and strengthen national security in space. This move is seen as a response to a joint initiative by China and Russia to establish their own lunar reactor by the mid-2030s. The plan prioritizes swift action to prevent the U.S. from being inhibited by potential "keep-out zones" established by other nations on the lunar surface.</p>

          <p>A hiker was rescued by a helicopter team after falling 25 feet from the top of Big Falls waterfall in the San Bernardino Mountains and landing in a rocky pool below. Fortunately, another person heard his screams for help and called 911, enabling a rapid response. Fire department officials noted that falls are a common occurrence at this notoriously dangerous spot, where warning signs are often ignored. The hiker sustained severe but non-life-threatening injuries and was airlifted to a trauma center in a complex operation requiring the helicopter to fly close to the canyon wall.</p>

        </div>
        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>New research from the American Cancer Society reveals a significant increase in early-stage colorectal cancer diagnoses among people aged 45 to 49. This positive trend is directly linked to the 2021 recommendation to lower the standard screening age from 50 to 45. Screenings in this age group rose by 62% from 2019 to 2023, allowing for earlier detection when the cancer is more treatable. While experts call the findings promising, they caution that screening rates among younger adults remain suboptimal and inequitable across different education and insurance levels.</p>

          <p>Following President Trump's dismissal of the Bureau of Labor Statistics commissioner over steep downward revisions to jobs numbers, experts clarify that such edits are a standard part of the process. The BLS issues preliminary reports for timeliness and then revises them as more complete survey data from businesses and households becomes available. While the recent 258,000-job downward revision for May and June was large, it is not unprecedented and reflects the challenge of collecting accurate data quickly. Experts assert the process is not subject to political manipulation by the commissioner.</p>

          <p>John Edward Bruce, a prominent Black journalist and Pan-Africanist pioneer born into slavery, will finally receive a headstone at his resting place in Yonkers, New York, 101 years after his death. Despite his international renown and a well-attended funeral in 1924, Bruce was buried in an unmarked grave, likely because he was not wealthy and plans were forgotten over time. Through a combination of private and public funds, a new black granite headstone has been created to honor his legacy. The effort corrects a historical oversight for a man who dedicated his life to preserving Black history and culture.</p>

          <p>A Michigan man, Joshua Taylor, is leading an effort to make adult-sized changing tables more common in public restrooms to accommodate teenagers and adults with disabilities. Taylor, who experiences incontinence due to a genetic condition, highlights the lack of dignity and accessibility that forces many caregivers to change loved ones on bathroom floors or in cars. He argues that this is a critical need, not a convenience, for millions of people across the country. By working with state officials and a national advocacy group, he hopes to make public spaces more inclusive for all.</p>

          <p>CNBC's Jim Cramer suggests the stock market's recent rebound is primarily due to the impressive earnings reports from the "Magnificent Seven" tech giants, including Microsoft, Meta, and Alphabet. He argues that despite a weaker-than-expected labor report, the financial strength and diverse revenue streams of these major companies provide a resilient foundation for the market. Cramer noted that these tech titans are performing well across various segments, from cloud infrastructure to AI and advertising, making them difficult to beat. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>California Attorney General Rob Bonta announced that his office has saved the state nearly $170 billion by successfully challenging the Trump administration in court over the last six months. While the legal fights have cost over $5 million in special funding, Bonta calculated a return of $33,600 for every dollar spent. The largest savings came from a lawsuit that blocked an attempt to freeze federal funding for the states. Bonta's office has filed 37 lawsuits against the administration on issues ranging from healthcare and education to immigration and environmental policy.</p>

          <p>New guidance for the UK's National Health Service recommends that people coming off obesity medications like Wegovy and Mounjaro receive structured support for at least a year. Experience shows that patients often regain a significant portion of the weight they lost once they stop the injections, which work by reducing appetite. Health assessment body NICE emphasizes that weight management is a long-term process, not a quick fix. The advice encourages creating a sustainable plan involving healthy eating, physical activity, and behavioral support to maintain weight loss.</p>
