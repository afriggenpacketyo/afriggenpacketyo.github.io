          <h2>Ancient Erotic Mosaic, Stolen by Nazi Captain, Successfully Repatriated to Pompeii</h2>
          <div class="timestamp">2025-07-15 14:49:24 EDT</div>
        </div>
        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>An ancient Roman mosaic panel, depicting an erotic theme and dating back to the mid-first century B.C. to first century A.D., has been triumphantly returned to the Archaeological Park of Pompeii. This culturally significant artwork was stolen by a Nazi German captain during World War II and repatriated from Germany through diligent diplomatic channels, following its return by the heirs of the last owner. Experts hail the mosaic as a work of "extraordinary cultural interest," potentially adorning a bedroom floor, marking a pivotal moment where domestic love became an artistic subject. Its return symbolizes "healing an open wound" and a positive shift in attitudes towards stolen cultural heritage.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>The Pentagon is taking decisive action to bolster U.S. critical mineral production and diminish reliance on China for rare earth magnets, vital components for advanced military platforms like the F-35 warplane. This strategy includes a significant direct equity stake in MP Materials, the sole U.S. rare earth mine operator, setting a precedent for public-private partnerships in national security industries. The Defense Department has already committed $540 million to strengthen the domestic and allied critical mineral supply chain. This aggressive push aims to rebuild the U.S. industrial base and secure essential resources against geopolitical vulnerabilities, fostering long-term energy independence. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>Country artist Ella Langley shared a unique insight into Kid Rock's disciplined approach to his performances, revealing that he treats his concerts like a football game. According to Langley, Kid Rock meticulously records his entire show and immediately reviews the footage with his Twisted Brown Trucker Band in the greenroom, akin to coaches analyzing game tape. This commitment to continuous improvement underscores his dedication to his craft and the longevity of his band, together since 1994. His music consistently reflects themes of American pride, a spontaneous outpouring of his feelings and experiences.</p>

          <p>President Donald Trump announced a preliminary trade deal with Indonesia, stating it includes a 19% tariff on Indonesian exports to the U.S. and grants the U.S. unprecedented market access. Indonesian officials have not yet confirmed these terms. Trump also claimed Indonesia committed to significant purchases, including $15 billion in U.S. energy, $4.5 billion in American agricultural products, and 50 Boeing jets. This proposed tariff rate is lower than the 32% duty Trump had previously threatened, reflecting his unconventional direct negotiation style. The announcement echoes a similar, partially unconfirmed deal with Vietnam, indicating a developing pattern in his trade policy. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>Two Manhattan men, Charles Collins and Brian Boles, have been exonerated after spending decades in prison for the 1994 murder of 85-year-old James Reid, a crime they did not commit. Convicted at age 17, both men were coerced into confessions and denied due process, with DNA evidence later contradicting their involvement. The Manhattan District Attorney's Post-Conviction Justice Unit, launched in 2022, found key exculpatory material and noted the men's questioning as minors without adult presence. This brings the unit's total of vacated cases to 13, all involving minority men, underscoring ongoing efforts to rectify past injustices within the criminal justice system.</p>
