          <p>A federal judge has issued a preliminary injunction, effectively blocking the Trump administration from proceeding with its plans to sharply reduce jobs and reorganize the structure of several major federal agencies. The order halts further reductions in force and any reorganization of the executive branch for the duration of the lawsuit. This decision marks a significant legal setback for the administration's efforts to streamline and downsize the federal workforce, ensuring stability for affected employees and agencies. The judge's ruling provides a temporary reprieve while the court considers the merits of the case.</p>

          <p>U.S. Treasury yields retreated from recent highs after President Trump threatened tariffs on Apple and the European Union, triggering investor concerns about escalating trade tensions. Trump's proposals for tariffs on EU goods and Apple products manufactured outside the U.S. led to a flight to safety, driving down yields on the 30-year, 10-year, and 2-year Treasury notes. The moves followed a volatile week for bonds, initially driven by fears that Trump's budget bill would worsen the U.S. deficit, which had pushed yields to levels not seen since 2023.

The stock transactions occurred over two days, with prices ranging from $125.26 to $127.70 per share. Following the sales, Karp still holds approximately 6.43 million shares of Palantir stock, valued at around $787 million based on the latest closing price. The sales were reportedly connected to automatic share sales to cover tax withholding obligations related to vesting restricted stock units, and other top executives at the company also sold stock.</p>

          <p>Saving money in an economy with persistent inflation can be a challenge, but certificates of deposit (CDs) offer a solution with higher returns than the current inflation rate. CDs allow savers to lock in high rates for the term of the CD and come with FDIC or NCUA insurance on balances up to $250,000. The current national average CD yields range from 1.69% to 1.99%, while top CDs offer rates between 4.00% and 4.41%. Strategies for securing a good CD rate include looking at online banks and considering short-term CDs. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>The mortgage market presents challenges for new homebuyers and those seeking to refinance due to high interest rates and limited housing inventory. As of May 23, 2025, average mortgage rates are 6.08% for a 15-year mortgage and 6.89% for a 30-year mortgage, while refinance rates are 6.21% and 6.91%, respectively. Strengthening credit profiles and shopping around for lenders can improve the chances of securing a good rate, and potential pauses in Fed rate hikes may provide some relief. Borrowers should consider loan terms, fees, and lock in rates to mitigate potential increases. (not investment advice)</p>

Baldoni and Lively are embroiled in a legal dispute after she accused him of sexual harassment and a smear campaign, while Baldoni is counter-suing Lively and Reynolds on claims of civil extortion, defamation, and invasion of privacy.</p>

          <p>A recent international study provides evidence that the Covid-19 virus did not originate in Wuhan, China, countering the "lab leak" theory promoted by the Trump administration. The study, led by the University of Edinburgh, analyzed 167 bat coronavirus genomes and traced the origins of the virus to bat populations in northern Laos and southwest China's Yunnan province. Researchers found that the virus's most recent ancestor circulated five to seven years before the pandemic emerged, challenging claims made by the White House.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>A new study has revealed that clownfish are shrinking in response to severe heat waves, suggesting this may be an adaptation to survive hotter ocean temperatures. Scientists scuba diving off the coast of Papua New Guinea measured clownfish during a heat wave in 2023 and found that most of the fish got shorter. The study, published in Science Advances, indicates that being small has advantages in a hot climate, potentially helping clownfish meet their bodies' energy requirements. The fish that shrank had a much higher chance of survival, adding complexity to the otherwise depressing effects of climate change on the world's oceans.</p>
