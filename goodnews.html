          <h2>Assisted Dying Impact Assessment Estimates Over 4,000 Deaths in Tenth Year After Law Change</h2>

          <p>A recent impact assessment in England and Wales estimates that assisted dying could account for over 4,000 deaths in the tenth year after its legalization. The report, intended to inform MPs debating the bill, also projects NHS savings ranging from ¬£5.84m to ¬£59.6m annually after a decade, due to reduced healthcare costs for those choosing assisted dying. However, the cost of staffing and training for the service could exceed ¬£10m annually. Kim Leadbeater, the Labour MP behind the bill, emphasizes the human cost, while opponents raise concerns about risks to vulnerable individuals.</p>

          <p>Singapore held its general election amidst concerns over potential tariffs imposed by the United States and rising living costs. Prime Minister Lawrence Wong's People's Action Party (PAP), which has been in power since 1965, faced a challenge from the opposition Workers' Party (WP), which seeks greater scrutiny and alternative voices in Parliament. Wong emphasized the need for a strong mandate to navigate economic uncertainty, while the WP highlighted the cost of living crisis. The PAP has historically dominated Singaporean politics, but recent elections have shown a slight decline in their popular support.</p>

          <p>Australians are voting in a general election amid economic challenges like inflation and housing affordability, as well as a complex global landscape influenced by the United States and China, according to this article. Voters express concerns about rising costs, but neither major party has proposed ambitious solutions. Opposition leader Peter Dutton has focused on cost-of-living issues, while Prime Minister Anthony Albanese emphasizes healthcare. The election also reflects cultural divisions and a shift away from major parties towards independent candidates, as voters seek deeper solutions to pressing issues.</p>

          <div class="timestamp">2025-05-03 02:29:15 EDT</div>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>The blood of Tim Friede, a US man who deliberately injected himself with snake venom for nearly two decades, has led to the creation of an "unparalleled" antivenom. Antibodies found in Friede's blood have shown the ability to protect against fatal doses from a wide range of snake species in animal tests. Current antivenom therapies must match the specific species of venomous snake involved in a bite. This mission could be a significant step in finding a universal antivenom against all snakebites - which kill up to 140,000 people a year and leave three times as many needing amputations or facing permanent disability.</p>

          <p>The Hong Kong Monetary Authority (HKMA) intervened in the financial market to weaken the local currency, which had appreciated against the U.S. dollar due to capital inflows. The HKMA bought US$6.005 billion and sold HK$46.539 billion in its first market intervention in two years. This action comes ahead of the U.S. Federal Reserve's meeting, where interest rate cuts are expected. The HKMA stated that the Hong Kong dollar's strength was driven by increased demand related to equity investment activities and regional currency appreciation, but that the HKMA will continue to monitor the market situation and ensure Hong Kong‚Äôs money and foreign exchange markets operate in an orderly manner.</p>

          <p>Vietnam is undergoing an administrative "revolution" to modernize the state, boost economic growth, and consolidate political power under the Communist Party. The reforms include merging ministries, shuttering state-run media, and eliminating public sector jobs. This overhaul is expected to address issues created by the party's anti-corruption campaign and external pressures, such as potential U.S. tariffs. To Lam, the country's new party chief, is spearheading the changes, which are also seen as a way to strengthen centralized governance and exert more direct control over local affairs.</p>

The exhibits explain the fusion energy process and the experimental reactor being built in France.

Fusion energy, often called "the Sun on Earth," is generated when light atomic nuclei merge to form a heavier nucleus, producing byproduct-free energy.</p>
