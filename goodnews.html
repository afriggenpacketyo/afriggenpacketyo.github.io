          <p>A new biography by Sam Tanenhaus, "Buckley: The Life and the Revolution That Changed America," explores the profound influence of William F. Buckley Jr. on the American conservative movement. The article details how Buckley, through his magazine National Review and TV show "Firing Line," created a platform for conservative ideas and played a key role in the rise of figures like Barry Goldwater and Ronald Reagan. It also touches on the complexities of his legacy, including his controversial early views on civil rights and how his intellectual style contrasts with today's political climate. The piece suggests Buckley's movement ultimately paved the way for the contemporary Republican Party.</p>

In addition to economic data, the market will be attentive to any policy updates from the White House regarding trade negotiations with China and other partners, as deadlines for tariffs approach.

          <p>The UK's Labour government has made significant concessions on its proposed welfare reforms after facing a substantial rebellion from over 120 of its own MPs. The original plans, aimed at saving ¬£5 billion, included cuts to the Personal Independence Payment (Pip) and were criticized for potentially harming disabled and vulnerable individuals. To avoid a parliamentary defeat, the government limited the Pip cuts to new claimants and reversed a freeze on the health-related component of Universal Credit. Health Secretary Wes Streeting admitted the government mishandled the rollout but argued the changes put them in a better position to pass necessary reforms for the system's long-term sustainability.</p>

          <p>Following rumors of a potential production shift to the United States, British sports car maker Lotus has assured the UK business secretary that it has no plans to close its historic factory in Hethel, Norfolk. The concerns arose after the company paused production due to US tariffs, and its CEO mentioned exploring localization in the US. The potential loss of 1,300 jobs prompted an urgent meeting where Lotus management reaffirmed its commitment to UK operations. The government, in turn, highlighted its support for the automotive sector through its modern industrial strategy, aiming to improve competitiveness and drive growth.</p>

          <p>Amidst summer beach season and what he calls "hysteria" fueled by the 50th anniversary of 'Jaws,' "Shark Week" host and biologist Forrest Galante advises vacationers on how to safely share the ocean with sharks. He emphasizes that sharks do not intentionally prey on humans and that negative encounters are rare accidents. To reduce risk, Galante recommends avoiding swimming at dawn and dusk, staying away from marine-rich areas like river mouths, and not wearing shiny jewelry that can mimic bait fish. He suggests a few minutes of research about a destination's local conditions can substantially minimize any potential danger, allowing for a worry-free vacation.</p>

          <p>The UK government has announced a new strategy to combat obesity by partnering with major food retailers and manufacturers to encourage healthier consumer habits. Rather than imposing strict rules, the plan will involve voluntary measures such as offering promotions on healthy items, adjusting loyalty point systems, or redesigning store layouts to make nutritious options more appealing. Retailers will report on their healthy food sales to increase accountability, with targets being set in collaboration with the industry. Health Secretary Wes Streeting framed the approach as a partnership, aiming to help reduce national calorie intake and alleviate pressure on the NHS.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>A psychologist specializing in couples suggests that answering "no" to four specific questions may indicate unrecognized unhappiness in a relationship. These questions probe whether partners feel they are on the same team during conflicts, if they can be their authentic selves, if their partner remains curious about their inner world, and if their partner takes accountability for mistakes. The article explains that healthy relationships involve collaborative problem-solving, the freedom for self-expression, sustained emotional intimacy, and a willingness to repair trust after errors. A lack of these qualities can lead to resentment, distance, and a loss of personal identity over time.</p>

          <p>Despite statistics showing they are having less sex than previous generations, Gen Z is not uninterested in sex but is instead redefining it on their own terms. This article argues that young people are engaging in a new sexual revolution, characterized by political activism for reproductive rights, a rejection of traditional gendered expectations, and a more inclusive understanding of sexuality. Having grown up post-#MeToo and post-Roe, many in Gen Z view sex and its consequences as inherently political. They are challenging older concepts like virginity and pushing for a society where sexual exploration is divorced from outdated, heteronormative pressures and power dynamics.</p>

          <p>New data from Vanguard illustrates a strong correlation between income and retirement savings, with higher earners accumulating significantly larger 401(k) balances. For instance, workers earning between $100,000 and $149,999 have a median balance nearly double that of those earning between $50,000 and $74,999. The report suggests that despite economic uncertainty, Americans are making steady progress in their retirement savings. A key factor boosting balances has been the adoption of automatic enrollment in employer-sponsored plans, which has led to substantially higher savings for long-tenured employees compared to those who had to voluntarily opt-in to their plans.
