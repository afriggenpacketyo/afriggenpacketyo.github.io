          <p>Reports of a feud between Brooklyn Beckham and his wife Nicola Peltz and the rest of the Beckham family threaten the carefully cultivated image of the Beckham brand.  The absence of Brooklyn and Nicola from David Beckham's 50th birthday celebrations fueled speculation about the rift.  Experts in reputation management suggest that the ongoing media coverage could damage the family's public image, shifting their perception from aspirational to reality-TV-like.  David Beckham's recent Father's Day post on Instagram, featuring all four of his children, attempted to counter these rumors.</p>
