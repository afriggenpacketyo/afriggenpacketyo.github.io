          <p>Dwayne "The Rock" Johnson is taking on his most ambitious role yet, portraying real-life MMA fighter Mark Kerr in "The Smashing Machine," a film exploring drug addiction and depression. Johnson underwent extensive makeup and prosthetics daily to transform for the part, which he says fulfills a long-held desire to delve into dramatic acting and "rip himself open." He drew on childhood trauma, including his family's eviction at age 15, to connect with the character's despair. This role marks a new "book" in his career, moving beyond his previous focus on box office success towards more fulfilling artistic challenges.</p>

          <p>Rabbi Angela Buchdahl, senior rabbi at Central Synagogue in New York, shares insights on Rosh Hashanah, the Jewish New Year, as a time for communal atonement and a return to "our better selves." She emphasizes the concept of Teshuvah, or repentance, as a hopeful message that individuals and societies can change. Buchdahl suggests that the nation could collectively engage in this self-reflection, acknowledging societal shortcomings and striving for goodness, compassion, and generosity. Her message, ahead of the year 5786, calls for unity and a commitment to positive transformation.</p>

          <p>Research indicates that children develop strong social skills not through memorizing polite phrases, but by observing their parents' emotional and interpersonal behaviors. This article highlights nine key practices of parents who raise socially adept children, including openly discussing feelings, modeling empathy, fostering authentic confidence, and teaching conflict resolution. These parents prioritize emotional safety and validation, help children recognize social cues, and treat mistakes as learning opportunities. Ultimately, listening more than lecturing enables children to build resilience and become empathetic adults capable of sustaining healthy relationships.</p>

          <p>The United States once again topped the medal table at the World Athletics Championships in Tokyo, securing 26 total medals, including 16 golds, continuing its dominant performance. In contrast, Great Britain and Northern Ireland experienced their worst championships in 22 years, failing to win a single gold medal and finishing 21st overall with only five medals. This marks a significant decline from their previous championship performance and their best Olympic haul in 40 years. The disappointing results for GB have prompted reflections on team structure and future strategies.</p>

          <p>The U.S. Supreme Court's unanimous ruling in Brown v. Board of Education of Topeka in 1954 declared the "separate but equal" doctrine unconstitutional, overturning nearly 60 years of legalized racial segregation. This landmark decision was the culmination of efforts by the NAACP's Legal Defense Fund, led by attorney Thurgood Marshall, who argued that segregation aimed to keep formerly enslaved people in a subordinate state. While the ruling did not immediately end all segregation, it pushed the United States closer to its founding ideals of equality, eventually leading to Marshall's appointment as the first African American Supreme Court Justice.</p>
