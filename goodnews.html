          <p>The Trump administration is proceeding with a long-held plan to build a new, large ballroom at the White House, with construction slated to begin in September. The project, estimated to cost $200 million, will be located in the East Wing and is designed to seat 650 guests, significantly larger than the current East Room. According to the White House, the cost will be covered by President Trump himself along with other private donors, fulfilling his desire for a grander event space than the tents often used for state dinners.</p>

        </div>
        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Researchers have discovered that the modern potato originated from the ancient interbreeding of a tomato ancestor and another wild species. A study published in the journal *Cell* explains that a crucial gene from the tomato parent enabled the formation of starch-rich tubers, solving a long-standing puzzle about the potato's evolution. This finding demonstrates how hybridization between different species can lead to the emergence of entirely new traits and organisms, fundamentally changing our understanding of this staple food.</p>

          <p>A registered dietitian explores the trend of adding protein to foods like cereals and chips, questioning if these products are truly healthy or necessary for most people. While protein is vital for healthy aging, many fortified foods can also be high in sugar, salt, or fat, making them less ideal than their marketing suggests. The article advises consumers to read nutrition labels carefully and prioritize whole foods like yogurt, legumes, and eggs, which are naturally rich in protein and other essential nutrients.</p>

          <p>On a chaotic, rain-shortened first day of the decisive fifth Test, England managed to take six of India's wickets, leaving the tourists at 204-6. The day was marred by a potentially serious shoulder injury to England's Chris Woakes, adding to their depleted pace-bowling attack. England's bowling was inconsistent, but key plays, including a run-out of India's captain and two crucial wickets by Josh Tongue, kept the match evenly poised heading into the next day.</p>

        </div>
        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>This article details a key consumer protection for federally backed reverse mortgages known as the "95% rule." The rule allows heirs who wish to keep a family home to pay off the loan for either the full balance or 95% of the home's current appraised value, whichever is less. This prevents them from owing more than the property is worth if the loan balance has grown past the home's value, providing financial predictability and a more manageable option for retaining a family asset.

          <p>President Trump has announced a 90-day extension for the current trade deal with Mexico, delaying the imposition of potentially higher duties and providing more time for complex negotiations. The existing tariffs, including a 25% rate on cars and specific duties on steel and fentanyl, will remain in place.
