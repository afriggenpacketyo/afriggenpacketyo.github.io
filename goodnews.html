          <p>A new study by SmartAsset has identified the best job markets in the United States, ranking 348 cities on factors like unemployment, income growth, and commute times. Bend, Oregon, secured the top spot due to its low unemployment rate and significant income growth, along with a favorable work-life balance highlighted by short commutes. The report also singles out cities for specific strengths, such as Santa Clara, California, for high health insurance coverage and Frisco, Texas, for a large percentage of remote workers. This data provides valuable insights for individuals navigating the current job market.</p>

          <p>A federal judge has issued a preliminary injunction, ruling that the Trump administration's recent mass layoffs at the Department of Health and Human Services were likely unlawful. The judge stated that the executive branch lacks the authority to implement such sweeping structural changes to congressionally created agencies without their approval. This ruling, sought by 19 state attorneys general, temporarily blocks further firings and the planned reorganization of the nation's public health workforce. The court found the states demonstrated "irreparable harm" from the cuts.</p>

          <p>Los Angeles punk band Go Betty Go is marking its 25th anniversary with renewed optimism as guitarist Betty Cisneros is now in remission from Stage 4 cancer. The band, known for its DIY ethic and Latina-led Ramones-inspired sound, rallied around Cisneros during her two-year health battle, which she said made their sisterly bond even stronger. Cisneros found that focusing on music was therapeutic and helped her through the difficult recovery process. Now with her health improving, the band is celebrating the milestone and planning a new West Coast tour.</p>

        </div>
        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>A provision within the broad Republican budget package passed by the Senate aims to create a new federal tax deduction for income earned from tips. The proposal, part of what President Trump calls the "one big, beautiful bill," would eliminate federal income tax on tips, though workers would still owe payroll and state taxes. Versions in the House and Senate differ on income and deduction caps, and the tax break would be temporary, expiring in 2028. Critics argue the policy would not benefit the lowest-wage workers, many of whom already have no federal tax liability. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>In a positive sign for consumers feeling the pinch of food inflation, Waffle House has officially removed the 50-cent surcharge it had placed on eggs. The restaurant chain implemented the temporary price hike in February after an avian flu outbreak led to a sharp increase in wholesale egg prices. With the market now stabilizing and prices falling, the popular diner, which serves hundreds of millions of eggs annually, has reverted to its normal pricing. The move reflects a broader, albeit slow, easing of food prices across the country.</p>

          <p>With credit card interest rates near record highs, many consumers are considering debt forgiveness programs as a potential solution. These programs can potentially reduce a borrower's total debt by 30% to 50% for those facing financial hardship, but they are not a universal fix and can negatively impact one's credit score. This article explores the conditions under which pursuing debt forgiveness might be a sensible strategy this month, while also cautioning individuals to explore alternative options like debt management or consolidation loans first.

          <p>Clean energy stocks experienced a significant rally after a proposed tax on solar and wind projects was removed from the Senate's version of the Republican spending bill. The tax would have applied to projects using components from foreign entities of concern, primarily China, and industry groups warned it would have been punitive. Following its removal, shares for major renewable developers and manufacturers like NextEra Energy, Array Technologies, and Sunrun all saw notable gains. Despite this positive development, industry associations maintain that the overall bill remains detrimental to the renewable energy sector.</p>

          <p>California has passed a significant overhaul of its landmark environmental law, the California Environmental Quality Act (CEQA), in an effort to address the state's severe housing shortage. Governor Gavin Newsom signed the changes, which will exempt most new housing projects built within existing urban areas from the law's stringent review process. Proponents argue this will streamline desperately needed construction, while some environmental and social justice groups oppose the move, fearing it will undermine public participation and protections against environmental risks. The new rules also provide exemptions for high-tech manufacturing sites.</p>
