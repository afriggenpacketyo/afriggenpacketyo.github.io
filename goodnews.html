King also discusses her personal commitment to an active lifestyle and her partnership with Lyft's "Silver is Gold" campaign, aiming to reframe conversations around aging and enhance independence for older adults.

          <p>A federal judge in Virginia dismissed a lawsuit filed by the Justice Department against all 15 federal district court judges in Maryland. The DOJ had accused the Maryland court of overstepping its authority by implementing a 48-hour freeze on deportations for migrants challenging their detention. Judge Thomas Cullen, specially appointed to the case, ruled that the lawsuit was an inappropriate challenge to a co-equal branch of government, stating it went against precedent and constitutional tradition. The Maryland judges, represented by former Solicitor General Paul Clement, argued the DOJ should have pursued appeals in specific cases or petitioned the judicial council for rule changes.</p>

          <p>Savers are facing uncertainty regarding Certificate of Deposit (CD) interest rates, with many financial experts predicting a decline in the coming months. Christopher Hodge, chief economist at Natixis CIB Americas, forecasts a 25 to 50 basis point drop by year-end, contingent on the Federal Reserve resuming rate cuts in September. While current rates range from 4% to 4.5%, persistent inflation or a stronger-than-expected job market could keep rates stable, while a significant re-acceleration of inflation might lead to increases. Experts advise locking in current high rates, utilizing CD ladder strategies for liquidity, and avoiding overly long terms to mitigate risk. (not investment advice)</p>

This deal will add 50 megahertz of mid-band and low-band spectrum to AT&T's network, covering over 400 U.S. markets, with an expected closure in mid-2026 pending regulatory approval. EchoStar stated the transaction helps resolve Federal Communications Commission inquiries regarding its 5G network compliance, following complaints from SpaceX about underused spectrum. The companies also expanded their network services agreement, allowing EchoStar to operate as a hybrid mobile network operator under the Boost Mobile brand. (not investment advice)</p>

While existing injectable GLP-1s show greater weight loss, orforglipron offers a convenient, needle-free, and dietary restriction-free oral alternative, potentially expanding access to obesity treatments. Gastrointestinal side effects were common but mild to moderate, and the company expects to launch the pill globally by next year.</p>

          <h2>Student Housing Market Shifts from Luxury to Affordability Amid Economic Concerns</h2>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>The student housing market is experiencing a shift, with rent growth slowing to 0.9% in July and advertised asking rents decreasing, as consumers prioritize affordability over luxury amenities. Robert Bronstein, CEO of Scion, a major student housing operator, notes a decline in demand for high-end features like golf simulators, with students now preferring co-working spaces. Investment is increasingly directed towards large, flagship public universities experiencing record enrollment growth, as new development slows due to higher construction and capital costs. This trend suggests a dynamic market where functional, convenient, and affordable options are gaining prominence, increasing the value of existing assets. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>Budget retailer Poundland has successfully secured a High Court approval for its turnaround plan, narrowly avoiding administration days before it was projected to run out of cash. The restructuring deal involves a significant £90m cash injection from private equity firm Gordon Brothers, which recently acquired the chain for £1. The plan also includes pushing back loan repayments by three years and reducing rents for unprofitable stores, alongside previously announced closures of 68 shops and warehouse sites, impacting about 1,000 jobs. Managing director Barry Williams stated the decision would "stabilise the business" and allow a focus on revamping ranges and lowering prices to drive growth.</p>

          <p>Experts emphasize that adequate calcium intake, crucial for bone health, muscle function, and nerve signaling, can be achieved through various sources beyond dairy milk. Registered dietitians suggest other dairy products like yogurt and cheese, as well as calcium-fortified non-dairy milks, fruit juices, and cereals. Tofu made with calcium, canned fish with bones such as salmon and sardines, and certain vegetables like kale, broccoli, and bok choy are also excellent sources. For those concerned about their intake, a balanced, colorful diet is generally sufficient, but consulting a doctor about supplements is advised if deficiencies are suspected.</p>

          <p>Former Australia head coach Justin Langer has expressed doubts about England's "killer instinct" needed to win the upcoming Ashes series against Australia. Langer, who has a strong record in the Ashes as both a player and coach, noted England's recent 2-2 draws against India and Australia, suggesting they lacked the decisive edge. He emphasized that England must adopt an aggressive "Bazball" approach in Australia to challenge bowlers like Mitchell Starc, Josh Hazlewood, and Pat Cummins. England's historical performance in Australia, with only one series win since 1987 and three consecutive losses without a match victory, underscores the challenge ahead.</p>

          <p>Katrina vanden Heuvel's article analyzes Gavin Newsom's effective use of Trump-like mockery to engage in political discourse, particularly regarding congressional redistricting, garnering millions of views. The piece suggests that in the current attention economy, characterized by shortened attention spans and social media dominance, Democrats are increasingly adopting a more aggressive, "fighter" persona to counter Trump's "malignant savant" approach to media manipulation. While acknowledging the degradation of thoughtful discourse, the article argues that combining profane style with substantive progressive policy, as seen in examples like Newsom's redistricting plan and other Democrats' pugilistic rhetoric, may be essential for electoral victory and rallying public support.</p>

Lamborghini is adapting to slowing EV demand by considering a hybrid option for its upcoming all-electric grand touring car. The company is riding a wave of new plug-in hybrid models and benefiting from a surge in younger, more diverse global wealth, while carefully managing supply to maintain exclusivity.

          <p>Starbucks' annual release of its Pumpkin Spice Latte (PSL) in late August, the earliest ever, continues to spark cultural debate and backlash, which the article explains is often more about broader societal anxieties than the drink itself. Since its 2003 inception, the PSL has become a symbol for discussions on capitalism, seasonal creep, and the term "basic," frequently criticized despite being Starbucks' most popular seasonal beverage. The article suggests that much of the contempt is rooted in sexism, class anxiety, and skepticism of savvy marketing, as trends coded as feminine often face dismissal. However, it also posits that public fatigue for "pumpkin spice hot takes" might be growing, allowing the drink to return to its simple autumnal appeal.</p>

This discovery is part of a larger initiative to map sunken Northern European landscapes, providing insights into how ancient societies adapted to drastic environmental changes.

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Scientists at the University of California San Francisco have identified a protein, ferritin light chain 1 (FTL1), that plays a central role in brain aging and memory decline. Experiments with mice showed that reducing FTL1 in the hippocampus improved nerve connections and memory test performance, effectively reversing some age-related impairments. Conversely, artificially stimulating FTL1 in young mice led to mental abilities matching older rodents. This discovery offers new hope for therapies targeting FTL1 to not only alleviate natural cognitive decline but also potentially benefit individuals with neurodegenerative diseases. The research contributes to a holistic understanding of brain aging, aiming to make cognitive decline a thing of the past.</p>
