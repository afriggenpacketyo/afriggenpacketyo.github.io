          <p>Long-serving Democratic Representative Jerry Nadler of New York has announced he will not seek reelection in 2026. In an interview, the 78-year-old congressman cited the necessity for "generational change" within the Democratic party as a primary reason for his decision. Nadler, who has been in Congress since 1992 and previously chaired the House Judiciary Committee, stated that watching the 2024 election outcome convinced him that a younger successor might better address the political challenges facing the country, including the rise of what he termed "incipient fascism."</p>

          <p>Markets in the Asia-Pacific region were mostly higher as investors processed developments from the Shanghai Cooperation Organization (SCO) summit in Tianjin. However, sentiment was tempered by uncertainty surrounding U.S. trade policy after a federal appeals court ruled that many of President Trump's global tariffs are illegal. Japan's Nikkei 225 saw gains, as did South Korea's Kospi, which rose despite data showing a slowdown in consumer price inflation. In contrast, Australia's S&P/ASX 200 declined ahead of the release of its current account balance data.</p>

          <p>Labour MP Marie Tidball, who was born with a congenital disability affecting all four limbs, has spoken out about the significant accessibility challenges within the historic Houses of Parliament. In a tour with the BBC, she pointed out obstacles such as heavy doors with smooth, round handles and the long distances to accessible toilets, which can hinder her work. Tidball emphasized the need for Parliament to better reflect the 22% of the voting-age population with disabilities, arguing that while some progress has been made, much more is needed to make the institution truly inclusive.</p>

          <p>The Old Faithful Inn, located in Yellowstone National Park, is highlighted as a historic and architectural treasure, considered a benchmark for national park lodges in the United States. Built in 1904 from some 10,000 trees, including many with unique, twisted shapes, the inn was once advertised as the largest log cabin in the world. Its distinctive "parkitecture" style influenced the design of other famous lodges in parks like Yosemite and Glacier. The article notes the continuous effort to maintain its historic character while accommodating millions of visitors over more than a century.</p>

          <p>Singer-songwriter Tom Odell reflects on a recent career resurgence, partly fueled by support from Billie Eilish and her brother Finneas, who were inspired by one of his early concerts. Eilish later invited Odell to open for her European tour, coinciding with his independent success after his song "Black Friday" went viral on TikTok. In the article, Odell discusses his new album, "A Wonderful Life," which explores personal and global anxieties despite his professional success. He explains how he has learned to find contentment in the present moment rather than constantly chasing an elusive future goal.</p>

          <p>Naomi Osaka delivered a commanding performance at the US Open, defeating American third seed and defending champion Coco Gauff 6-3, 6-2 to reach the quarterfinals. This marks Osaka's most significant victory since returning to the sport after giving birth and her first Grand Slam quarterfinal appearance since winning the Australian Open in 2021. Gauff struggled with her form, particularly her forehand, and seemed unsettled throughout the match. Osaka, a two-time US Open champion, will now face Czech player Karolina Muchova in the next round of the tournament.</p>

          <p>Premier League clubs have set a new spending record, with their total outlay during the summer transfer window exceeding £3 billion for the first time. The final figure was pushed past the milestone by several major deadline-day deals, including Alexander Isak's British record £125 million move to Liverpool. This summer's spending significantly surpasses last year's £1.96 billion and is more than the combined total of all clubs in Germany's Bundesliga, Spain's La Liga, France's Ligue 1, and Italy's Serie A, highlighting the Premier League's immense financial dominance.</p>

          <p>A detailed analysis explores how Liverpool transitioned from a club with self-imposed spending "ceilings" to the biggest spenders in a single transfer window, with an outlay of £415 million. The shift is attributed to a combination of factors, including saved funds from a quiet previous summer, significant commercial growth, and a desire to capitalize on their recent Premier League title win. Key signings like Florian Wirtz and the record-breaking deal for Alexander Isak were driven by manager Arne Slot's ambition to evolve the team, though the tragic death of Diogo Jota also necessitated reinforcing the attack.</p>

          <p>Actor Dwayne "The Rock" Johnson is generating early Oscar buzz for his dramatic turn as UFC fighter Mark Kerr in the new film "The Smashing Machine," which premiered at the Venice Film Festival. Johnson stated he had a "burning desire" to take on a more intense and raw role after feeling "pigeon-holed" as a blockbuster action star for years. Critics have praised his performance as a "revelation," noting his sincere and ego-less portrayal of the fighter, who battled substance abuse. The film, directed by Benny Safdie, represents a significant departure from Johnson's typical roles.</p>

          <p>The Shanghai Cooperation Organisation (SCO), a Eurasian political and security bloc including China, Russia, and India, has decided to establish a new development bank. The move is aimed at insulating the ten member nations from risks associated with the U.S. dollar-dominated global financial system and accelerating key infrastructure projects. According to analysts, creating this concessional lender is a logical step for the group to enhance economic cooperation and reduce their reliance on Western-led financial institutions. The bank's establishment was officially announced following the SCO summit.</p>

          <p>A new study has precisely dated the "Petralona cranium," a significant human fossil discovered in a Greek cave, to be at least 286,000 years old. This new minimum age, determined using advanced uranium-series dating techniques, places the skull firmly in the Middle Pleistocene era and helps resolve decades of debate. The findings suggest that the individual, likely belonging to the species Homo heidelbergensis, was part of an archaic human population that coexisted with, but was distinct from, emerging Neanderthals. This discovery provides crucial new insights into the complex and branching history of human evolution in Europe.</p>

          <p>The Met Office has announced a "decent chance" that the aurora borealis, or Northern Lights, could be visible across much of the United Kingdom in the coming days. The increased visibility is due to a fast-moving coronal mass ejection from the sun, which could push the celestial display further south than usual. While visibility will depend on clear skies and low light pollution, the Midlands may have the best viewing conditions. Officials advise that Monday and Tuesday nights offer the best opportunity for a rare and memorable sighting for many in the UK.</p>

          <p>Despite setting new age-related records at the US Open, questions remain about Novak Djokovic's physical durability as he seeks a 25th Grand Slam title. The 38-year-old has played himself into good form but has been hampered by various physical issues throughout the tournament, calling for a trainer in nearly every match. This follows a pattern from other recent Grand Slams where injuries affected his performance. As he prepares to face No. 4 seed Taylor Fritz, against whom he holds a 10-0 record, his biggest challenge may be whether his body can withstand the strain of the tournament's final stages.</p>
