          <p>England's women's cricket team has advanced to the World Cup semi-finals after a tense four-run victory against co-hosts India. England set a target of 289, anchored by a century from former captain Heather Knight. India appeared to be on track for a win, reaching 234-3, but the dismissal of opener Smriti Mandhana for 88 triggered a middle-order collapse under pressure. Despite a half-century from Deepti Sharma, India fell just short in the final over, leaving them needing to win their remaining games to secure their own semi-final position after three consecutive losses.</p>

The insights suggest that Salesforce's AI platform is performing well, defying skepticism, and that the AI hardware market is large enough for companies like Nvidia, AMD, and Broadcom to thrive simultaneously. The article also conveyed growing concerns among OpenAI's backers about its consumer-focused strategy and spending. Other takeaways included recommendations to sell speculative nuclear and quantum computing stocks, while expressing optimism for Dell's market position and Levi Strauss's product line.

          <p>A new book titled "The Biblio Diet" suggests that a dietary plan based on foods mentioned in the Bible can improve physical health and potentially reverse serious illnesses. The authors, Dr. Josh Axe and Jordan Rubin, advocate for consuming foods like red meat, whole-grain sourdough, olive oil, and raw honey, while avoiding items labeled as "unclean" in Leviticus, such as pork and shellfish. They also emphasize the importance of avoiding modern processed ingredients. Beyond diet, the book promotes other biblical practices like fasting and prayer, framing overall health as a way to honor God and a path to holistic well-being.</p>

          <p>The Los Angeles Rams defeated the Jacksonville Jaguars 35-7 at Wembley Stadium in London, improving their record to 5-2 before their bye week. Quarterback Matthew Stafford threw for five touchdowns, three of which were to receiver Davante Adams, effectively compensating for the absence of injured star Puka Nacua. The Rams' defense was dominant, recording seven sacks on Jaguars' quarterback Trevor Lawrence, with rookie edge rushers Jared Verse and Byron Young leading the charge. The victory continues coach Sean McVay's undefeated streak in London games and positions the team strongly for the remainder of the season.</p>

          <h2>Southeast Asia Sees Decline in Smoking Prevalence but Faces New Challenges</h2>

          <p>Tobacco use in Southeast Asia has significantly decreased over the past two decades, with smoking prevalence dropping from 54% to 23% between 2000 and 2020, according to a WHO report. This success is attributed to strong government policies, including higher taxes, advertising bans, and smoke-free public spaces in countries like Singapore and Thailand. However, the absolute number of smokers has risen due to population growth, and challenges remain, particularly in Indonesia, which has high smoking rates and significant tobacco industry influence. Furthermore, the rising popularity of e-cigarettes, especially among adolescents, presents a new public health concern for the region.</p>

          <h2>Trump Administration Reinstates Student Loan Forgiveness Programs After Lawsuit</h2>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>The Trump administration has agreed to resume processing student loan forgiveness for millions of borrowers under two specific income-driven repayment plans. This decision is the result of a settlement in a lawsuit filed by the American Federation of Teachers, which accused the administration of unlawfully blocking access to debt cancellation mandated by the borrowers' original loan terms. The Education Department had previously paused forgiveness under the Income-Contingent Repayment (ICR) and Pay as You Earn (PAYE) plans. The agreement ensures that eligible borrowers in these programs will again have their debt cancelled after making qualifying payments for 20 to 25 years.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>UK Energy Secretary Ed Miliband has suggested the government is considering cutting the 5% VAT on household energy bills ahead of the November Budget. Acknowledging the country's severe cost-of-living crisis, Miliband stated that officials are "looking at all of these issues" to provide relief, though he emphasized that the long-term solution is transitioning to home-grown clean energy. Scrapping the tax could save an average household around £86 per year. The potential move comes as the government faces mounting pressure to lower energy costs, which recently increased by 2% for millions of households under the latest regulatory price cap.</p>

          <p>American figure skater Ilia Malinin, known as the "Quad God," began his Olympic season with a commanding performance at the Grand Prix de France, winning by a remarkable 40-point margin. The 20-year-old landed five quadruple jumps in his free skate, achieving an overall score of 321.00 and extending his unbeaten streak to nearly two years. Malinin secured the victory without attempting his signature quadruple axel, a jump he is the only person to have ever landed in competition.

          <p>J.D. Power has released its 2025 North American Airport Satisfaction Study, which evaluates mega-airports based on factors like ease of travel, terminal facilities, and staff. The study, which defines mega-airports as those serving 33 million or more passengers annually, found that overall satisfaction remains high despite record travel numbers. An expert noted that the top-performing airports excel in fundamental areas such as cleanliness and TSA efficiency, with food, beverage, and retail options being a significant factor in scores. While the ongoing government shutdown is causing some travel disruptions, it has not yet had a major impact on these satisfaction rankings.</p>

          <p>A financial analysis highlights the concept of "asymmetric upside" in the stock market, demonstrating that historical gains during bull markets have far surpassed the losses from preceding bear markets. For example, while a 50% loss requires a 100% gain to break even, the S&P 500 has consistently recovered and achieved significant new highs. After the 2007 financial crisis caused a 55% decline, the market responded with an 11-year bull run that delivered a 527% return. This historical data suggests that for long-term investors in diversified indexes, the potential for substantial gains has historically outweighed the impact of periodic downturns.

          <p>Thousands of spectators gathered in Madrid to watch the annual Transhumance Festival, where a large flock of sheep and goats were herded through the city's streets. The event honors the ancient pastoral tradition of moving livestock between seasonal grazing grounds and highlights its modern environmental benefits, such as using livestock to clear flammable undergrowth and reduce wildfire risk. The festival, which has been held since 1994, follows an ancient migration route that the Spanish capital was built upon. As part of the tradition, organizers pay a symbolic fee of medieval coins to city hall for the animals' right of passage.</p>

          <p>Following more than a week of deadly border clashes, Pakistan and the Taliban government in Afghanistan have agreed to an immediate ceasefire. The agreement, mediated by Qatar and Turkey, aims to establish mechanisms for lasting peace after the most intense fighting between the two sides since the Taliban regained power in 2021. The conflict had escalated after Pakistan was accused of carrying out attacks in Kabul. Under the new deal, the Taliban has agreed not to support groups that attack Pakistan, and both parties have committed to avoiding targeting security forces, civilians, or critical infrastructure.</p>

          <p>The UK government has unveiled a strategy to create an additional 400,000 jobs in the clean energy sector by 2030 to support its transition to renewable power. The plan identifies 31 priority occupations, including plumbers, electricians, and welders, and includes initiatives like establishing new technical colleges and programs to match military veterans with careers in solar, wind, and nuclear industries. Energy Secretary Ed Miliband stated the plan will bring well-paid, secure jobs to industrial heartlands and is essential for lowering energy bills long-term. The announcement was welcomed by unions, though the opposition criticized the government's current net-zero policies for driving up electricity costs.</p>
