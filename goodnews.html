        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>The European Union and Indonesia have concluded a free trade pact, the Comprehensive Economic Partnership Agreement (CEPA), after over nine years of negotiations, a process expedited by US President Donald Trump's tariff policies. The deal aims to eliminate most tariffs on EU exports like car parts and pharmaceuticals, while opening investment in sectors such as electric vehicles. This agreement is expected to boost jobs and growth for both parties, securing critical raw materials for Europe and providing Indonesia wider access to the EU market. Officials estimate EU exporters will save approximately €600 million annually in duties.</p>

          <p>Shares of Danish renewables company Orsted surged by 6.6% after a U.S. District Court granted a preliminary injunction, allowing the firm to resume construction of its Revolution Wind project. This offshore wind farm, located off Rhode Island and Connecticut, had been halted by the Trump administration's policy against such projects. The court's decision represents a significant victory for Orsted, which has been negatively impacted by the administration's stance on wind power. The company plans to restart work on the nearly completed project as soon as possible, providing a reprieve for the embattled firm.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>England's National Health Service has launched "Jess's Rule," a new initiative urging general practitioners to re-evaluate diagnoses if a patient presents with worsening or undiagnosed symptoms after three appointments. Named after Jessica Brady, who died from advanced cancer at 27 after repeated misdiagnoses, the rule aims to prevent avoidable deaths by promoting earlier specialist referrals or additional tests. Health Secretary Wes Streeting called her death a "preventable tragedy," emphasizing the rule's potential to improve patient safety. The Royal College of General Practitioners supports this best practice approach, especially for younger patients and ethnic minorities who often face diagnostic delays.</p>

          <p>Global investment in renewable energy reached a record $386 billion in the first half of 2025, a 10% increase from the previous year, despite efforts by the Trump administration to hinder low-carbon projects. This growth indicates the sector's resilience and momentum, with significant finance directed towards onshore and offshore wind, particularly in China and Europe. Future clean energy finance announcements, largely for energy grids, are also substantial. Furthermore, a separate report found that most large companies are continuing with net-zero plans, suggesting the White House's impact on corporate climate decisions is limited, even as the US federal government has withdrawn from the Paris Agreement.

          <p>Forty years ago, Tony Jacklin transformed the Ryder Cup, leading Europe to its first victory in 1985 and subsequently masterminding its first away triumph in 1987. Decades of American dominance had left the biennial golf contest on the brink of irrelevance. Jacklin, a two-time major winner, accepted the captaincy in 1983 with a list of demands for improved conditions and the inclusion of star player Severiano Ballesteros, whom he personally convinced to join. His strategic leadership and emphasis on team unity fostered a new competitive spirit, ultimately rescuing the event and laying the groundwork for Europe's future successes.</p>

          <p>Australian pediatrician Mike Freelander strongly refutes recent claims linking paracetamol (acetaminophen) use during pregnancy to autism, emphasizing its established safety based on rigorous scientific evidence from global medicine regulators. He highlights that autism is a complex neurodevelopmental disorder, often without a singular cause, and that discredited claims, like those concerning vaccines, cause significant distress and poor health outcomes. Freelander stresses the importance of trusting regulatory frameworks and expert scientific evidence over unscientific health policies. He warns that unsubstantiated comments about such disorders can lead to anxiety and inappropriate health decisions, underscoring the need for evidence-based information.</p>

          <p>U.S. House Representative Adam Smith, leading a bipartisan delegation to Beijing, emphasized the critical need for greater communication between the U.S. and Chinese militaries, especially given China's rising strength and nuclear arsenal. Smith warned that a lack of regular dialogue on capabilities and intentions is dangerous, increasing the risk of miscalculations and misunderstandings that could lead to larger problems. He highlighted rapid advancements in AI and cyberspace as amplifying these risks. Smith urged China to engage more with other large militaries for "basic deconfliction," stressing that even as Beijing downplays its nuclear strength, a conversation about it is essential.</p>

          <p>A federal judge has ordered the Trump administration to restore $500 million in federal grant funding to UCLA, which had been frozen over allegations of civil rights violations related to antisemitism and affirmative action. U.S. District Judge Rita Lin ruled that the government likely violated the Administrative Procedure Act by failing to provide specific explanations for the cuts. This ruling follows a previous order that restored $81 million to UCLA from the National Science Foundation. The administration had sought a $1 billion payment from UCLA to settle its investigation, which California Governor Gavin Newsom called an extortion attempt.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Modern Premier League football is increasingly adopting tactics long championed by manager Sam Allardyce, often criticized in his time. Coaches are now emphasizing set-pieces, direct long passes, and utilizing large strikers, moving away from strict possession-based play. Allardyce, who guided teams like Bolton to success with these methods, notes a shift away from the "pandemic" of playing out from the back due to the risks of losing possession in one's own half. He also highlights the growing importance of set-piece coaches and strategic innovation. Allardyce encourages young coaches to be different and embrace tactics that surprise opponents.</p>
