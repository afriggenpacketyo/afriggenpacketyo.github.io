          <p>Poland's Iga Świątek has won her first Wimbledon women's singles title, defeating American Amanda Anisimova in a decisive 6-0, 6-0 final. The match, lasting under an hour, marked only the second "double bagel" victory in a Wimbledon final during the Open era. The win is a historic first for a Polish singles player at the tournament and a remarkable achievement for Anisimova, who reached the final after taking a break from tennis in 2023 for mental health reasons. Kate, the Princess of Wales, presented the trophy.</p>

          <p>Milwaukee Brewers' rookie pitcher Jacob Misiorowski has been named a Major League Baseball All-Star after just five games, a decision that has generated significant controversy. The 23-year-old, known for his 103 mph fastball, has an impressive 2.81 ERA but his limited experience has led many to question the selection. Critics point to more established pitchers like Christopher Sanchez of the Philadelphia Phillies who were overlooked despite strong seasons. Supporters, however, argue that MLB is wisely using the opportunity to market one of its bright, emerging stars.</p>

          <p>Despite the Trump administration's recent announcements of significant tariffs on goods from the EU, Mexico, and Canada, the U.S. stock market has remained near record highs. This article analyzes why investors are not panicking as they did in the past, suggesting they have become more accustomed to the president's negotiation tactics. Analysts advise focusing on policy implications for corporate earnings rather than political rhetoric, highlighting deregulation and unfettered AI development as key drivers of market optimism. The upcoming earnings season, particularly for major banks, will be a critical indicator of the economy's underlying strength. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>The third cricket Test between England and India is finely balanced after three days of intense play at Lord's, with both teams level on first-innings scores of 387. England's bowlers rallied late in the sweltering heat, taking India's last four wickets for just 11 runs to prevent the tourists from building a lead. Key performances included a century for India's KL Rahul and vital contributions from Ravindra Jadeja and Rishabh Pant. The match has been a strategic battle on a slow pitch, with tempers flaring at the end of the day, setting up a dramatic final two days.</p>

He is believed to have managed trafficking routes from Colombia, Peru, and Ecuador for one of the world's most powerful criminal organizations.

          <p>The burger chain Wahlburgers has quietly closed 79 locations this year, but the company's CEO has clarified the context behind the move. The closures are primarily the result of ending a franchise agreement with the Hy-Vee grocery store chain, affecting small food court kiosks rather than full-service restaurants. CEO Randy Sharpe emphasized that these were not significant revenue drivers and that the company is now focused on quality over quantity. To signal its forward momentum, the chain recently launched a new summer menu featuring items like a Teriyaki Pineapple Smashburger and a Strawberry Shortcake Shake.</p>

After leaving the restaurant industry due to burnout, Kirby developed his hummus recipe while studying at Cornell, using a $450 blender and starting with just a few thousand dollars. He focused on slow, deep growth in the Upstate New York market before expanding, a strategy necessitated by the product's short shelf life.
