          <p>Veteran actor Harrison Ford, recently nominated for his first Emmy for the series "Shrinking," has shared what continues to drive his passion for his craft after more than five decades in Hollywood. The 83-year-old star stated that his real pleasure comes from the work itself and the "mystery" of the creative process, rather than awards or accolades. Ford emphasized his excitement for the unpredictable nature of the industry and credited the writers on his current show for helping him expand his acting range. He also reflected on early career advice where he was told his name was too pretentious and that he had no future in the business.</p>

          <p>Australia's national rugby team secured a stunning 38-22 victory against world champions South Africa after overcoming a significant early deficit in Johannesburg. The Wallabies were down 22-0 just twenty minutes into the match but mounted an impressive rally to win at Ellis Park for the first time since 1963. The Springboks initially dominated with three quick tries, but Australia took control of the breakdown, with captain Harry Wilson leading the charge and scoring two tries himself. The comeback was sealed with additional tries from Dylan Pietsch, Max Jorgensen, Joseph Suaalii, and a final solo effort from Tom Wright, marking a historic win for the team.</p>

          <p>The fashion brand Topshop is making a major comeback to physical retail, with plans to open new standalone stores on the British High Street for the first time since its collapse in 2020. The relaunch was marked by the brand's first catwalk show in seven years, held in London's Trafalgar Square, signaling a renewed ambition to reclaim its former cultural relevance. Industry experts note that while there is significant nostalgia for the brand, its success will depend on attracting a new generation of shoppers beyond its original millennial base. The company's management acknowledges the competitive landscape but believes there is a market gap for its distinct "London girl" aesthetic.</p>

          <p>During the Alaska summit, President Donald Trump is reported to have hand-delivered a personal letter from First Lady Melania Trump to Russian President Vladimir Putin. The letter addressed the plight of Ukrainian children who have been abducted and transferred to Russia during the war, a situation Ukraine has labeled a war crime and potential genocide. Putin is currently under an international criminal court indictment for his alleged role in these abductions. Ukrainian officials expressed gratitude for the First Lady's efforts, with Foreign Minister Andrii Sybiha calling it a "true act of humanism." The issue remains a significant concern for the U.S. administration and lawmakers.</p>

          <p>The S&P 500 and Nasdaq Composite indexes both closed the week at record highs, driven by investor optimism regarding potential interest rate cuts from the Federal Reserve. Wall Street's positive momentum was largely fueled by a July consumer price index report that showed inflation cooling more than anticipated, increasing the likelihood of a rate cut in September. Although a subsequent report indicated a rise in wholesale inflation, it did not significantly dampen market expectations for looser monetary policy. The week also saw several major stocks, including Goldman Sachs, Nvidia, and Meta, hit all-time highs. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>The Prince and Princess of Wales are planning to move to Forest Lodge, an eight-bedroom home in Windsor Great Park, along with their three children. The family has been living at Adelaide Cottage since 2022, a period that has included the Princess's recent cancer diagnosis and treatment. A royal source indicated the move is seen as an opportunity for a "fresh start" and a chance to leave behind some difficult memories, with Forest Lodge intended to be their long-term family home. The couple will continue to fund their living arrangements privately and will not have live-in staff, aiming to maintain as much privacy as possible.</p>

          <p>Grace Chambers, a 97-year-old from Belfast, has set a new European record by becoming the oldest person to complete 250 Parkrun events. She achieved the milestone at Ormeau Park just four weeks after undergoing heart surgery, demonstrating remarkable resilience and determination. Chambers began her Parkrun journey at age 88 as part of her rehabilitation from a previous surgery and has since become a beloved local figure, inspiring fellow runners and even running alongside Olympian Dame Kelly Holmes. Despite her achievements, she remains humble, expressing hope that her story encourages others to start running, and stated she was "over the moon" to have finished.</p>

          <p>In Phoenix, Arizona, architect Brian Stark is addressing the affordable housing crisis by designing and building shelters for the unhoused population using repurposed shipping containers. His "X-WING" shelters, developed with the company Steel + Spark, consist of four containers arranged in an 'X' shape, creating five individual, air-conditioned rooms and shared courtyard spaces. The units are topped with solar panels and can be constructed in just one week, offering a rapid and sustainable housing solution in a city with extreme temperatures. Stark's next project is a 105-unit apartment complex for low-income seniors, continuing his mission to use existing materials to create dignified living spaces.</p>

          <p>Judy Faulkner, the 82-year-old founder and CEO of Epic Systems, has built the dominant electronic health record software company in the U.S. while deliberately avoiding the typical Silicon Valley model. Since starting the company in a Wisconsin basement in 1979, she has never taken venture capital funding and has steadfastly refused to go public or be acquired, maintaining private control. Epic's software is used in over 40% of U.S. hospitals, and Faulkner has amassed a net worth of nearly $8 billion, 99% of which she has pledged to charity. Her unique leadership style and the company's quirky campus have led some to describe her as a "female cross between Bill Gates and Willy Wonka."</p>

          <p>Jamaican sprinter Kishane Thompson claimed victory over Olympic champion Noah Lyles in their first 100-meter race since the Paris Olympics. At the Silesia Diamond League meet, Thompson ran a meet-record-tying time of 9.87 seconds, narrowly beating Lyles, who finished second in 9.90 seconds. The race was a measure of redemption for Thompson, who had lost to Lyles by just five-thousandths of a second in the Olympic final a year prior. Lyles, despite the loss, viewed his performance as a "great stepping stone" and expressed confidence as he prepares for the upcoming world championships in Tokyo.</p>

          <p>A 46-year-old man was successfully rescued after being trapped for two days behind a powerful waterfall in a remote area of California. The man, Ryan Wardwell, had been rappelling down a series of waterfalls known as the Seven Teacups when the intense force of the water pushed him off his lines, leaving him stranded. A search was initiated after he failed to return to his car, and a dive and rescue team eventually located him using a drone. The California Highway Patrol then used a helicopter to hoist him to safety, and he was treated for minor injuries before being reunited with his family.</p>

          <p>A prominent academic from the Chinese Academy of Sciences has called for China to create a top-down national strategy to accelerate its development of space-based solar power. The technology involves building large solar arrays in orbit that would convert sunlight into electricity and transmit the energy back to Earth using microwaves or lasers. This method offers a continuous power source unaffected by weather or nighttime, but China is considered to be lagging behind the United States in key areas of its development. The scientist argued that relying on scattered efforts from universities is insufficient for such a large-scale project and that a more coordinated national effort is needed.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>A recent collection of articles from The Atlantic examines the phenomenon of "intensive parenting" and its detrimental effects on both children and adults. This parenting style, characterized by constant supervision and intervention, is exhausting for parents and can undermine a child's confidence and independence. As an alternative, the articles advocate for the "Lighthouse Parent" model, where parents act as a steady, reliable guide, offering illumination and safety when needed but otherwise allowing their children to navigate their own journeys. This approach encourages parents to resist the instinct to immediately solve every problem, fostering resilience and self-reliance in their children instead.</p>

          <p>Police in Devon and Cornwall have seized £180,000 that controversial influencer Andrew Tate had paid as a deposit for a special-edition Aston Martin Valhalla supercar in 2021. A court order granted the forfeiture after the force argued the funds were proceeds from tax evasion and money laundering, claims which Tate and his brother did not contest. This seizure is in addition to £2.7 million of the brothers' funds forfeited in December 2024 for failure to pay taxes on revenue from their online businesses. Authorities stated the seized money will be reinvested into crime prevention initiatives and support for victims in the local community.</p>
