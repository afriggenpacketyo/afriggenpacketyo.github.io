        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>The UK's House of Commons has voted to pass the Football Governance Bill, which will establish an independent regulator for the top five divisions of men's football in England. The legislation, reintroduced by the new Labour government, aims to protect clubs by ensuring their financial sustainability and placing fans at the heart of the game. A proposed amendment by the Liberal Democrats to make more Premier League matches available on free-to-air television was voted down, with the government citing the need to balance public access with broadcasting revenue for investment.</p>

          <p>This article compares the interest-earning potential of placing $20,000 into a certificate of deposit (CD) versus a high-yield savings account amidst market uncertainty. It calculates that short-term CDs currently offer slightly higher returns, while high-yield savings accounts can outperform over longer periods, assuming their variable rates remain stable. The analysis advises savers to weigh the fixed, less-liquid nature of CDs against the accessibility and variable rates of high-yield savings accounts, suggesting a split strategy could be optimal for some.

          <h2>Researchers Develop Sustainable Bricks from Recycled Coffee Grounds</h2>
          <div class="timestamp">2025-07-08 15:00:46 EDT</div>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Researchers at Australia's Swinburne University of Technology have developed a method for creating strong, sustainable bricks from used coffee grounds. This innovative process significantly reduces both construction emissions and costs, as the coffee bricks require baking at much lower temperatures than traditional clay bricks, cutting energy use by up to 80%. An Australian company, Green Brick, has licensed the intellectual property, paving the way for the commercial use of this eco-friendly building material.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>This article offers guidance for homeowners interested in a no-closing-cost Home Equity Line of Credit (HELOC). It clarifies that while these products eliminate upfront fees, lenders often recover these costs through higher interest rates or penalties if the line of credit is closed early. Borrowers are advised to carefully calculate the break-even point, understand the variable rate structures, and be aware of potentially stricter credit requirements and clawback provisions before proceeding.

          <p>The Trump administration has abandoned its plan to reconsider and potentially weaken a Biden-era rule that banned chrysotile asbestos, the last form of the carcinogen legally used in the United States. Following a significant outcry from public health advocates and asbestos opponents, the Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) notified a federal court that it will now defend the existing ban. This reversal is seen as a major victory for public health, preventing further delays in protecting workers and the public from asbestos-related diseases.</p>

The rule, implemented in 2006 after the attempted "shoe bomber" plot, is being phased out due to advancements in screening technology. While the change has been reported at several airports, including in Philadelphia and Washington D.C., the lack of a formal nationwide announcement has led to some confusion among passengers.</p>
