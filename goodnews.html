          <h2>Thames Water Pauses Executive Bonus Scheme Amid Public Outcry</h2>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Thames Water has decided to halt its executive bonus scheme, responding to criticism from the government and public regarding potential payouts amidst the company's financial struggles and environmental performance. The decision follows accusations that the company was attempting to bypass regulations aimed at preventing water companies from awarding bonuses despite mismanagement and failures. The company will await guidance from the regulator Ofwat to ensure its approach aligns with both turnaround objectives and public expectations. Thames Water has faced scrutiny over sewage discharges, leaks, and its ¬£20bn debt, requiring a ¬£3bn emergency loan to avoid collapse, and the government has expressed strong disapproval of executives being rewarded despite these issues.</p>

          <p>Tim Friede, a man who has allowed himself to be bitten by venomous snakes over 200 times, may hold the key to developing a universal antivenom. Friede has gradually built up an immunity to various types of venom, prompting researchers to investigate whether his blood could be used for public benefit. The World Health Organization estimates that millions are bitten by venomous snakes annually, resulting in tens of thousands of deaths and disabilities. Researchers hope to synthesize a treatment from Friede's blood that can neutralize toxins from multiple snake bites, offering a more effective and accessible solution.</p>

          <p>Pope Leo XIV's election has sparked debate among Maga Catholics, with some viewing him as a continuation of Pope Francis's progressive stance. However, the new pope's choice of name signals a potential confrontation with Trumpian nationalism, as he aims to address issues like inequality, climate change, and migration. Pope Leo XIV intends to follow in the footsteps of Leo XIII, who confronted the ruthless economics of the Industrial Revolution, promoting social solidarity and a just wage. This stance challenges the nationalistic and insular form of solidarity embraced by the Maga movement, setting the stage for a clash over Catholic social teaching.</p>

        </div>
        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>The Tokyo metropolitan government will waive basic water utility charges for households for four months this summer, aiming to encourage residents to use air conditioning without financial concerns amid increasingly extreme heat. A supplementary budget bill of 36.8 billion yen ($256 million) will be submitted to the Tokyo metropolitan assembly in June to cover the costs. Tokyo Governor Yuriko Koike stated that this measure is intended to protect residents' lives and daily living, given declining real wages and predictions of an extremely hot summer. About 8.2 million households are expected to benefit from the plan.</p>

        </div>
        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>The Trump administration has considered suspending habeas corpus, a foundational principle of the Constitution that protects people from unlawful detention. Homeland Security Secretary Kristi Noem incorrectly described it as the president‚Äôs right to deport people, highlighting confusion about its purpose. Habeas corpus ensures that people are not detained without valid legal grounds, allowing individuals to challenge their detention in court. While the Constitution allows Congress to suspend habeas corpus during rebellion or invasion, the executive branch cannot do so unilaterally, as affirmed by the Supreme Court in cases involving Guant√°namo Bay detainees.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>The Los Angeles Dodgers secured a dramatic 4-3 walk-off victory against the Arizona Diamondbacks, ending a four-game losing streak. Yoshinobu Yamamoto delivered a stellar performance, pitching seven scoreless innings with nine strikeouts. Despite Yamamoto's brilliance, the Dodgers found themselves trailing after closer Tanner Scott blew a lead, but a late rally in the bottom of the 10th inning, highlighted by a walk-off sacrifice fly from Max Muncy, secured the win. The victory was particularly significant given the Dodgers' recent struggles and the importance of capitalizing on Yamamoto's strong outing.</p>
