          <p>President Trump indicated potential trade agreements could be announced soon, facing pressure to finalize deals before a tariff pause concludes in July. Trump mentioned a "major trade deal" with a "big, highly respected country" and hinted at an agreement with the United Kingdom. Negotiations are reportedly ongoing with Canada, Italy, India, and Japan, while China remains absent from active discussions. Experts suggest any agreements are likely to be nonbinding, and Treasury Secretary Bessent anticipates reduced tariffs and resolutions to non-tariff barriers.</p>

          <p>President Trump criticized Federal Reserve Chairman Jerome Powell for not lowering interest rates, attributing economic uncertainty to tariffs. The Fed decided to maintain rates due to concerns about higher unemployment and inflation, resisting pressure to counteract potential economic slowdowns from Trump's trade policies. Powell stated that the Fed's decisions are based solely on economic data and the outlook for employment and price stability. Trump previously caused market concerns by suggesting he might fire Powell, but later clarified he had "no intention" of doing so.</p>

          <p>The British government is poised to announce a trade deal with the United States, which aims to mitigate the impact of increased U.S. tariffs and support the British economy. The agreement could bolster sectors like Britain's auto industry and lift consumer and business sentiment. While the U.S. is a key trading partner, the impact on the overall British economy may be limited, as trade flows are heavily skewed toward services. The Bank of England has cautiously cut interest rates due to concerns about price pressures and trade uncertainty.</p>

Weightlifting helped her build emotional strength, repair disordered eating habits, and embrace movement, rest, and eating equally.
