          <p>House Republicans made last-minute revisions to their tax cut and immigration bill to garner support before a House vote. Changes include renaming "MAGA" investment accounts to "Trump" accounts and accelerating work requirements for Medicaid beneficiaries. The revised bill also increases the cap on state and local tax deductions to $40,000 for certain households and deregulates gun silencers. Additionally, the bill creates a $12 billion fund for border security efforts and accelerates the Inflation Reduction Act tax credit phaseout for wind, solar, and battery storage to 2028. </p>

          <p>The Japanese government is considering reusing soil removed from areas around the Fukushima Daiichi nuclear power plant at the prime minister's office and other government buildings. The initiative aims to set a precedent for soil recycling outside Fukushima Prefecture, after similar projects faced local opposition. The soil, deemed safe by the Environment Ministry, would be used for flowerbeds and other purposes in Tokyo's Kasumigaseki district. This effort supports Japan's goal to recycle soil with low radioactivity for public works, reducing the overall waste volume. </p>

          <p>As Major League Soccer celebrates its 30th season, it can learn from the J League's approach to relevance in a soccer-reluctant country. The J League focused on developing players and establishing strong local relationships, while MLS started with new franchises under a single entity system. J League chairman Yoshikazu Nonomura emphasizes player development and creating a professional pathway. MLS can also learn from the J League's post-Iniesta media investments and unified ticketing system. A key lesson is to involve fans as stakeholders in major decisions, such as transitioning to a fall-spring format. </p>

The technique is scalable and cost-effective, potentially transforming air quality networks into global wildlife monitoring systems. </p>

          <p>Paul Elie's "The Last Supper" captures a pivotal moment in social history when religion, art, and sexuality collided in the 1980s. The book surveys artists who grappled with crypto-religion, creating thought-provoking art in response to Ronald Reagan's rise and the conservative Christian movement. Artists such as Andy Warhol, Sin√©ad O'Connor, Bob Dylan, and Martin Scorsese negotiated the liminal space between belief and non-belief, producing work that challenged the church's narrow views. The book is a reminder of art's power in matters of the heart and soul. </p>

          <p>Bitcoin reached a new all-time high above $111,000, continuing its 2025 bull run. The surge comes despite declines in U.S. stock markets. Analysts attribute the price appreciation to growing institutional appetite and regulatory progress in the U.S. Supply dynamics are also playing a key role, with the amount of bitcoin held on exchanges dropping to historic lows.
