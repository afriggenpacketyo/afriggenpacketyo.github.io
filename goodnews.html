          <p>In response to the deadly floods in Texas Hill Country, a group of over 30 active and former Navy SEALs have volunteered to assist in the difficult search and recovery operations. Leveraging their specialized skills in navigating treacherous terrain and diving, the SEALs are working along the devastated Guadalupe River to locate victims and provide closure for families. The volunteers, partnering with a non-profit organization, have been instrumental in combing through miles of debris and flattened forests. Their efforts represent a significant community-driven response to the large-scale natural disaster.</p>

          <p>Drake headlined London's Wireless festival with a series of performances that heavily featured a star-studded lineup of guest artists, seemingly countering recent narratives about his cultural relevance. Over two nights, he shared the stage with UK rap titans like Dave, Central Cee, and Skepta, as well as R&B legends like Lauryn Hill. The shows, which drew massive crowds, were structured to celebrate different eras of Drake's career and his collaborations across various genres. The enthusiastic reception and willingness of so many artists to perform with him demonstrated his continued strong standing, particularly within the UK music scene.</p>

          <p>As the global space economy is projected to reach $1.8 trillion by 2035, China's private aerospace sector is experiencing a significant boom, supported by state initiatives and increased private investment. This opinion article argues that Hong Kong is uniquely positioned to become a vital hub for this burgeoning industry, leveraging its status as an international financial center to attract capital and talent. With Chinese companies like i-Space and LandSpace already achieving major milestones, Hong Kong can facilitate further growth by connecting mainland innovation with global markets, contributing to China's ambitions in space exploration and commercialization.</p>

          <p>China is strategically investing in what it calls 'future industries' as part of a new growth model centered on technological advancement and industrial upgrading. First mentioned by President Xi Jinping in 2020, this initiative targets foundational technologies that are currently in their infancy but hold immense potential. Key sectors identified by the government include humanoid robots, 6G networks, brain-computer interfaces, large-scale AI data centers, and next-generation aircraft. This push aims to secure China's position in the global tech race and transition its economy toward high-value, innovation-driven sectors.</p>

          <h2>Analysis: Why Boeing Discontinued the C-17 Globemaster and Why It Might Return</h2>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Boeing's iconic C-17 Globemaster III military transport aircraft, known for its massive cargo capacity and ability to land on short, undeveloped runways, was discontinued in 2015 primarily due to a lack of new orders. After the U.S. Air Force completed its purchase order, and with defense budget cuts looming, demand waned for the expensive aircraft. However, recent global conflicts have renewed interest in the C-17's unique capabilities, sparking discussions about potentially resuming production. Reviving the assembly line would be a major challenge, as the original Long Beach factory has been shuttered.</p>

          <h2>Lab-Grown Cheese Nears Market, But Faces Challenges of Consumer Acceptance and Price</h2>
          <div class="timestamp">2025-07-12 20:12:02 EDT</div>
        </div>
        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Start-ups like Better Dairy in the UK are on the verge of bringing lab-grown cheese, made using precision fermentation, to consumer markets within the next few years. The technology uses genetically modified yeast to produce casein, the key protein in milk, which is then combined with plant-based fats to create cheese without any animal involvement. While proponents tout environmental and health benefits, the industry faces significant hurdles, including high initial costs, regulatory approval, and overcoming consumer skepticism about ultra-processed foods. The success of these products will depend on their ability to match the taste and price of traditional dairy cheese.</p>

          <p>Despite declining traditional TV viewership in recent years, the reality show 'Love Island' is experiencing a significant resurgence in engagement, largely driven by its presence on TikTok. The show's official social media accounts have gained millions of followers, with short-form clips, recaps, and fan commentary on TikTok receiving massive view counts. This shift in consumption habits allows viewers to keep up with the drama without committing to nightly hour-long episodes. While this boosts the show's overall reach, some express concern that it distorts the viewing experience by presenting contestants through out-of-context, bite-sized clips.</p>
