          <p>A long-standing succession dispute within Rupert Murdoch's media empire has concluded with an agreement that ensures his son, Lachlan, will control the trust for News Corp and Fox Corp. The deal will see siblings James, Elisabeth, and Prudence sell their holdings, preventing them from influencing the conservative editorial direction of outlets like Fox News. This resolution ends years of family tension and litigation, which famously inspired the television series "Succession." The agreement finalizes Lachlan's leadership role following Rupert Murdoch's step back in 2023.</p>

In Indonesia, markets reacted negatively to the unexpected dismissal of the finance minister, causing the rupiah to weaken. Meanwhile, Hong Kong's Hang Seng index reached a multi-year high, reflecting broader regional trends as investors tracked gains in US tech stocks.</p>

          <p>New league tables rating the performance of NHS trusts in England have been published for the first time, with specialist institutions like Moorfields Eye Hospital ranking highest. The system scores trusts on seven metrics, including waiting times, A&E performance, and financial management, sorting them into four categories. Health Secretary Wes Streeting stated the tables will help identify where support is needed, but some trusts have questioned the metrics used. The rankings aim to increase transparency and drive improvements, with top performers gaining more autonomy.</p>

          <p>Apple is set to reveal its next iPhone lineup, with speculation that prices may increase due to tariffs imposed by the Trump administration on goods from China. The new models are expected to feature incremental improvements in camera quality and battery life, with a possible new ultra-thin "Air" model. The launch comes as Apple faces pressure to deliver on its artificial intelligence promises after some features were delayed. Analysts suggest the relatively minor updates and trade war pressures are creating a pivotal moment for the company's innovation and market strategy.</p>

          <p>England's football team, under manager Thomas Tuchel, is preparing for a challenging World Cup qualifying match against Serbia in Belgrade. Despite a perfect record of four wins and no goals conceded in the campaign so far, England's performances have been described as uninspired. The match in Serbia's hostile Rajko Mitic Stadium is seen as the first major test of temperament and progress for Tuchel's squad. A victory would put England in a commanding position to qualify for the World Cup, but Serbia presents a formidable opponent.</p>

          <p>This article analyzes why large orders for Boeing aircraft have become a recurring feature in trade deals struck by the Trump administration. Countries striking deals with the U.S., including South Korea, Japan, and the UK, have often announced multi-billion dollar purchases of Boeing jets. Experts suggest these high-profile, high-value orders serve as a visible way for nations to show they are addressing trade surpluses with the U.S. Additionally, aircraft are a less politically sensitive import than agricultural or industrial goods, and the long delivery timelines ease immediate financial strain on the purchasing airlines.</p>
