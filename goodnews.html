          <p>Federal Reserve Governor Christopher Waller, a potential candidate for the next Fed chair, has publicly called for an interest rate cut at the upcoming September meeting. Citing concerns about a rapidly deteriorating labor market, Waller argued for a proactive approach, suggesting multiple cuts could occur over the next three to six months to bring rates closer to a neutral level. He emphasized that the central bank should not be locked into a rigid sequence of cuts but should remain flexible based on incoming economic data. Waller also stressed the importance of the Fed's independence amid political pressures. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>Macy's stock jumped over 10% after the retailer reported second-quarter earnings that significantly surpassed Wall Street estimates and raised its financial guidance for the full year. The company's CEO, Tony Spring, attributed the positive results to a resilient consumer and successful strategies, including revamping 125 key stores, which outperformed other locations. Despite concerns about tariffs, the company has factored them into its optimistic outlook, citing strong performance across its portfolio, including Bloomingdale's and Bluemercury. The strong sales growth marks a notable turnaround after the company had cut its guidance in the previous quarter.</p>

          <p>Alphabet's shares climbed 7% following a favorable ruling in its major antitrust case, where a U.S. District Judge decided against the Department of Justice's most severe proposals. Google will not be forced to divest its Chrome browser or Android operating system, removing a significant overhang on the company's stock. The ruling also permits Google to continue its lucrative arrangement to be the default search engine on Apple devices, though it cannot enforce exclusivity in such contracts. Investors viewed the outcome as a major victory, bolstering confidence in the long-term stability of Google's core search and advertising business.</p>

        </div>
        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Gold is widely regarded as a safe-haven asset, particularly during periods of economic instability, with its price influenced by a complex interplay of market forces. Key drivers include fundamental supply and demand, global economic conditions, and inflation rates, as investors often use the precious metal to hedge against the eroding purchasing power of fiat currencies. Additionally, geopolitical uncertainty, central bank policies, and the strength of the U.S. dollar all play significant roles in its valuation. Interest rates are also a critical factor, as lower rates decrease the opportunity cost of holding a non-yielding asset like gold. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>The UK government is considering a plan to merge the country's six steel companies into one national entity to address the sector's financial instability. With four of the companies already receiving government support, ministers believe consolidation is the best path to long-term sustainability, preferring a joint private buyer over full nationalization. The industry has been struggling with high energy costs, tariffs, and a global steel surplus. The government is actively seeking buyers for two companies, Liberty Steel and British Steel, and is engaging in negotiations with the Chinese owners of the latter to facilitate a handover.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>The depiction of children in art has evolved significantly throughout history, reflecting societal shifts in the perception of childhood itself. In the Middle Ages, art focused on religious themes, with the Christ child being the most common representation, often appearing glorified and adult-like. As the modern era emerged, the affluent bourgeoisie began commissioning portraits that styled their children after mythological figures to symbolize virtues. It wasn't until the 17th century that peasant children became worthy artistic subjects, initially to evoke charity, before the modern concept of a carefree, playful childhood emerged in the 18th and 19th centuries.</p>
