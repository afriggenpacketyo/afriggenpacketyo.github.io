          <p>President Trump has appointed Transportation Secretary Sean Duffy to serve as the interim administrator of NASA, highlighting the increasing importance of space in national priorities. Duffy, a former congressman and longtime Trump ally, will temporarily lead the space agency, a role previously held by acting administrator Janet Petro. The appointment follows the withdrawal of Jared Isaacman's nomination for the permanent role in May, which was reportedly due to concerns over his ties to Elon Musk and potential conflicts of interest with SpaceX.</p>

          <p>Amazon's cloud division, AWS, has engineered its own custom hardware to cool the next generation of power-intensive Nvidia GPUs used for artificial intelligence. The new equipment, called the In-Row Heat Exchanger (IRHX), was developed because commercially available solutions were insufficient for AWS's massive scale. This allows AWS to effectively deploy Nvidia's latest high-density computing systems, like the GB200 NVL72, keeping it competitive with other cloud providers. The move reflects a broader trend of major tech companies designing their own hardware to optimize performance and reduce reliance on third-party suppliers.</p>
