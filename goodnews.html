          <p>Jen Pawol made sports history by becoming the first woman to serve as an umpire in a Major League Baseball regular-season game. Her debut was at first base for a match between the Atlanta Braves and Miami Marlins, a moment celebrated by family, friends, and the wider baseball community. The 48-year-old, who has been an umpire in the minor leagues since 2016, called her promotion an emotional and gratifying culmination of years of hard work. Following the game, she donated the cap she wore to the National Baseball Hall of Fame to commemorate the milestone.</p>

          <p>Actress Sophie Turner addressed social media criticism she received for attending an Oasis concert without her two young children. After a user commented that she had forgotten she was a mother, Turner retorted by explaining the concept of shared custody, suggesting the children were with their father, Joe Jonas. Her response garnered significant support from fans who pointed out the double standard often applied to mothers compared to fathers. The incident occurred following the finalization of her divorce from Jonas, which involved a contentious custody battle over their children.</p>

Rose defeated American JJ Spaun on the third sudden-death hole at TPC Southwind in Memphis. The win was a redemption for Rose, who had recently lost a playoff at the Masters. The victory was a disappointment for fellow Englishman Tommy Fleetwood, who entered the final round with a lead but finished tied for third, still seeking his first PGA Tour win after 162 events.</p>

        </div>
        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>The UK government has announced new measures aimed at making it easier for NHS employers in England to hire newly qualified nurses and midwives. The initiative seeks to address a surplus of graduates, with some regions having up to three times more new professionals than available vacancies. The plan simplifies regulations, allowing trusts to hire proactively based on anticipated needs rather than waiting for formal vacancies. While nursing and midwifery colleges welcomed the move, employer representatives raised concerns about how the new hiring would be funded amid already strained budgets.</p>

          <p>In the Chargers' 27-13 preseason victory over the New Orleans Saints, quarterback Trey Lance demonstrated significant progress in the competition for the backup role. Lance was effective with his legs, rushing for 48 yards and a touchdown, while completing 7 of 14 passes. In contrast, Taylor Heinicke, who is also vying for the position, appeared rusty in his first preseason action. The game also showcased the Chargers' defensive depth, with undrafted rookie Eric Rogers making a strong case for a roster spot with two interceptions, including one returned for a touchdown.</p>

She examined her mother Janet Leigh's script from Alfred Hitchcock's "Psycho," noting her mother never took a shower again after filming the infamous murder scene. Curtis also recounted how she convinced director James Cameron to alter a striptease scene in "True Lies" to be more comedic by wearing a dress instead of being nude. She also reflected on her Oscar-winning role in "Everything Everywhere All at Once," explaining that she achieved her character's physique simply by relaxing her body, without prosthetics.</p>

          <p>A 60-foot passenger vessel named Discovery ran aground in powerful surf near Honolulu's Kewalo Basin Harbor. Video captured the boat being tossed by large waves, nearly capsizing before coming to rest near the shore. The two crew members on board were uninjured, and the vessel's operator reported that two large waves hitting the stern disrupted its course. The U.S. Coast Guard is investigating the incident, and the boat's owner, Atlantis Adventures, is coordinating its removal. Fuel and other pollutants were removed from the vessel to prevent environmental damage.</p>

          <p>Financial commentator Dave Ramsey offered advice to a recently divorced man struggling with how to pay his ex-wife her $150,000 share of their home's equity. The caller, who has a low 2.25% mortgage rate, was considering a Home Equity Line of Credit (HELOC) to cover the payment. Ramsey unusually agreed that taking on the HELOC was a sensible way to restructure the existing debt to his ex-wife but cautioned the man against keeping the house for purely emotional reasons, suggesting a fresh start might be better in the long run.

          <p>Historian Rana Mitter, a leading expert on modern China, emphasizes that the Second World War was a pivotal, yet often underestimated, factor in shaping the nation's contemporary trajectory. Speaking 80 years after the war's conclusion, Mitter explains that Japan's invasion shattered much of the infrastructure and communications networks that had been built in the 1920s and 1930s. This widespread destruction forced China to essentially rebuild from scratch in the post-war era, profoundly influencing its political and social development. He asserts that China's current interests are best served by a peaceful Asia-Pacific region.</p>

          <p>A federal judge in Hawaii has reinstated a ban on commercial fishing within the Pacific Remote Islands Marine National Monument, overturning a recent directive from the Trump administration. The ruling blocks a letter from the National Marine Fisheries Service that had permitted fishing in areas previously protected by the Obama administration. The lawsuit, filed by environmental and Native Hawaiian groups, argued that the administration violated federal law by changing the rules without the required public notice and comment period. The decision is being celebrated as a major victory for marine conservation and the rule of law.</p>

          <p>Liverpool's new-look team under manager Arne Slot displayed both brilliant attacking potential and defensive frailties in a 2-2 draw and penalty shootout loss to Crystal Palace in the Community Shield. Four new signings started, with debut goals from Hugo Ekitike and Jeremie Frimpong. However, the team twice surrendered a lead, revealing defensive vulnerabilities, particularly at full-back and in central defense. Record signing Florian Wirtz was a standout performer in a new, free-roaming attacking midfield role, but the overall performance indicates that the team still needs time to adapt and address its defensive bugs.</p>

          <p>England's Rehan Ahmed was the star performer as the Trent Rockets defeated the Northern Superchargers by five wickets, maintaining their perfect start in the men's Hundred cricket tournament. The 20-year-old first excelled with the ball, taking two wickets for 23 runs to help restrict the Superchargers to a modest total of 124-9. He then contributed a crucial 31 runs with the bat during the chase. Despite a mid-innings wobble caused by the Superchargers' spinners, the Rockets successfully reached their target with four balls remaining, thanks to Ahmed's steadying influence.</p>
