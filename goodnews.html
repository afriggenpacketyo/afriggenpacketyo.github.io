          <div class="timestamp">2025-07-09 09:46:41 EDT</div>

          <p>Seven of Britain's largest housebuilding firms have agreed to pay £100 million towards affordable housing to resolve a probe by the Competition and Markets Authority (CMA). The investigation examined whether the companies illegally shared commercially sensitive information, which could have distorted market competition. As part of the settlement, the firms will not admit wrongdoing but will cease sharing such data and implement new compliance programs. This resolution allows the CMA to avoid a lengthy legal battle and a formal decision on whether competition law was broken, instead focusing on immediate benefits for the housing market.</p>

          <p>A new bill signed by President Trump does not eliminate federal income taxes on Social Security benefits, contrary to some claims. Instead, the legislation introduces a new temporary "bonus" tax deduction for seniors, which can lower their overall taxable income. The deduction is up to $6,000 for individuals aged 65 and older with adjusted gross incomes of $75,000 or less. Policy experts note this provides some relief but is not a full repeal of the tax on benefits, and it primarily benefits higher-income seniors while not affecting low-income recipients who already pay no federal income tax.

          <h2>Socialist Candidate Zohran Mamdani's Online Strategy Credited for NYC Mayoral Primary Win</h2>
          <div class="timestamp">2025-07-09 09:30:11 EDT</div>
        </div>
        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Zohran Mamdani's victory in the New York City Democratic mayoral primary is being attributed to a sophisticated and modern social media strategy that resonated with a younger, online electorate. The 33-year-old self-described socialist used platforms like TikTok and Instagram, adopting the style of an influencer with high-quality videos and celebrity cameos to spread his message. His campaign, endorsed by figures like Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez, focused on radical proposals and successfully built a coalition that included voters previously aligned with more moderate or conservative candidates. This victory signals a potential generational shift within the Democratic Party, highlighting the growing power of digital-first political campaigning.</p>

          <p>This article explores when individuals with tax debt should handle the issue themselves versus hiring a professional. For smaller debts, typically under $10,000, a do-it-yourself approach like setting up an online IRS payment plan may be sufficient and more cost-effective. However, experts recommend hiring a tax professional for debts exceeding $10,000, complex situations involving unfiled returns, or when seeking an Offer in Compromise. A professional can help navigate complex processes, advocate on the taxpayer's behalf, and potentially secure a better outcome than an individual could alone, avoiding more severe IRS collection actions.

          <p>Telehealth company Hims & Hers Health has announced its expansion into Canada, where it will offer a generic version of semaglutide, the active ingredient in popular weight-loss drugs Ozempic and Wegovy. The move is timed with the upcoming expiration of Novo Nordisk's patent on the drug in Canada in January. This marks the company's first operation in the country and positions it to capitalize on the growing demand for GLP-1 medications at a more affordable price point. The announcement follows Novo Nordisk's decision to end its collaboration with Hims & Hers over the promotion of knockoff drugs.</p>

          <p>Chinese e-commerce firm JD.com is investing over 10 billion yuan (US$1.4 billion) in its "Double Hundred Plan" to bolster key brands and intensify its competition in the on-demand local delivery sector. The initiative aims to boost sales for select brands by offering increased traffic and marketing incentives. This move heats up the rivalry with market leader Meituan and Alibaba's Taobao Instant Commerce, which recently saw a surge in orders following a price war. The battle for dominance comes as China's overall daily on-demand delivery orders have surpassed 200 million, indicating a rapidly growing market.</p>

          <p>A top official from China's National Development and Reform Commission (NDRC) has stated that the country will continue to maintain a significant scale of investment in megaprojects to drive economic growth. This statement comes amid speculation about Beijing's strategy to boost domestic consumption, especially in light of the ongoing tariff war with the United States. While large-scale investment was crucial in past economic recoveries, it has also led to a substantial increase in debt, particularly at the local government level. The official emphasized that such investment is still essential for improving people's livelihoods as China's per capita GDP grows. (not investment advice)</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Australia has implemented a first-of-its-kind "climate visa" for citizens of Tuvalu, a low-lying Pacific nation severely threatened by rising sea levels. The Falepili Union Treaty allows up to 280 Tuvaluans annually to live, work, or study in Australia, with a pathway to permanent residency. This proactive "climate mobility pathway" differs from traditional refugee status by recognizing climate change as a factor and allowing people to migrate with dignity before disaster strikes. The program, which has already seen high demand, is being watched as a potential model for other nations facing existential climate threats, offering a planned response rather than a purely humanitarian one.</p>

          <p>Freddie, a 5-year-old Customs and Border Protection (CBP) beagle, is returning to work at Dulles International Airport two weeks after being intentionally kicked by a traveler.

The traveler, an Egyptian national, pleaded guilty to assaulting a police animal and was sentenced to time served after paying the dog's veterinary fees. Freddie, a rescue dog trained to detect illicit food items, has recovered from his injuries and is ready to resume his duties protecting U.S. agriculture from foreign pests and diseases.</p>

          <div class="timestamp">2025-07-09 08:50:30 EDT</div>
        </div>
        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>This article details several IRS tax relief programs available to small business owners facing financial difficulties. Options include business installment agreements, which allow for monthly payments, and an Offer in Compromise (OIC), which can settle debt for less than the full amount for businesses in severe hardship. Another option is Currently Not Collectible (CNC) status, which temporarily pauses collections. Experts stress the seriousness of unpaid payroll taxes, as the IRS can pursue personal assets, and advise owners to address the issue proactively rather than ignoring it to avoid escalating penalties and interest.

          <p>The food chain Pret A Manger has launched a new line of "premium" salads, with prices reaching up to £12.95, as it competes for the business of returning office workers. The company states the larger, nutrient-rich salads with premium ingredients meet a growing demand from workers who want to treat themselves on days they are in the office. This move comes as the lunchtime market becomes more competitive and follows previous customer criticism over changes to Pret's popular subscription model. The strategy targets a higher-end market segment, even as many consumers remain concerned about the rising cost of living.</p>
