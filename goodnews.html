          <p>The UK economy experienced a 0.7% expansion in the first three months of the year, surpassing analyst expectations of 0.6%. According to the Office for National Statistics, this growth was primarily fueled by the services sector, with significant contributions from production. Chancellor Rachel Reeves highlighted that the UK's economic performance outpaced that of the US, Canada, France, Italy, and Germany during this period, indicating a positive trajectory for the nation's economy. However, shadow chancellor Mel Stride criticized the rise in employers' National Insurance payments, cautioning that such measures could potentially jeopardize the progress achieved.</p>

          <p>A seemingly ordinary manuscript housed in Harvard Law School's library for eight decades has been identified as an original 1300 version of the Magna Carta, a foundational document of modern liberties. Two British academics, David Carpenter and Nicholas Vincent, made the discovery while researching digital images of the manuscript. The document, purchased for a mere $27.50 after World War II, is now recognized as one of only seven originals from that date still in existence. This discovery underscores the importance of preserving and studying historical documents, especially in times when fundamental freedoms are under threat.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Denmark's economic growth, driven by a surge in pharmaceutical exports, is expected to moderate in the coming years, according to the International Monetary Fund. Despite the looming threat of U.S. tariffs on the pharma industry, Denmark is expected to be shielded as most Danish drug products are neither produced in the country nor cross its borders. The IMF noted that Danish drugmakers rely on a "merchanting and processing" system, contracting manufacturers in other countries for production and shipment. The fund projects medium-term growth at around 1.5%, reflecting a maturing pharmaceutical sector and a declining working-age population.</p>

          <p>A version of the Magna Carta held by Harvard University has been confirmed as an original from 1300, overturning its previous classification as a copy. Experts from King's College London and the University of East Anglia based their conclusion on an analysis of the document's size and handwriting, consistent with those in the six previously known originals. The discovery highlights the significance of the Magna Carta as a cornerstone of freedoms and constitutional history.

          <p>The Kurdistan Worker's Party (PKK) has announced its intention to disband after 41 years of armed conflict with the Turkish state, a move greeted with cautious optimism but also uncertainty. The dissolution of the group, classified as a terrorist organization by some countries, could fundamentally alter the balance of political power in Turkey. Questions remain about the surrender of weapons, the fate of PKK members, and the potential for a new organization to take its place. This development could lead to a more democratic model for Turkey, but challenges persist due to the government's authoritarian tendencies.</p>

          <p>The Japanese government is contemplating doubling the release of stockpiled rice to address a shortfall that has led to near-record high prices. The government is considering releasing 100,000 tons of reserve rice per month for three months, in addition to 321,000 tons already auctioned. This decision is driven by a poor harvest in 2023 and increased rice consumption due to a surge in foreign tourists.

          <p>Boeing and Qatar Airways announced a landmark agreement for the airline to purchase up to 210 jets, marking Boeing's largest-ever order of widebody aircraft. The order includes 130 Boeing 787 Dreamliners and 30 of the 777-9s, with options for 50 more planes. The deal, valued at $96 billion by the White House, is expected to support 400,000 U.S. jobs. This agreement could provide a significant boost for Boeing, which has faced safety concerns and manufacturing challenges in recent years, and it could help to narrow losses as it addresses a backlog worth more than $500 billion.</p>

          <p>A manuscript once considered an unofficial copy of the Magna Carta is now believed to be a genuine version, potentially making it one of the world's most valuable documents. Harvard Law School acquired the document for $27.50 in 1946, and it remained tucked away in its library for years. Two medieval history professors have concluded it is an extraordinarily rare and lost original Magna Carta from 1300, in the reign of King Edward I. The discovery underscores the importance of preserving historical artifacts and the potential for uncovering hidden treasures in unexpected places.</p>
