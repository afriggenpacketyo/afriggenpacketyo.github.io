          <p>David Hogg has stepped down from his position as a Democratic National Committee (DNC) vice chair, citing a "fundamental disagreement" with the party regarding the role of the vice chair. Hogg stated that he will now focus on his PAC, Leaders We Deserve, which supports aligned candidates in Democratic primaries. DNC chair Ken Martin acknowledged Hogg's contributions and respected his decision despite escalating tensions. This development comes as the DNC prepares for re-do elections, with details remaining unclear, especially concerning Malcolm Kenyatta's candidacy.</p>

She was one of three women to testify against Weinstein, who was ultimately found guilty of sexually assaulting only her. Haley said the verdict gives her hope that there is new awareness around sexual violence.</p>

          <p>Despite concerns, President Trump's tariffs have not yet significantly impacted inflation data. Recent reports on consumer and producer prices indicate only slight increases. Three factors are contributing to this: companies stockpiling imported goods before tariff announcements, the time it takes for tariffs to affect the economy, and limited pricing power for companies due to consumer belt-tightening. Economists anticipate that the impact of tariffs will become more apparent in the coming months. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>NASA and Axiom Space have delayed the launch of the Axiom-4 commercial flight to the International Space Station (ISS) due to concerns about a persistent air leak in a Russian compartment.

Cosmonauts have sealed additional areas and measured the leak rate, but NASA is taking extra time to evaluate the situation with Roscosmos.

          <p>There has been an unexpected surge in people claiming Social Security benefits, with claims nearly 18% higher between January and May compared to the same period last year. This increase is attributed to a peak of retiring Baby Boomers, a rule change boosting benefits for some with pensions, and individuals refiling for higher benefits based on their own records. Some also worry about their economic future under the Trump administration, leading them to claim benefits earlier. Experts advise caution, as delaying claiming benefits generally leads to higher monthly payments.</p>

          <p>A survey of retail executives indicates that most expect President Trump to walk back his "reciprocal" tariffs after a 90-day pause. Many believe tariffs on goods from the European Union, Vietnam, India, and Mexico will remain at 10% rather than the steeper rates initially imposed. This optimism stems from progress in U.S.-China trade negotiations and a court ruling challenging Trump's authority to impose the tariffs. Despite the optimism, some caution that the situation could still change and that companies should plan for both scenarios. (not investment advice)</p>
