          <p>Tesla experienced a significant rebound in Australian electric vehicle sales in May, reaching their highest level in nearly a year. The sales were primarily driven by strong demand for the revamped Model Y compact SUV, which saw a 122.5% year-over-year increase. However, despite this success, Tesla's overall sales in Australia remain down 48.2% year-to-date compared to the previous year.

The agreement hinges on the US determining that the UK has complied with relevant aspects of the economic prosperity deal by July 9.
