        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Chinese researchers are leading an effort to map the genetic diversity of Southeast Asian populations, which were previously overlooked in the Human Genome Project. The SEA3K data set, published in Nature, represents a decade-long collaboration with 34 Southeast Asian research teams and includes genome sequencing for over 3,000 individuals from six countries, covering five language families and 30 ethnic languages. The study has revealed unique genetic adaptations to tropical challenges and distinct Denisovan ancestry in these populations, aiming to rectify the historical underrepresentation of mainland Southeast Asia in global genomic databases. This initiative involves extensive fieldwork and community engagement, adhering to local ethical protocols. The optimism score is based on the progress of genetic research and the inclusion of underrepresented populations in scientific advancements.</p>

          <p>The aviation industry is projected to improve in profitability in 2025, despite a forecasted drop in global GDP growth, according to the International Air Transport Association. Revenue, operating profits, and net profits are expected to increase, driven by lower jet fuel costs and greater efficiency. Passenger load factors are anticipated to reach a record high, even as fleet expansion faces challenges due to supply chain issues. Jet fuel costs are expected to decrease, leading to lower overall fuel bills for airlines. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>An essay discusses the increasing internationalization of American higher education, noting that over 1.1 million international students were enrolled in U.S. colleges and universities in the 2023-24 school year. This trend has occurred without much conscious planning or debate, as universities have happily admitted foreign students due to lower rates of financial assistance. The author raises questions about whether the internationalization of the American student body has been a positive development and whether it should continue. The essay contrasts this with the Trump administration's attempts to limit foreign student enrollment.</p>
