          <p>The Italian food giant Ferrero Group has announced its intention to purchase WK Kellogg Co. in a cash deal valued at approximately $3.1 billion. This acquisition will bring iconic cereal brands like Corn Flakes and Froot Loops under the same ownership as Nutella and Rocher chocolates. The deal encompasses Kellogg's U.S., Canadian, and Caribbean cereal operations, aiming to expand Ferrero's presence in North America. Following the transaction, which is expected to close in late 2025, WK Kellogg will be delisted from the New York Stock Exchange. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>The U.S. Department of Defense is set to become the largest shareholder in MP Materials, the country's only operational rare earth miner, through a $400 million investment. This strategic move aims to bolster the domestic supply chain for rare earths, which are crucial for military technology like F-35 jets and drones, reducing reliance on China. The investment will fund the expansion of MP Materials' processing and magnet production, including a new facility fully backed by a 10-year Pentagon purchase agreement. This public-private partnership caused the company's shares to surge significantly upon the announcement. (not investment advice)</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Amazon's cloud division, AWS, has engineered its own specialized cooling equipment, the In-Row Heat Exchanger (IRHX), to manage the intense heat generated by next-generation Nvidia AI processors. This development was necessary because existing commercial solutions were inadequate for the scale of AWS's operations, and building new liquid-cooled data centers would have taken too long. The new hardware allows AWS to efficiently integrate powerful Nvidia GB200 NVL72 systems into its data centers. This move continues Amazon's strategy of creating custom infrastructure to reduce reliance on third parties and improve profitability.</p>

          <p>According to an annual CNBC study, North Carolina has been named the best U.S. state for business for 2025, reclaiming the top spot with its strong economy and skilled workforce. The state has successfully attracted major investments, including a new JetZero factory and Amazon data centers, contributing to robust job and GDP growth. Despite its business-friendly environment, the report notes challenges, including a lower quality-of-life ranking and potential economic headwinds from federal policy changes and hurricane recovery costs. The state's bipartisan focus on business attraction is cited as a key factor in its consistent high rankings. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>Delta Air Lines saw its shares jump after reinstating its 2025 profit forecast, signaling a more stable outlook for the travel industry. CEO Ed Bastian noted that while consumer booking patterns have shifted to be closer to travel dates, demand has stabilized, leading to a stronger-than-expected summer season. The airline now projects full-year adjusted earnings between $5.25 and $6.25 per share, a downward revision from its initial optimistic forecast but still a sign of confidence. The positive report was driven by strong sales of premium seats and its lucrative partnership with American Express. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>Following President Trump's comments on Liberian President Joseph Boakai's "good English," this article explains the deep historical ties between Liberia and the United States. English is Liberia's official language because the nation was founded in 1822 by freed African-American slaves, and its culture retains significant American influence. The country's capital, Monrovia, is named after U.S. President James Monroe, and its flag closely resembles the American flag. This shared history, which includes ten U.S.-born Liberian presidents, provides the context for the linguistic fluency observed by President Trump.</p>

          <p>The UK's National Crime Agency (NCA) has arrested four individuals in connection with the major cyber-attacks that targeted retailers M&S and the Co-op. The suspects, three males and one female aged 17 to 20, were apprehended on suspicion of blackmail, money laundering, and other cybercrime offenses. The attacks, which began in April, caused severe disruption, including data theft and ransomware deployment, costing M&S an estimated £300 million in lost profits. The NCA described the arrests as a "significant step" in their ongoing investigation into the organized crime group responsible.</p>

          <p>Vietnam's government has approved a plan to raise the special consumption tax on alcohol from the current 65% to 90% by the year 2031. This measure is part of a broader government effort to curb what it sees as excessive and harmful drinking habits and to improve public health outcomes. The move comes as the state struggles to enforce a zero-tolerance drink-driving policy and prepares for demographic shifts that will increase healthcare spending. While supported by the World Health Organization, the tax hike has faced opposition from the alcohol industry, which is already experiencing declining sales.</p>

          <p>Nepal is experiencing a significant surge in electric vehicle (EV) adoption, particularly in its capital, Kathmandu, which suffers from severe air pollution. Favorable government policies, including lower taxes on EVs compared to gasoline cars, have driven the shift, with over 70% of new private vehicle imports now being electric. The government has set an ambitious target for 90% of new private vehicle sales to be electric by 2030, aiming to reduce carbon emissions and leverage the country's abundant hydropower. This transition is transforming urban mobility and addressing a major public health crisis caused by vehicle emissions.</p>

          <p>A new book, "Loud and Clear," explores the history of the Grateful Dead's legendary "Wall of Sound," a massive, innovative, and ultimately unsustainable PA system from the early 1970s. Conceived by sound engineer Owsley Stanley, the system aimed to provide perfect, uniform audio for the entire audience by placing a literal wall of speakers behind the band. While it achieved unprecedented clarity for some, the logistical nightmare and immense cost of the elephant-sized rig contributed to the band's eventual hiatus in 1974. The article reflects on this quest for technical perfection, contrasting the Wall's hubris with the modern, controlled audio of venues like the Sphere.</p>

Ministers, including Saudi Arabia's Prince Abdulaziz bin Salman, advocated for a pragmatic approach to the green transition, arguing that hydrocarbons will remain essential for the global economy for decades. OPEC's latest World Oil Outlook projects that oil demand will continue to grow through 2050, requiring an estimated $18.2 trillion in investment. The group also cited low inventories and a stable global economy as justification for recent decisions to increase production. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>As "Dora the Explorer" celebrates its 25th anniversary, her legacy as a pioneering Latina character in children's television continues to resonate. The show, which premiered in 2000, broke new ground by featuring a bilingual, pan-Latina protagonist who empowered young viewers by incorporating Spanish into problem-solving. This occurred despite a political climate often hostile to bilingual education, and it coincided with the "Latin Boom" in pop culture. With a new live-action film and a rebooted animated series, Dora's journey of exploration, curiosity, and cultural pride continues to inspire new generations of children and creators.</p>
