          <h2>Mike Waltz Seen Using Signal App Day Before Being Replaced as National Security Advisor</h2>
          <div class="timestamp">2025-05-01 22:03:12 EDT</div>

          <p>This article details how former White House national security advisor Mike Waltz was photographed using the Signal app at a Cabinet meeting, a messaging app that President Trump had previously discouraged using after a leak controversy. The photo shows Waltz engaged in active conversations with several individuals, including Vice President JD Vance and potentially Secretary of State Marco Rubio. White House spokeswoman Anna Kelly stated that Signal is an approved app for government use, but Waltz's past use of Signal to discuss military strikes had triggered controversy earlier in Trump's second term, making this instance notable. The article provides context regarding the administration's stance on secure communication methods.</p>

          <p>Amazon reported mixed first-quarter results, with overall sales growth slowing to the lowest rate since the pandemic's peak, alongside a profit increase of 64 percent. The company anticipates sales between $159 billion and $164 billion for the current quarter, but operating profits may decrease due to factors including "tariff and trade policies". CEO Andy Jassy noted the company's focus on managing prices amid tariff uncertainty, including purchasing extra inventory and assisting sellers. While online sales grew modestly, Amazon's cloud computing business showed strong growth, driven by artificial intelligence offerings, although capacity constraints at data centers limited potential sales.

          <p>Japan and the United States have agreed to hold ministerial-level tariff discussions around mid-May, aiming to reach a mutually beneficial deal quickly, according to Japan's chief negotiator Ryosei Akazawa. Following meetings with U.S. officials, Akazawa reported deepened discussions on nontariff barriers, expanded bilateral trade, and economic security cooperation. Japan is expected to offer proposals including increased purchases of U.S. corn and soybeans and simplified screening processes for imported cars, while the U.S. seeks tariff reductions and better-paying jobs. The Trump administration has prioritized striking early tariff deals with Japan, India, and South Korea to gain leverage over China in the Indo-Pacific region.</p>

          <p>China has stated that it is evaluating U.S. overtures to initiate trade negotiations, potentially opening the door for talks to resolve the ongoing trade war. Chinese authorities reiterated that the U.S. must remove all unilateral tariffs to demonstrate sincerity and build mutual trust. The U.S. has imposed tariffs of 145% on imported Chinese goods, prompting retaliatory levies from China.

          <p>As President Trump pushes for a second baby boom, more couples are choosing child-free lives, citing economic costs, climate change fears, and career priorities. The U.S. fertility rate has plummeted to record lows, with some young adults saying they simply don't want children. Sociologist Amy Blackstone notes that child-free individuals often value their relationship with their partner and don't want to change it, while parents value the imagined relationship with a child. While some child-free individuals have occasional doubts about the future, they made the decision with careful thought.</p>

          <p>Santa Cruz implemented a "soda tax" on Thursday, adding a 2-cents-per-ounce tax on sweetened beverages, defying a statewide ban signed in 2018. The tax applies to nonalcoholic beverages with added sweeteners and 40 or more calories per 12 fluid ounces. Santa Cruz is the first city to institute such a tax since the statewide ban was enacted. Proponents framed the campaign as a battle against the American Beverage Assn., which opposed the measure. The American Beverage Assn. argues the tax unfairly burdens working families already struggling with high prices.</p>
