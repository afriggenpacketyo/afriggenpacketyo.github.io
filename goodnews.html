          <p>Major US stock indices like the S&P 500 and Nasdaq experienced a volatile week, closing with minor losses despite reaching record highs earlier. Investor focus was on mixed economic signals, including jobs and inflation data, which influenced speculation about future Federal Reserve interest rate cuts. Key corporate news included Nvidia's massive $100 billion investment in OpenAI to develop AI data centers and strong initial sales reports for Apple's new iPhone models. This market activity highlights the ongoing tension between positive corporate developments and broader macroeconomic uncertainty. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>This article reflects on the significant cultural power of teen novels, using Judy Blume's "Forever," which turns 50, as a prime example. It highlights how such books served as a rite of passage, offering young readers, particularly girls, a rare perspective on sexuality and desire from a female vantage point. These novels provide a space for teenagers to see their own anxieties and curiosities reflected, validating feelings that are often difficult to express. The piece explores how the art and literature discovered during adolescence can have a singular, lasting impact on personal development and understanding of the world.</p>

          <p>Belva Davis, the first Black woman to be hired as a television reporter on the U.S. West Coast, has passed away at the age of 92. A trailblazer in an industry dominated by white men in the 1960s, Davis became a trusted and respected figure in Bay Area journalism, known for her integrity and grace. Throughout her long career, she covered pivotal moments from the assassination of Harvey Milk to the AIDS crisis, earning eight regional Emmy Awards.

This asset class, which involves lending to companies by non-bank institutions, has traditionally been accessible only to institutional and high-net-worth investors. The new fund, the Simplify VettaFi Private Credit Strategy ETF (PCR), offers a liquid vehicle for indirect exposure through publicly traded business development companies (BDCs). The creators believe it will appeal to investors seeking income streams, as private credit can offer low to high double-digit yields. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>Lieutenant Colonel George Hardy, one of the last surviving original Tuskegee Airmen, has passed away at the age of 100. As the youngest Red Tail fighter pilot, he flew 21 combat missions over Europe during World War II and also served in the Korean and Vietnam Wars. The Tuskegee Airmen were the first Black military pilots in the U.S. Armed Forces, overcoming significant racial discrimination to serve their country with distinction. Hardy's legacy is remembered as one of courage and resilience, and in his later years, he became a champion for preserving the group's historic contributions.</p>

          <p>Markeiz Ryan, a 36-year-old U.S. Air Force veteran, has relocated to Ho Chi Minh City, Vietnam, where he lives comfortably on approximately $4,000 a month. His income is sourced from VA disability, the GI Bill, and teaching English. Ryan contrasts the high cost and financial pressure of life in America with the calm and safety he feels in Vietnam, where he says he can focus on personal happiness rather than just survival. Despite some challenges like noise pollution, he has no plans to leave, citing a more motivated and human-centric way of living that was unattainable for him in the U.S.</p>

          <p>Activist investor Anson Funds is publicly calling for the sale of Clear Channel Outdoor Holdings (CCO), arguing the timing is right for the company to be acquired. This follows a previous activist campaign by Legion Partners that led CCO to divest its international assets, transforming it into a more focused U.S. pure-play company. Despite these strategic moves, CCO's stock has underperformed its peers, and Anson believes a sale to a strategic buyer like JCDecaux or Lamar, or to a private equity firm, offers the best path forward for shareholders.

          <p>Colorado-based modular homebuilder Fading West is positioning itself as a solution to the U.S. housing affordability crisis by manufacturing homes in a factory setting. The company claims its process can reduce costs by up to 20% and cut construction time in half compared to traditional on-site building. This method allows for year-round production and greater efficiency, addressing labor shortages and weather delays. Recently, the company demonstrated its rapid-response capabilities by producing 82 modular homes in two months for residents displaced by the wildfires in Lahaina, Maui, showcasing a potential model for both disaster relief and affordable housing.</p>

          <p>This article provides advice for interracial couples on navigating the unique challenges and conversations that can arise from their different racial and cultural backgrounds. Experts suggest four key discussions: openly addressing differences, co-creating a new shared family culture, compromising on cultural or spiritual practices, and planning how to support each other against external biases. The guidance emphasizes that being curious, open, and intentional can help couples build a stronger relationship. Rather than ignoring differences, couples are encouraged to blend their backgrounds to create a unique family identity that respects both partners.</p>

          <p>Georg Stefan Troller, a renowned journalist, writer, and documentarian, has died at the age of 103. An Austrian Jew who fled the Nazis, he later returned to Europe as a U.S. soldier and was present at the liberation of the Dachau concentration camp. He became famous for his unconventional and sensitive television interviews with international celebrities like Marlon Brando and Woody Allen for his German TV show "Personenbeschreibung." Troller viewed his journalistic work as a form of "self-healing" after losing 19 relatives in the Holocaust, leaving behind a legacy of insightful and deeply human storytelling.</p>

          <p>This article examines the growing trend of dating apps, including a new venture from Bumble founder Whitney Wolfe Herd, incorporating artificial intelligence to act as a "matchmaker." The goal is to move beyond superficial swiping by using AI to pair users based on deeper values and goals. However, the author questions whether this is truly groundbreaking, pointing to past experiments by sites like OkCupid which found that algorithms struggled to predict real-world chemistry. The piece argues that romantic compatibility is still largely unpredictable, and while AI might refine suggestions, it cannot solve the fundamental mystery of human connection.</p>

          <p>A six-year-old Miami girl named Imani Dell was diagnosed with a medulloblastoma, a fast-growing brain tumor, after her family noticed her eyes were crossed. What started as a minor concern quickly escalated when she began seeing double, leading to an emergency room visit where a CT scan revealed a golf-ball sized mass. Surgeons successfully removed the tumor, and after a difficult year of radiation and chemotherapy, Imani has finished her treatment. Now in second grade, she is recovering well and returning to her normal, cheerful self, bringing immense relief and happiness to her family.</p>

          <div class="timestamp">2025-09-27 08:00:00 EDT</div>
        </div>
        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>This opinion piece reflects on the 1977 legal battle over a neo-Nazi group's right to march in Skokie, Illinois, a suburb with many Holocaust survivors. The author recounts the pain the case caused survivors, while also presenting the ACLU's argument that protecting even offensive and hateful speech is essential for the First Amendment to have meaning. The ACLU lawyer on the case, who was Jewish himself, argued that if speech can be denied because it is offensive, officials gain the power to silence any speech they dislike. The article draws a parallel to current debates, concluding that free speech must apply even when we disagree with the content.</p>
