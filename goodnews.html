          <p>The Northern Irish rap group Kneecap delivered a politically charged performance at the Glastonbury Festival, defying criticism from UK politicians and the ongoing legal troubles of one of its members. Rapper Mo Chara, who faces a terrorism charge, appeared on stage as the band led pro-Palestinian chants and criticized UK Prime Minister Keir Starmer. The trio is known for its anarchic energy and use of Irish republican symbolism, and their set drew a large, supportive crowd waving Palestinian flags. The performance highlighted the ongoing intersection of music, free speech, and contentious political issues at the world-famous festival.</p>

Despite a late surge from Ch√°vez in the final rounds, the judges scored the fight decisively in Paul's favor. After the match, Paul taunted the booing crowd and called out other big names in boxing, continuing his controversial but successful career in the sport and raising questions about a potential future title shot.</p>

          <p>The French government has led a major investment in satellite operator Eutelsat, positioning it as a European strategic asset and a potential competitor to SpaceX's Starlink. This move is part of a broader push for European technological sovereignty in the growing space race. However, industry experts express skepticism about Eutelsat's ability to challenge Starlink's dominance in the near future. They point to significant hurdles, including Starlink's massive lead in satellite constellation size, launch capacity, and manufacturing throughput, suggesting Eutelsat is better positioned for niche sovereign and enterprise markets rather than the mass consumer market.

Once a heavily militarized front line, the island has transformed into a quiet community caught between two powerful political systems. Its current state demonstrates the practical limits of influence for both Beijing, which cannot easily absorb it, and Taipei, which uses it as a symbol of its distinct governance. The island's existence highlights the complex and often contradictory dynamics that define the ongoing geopolitical standoff in the Taiwan Strait, showcasing a blend of historical tension and modern coexistence.</p>

          <p>Following a disappointing single-medal performance at the Paris Olympics, Japan's national swimming team is implementing a new strategy to enhance future results. Athletes are now living together in a "virtual athletes' village" during domestic championships to simulate the conditions of an Olympic Games. The initiative, held at a remote Tokyo Bay venue, aims to build team morale and better prepare swimmers for the challenges of competing in unfamiliar environments. Officials hope this approach will instill a stronger team identity and help athletes perform at their peak under the high-pressure conditions of the upcoming Los Angeles Olympics.</p>
