          <p>Mount Etna, Europe's most active volcano, erupted on the Italian island of Sicily, emitting a massive ash cloud and a "lava fountain." The volcano department noted "explosions of increasing intensity," with the explosive activity from the Southeast Crater evolving into a lava fountain. The eruption has not posed an immediate risk to the local population or air travel, as residents are accustomed to Etna's frequent activity. The volcano has erupted annually for the past several years, often covering nearby towns with volcanic dust, but without causing major disruptions. While this eruption is visually dramatic, it is within the range of Etna's typical behavior.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Maintaining a healthy romantic relationship requires effort, but modern culture often encourages individuals to abandon relationships that demand too much work. Research suggests that couples who invest effort into their relationships are happier in the long run, engaging in activities together and maintaining open communication. However, it's crucial to avoid burnout by recognizing when the effort is disproportionate or detrimental to one's mental and physical health. Understanding personal needs and boundaries, as well as being able to verbalize them, is essential for a balanced partnership, and it's acceptable to end a relationship if those needs are not met.</p>

          <p>Major steel stocks experienced a significant surge after President Donald Trump announced a doubling of tariffs on steel imports to 50%. Cleveland-Cliffs shares jumped roughly 25% in premarket trading, while Steel Dynamics and Nucor each increased by more than 10%. Trump's decision, revealed at a Pennsylvania rally, aims to further secure the steel industry in the United States but has reignited trade tensions and faced criticism from global partners. The VanEck Steel ETF (SLX) also saw an increase of 1.9% following the announcement. (not investment advice)</p>

        </div>
        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>The UK government is set to announce the creation of the UK Airspace Design Service (UKADS) to modernize flight paths, potentially leading to shorter journey times, fewer delays, and more flights for passengers. The planned changes, which could allow planes to climb quicker during take-off and descend more smoothly, represent the largest redesign of UK airspace since the 1950s. While some changes outside London could be seen before 2030, alterations to airspace over London are not expected until the 2030s. Concerns have been raised about the potential for new flight paths over previously unaffected residential areas, and some stakeholders emphasize the need to prioritize environmental impacts and community well-being.</p>

          <p>Indian customs officials at Mumbai airport arrested a passenger arriving from Thailand for attempting to smuggle dozens of venomous vipers, including 44 Indonesian pit vipers, concealed in checked-in baggage. The passenger also possessed three Spider-tailed horned vipers and five Asian leaf turtles. Mumbai Customs has issued photographs of the seized snakes, highlighting the unusual nature of the seizure compared to more common hauls of gold, cash, or drugs. This incident follows several other recent cases of wildlife smuggling through the airport, including gibbons, turtles, and caimans, indicating a trend in illegal wildlife trafficking.</p>

NASA and ESA are collaborating on the Artemis program to establish a permanent base at the moon's South Pole, while China and Russia aim to build a lunar base by 2035. The moon's resources, including iron, silicon, hydrogen, and helium-3, could be used for self-sufficiency in lunar bases and as fuel for spacecraft. Scientific research on the moon will focus on understanding lunar environments, human health in space, and developing technologies for long-term lunar habitation, which could also benefit life on Earth.</p>

          <p>Sri Lankan customs authorities arrested a Thai woman for attempting to smuggle nearly 10 kilograms of cocaine, with an estimated street value of $1.72 million, concealed inside plush toys at Bandaranaike International Airport. This is the largest cocaine seizure ever detected at the airport, following three other hauls this month totaling nearly 60 kilograms of synthetic cannabis. The seizure underscores Sri Lanka's role as a potential transit hub for narcotics destined for other locations, with authorities having previously seized large quantities of heroin off the country's shores. All suspects could face life imprisonment if convicted, reflecting the severity of drug-related offenses in Sri Lanka.</p>

          <p>A restaurant consultant, Salar Sheik, shared dining etiquette tips, emphasizing that "one-timing" a server (making multiple small requests instead of one comprehensive order) is considered rude. Sheik also advises explaining to the server if you are in a hurry and need to order quickly. He suggests making eye contact and waving to get a server's attention rather than snapping fingers. Sheik also notes that customers should be understanding if an order is incorrect, as errors can occur in the kitchen, and should approach the situation calmly. He also suggests being mindful of how long you stay at a table after finishing your meal, placing your first order shortly after being seated, and that servers should provide timely service.</p>

          <p>Opposition to women‚Äôs rights has helped fuel authoritarian movements in various countries, including South Korea, where it has placed women‚Äôs issues at the center of the country‚Äôs presidential election. The rise of anti-feminist sentiment has been attributed to economic challenges, such as housing crises and job shortages, which some blame on women and feminists. This has led to a political landscape where candidates capitalize on men‚Äôs grievances, as seen in the 2022 election, which further fueled the country‚Äôs political crisis. The upcoming election presents an opportunity for a shift away from anti-feminist policies and a focus on addressing the underlying issues that contribute to social division.</p>

        </div>
        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>While self-understanding is often encouraged, the pursuit of perfect self-knowledge is unattainable and can lead to confusion and stagnation. Humans have limitations in their ability to see themselves clearly due to unconscious biases and a limited awareness of their capacity for change. Introspection can be beneficial but also lead to rumination and negative thought spirals, and a belief in a fixed true self can hinder personal growth. Instead of seeking a perfectly accurate story about themselves, people should focus on building a flexible sense of self that allows for surprise and mystery, embracing change and resisting rigid categorization.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>First-time buyers in the UK are increasingly borrowing through mortgages with an average term of 31 years, as the affordability of homes remains a challenge. A decade ago, the average mortgage term for first-time buyers was 28 years, but higher mortgage rates have pushed people to borrow for longer to keep monthly repayments manageable. Many young homeowners are choosing these long mortgage terms to make repayments more manageable, they may opt for shorter terms in the future if their salaries improve or they move house. Lenders tend to allow mortgage terms up to a maximum of 40 years.</p>

          <p>A senior correspondent at Vox argues that Democrats should focus more on policy than messaging, challenging the idea that "abundance liberalism" is less politically resonant than populism. While a recent poll suggests voters prefer a populist message, the author contends that the political case for abundance reforms rests on their material benefits, not their rhetorical appeal. The author highlights the Democratic Party's governance failures, such as housing shortages and infrastructure delays, and argues that abundance reforms can improve the party's reputation for economic management. Ultimately, the author emphasizes that Democrats should prioritize accurate policy analysis over politically appealing messaging to effectively address working people's needs.</p>

Taiwan has never been officially invited to the memorial event but has expressed its wish to join for the first time. Nagasaki plans to send invitations to all countries and regions that have diplomatic missions in Japan or representative offices at the United Nations, but Taiwan does not fall into either category.
