          <p>Following a landmark antitrust ruling that found Google illegally monopolized the search market, the U.S. Department of Justice has proposed forcing the company to sell its Chrome browser. In response, AI startup Perplexity has made an unsolicited offer of $34.5 billion to acquire Chrome, aiming to integrate its AI browser with Chrome's vast user base. The potential sale represents a significant threat to Google's core advertising business, which relies heavily on the data collected through the browser. This development marks a major moment for U.S. antitrust enforcement, echoing historic cases against monopolies like Standard Oil and AT&T. (not investment advice)</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Scientists in Australia have identified a new species of prehistoric whale, named Janjucetus dullardi, that lived 26 million years ago. The discovery was made after a local man found a well-preserved skull fossil on Victoria's Surf Coast, a region known for significant paleontological finds. This dolphin-sized whale, described as "deceptively cute," was a formidable predator with sharp, slicing teeth, belonging to a group of early whales distantly related to modern baleen whales. The finding provides new insights into whale evolution and highlights the unique prehistoric marine life that once inhabited Australian waters.</p>

          <p>McDonald's in Japan has canceled its Happy Meal promotion featuring coveted Pokémon cards after the campaign was overwhelmed by adult resellers. These individuals purchased the meals in bulk solely for the collectible cards and then discarded the food, leading to piles of waste near restaurant locations. The company issued an apology, stating the situation contradicted its philosophy of providing a fun dining experience for families and admitted its preparations were inadequate. To prevent future issues, McDonald's is considering purchase limits and ending online orders for similar promotions, as the incident sparked public frustration over the "Unhappy Meals" campaign.</p>

        </div>
        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>A significant drop in interest rates has triggered a 23% weekly jump in mortgage refinance applications, the strongest showing since last April. Overall mortgage application volume rose by nearly 11%, driven largely by homeowners seeking to lower their monthly payments. The trend also saw a 25% increase in demand for riskier adjustable-rate mortgages (ARMs), as their rates became more attractive compared to fixed-rate loans. Despite the favorable conditions for refinancing, applications for home purchases saw only a minor 1% increase, indicating that high home prices continue to be a barrier for many potential buyers.

          <p>A new book, "A Marriage at Sea," recounts the extraordinary survival story of Maurice and Maralyn Bailey, who were adrift in the Pacific for 117 days in 1973 after a whale sank their sailboat. The couple endured starvation and illness on an inflatable raft, sustaining themselves by catching turtles and rainwater. The narrative explores how their contrasting personalities—Maralyn's optimism and Maurice's negativity—forged a powerful bond that enabled their survival. Their shared ordeal and constant planning for a future sailing trip became a crucial psychological anchor, offering a unique, if extreme, perspective on marital resilience and shared purpose.</p>

          <p>For the first time since the market turmoil caused by Liz Truss's mini-budget in September 2022, the average two-year fixed mortgage rate in the UK has dropped to 4.99%. Financial data firm Moneyfacts described this as a "symbolic turning point," indicating that lenders are competing more aggressively for business. While this offers some relief to homebuyers and the 1.6 million borrowers whose fixed-rate deals expire this year, rates remain significantly higher than pre-2022 levels. The Bank of England's recent actions and inflation forecasts suggest that further substantial drops in mortgage rates are unlikely in the near term. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>London's long-held reputation as a leading global financial center is being questioned as it grapples with persistent economic challenges, including higher inflation than the U.S. and ongoing friction from Brexit. Initial public offerings in the city have fallen to a 30-year low, and business uncertainty remains high, hampering investment. Despite these setbacks, there are signs of potential recovery, such as recent interest rate cuts by the Bank of England and new trade deals. Business leaders emphasize the need for growth-oriented policies to enhance access to capital and attract entrepreneurial talent to secure the city's financial future. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>Following a devastating magnitude 7.7 earthquake in Myanmar in March 2025, scientists are analyzing the event's data to enhance their ability to forecast future seismic events. The quake, which caused thousands of deaths, resulted from a rapid, "supershear" rupture along the Sagaing Fault. Researchers created a computer model incorporating the fault's history, or "memory effect," which suggests that large earthquakes occur there irregularly, with the next major event potentially not due for over a century. While precise earthquake prediction remains impossible, this research aims to improve long-term hazard assessments for disaster planning in seismically active regions.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>This article explores the evolution of soccer design, contrasting the iconic, culturally-infused work for the 1968 Mexico Olympics by Lance Wyman with modern, often generic, club and tournament branding. It suggests that many contemporary designs, including the logo for the 2026 World Cup, prioritize a safe, corporate aesthetic over the bold, clever, and community-representative styles of the past. While designers like Matthew Wolff have created acclaimed crests for clubs like LAFC and NYCFC, the overall trend is seen as moving toward committee-driven, analytics-focused branding that lacks the unique, artistic character that once defined the sport's visual identity.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>A recent analysis by sports betting website Action Network has ranked California as the best state in the U.S. for stargazing, based on factors like sky visibility, elevation, and astronomical infrastructure. While some professional astronomers question the methodology, they agree that California offers excellent opportunities for viewing celestial events due to its large wilderness areas and designated Dark Sky Places. Locations like Anza-Borrego Desert State Park and Joshua Tree National Park provide ideal conditions far from city light pollution. Experts recommend visiting local observatories or joining astronomical societies to best enjoy cosmic events.</p>

          <p>Actress Rashida Jones, who earned an Emmy nomination for her role in the "Black Mirror" episode "Common People," discusses the show's cautionary themes about technology and capitalism. In the episode, her character is saved from a coma via a brain subscription service that devolves into a parable about corporate greed and the U.S. healthcare system. Jones reflects on how the series mirrors our current reality, where convenience often comes at the cost of privacy and agency. To escape the pressures of modern life, she emphasizes the importance of disconnecting from technology and reconnecting with nature, or as she puts it, "you gotta touch grass."</p>
