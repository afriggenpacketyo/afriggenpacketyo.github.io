          <p>President Trump addressed Elon Musk's recent criticism of his proposed tax bill, suggesting Musk is upset over the elimination of electric vehicle credits and the administration's decision regarding the NASA directorship. Trump stated he prefers Musk to criticize him rather than the bill itself, defending the bill as "incredible." Musk had previously condemned the bill as a "disgusting abomination" and recently left his government post overseeing DOGE, the Trump administration's initiative to reduce federal spending. Trump emphasized that Musk was aware of the elimination of EV tax credits from the beginning. Optimism around the bill is high for Trump, though the relationship between Musk and Trump may be strained.</p>

          <p>With gold prices significantly rising since early 2024, investors should consider whether to wait for a price drop, when the price might change again, and what amount is safe to invest at today's elevated price. Waiting for a price drop carries the risk of missing out on gold's portfolio protection benefits, especially given current stock market uncertainty. The price of gold may fluctuate based on upcoming inflation reports and Federal Reserve monetary policy decisions this June. Investors should limit gold investments to a maximum of 10% of their portfolio and consider dollar-cost averaging. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>Unemployed individuals struggling with debt have several options for debt relief, including negotiating settlements directly with creditors, working with a debt relief company, exploring lender hardship programs, and seeking credit counseling. Negotiating a settlement may be possible if creditors believe the individual is truly unable to pay in full. Lender hardship programs can provide temporary relief through lowered interest rates or deferred payments. Credit counseling agencies offer advice on budgeting and debt management, including debt management plans, offering support during financial instability.</p>

          <p>The Supreme Court ruled in favor of a heterosexual woman in a job discrimination suit, rejecting the appeals court's requirement for members of majority groups to meet a heightened standard in employment discrimination cases. The ruling effectively lowers the burden of proof required for people who are members of a majority group to make discrimination claims. The justices voted unanimously, focusing on evidence standards that could make it easier to file similar "reverse discrimination" cases. The court concluded that anti-discrimination and equal protection laws were meant to apply to all Americans.</p>

          <p>Ludwig Wittgenstein's philosophy suggests that language is inherently flawed and inadequate for conveying subtle truths or subjective experiences, leading to misunderstandings that lower well-being. He argued that words are merely crude models of the world, and therefore, we cannot fully comprehend the meaning of our lives through reading or talking about it. To find meaning without words, Wittgenstein recommends meditative contemplation and seeking understanding rather than exact answers. By engaging in silent reflection and disengaging from habitual left-brain dominance, individuals can transcend the limitations of language and gain ineffable rewards.</p>
