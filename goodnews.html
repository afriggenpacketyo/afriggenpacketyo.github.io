          <p>Warren Buffett's Berkshire Hathaway is reportedly on the verge of a significant $10 billion deal to acquire Occidental Petroleum's petrochemical division, OxyChem. This potential transaction, which could finalize within days, would represent Berkshire's largest acquisition in three years, utilizing a portion of its record $344 billion cash reserves. Despite the Wall Street Journal's report, Occidental's shares experienced a slight decline. Buffett has a notable history with Occidental, having previously supported its 2019 Anadarko acquisition and steadily built a substantial 28.2% stake in the oil company since early 2022.

          <p>Members of the Academy of Magical Arts (AMA) have overwhelmingly voted to approve a reorganization plan that transfers control of the Magic Castle's operations and revenue to a company owned by landlord Randy Pitchford. The AMA, a nonprofit, will continue its magic promotion, educational efforts, and awards programs, while retaining its clubhouse use. This decision prevents the need to find a new venue after their lease expires in 2028, but some members expressed concerns about the loss of self-governance. The vote follows a period of significant changes for the iconic Hollywood landmark, including a leadership overhaul and allegations of misconduct.</p>

The couple's romance first sparked rumors in February with public appearances and was later prominently featured in Taylor's music video for her single "Long Time." Taylor, who finalized her divorce from basketball player Iman Shumpert in 2024 and faced a court order to cover his attorney fees, affirmed her focus on her current relationship during a recent interview, playfully sidestepping inquiries about on-screen chemistry with Leonardo DiCaprio.</p>

          <p>Manchester City captain Bernardo Silva has indicated he knows his future intentions once his current contract concludes at the end of the season, but asserts it's "not the right time to talk about it." The 31-year-old midfielder, now in his ninth season with the club, has been the subject of transfer speculation, with reported interest from teams like Juventus and Benfica. Silva, who has achieved significant success including seven Premier League titles and the Champions League, inherited the captaincy from Kevin de Bruyne. Manager Pep Guardiola lauded Silva as an "extraordinary player" and praised his leadership qualities.</p>

          <p>For older homeowners, reverse mortgages offer a way to convert home equity into cash without monthly payments, appealing amidst high home values and inflation. However, this article warns against common pitfalls, emphasizing the importance of understanding true costs, including origination fees, insurance, and ongoing property expenses, which can be substantial. Borrowers must also consider the impact on heirs, who will need to repay the loan or refinance to keep the home.
