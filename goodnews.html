          <p>A small, 3.0 magnitude earthquake occurred in northern New Jersey, causing brief shaking that was felt across parts of the New York City metropolitan area. The U.S. Geological Survey located the epicenter near Hasbrouck Heights, New Jersey. While the event startled residents, with some reporting it felt like a loud boom or an impact against their house, no significant damage or injuries were reported. Officials noted that while earthquakes are uncommon on the East Coast, a quake of this magnitude is not considered a major event and is not expected to cause structural issues, offering reassurance to the public.</p>

          <p>The superhero film “The Fantastic Four: First Steps” remained at the top of the North American box office in its second weekend, earning an estimated $40 million. This figure represents a significant 66% drop from its impressive debut, a steeper decline than other recent Marvel releases. Despite the domestic slowdown, the film performed well internationally, pushing its global total to $369 million. Following in the box office rankings were the debut of the animated comedy “The Bad Guys 2” and the reboot of “The Naked Gun,” which secured the second and third spots, respectively, during a slow start to the month of August.</p>

          <p>A new podcast series from NPR's 'Embedded' program, titled 'Tested,' investigates the complex and often controversial history of sex and gender testing in sports. The series examines how athletic organizations have historically attempted to define and regulate the participation of athletes based on biological markers. It delves into the scientific, ethical, and personal dimensions of these policies, questioning what constitutes fairness in competition. The episodes explore the impact of these regulations on individual athletes and the evolving understanding of gender identity within the context of elite sports, highlighting a contentious and deeply personal issue.</p>

In a post-game interview, she described the injury as the hardest thing she has had to go through and expressed her joy at being back on the field. The win moved the Spirit into second place in the National Women's Soccer League standings as the league resumed play after its summer break.</p>

          <p>Florida has surpassed California in the installation of new utility-scale solar capacity, driven largely by economic factors rather than state-level climate policy. Utilities like Florida Power & Light are leading this expansion because solar has become cheaper than natural gas, and a streamlined permitting process for smaller projects accelerates development. This growth is occurring despite the state government removing climate change from official policy and new federal legislation rolling back some solar tax credits. The success of solar-powered communities like Babcock Ranch, which maintained power during Hurricane Ian, highlights the resilience and appeal of this energy source. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>The Los Angeles Dodgers defeated the Tampa Bay Rays 3-0, relying on solid pitching and timely, small-ball offense rather than power hitting. Yoshinobu Yamamoto delivered 5 ⅔ scoreless innings, and the bullpen completed the shutout. The Dodgers manufactured their runs through aggressive baserunning, a key double-steal, and a sacrifice fly, overcoming a recent team-wide slump at the plate. The victory secured a winning 5-4 record for the team on their nine-game road trip. The game also saw manager Dave Roberts experiment with the batting order, moving Shohei Ohtani back to the leadoff spot to spark the offense.</p>

          <p>A number of former career attorneys from the U.S. Department of Justice are running for public office for the first time, motivated by a desire to counter what they describe as the politicization of the agency under President Trump. These candidates, who have resigned from their posts, are now seeking positions from the U.S. House to local city attorney, openly criticizing recent DOJ decisions and purges within the department. Lacking traditional political backgrounds, they are campaigning on their experience as public servants and their commitment to upholding the rule of law, representing a unique trend of legal professionals moving into electoral politics.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>The UK's Financial Conduct Authority (FCA) is proposing a compensation scheme for consumers who were mis-sold car finance deals with hidden commissions. Following a Supreme Court ruling that deemed exceptionally high commissions unfair, the FCA plans to consult on a payout system that could cost the industry between £9 billion and £18 billion. While the court did not find all hidden commissions unlawful, this new scheme targets cases with excessive charges. The FCA anticipates that eligible customers will likely receive less than £950 per deal, with the first payouts expected next year for agreements dating back to 2007.</p>

The statement followed a report that a temporary placard referencing President Trump's two impeachments had been removed in July. The Smithsonian clarified that the removal was due to the placard not meeting museum standards for presentation and was not requested by any government official. The museum affirmed its responsibility to present complete and accurate histories and will update the exhibit in the coming weeks to properly reflect all such proceedings.</p>
