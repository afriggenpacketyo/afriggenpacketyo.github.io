          <div class="timestamp">2025-07-03 00:17:57 EDT</div>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Upon reaching the historic milestone of 3,000 career strikeouts, Los Angeles Dodgers pitcher Clayton Kershaw has reignited the debate over who is the franchise's greatest pitcher. This article argues that Kershaw's sustained excellence and longevity over 18 seasons give him an edge over the legendary Sandy Koufax, whose peak dominance was brilliant but brief. While acknowledging Koufax's superior postseason record, the piece emphasizes Kershaw's higher totals in wins, strikeouts, and innings pitched as evidence of his enduring impact. The achievement solidifies a legacy built on consistent professionalism and performance, making a powerful case for his place as the team's all-time best.</p>

          <p>The United States government has lifted its export restrictions on chip-design software to China, a move announced by leading semiconductor software firms Synopsys and Cadence. Both companies confirmed they are working to restore access for their Chinese customers in compliance with the updated U.S. export laws. This reversal comes after the U.S. imposed a license requirement on such exports in May. The decision, which prompted a significant rise in the stock prices of the involved firms, signals a potential de-escalation in trade tensions as both nations work toward a truce.

          <p>Armenia is actively working to deepen its relationship with China and elevate bilateral ties to a strategic partnership. During his first official visit to Beijing, Armenian Foreign Minister Ararat Mirzoyan stated there is mutual interest in strengthening relations without limitations. This diplomatic effort is part of Armenia's broader strategy to diversify its foreign policy and reduce its traditional dependence on Russia. The move comes in the wake of the 2020 Nagorno-Karabakh war and Armenia's subsequent decision to withdraw from the Moscow-led Collective Security Treaty Organisation.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>With the U.S. House of Representatives operating with a razor-thin Republican majority, the possibility of a tie vote on major legislation has become a relevant concern. This article explains the chamber's procedure for such an event, noting that unlike the Senate, the House has no tie-breaking mechanism. According to House rules, if a vote is tied, the question or measure being voted on is automatically defeated. This procedural reality underscores the high stakes of party unity on closely contested bills, such as the recent vote on President Trump's domestic spending package.</p>

          <p>Hong Kong's market for initial public offerings (IPOs) is experiencing a dramatic resurgence, with fundraising volumes reaching their highest first-half level since 2021.

This influx of capital has put Hong Kong on track to potentially surpass both the Nasdaq and NYSE as the world's top destination for new listings this year, marking a significant turnaround after several lackluster years.

The judge granted a nationwide injunction against the policy but stayed his decision for 14 days, allowing the administration time to appeal the ruling and prepare for its implementation.</p>

          <p>According to the Pentagon's chief spokesperson, U.S. intelligence assessments suggest that last month's strikes on three key Iranian nuclear facilities have set back the country's program by approximately one to two years. This evaluation indicates a significant degradation of Iran's capabilities, particularly through the destruction of centrifuges at the Fordow enrichment site. The assessment provides a more measured timeframe than President Trump's initial claims of complete obliteration but still points to a substantial delay in Iran's ability to produce enriched uranium.</p>
