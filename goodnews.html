          <h2>Republican Congressman Urges Release of Jeffrey Epstein Files for Transparency</h2>

          <p>Tennessee Representative Tim Burchett is strongly advocating for the Department of Justice to release its evidence files related to the late financier Jeffrey Epstein. While pushing for transparency, Burchett emphasized the need to protect the identities of victims and any innocent individuals who might be named in the documents. He also dismissed former President Trump's recent claims that the files are a "hoax," stating that while he was annoyed by the comments, he remains committed to pursuing the release of the information.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>New research highlighted by author Olga Khazan suggests that personality traits, once thought to be fixed, can be consciously redesigned. Khazan, who documented her own journey of change in her book "Me, But Better," sought to overcome anxiety and neuroticism through deliberate actions like improv classes and journaling. University of Kentucky professor Shannon Sauer-Zavala supports this, explaining that intentionally altering thoughts and behaviors over time can lead to fundamental shifts in personality, offering a new approach to mental health and personal development.</p>

          <p>Jaclyn Johnson, founder of the events company Create & Cultivate, identifies a major red flag in job interviews as a candidate who arrives unprepared and lacks knowledge about the company. She values candidates who have done their research and can offer thoughtful feedback on the business's current operations. Conversely, Johnson is most impressed by applicants who can openly discuss their past mistakes and demonstrate problem-solving skills, particularly how they've handled a crisis. These qualities are especially crucial for a fast-paced, remote-first startup environment where adaptability is key.</p>

          <p>In a recent interview, Carol Moseley Braun, the first African American woman elected to the U.S. Senate, discussed her historic career and offered her perspective on contemporary politics. She recounted facing both racism and sexism in Washington, arguing that sexism is often a more difficult barrier to overcome. Moseley Braun, who served from 1993 to 1999, also commented on the current political climate, expressing concern that the Democratic party appears to be "walking around in a daze" in its efforts to counter Donald Trump.</p>

          <h2>Parenting Expert Emphasizes Teaching Children 'Self-Connection' for Lifelong Success</h2>
          <div class="timestamp">2025-07-20 08:50:36 EDT</div>
        </div>
        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>According to parenting expert Reem Raouda, the most critical skill parents can teach their children is self-connection—the ability to understand and trust their own emotions and needs. Raouda argues that this skill is fundamental to building emotional resilience, healthy boundaries, and authentic confidence. She advises parents to validate their children's feelings rather than dismissing them, creating a safe space for all emotions. This approach helps children develop a strong sense of self-worth, which can protect their mental health and guide them through life's challenges.</p>

          <p>A team of archaeologists believes they have identified the 300-year-old wreck of the 'Nossa Senhora do Cabo,' a Portuguese warship captured by the notorious French pirate Olivier Levasseur, known as La Buse. The ship, seized in 1721, was laden with a treasure of gold, diamonds, and other valuables estimated to be worth over $138 million today. The discovery near the island of Nosy Boraha off Madagascar could be a major breakthrough in solving the mystery of La Buse's legendary lost treasure, which he cryptically alluded to just before his execution.</p>

        </div>
        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>The women's Euro 2025 tournament has seen an unusually low success rate for penalty kicks, currently at just 58.5%, a significant drop from previous competitions. Experts suggest several contributing factors, including the increased pressure on players due to the sport's growing popularity and media spotlight. Additionally, goalkeepers are better prepared than ever, using data analysis to anticipate takers' moves, and have shown improved physical capabilities. While randomness plays a role, the trend points to a combination of heightened psychological stress and more advanced goalkeeping in the women's game.</p>

          <p>Following a court ruling that found it subject to public records laws, the Atlanta Police Foundation (APF) has released nearly 300 pages of documents related to the controversial "Cop City" training center. The records, obtained by a news outlet and a research group, reveal the foundation's active lobbying efforts to prevent a public referendum on the project. This case is seen as a significant precedent, potentially opening the door for greater transparency from the more than 250 private police foundations operating across the U.S., which have often been criticized for lacking public scrutiny.</p>

          <p>GLP-1 drugs, such as those used in Wegovy and Ozempic, are showing potential as a breakthrough treatment for polycystic ovary syndrome (PCOS), a common hormonal disorder in women. Women with PCOS who have used these drugs report significant improvements in symptoms like irregular periods, hair loss, and difficulty losing weight. Researchers believe the drugs help by improving insulin sensitivity, which in turn can lower testosterone levels and regulate hormones. While more research is needed, this offers a new avenue of hope for a condition that has lacked effective, comprehensive treatments.</p>

          <p>A series of powerful earthquakes, the largest a magnitude 7.4, struck in the sea off Russia's Kamchatka Peninsula, initially prompting a tsunami warning. The Pacific Tsunami Warning Center later confirmed that the danger of significant tsunami waves had passed for the region. A separate tsunami watch for Hawaii was also canceled. The quakes, which occurred near the city of Petropavlovsk-Kamchatsky, were followed by numerous aftershocks. Fortunately, there were no immediate reports of casualties or significant damage from the seismic activity.</p>

          <p>Amid recent conservative criticism of Superman being portrayed as an immigrant, comic book author Grant Morrison highlights the character's leftist origins. Created by the sons of Jewish immigrants, the original 1930s Superman was a "socialist figure" and a "Champion of the Oppressed" who fought corrupt bosses and tore down slums. Morrison, whose work influenced the new film, explains that Superman has always been an immigrant and has evolved over the decades to reflect the times, from a patriotic figure in the 1940s to a cosmic seeker in the 1960s.</p>
