PBS CEO Paula Kerger noted the unprecedented nature of the attacks, which include potential rescission of funds and challenges to corporate sponsorships. Both CEOs defended the fairness and non-partisanship of their news coverage, highlighting their commitment to serving the entire public.</p>

          <p>A psychologist identifies the phrase "Why can't you be more like [other person]?" as a highly damaging statement in relationships, often indicating deeper communication issues. This comparison undermines a partner's sense of worth and can lead to insecurity, stemming from a fear of not meeting expectations. The phrase is usually a symptom of a deeper dysfunction: the fear of openly speaking up. The psychologist suggests that open and direct communication of needs, without shame or comparison, is essential for a thriving relationship.</p>

This approach aims to address the housing mismatch, where older people live in large homes with empty bedrooms while others seek smaller, more affordable options.
