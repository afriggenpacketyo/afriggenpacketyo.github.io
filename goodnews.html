          <p>Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy has expressed his willingness to step down from office once the war with Russia concludes, emphasizing that his primary focus remains achieving peace rather than securing another term. During an interview, he affirmed his commitment to pushing for elections in Ukraine even if a ceasefire were to be implemented. Under current martial law, imposed since Russia's full-scale invasion in February 2022, elections cannot be held, meaning Zelenskyy has already served beyond his original five-year mandate. His statements underscore a profound dedication to national resolution and democratic principles over personal political ambition.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Sir Keir Starmer, the Labour Party leader, publicly acknowledged that "some on the Left," including his own party, previously "shied away" from public concerns regarding illegal immigration. Writing in The Telegraph, he stressed the urgent need for Labour to tackle "every aspect of the problem" to effectively counter the increasing popularity of the populist Right. Starmer is expected to announce plans for a compulsory UK-wide digital ID scheme as part of this new approach, attributing the current challenges to "14 years of Conservative government's failure." This strategic shift aims to re-establish Labour's credibility on national security and immigration, appealing to "fair-minded Britons."</p>

          <p>Artificial intelligence is currently in the nascent stages of a "super cycle" that could last between 15 to 20 years, profoundly transforming various aspects of the world, according to Raj Ganguly, co-founder of B Capital. This extended period of persistent growth is anticipated to reshape industries from drug development to the jobs market, driven significantly by generative AI and advanced semiconductors. Ganguly highlights a notable shift towards "deep" tech and foresees the emergence of AI-native applications from global markets like India. While acknowledging a potential "bubble" due to short-term market exuberance, he emphasizes the long-term, transformative global impact of AI. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>China is set to open the world's highest bridge, the Huajiang Grand Canyon Bridge, to traffic this Sunday in the mountainous southwestern province of Guizhou. Rising an astounding 625 meters (2,050 feet) from the river below, its deck height is comparable to mainland China's tallest skyscraper, the Shanghai Tower, and significantly surpasses the previous record holder, the Duge Bridge. The bridge, which spans a total length of 2,890 meters, will also become the longest mountain bridge globally. This monumental engineering achievement, crossing the incredibly deep and narrow gorge known as the "Earth's crack," showcases China's advanced infrastructure capabilities and technological prowess.</p>

        </div>
        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>A federal judge has preliminarily approved a substantial $1.5 billion settlement between artificial intelligence company Anthropic and authors and publishers over the alleged illegal use of nearly half a million pirated books. The agreement will compensate authors and publishers approximately $3,000 for each covered book, though it explicitly does not apply to future works. While the court had previously ruled that AI training itself constitutes transformative fair use, Anthropic was found to have wrongfully acquired materials from pirate websites. This landmark settlement is hailed by authors' guilds as a crucial step, signaling accountability for AI developers and encouraging legal content licensing.</p>

          <h2>California Bill Inspired by Waking Baby Aims to Regulate Streaming Ad Volume Nationwide</h2>

          <p>A California Senate Bill 576, inspired by an 8-month-old baby being woken by excessively loud streaming commercials, aims to regulate ad volume on platforms like Netflix and Prime Video. This legislation seeks to extend the protections of the federal Commercial Advertisement Loudness Mitigation (CALM) Act, currently applicable only to traditional TV broadcasters, to streaming services. Given California's significant market influence, the bill could effectively establish a national standard for ad volume. The Motion Picture Association opposes the bill, citing complexities in controlling ad volumes from diverse sources, but proponents emphasize consumer advocacy and the need for quieter viewing experiences.</p>

          <p>Approximately 200 pieces of coral, illegally smuggled from Indonesia and subsequently seized by the U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service at JFK Airport, have found a new, protected home at the New York Aquarium. The corals, which are protected under endangered species acts and were in poor health after five days in transit, would have perished without intervention from the aquarium. Staff, who describe their facility as a "coral hospital," have diligently nursed many of the specimens back to health, allowing them to be moved to public display. This successful intervention highlights ongoing efforts against illegal wildlife trade and the aquarium's vital role in education and conservation.</p>

          <p>The U.S. Air Force is actively exploring diverse options for its Next Generation Air Refueling System (NGAS), including the innovative concept of converting business jets into tankers, alongside stealthy designs and enhanced conventional models. Business jet tankers could offer significant advantages such as lower operating costs, increased operational flexibility, and the ability to utilize shorter runways, though with a reduced fuel offload capacity. This approach could effectively support more routine operations, thereby freeing up larger tankers for demanding, high-threat missions. The Air Force is currently refining cost estimates for signature-managed platforms, acknowledging the critical need for tankers to survive in increasingly contested future environments.</p>

          <p>Yang Weimin, a former senior official, has strongly urged China to prioritize boosting household income over the next five years, emphasizing its crucial role in driving future economic growth through increased consumption. Ahead of the Communist Party's Central Committee meeting to discuss the country's next five-year plan, Yang highlighted that current weak consumer demand fundamentally stems from income disparities and insufficient purchasing power. The forthcoming economic blueprint is expected to focus significantly on income and GDP growth, industrial upgrading, and technological innovation. This recommendation underscores a strategic shift towards strengthening domestic consumption as a core pillar of national economic development.</p>

          <p>British energy major BP has seen its shares climb over 32% since early April, outperforming many rivals and stepping out of the intense takeover speculation it faced earlier in the year. This improved market sentiment is attributed to a comprehensive strategic reset, a significant leadership shake-up, tangible progress on its cost-cutting program, and recent promising oil discoveries. Equity analysts highlight the selection of a new chair with a proven track record in successful turnarounds as a significant catalyst. The company's stronger second-quarter results and optimism about new oil and gas discoveries, particularly in Brazil, indicate a renewed focus on growth and a more stable outlook for the oil giant.
