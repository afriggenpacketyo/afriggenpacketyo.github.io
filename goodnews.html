          <p>Son Heung-min, the captain of Tottenham Hotspur, has announced he will be leaving the club this summer after a decade of service. The 33-year-old South Korean forward, who is reportedly in advanced talks with Los Angeles FC, described the move as the most difficult decision of his career. Son scored 173 goals for Spurs and recently captained the team to its first trophy in 17 years. His final appearance for the club could take place in his home country of South Korea during a pre-season friendly against Newcastle.</p>

          <p>Two major Chinese state-owned companies, SinoHydro Group and Citic, have signed deals to invest a combined $350 million in Angola's agricultural sector. The investment aims to develop tens of thousands of hectares for grain, soybean, and corn production, part of a broader strategy to enhance China's food security. Under the agreements, SinoHydro will receive a 25-year tax-free land concession, with about 60% of its output designated for direct shipment to China. This move deepens the economic ties between the two nations while addressing China's domestic food supply needs. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>As England's women's rugby team, the Red Roses, prepares to face Spain in a warm-up match, the primary focus is on internal competition for spots on the World Cup squad. Head coach John Mitchell is using the game to assess players on the fringe of the main roster, creating key matchups in positions across the field. With the domestic season condensed to maximize national team preparation, this match is a crucial opportunity for players to prove their worth. The game serves as a final tune-up before the World Cup opener against the United States later in the month.</p>

In a podcast interview, she explained that while she is Nigerian by ancestry, her identity is now British, as most of her life has been spent in the UK. Badenoch, who was born in the UK, mentioned that her early experiences in Nigeria's difficult political and economic climate shaped her conservative political views. Her comments follow previous criticism from Nigeria's vice-president over her remarks about the country.</p>

          <p>Cambodia's government has announced its intention to nominate U.S. President Donald Trump for the Nobel Peace Prize. The nomination is in recognition of his role in helping to broker a ceasefire agreement between Cambodia and Thailand, ending a recent deadly border conflict. Cambodia's Deputy Prime Minister, Sun Chanthol, thanked President Trump for his efforts in bringing peace to the region. The ceasefire was reached after Trump urged the leaders of both nations to end the fighting, which had displaced over 300,000 people and resulted in dozens of casualties.</p>

          <h2>Chinese-Led Study Traces Potato's Origin to Ancient Hybridization with Tomato Ancestor</h2>

          <p>A new study led by Chinese scientists has revealed an ancient genetic link between potatoes and tomatoes, uncovering the potato's evolutionary origins. By analyzing the genomes of various potato species, researchers found that the modern potato emerged from a hybridization event approximately nine million years ago. This event involved a forerunner of the tomato and a tuberless, potato-like plant. The findings, published in the journal Cell, suggest that this ancient cross-breeding was the key evolutionary step that led to the development of the tuber, the edible part of the potato.</p>

          <p>The 9th U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals has upheld a lower court's order temporarily blocking federal agents from conducting "roving patrols" to detain suspected undocumented immigrants in Southern California without reasonable suspicion. The ruling is a setback for the Trump administration's aggressive deportation strategy, with the court affirming that factors like race, language, or location alone are insufficient grounds for a stop. The decision was celebrated by civil rights groups and Los Angeles Mayor Karen Bass, who expressed hope that it would reduce the fear paralyzing immigrant communities in the region.</p>

          <p>In response to widespread user fatigue with online dating, new apps are emerging with innovative formats designed to get people offline and on dates faster. This article explores this trend, focusing on an app called Breeze, which eliminates pre-date messaging and instead books a date at a partner venue once a match is made. This approach aims to reduce the time spent on fruitless online chats and avoid behaviors like 'ghosting'. While the major apps like Tinder and Hinge are adding new features, these alternative platforms reflect a growing desire for more direct and authentic connections.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>China's customs authority has tightened import rules for durians from Vietnam after detecting hazardous levels of the metal cadmium and the compound alkaline yellow in previous shipments. The new regulations mandate enhanced pre-export safety checks and require that all shipments be accompanied by qualified test reports. Under the stricter protocol, all incoming Vietnamese durians are subject to "batch by batch" testing, with non-compliant fruit being returned or destroyed. The move has already led to a significant year-on-year decrease in the value of fresh durian shipments from Vietnam to China. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>HBO has announced that 'And Just Like That...', the reboot of the popular series 'Sex and the City', will end after its upcoming third season. Showrunner Michael Patrick King stated that it felt like a natural stopping point for the story of Carrie, Charlotte, and Miranda in their 50s. The show has faced progressively declining viewership and criticism for its attempts to diversify the original cast and for perceived plot holes. Star Sarah Jessica Parker reflected on the 27 years she has played Carrie Bradshaw, calling the experience a joy and an adventure.</p>

          <p>A mechanical failure on a truck caused a massive spill of hot dogs across a major highway in Shrewsbury, Pennsylvania, leading to significant traffic delays during the morning commute. The truck's trailer was ripped open after scraping against a concrete divider, scattering its entire cargo of sausages onto the road. Cleanup crews, including the local fire company, were dispatched to the scene to manage the unusual and slippery mess. A front-end loader was used to scoop the thousands of discarded wieners into a dump truck for disposal.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Researchers have identified a link between the sun's magnetic cycle and a decadal pattern of summer rainfall in China, which has resulted in increased flooding in the north and drought in the south. The study, published in the Journal of Climate, suggests that changes in solar activity influence the positioning of the monsoon rain belt over the country. This finding could be crucial for improving long-term climate predictions and flood season forecasts in China. Understanding this solar-driven precipitation regime helps explain the significant shifts in weather patterns observed over decades.</p>

          <p>Lifeguards in Seal Beach, California, are warning beachgoers about a seasonal increase in stingray injuries, with daily incidents jumping from an average of one to as many as 15. The rise is attributed to calm, warm waters drawing stingrays closer to shore, particularly in an area known locally as "ray bay." Experts advise people to shuffle their feet in the sand when entering the water to alert the camouflaged fish and give them a chance to swim away. If a sting does occur, the recommended treatment is to soak the affected area in hot water.</p>
