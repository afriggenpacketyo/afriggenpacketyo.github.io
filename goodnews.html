Experiencing fatigue, moodiness, and anxiety after her daughter's birth, she discovered low testosterone levels through bloodwork. HRT has helped her regain energy and balance. Experts note that testosterone is important for women's mood, energy, and bone health, but research is limited. Although there are currently no Health Canada approved testosterone medications for women in Canada and no federally approved testosterone drugs for women in the U.S., Jacobson said healthcare providers can repurpose and prescribe testosterone medications that are approved for men at much lower doses.</p>

The vessel is actually designed to launch up to 13,000 lbs., but because this was a test flight, it wasn't filled to its maximum capacity.
