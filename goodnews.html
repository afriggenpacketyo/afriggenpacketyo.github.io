          <p>India's central bank exceeded market expectations by cutting its benchmark policy rate by 50 points to 5.5%, the lowest since August 2022. This marks the third consecutive rate cut since February, driven by softened inflation and concerns over economic growth amid global challenges. Reserve Bank of India (RBI) Governor Sanjay Malhotra stated that while GDP growth in the fiscal fourth quarter was better than expected at 7.4%, the full-year GDP estimate remains at 6.5%, a slowdown from the previous year. The RBI also shifted its monetary policy stance from "accommodative" to "neutral," indicating limited room for further rate cuts. (not investment advice) </p>

          <p>The government has banned six water companies from awarding bonuses to senior executives due to failure to meet environmental and consumer standards. The new measures, under the beefed-up Water Act, apply to firms that are not financially resilient or have been convicted of criminal offenses. Environment Secretary Steve Reed stated that the public is outraged by bonuses paid to water firm bosses despite sewage spills and rising bills. The ban is backdated to April 2024, allowing the regulator Ofwat to claw back bonuses or take enforcement action, aiming to rebuild trust with customers. </p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Overcapacity in China's manufacturing sector is causing producer prices to remain deflationary, leading to a surge of cheap exports into global markets. While steep tariffs deter Chinese exports to the U.S., other economies, particularly in Asia, are concerned about being overwhelmed by these low-cost goods, potentially squeezing local industries. However, economists suggest that this influx could ease inflationary pressures for inflation-worn economies, offering some relief to central banks. For markets with limited manufacturing bases, like Australia, these cheap imports may alleviate the cost-of-living crisis. (not investment advice) </p>

          <p>North Korea has successfully refloated a new destroyer that capsized during its launch last month, according to state media. The damaged vessel will be moved to a dry dock in a different shipyard for repairs, meeting leader Kim Jong Un's goal to repair the ship before the late-June plenary session. Analysts were surprised by the quick action, which involved using aerostatic balloons attached to the ship's hull. The vessel's internal machinery and electronics will be purged of seawater and dried salt during the repair process, with analysts saying the effort could lead to sea trials sooner than expected. </p>
