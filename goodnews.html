          <div class="timestamp">2025-05-20 14:42:10 EDT</div>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Tesla CEO Elon Musk has announced that the company will launch its robotaxi service in Austin, Texas, by the end of June, with plans to expand to Los Angeles and San Francisco. The service will start with approximately 10 Model Y vehicles equipped with FSD Unsupervised, and will rapidly scale to thousands if the initial launch is successful. These robotaxis will be geofenced initially, meaning their operation will be limited to specific areas in Austin, but there will be no human safety driver in the vehicles. Tesla employees will remotely monitor the fleet, gradually reducing the level of oversight as confidence grows.</p>

          <p>Maryland lawmakers have introduced a bill to posthumously award Henrietta Lacks a Congressional Gold Medal for her contributions to medical research through her HeLa cells, which were taken without her consent. The Henrietta Lacks Congressional Gold Medal Act, introduced by Maryland Rep. Kweisi Mfume and Sen. Chris Van Hollen, would honor Lacks for her contribution to life-saving research, even though her cell samples were taken without her consent. Research involving HeLa cells has led to treatments for polio, HIV/AIDS, leukemia, and Parkinson's disease. The Lacks family has sued several pharmaceutical companies over using HeLa cells without consent.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Millions of consumers in England, Wales, and Northern Ireland could receive up to ¬£70 each following a court ruling that historic fees administered by Mastercard were unfair. The legal case, initiated by a former financial ombudsman, argued that shoppers were charged higher prices due to wrongly levied fees on transactions between 1992 and 2008. Consumers are eligible if they lived in the specified regions for at least three months between June 1997 and June 2008 and purchased goods or services from UK businesses accepting Mastercard. The settlement is for ¬£200m, with ¬£100m ringfenced for consumers who have until the end of the year to claim.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>The Senate has voted to advance the GENIUS Act, a bill aimed at regulating some cryptocurrencies, particularly stablecoins. The measure establishes rules for stablecoin issuers, including a mandate to hold a reserve of assets underlying the cryptocurrency, and requires issuers to grant coin holders priority for repayment in bankruptcy. Supporters hail the bill as a means of protecting consumers and setting industry standards, while critics argue that it fails to address conflict-of-interest concerns and risks endangering consumers with weak regulations. Senator Elizabeth Warren stated that the bill is industry-friendly and inadequate for consumer protection.</p>

          <p>Investing in gold can be done safely by limiting your investment to a maximum of 10% of your overall portfolio, steering clear of riskier investment types, and monitoring the economic climate. While gold has seen a substantial price increase, it is primarily an income protector rather than an income producer. Less experienced investors should avoid gold mining stocks and consider gold bars, coins, or gold IRAs. Monitoring the economic climate will help investors determine potential selling opportunities.

The EU said it wants to help the Syrian people rebuild a new, inclusive and peaceful Syria. The EU dismissed suggestions its decision was a response to US policy.</p>

The company is also introducing more personalized and automated email replies and a shopping tool to automatically purchase clothing after it‚Äôs put on sale. With A.I.

          <p>A new study has identified molecules in blood and urine that may reveal how much energy a person consumes from ultraprocessed foods. Researchers examined data from over 1,000 older U.S. adults and found that hundreds of metabolites corresponded to the percentage of energy a person consumes from ultraprocessed foods. They devised a score of 28 blood markers and up to 33 urine markers that reliably predicted ultraprocessed food intake in people consuming typical diets. The tool could help untangle the biological pathways and harms of ultraprocessed foods.</p>
