        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>US art collector Thomas Kaplan, owner of the Leiden Collection, plans to sell virtual shares in his 17th-century Dutch art, including Rembrandts, to democratize art ownership. This fractional ownership model, facilitated by blockchain, allows individuals with modest budgets to "own" a piece of art without possessing the physical work. While Kaplan intends to retain a majority stake to ensure museum loans, art market experts like Dirk Boll remain skeptical about its revolutionary impact, citing complexities and high costs associated with art as an asset class. The initiative also serves as a practical solution for managing the collection's future inheritance. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>This article explores six surprising and innovative applications where solar power is rapidly expanding beyond traditional rooftop installations. These advancements include integrating solar modules directly into roads, parking lots, and noise barriers, alongside their use on buses and electric car bodies. Switzerland is pioneering solar energy generation on railway tracks, while building facades are adopting less noticeable solar glass. Furthermore, agricultural fields are yielding "double harvests" with solar panels positioned above crops, and large-scale floating solar parks are being developed on various bodies of water. The article also briefly touches upon the long-term potential of beaming solar energy from space, illustrating the diverse future of renewable energy.</p>

          <p>Dutch semiconductor equipment leader ASML is actively addressing investor anxieties about its 2026 growth, even as it forecasts a "significant" drop in sales within the Chinese market. The company has committed to ensuring its 2026 total net sales will not dip below 2025 figures, promising further outlook details in January. ASML is maintaining its projection for a 15% annual sales increase this year, buoyed by the burgeoning AI sector and robust orders. Nevertheless, the tightening US chip export restrictions on China and potential tariffs under the Trump administration pose ongoing challenges to its operations. (not investment advice)</p>

          <h2>UK Competition Watchdog Recommends Mandatory Price Publication for Vets</h2>

          <p>The UK's competition watchdog is recommending that veterinary practices be required to publish comprehensive price lists, enabling pet owners to easily compare costs before committing to treatments. This proposal stems from an investigation that found vet prices have increased at almost twice the rate of inflation, often leaving owners unaware of the full financial implications of care. The Competition and Markets Authority (CMA) also suggests measures like mandating disclosure of corporate ownership, capping prescription fees, and prohibiting bonuses tied to specific treatments. This article underscores a push for greater transparency and affordability within the veterinary industry, aiming to better protect consumers.</p>

          <p>The US government has indicted Cambodian tycoon Chen Zhu, chairman of Prince Holding Group, on charges of wire fraud and money laundering, concurrently seizing approximately $15 billion in Bitcoin. Prosecutors allege that Chen, along with unnamed co-conspirators, operated "pig butchering" scams from Cambodian cyber scam centers, exploiting forced labor to defraud global investors of billions. The Justice Department has characterized this as the "largest forfeiture action" in its history, identifying Prince Holding Group as a front for a major transnational criminal organization. This coordinated action with British authorities, including sanctions, marks a significant effort against human trafficking and cyber-enabled financial fraud. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>Stephen Graham, the acclaimed star and creator of Netflix's successful series "Adolescence," is embarking on a new project: a book titled "Letters to Our Sons." This initiative invites fathers from around the world to contribute letters sharing their experiences in raising boys and exploring the evolving meaning of manhood. Graham envisions the book as a continuation of the dialogue initiated by his series on toxic masculinity and the influence of modern technology, aiming to bridge communication gaps between fathers and sons. Submissions are open for a few months, and a portion of the proceeds will benefit charities supporting young men's mental health.</p>

          <p>An Oklahoma high school girls' basketball team, the Academy of Classical Christian Studies, exhibited exceptional sportsmanship by voluntarily returning a championship trophy after a scoreboard error mistakenly declared them winners. Coach Brendan King, upon reviewing game footage, discovered his team had been incorrectly awarded an extra point, meaning they had lost the decisive game. Despite official rules dictating that game scores are final, the team collectively decided to appeal their own victory, leading to its reversal. The championship plaque was subsequently delivered to Apache High, whose coach lauded the act of honesty and integrity as a profound lesson beyond the game's outcome.</p>

          <p>Alphabet's Waymo is poised to introduce its driverless robotaxi service in London, signifying its inaugural European expansion and its second international city after Tokyo. The company plans to commence test drives with human safety specialists in the coming months, with a target of launching commercial operations next year, contingent on regulatory approvals. London's ambitious "Vision Zero" initiative to eradicate transport-related injuries by 2041 complements Waymo's safety assertions, which claim a substantially lower rate of injury-causing collisions compared to human-driven vehicles. This strategic expansion, utilizing Jaguar iPACE electric vehicles and a partnership with Moove for fleet management, places Waymo among autonomous vehicle ventures entering the UK market.</p>

          <p>A crucial debate is unfolding among scientists and conservationists regarding the release of genetically modified wildlife into natural environments to aid conservation efforts. While gene-editing tools are being developed to create species more resilient to climate change and diseases, a coalition of environmental groups is advocating for a moratorium at the International Union for the Conservation of Nature (IUCN). They cite concerns over the unproven nature of the science, potential unforeseen ecological consequences, and the difficulty of mitigating negative impacts once released. In contrast, many scientists argue that synthetic biology represents an essential tool in confronting the escalating biodiversity and climate crises.</p>
