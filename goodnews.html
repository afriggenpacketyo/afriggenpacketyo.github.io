          <h2>China Potentially Conducted Marine Survey Near Senkaku Islands</h2>

          <p>A Chinese research vessel was observed lowering a pipe-like object into the sea within Japan's exclusive economic zone near the Senkaku Islands. The Japan Coast Guard radioed the vessel, urging it to cease its activities, suspecting it was conducting oceanographic research without prior consent. This incident follows a similar occurrence in October 2023, where a Chinese research vessel was detected performing suspicious maneuvers in the same area. Japan has protested against China's intensifying military activities and maritime assertiveness in the East and South China Seas, particularly intrusions by Chinese vessels into Japanese waters near the Senkakus. The Senkaku Islands are controlled by Tokyo but claimed by Beijing.</p>

          <p>United CEO Scott Kirby addressed concerns about air travel safety following recent radar outages at Newark International Airport, assuring the public that the system is safe due to backup procedures and pilot training. Kirby explained that United has proactively reduced flights out of the schedule in coordination with the FAA to manage capacity and maintain safety margins, especially with runway construction underway. While acknowledging a potential financial impact on United, Kirby emphasized that safety and customer service remain the top priorities. He also noted that while there was a dip in demand beginning in February, the consumer is still cautious but in pretty good shape.</p>

          <p>Democrats are beginning the process of deciding which state will go first in the 2028 presidential nominating calendar. This decision follows President Joe Biden's move to prioritize South Carolina in 2024, leading to debate among traditionally early-voting states like Iowa, New Hampshire, and Nevada, all vying for the lead-off position. The Democratic National Committee (DNC) will ultimately solidify the order, making it a crucial choice for the party as it grapples with its direction after recent electoral losses. Potential 2028 candidates are already visiting these early states, signaling the start of the next campaign cycle.</p>

          <p>Li-Young Lee's poem ‚ÄòInfant Longing‚Äô delves into profound themes of love, loss, and the cyclical nature of the world, marked by both beginnings and endings, slaughter and innocence. The speaker addresses a loved one, intertwining physical intimacy with existential questioning, and reflects on the memory of his mother, who embodies both the world's end and its new beginning. The poem juxtaposes the intimate act of kissing with the immense longing that transcends time and space, and explores the union of opposites and the search for meaning in a world filled with suffering. It culminates in the recognition of an infinite longing that connects individuals to something beyond earthly existence.</p>

          <h2>More Parents Consider Raising Children With Friends to Combat Isolation and Lack of Support</h2>
          <div class="timestamp">2025-05-11 08:00:00 EDT</div>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Faced with the challenges of parenthood and a lack of structural support in the US, more parents are exploring alternative family structures built around friendships. These arrangements involve families living near each other, sharing child care responsibilities, and creating a supportive community for both children and adults. While such setups require coordination, compromise, and a willingness to cede some control, they offer a solution to the isolation often experienced by modern parents. The article explores various models of co-parenting with friends, from co-housing communities to adjacent townhouses, and highlights the benefits and challenges of this emerging trend.</p>

          <h2>British Plane Parts to Be Exempted from US Tariffs in Trade Deal</h2>

          <p>British plane parts are expected to be exempted from US import tariffs as part of the ongoing trade agreement with the Trump administration. This would include engines from Rolls-Royce and similar components, providing certainty to the UK's ¬£40bn aerospace sector. The deal is also important for the US, as Boeing imports Rolls-Royce engines for its commercial airliners. The agreement follows relief for the car and steel industries, with car tariffs expected to decrease and steel tariffs potentially eliminated. There are hopes to increase the quota on British-made cars beyond the initially agreed 100,000.</p>

          <h2>Sibling Relationships and Genetic Determinants Shape Family Dynamics, Says New York Times</h2>

        </div>
        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>A new study featured in the New York Times Magazine explores how siblings mold each other's personalities, often as much as or more than parents do. The research suggests that sibling influence, known as the ‚Äúsibling spillover effect,‚Äù is particularly strong in disadvantaged families. The article also challenges the validity of birth-order psychology, noting that many qualities attributed to birth order do not hold up in well-conducted studies. Genetic influences also play a role, with genetic inclinations eliciting responses from the world that shape personalities and outcomes, but parenting choices may have less impact than most parents think.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Prime Minister Shigeru Ishiba has expressed caution regarding a consumption tax cut as a measure to combat inflation, citing concerns about the significant reduction in state revenue that such a move would cause. Senior officials within his administration and the ruling Liberal Democratic Party have generally dismissed the idea of reducing the consumption tax, which currently stands at 8 percent for food and beverages and 10 percent for other items. The coalition government is currently working to assemble an economic package in anticipation of the House of Councillors election this summer.</p>

          <h2>Science-Based Tips to Reverse Declining US Life Expectancy</h2>
          <div class="timestamp">2025-05-11 07:00:00 EDT</div>
        </div>
        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>After decades of progress, US life expectancy has declined in recent years, but scientific advances offer hope for reversing this trend. Key strategies include knowing and lowering biological age through blood tests, adopting a Mediterranean diet rich in whole grains and vegetables, prioritizing deep and consistent sleep, engaging in both aerobic and strength training, and fostering social connections. Experts emphasize that these steps, while not requiring advanced technology, can significantly improve health and longevity. These interventions focus on lifestyle changes rather than relying solely on pharmaceutical solutions.</p>
