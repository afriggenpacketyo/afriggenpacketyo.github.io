          <p>Alma Cocina Latina, a restaurant in Baltimore, is introducing diners to the unique and aromatic flavors of Venezuelan cuisine through a concept its founder calls "culinary diplomacy." The key to its distinct taste lies in specific Venezuelan peppers, such as ají dulce, which are difficult to source in the U.S. and are now being locally grown by a Maryland farmer. Founder Irena Stein and her chefs aim to provide an authentic cultural experience, with the fragrant peppers forming the essential base for their dishes and creating a memorable culinary journey for their customers.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>After a period of significant electoral losses and leadership turmoil, the Scottish National Party (SNP) is demonstrating renewed political stability and competitiveness. Under the leadership of John Swinney, the party's support has steadied, while backing for rivals like Labour has fragmented. Recent polling suggests the SNP could be close to winning a majority in the Scottish Parliament, a key goal for their argument to hold another independence referendum. This resurgence highlights the unpredictable nature of UK politics and the deep-rooted split on the constitutional question within Scotland.</p>

          <div class="timestamp">2025-10-13 18:02:37 EDT</div>
        </div>
        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>California has enacted a new law to ease the burden on wildfire victims who have lost their homes, allowing them to receive up to $350,000 for personal property without an itemized list. Previously, survivors faced the daunting task of cataloging every lost possession to claim their full coverage. The legislation, signed by Governor Gavin Newsom, aims to streamline the insurance process and provide faster financial support to those recovering from catastrophic fires. The law also extends the time victims have to file detailed claims, addressing a major hurdle in post-disaster recovery.</p>

          <p>As Beijing formulates its 15th five-year plan, there is a growing focus on enhancing industrial collaboration with Taiwanese companies, particularly in high-tech sectors like electric vehicles. A recent delegation of Taiwanese executives, including representatives from major firms like Delta Electronics, visited mainland China to explore partnership opportunities. This trend reflects an evolution in cross-strait economic relations, moving beyond traditional manufacturing to specialized component supply for leading mainland industries. The new plan is expected to further shape these complex economic and political dynamics.</p>

          <p>England manager Thomas Tuchel has praised the high potential of forward Marcus Rashford but issued a warning that he must consistently perform to avoid future career regrets. Rashford, currently on a successful season-long loan at Barcelona from Manchester United, has shown flashes of brilliance but has struggled with consistency in the past. Tuchel emphasized that while Rashford has the talent to be among the world's best, he needs to translate that potential into regular high-level performances for both his club and the national team.</p>

          <p>Germany's national football team took a significant step toward World Cup qualification with a hard-fought 1-0 victory over Northern Ireland in a tense match in Belfast. The decisive goal was scored by Nick Woltemade, marking his first for the national team. A key factor in Germany's recent success has been their improved performance on set-pieces, which accounted for five of their eight goals in the qualifying campaign so far.

          <p>Amazon is planning to hire 250,000 seasonal workers for the upcoming holiday shopping season to manage the expected increase in customer orders. This marks the third consecutive year the e-commerce giant has aimed for such a large number of temporary hires, offering an average pay of over $19 per hour for these roles. The move comes as the overall forecast for seasonal retail jobs is expected to decline to its lowest level since 2009, according to industry analysts, due to economic pressures and increased automation.</p>

          <p>A significant step toward peace in Gaza has been achieved with a major exchange of Israeli hostages for Palestinian prisoners and detainees. The US-brokered deal, part of a broader ceasefire plan, saw emotional reunions as Hamas returned all living Israeli hostages. In return, Israel released almost 2,000 Palestinians from its jails, who were greeted with celebrations in Gaza and the West Bank. U.S. President Donald Trump hailed the event as a "historic dawn" during a summit in Egypt with regional leaders.</p>

          <p>U.S. stocks recovered on Monday, with the S&P 500 and Dow Jones Industrial Average posting significant gains after a sharp plunge on Friday. The market rally was fueled by President Trump's more conciliatory tone regarding trade tensions with China, which eased investor fears of an escalating tariff war. On Friday, markets had dropped sharply after the president announced a new 100% tariff on Chinese imports. However, his weekend comments suggesting that "all will be fine" helped restore confidence ahead of the upcoming corporate earnings season. (not investment advice)</p>
