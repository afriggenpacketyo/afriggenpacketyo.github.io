          <p>Chinese tourists are driving a surge in inbound travel to Japan, exceeding pre-pandemic levels, though their travel habits are evolving. The Japan National Tourism Organization reports that travelers now seek immersive experiences related to Japanese cuisine, culture, and scenery, rather than large group tours and shopping sprees. The JNTO is working to target this market by opening an account on a popular Chinese social media platform. There was a slight decline in visitors from Hong Kong due to a Japanese manga predicting a major disaster in Japan this July, but April saw a strong rebound.</p>

The move addresses a shortage of drivers and improves safety in dangerous driving conditions. Yimin is among the first to develop "intelligent coal mines" as part of China's push to digitally transform its coal industry. The initiative stems from guidance issued in 2020 by central government agencies, which outlined the construction of intelligent mines and identified autonomous driving as a strategic goal.</p>

He also mentioned a $14bn investment in the area's steel production through a partnership between US Steel and Japan's Nippon Steel, though he had yet to see or approve the final deal.

          <p>BBC Three's new drama, What It Feels Like For A Girl, is a coming-of-age story about a gender-questioning teenager growing up in a working-class town near Nottingham, based on the autobiography of Paris Lees. The series explores the challenges faced by Byron, a 15-year-old trying to find his identity and escape the small-mindedness of his home town. The drama also doesn't shy away from a serious crime committed by Liam and Byron, which led to serious consequences for Lees in real life as a teenager. The series highlights the intersectionality of being trans and working class, and the survivalist mechanisms that exist for those people.</p>
