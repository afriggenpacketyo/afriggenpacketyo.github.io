          <div class="timestamp">2025-07-09 17:22:21 EDT</div>
        </div>
        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>The U.S. Supreme Court has declined to lift a lower court's injunction against a controversial Florida immigration law. The law, signed by Governor Ron DeSantis, would have made it a state felony for undocumented immigrants to enter Florida. A federal judge had previously blocked the law, ruling that it unconstitutionally infringes upon the federal government's exclusive authority over immigration policy. Civil rights groups praised the decision, reaffirming the principle that states cannot create their own immigration enforcement systems.</p>

          <p>India's women's cricket team claimed a historic T20 series win against England with a decisive six-wicket victory at Old Trafford, securing the series with one game still to play. After restricting England to a modest score of 126-7, India's batters chased down the target comfortably in the 17th over. The victory marks India's first-ever women's T20 series win on English soil. England struggled against India's spin bowlers, a key factor they will need to address before the upcoming one-day international series.</p>

          <p>Los Angeles Rams wide receiver Davante Adams expressed his belief that basketball superstar LeBron James would have been one of the greatest wide receivers or tight ends in NFL history. In an interview, Adams cited James's exceptional size, speed, and athleticism as key attributes for success on the football field. James himself has previously speculated on a potential NFL career, comparing his hypothetical playstyle to a mix of Rob Gronkowski and Randy Moss. The discussion highlights the perennial debate about multi-sport athletes, with Adams, a six-time Pro Bowler, offering an expert's perspective on James's transferable skills.</p>

          <p>Amazon's cloud division, AWS, announced it has developed its own specialized hardware to cool Nvidia's next-generation GPUs, which are essential for powering the artificial intelligence boom. The new equipment, called the In-Row Heat Exchanger (IRHX), was designed because commercially available solutions were inadequate for the scale of AWS's operations. This development allows AWS to efficiently deploy powerful new computing clusters based on Nvidia's Blackwell architecture. The move reflects Amazon's strategy of building custom infrastructure to optimize performance and reduce reliance on third-party suppliers, which can improve profitability.</p>

          <p>The price of Bitcoin surged to a new record high on Wednesday, briefly exceeding $112,000. The rally in the flagship cryptocurrency was partly attributed to positive momentum in the broader technology sector, led by Nvidia's stock performance. Despite significant inflows into Bitcoin ETFs, the cryptocurrency's price had been trading in a relatively tight range for weeks before this recent breakout. Investors remain bullish, anticipating that increased corporate adoption and potential progress on crypto legislation in the U.S. could continue to drive prices higher in the second half of the year.

Nvidia, now the world's most valuable company, has seen its value skyrocket due to overwhelming demand for its graphics processing units (GPUs).

To qualify for the full credit, parents must earn $200,000 or less ($400,000 for joint filers) and meet other requirements. However, the bill does not expand eligibility, meaning millions of children in the lowest-income families will still not receive the full benefit, as their families' incomes are too low to qualify.

          <p>The Bank of England has recommended loosening a cap on riskier mortgage lending, a move that could help more first-time buyers get onto the property ladder. The change would allow individual banks to issue a higher percentage of their new mortgages to borrowers with high loan-to-income ratios. This could lead to an estimated 36,000 new mortgages a year for people who have struggled to meet affordability tests due to high rent and living costs. The recommendation follows a government request for regulators to find ways to stimulate economic growth, though millions of existing homeowners still face rising monthly payments.

          <p>For those overwhelmed with debt, Chapter 7 bankruptcy can offer a financial fresh start, but it's a decision with significant consequences. The article outlines that while this process can discharge unsecured debts like credit cards and medical bills, it does not eliminate student loans, recent tax debts, or alimony. Filers should also be aware of the tradeoffs, as nonexempt assets may be liquidated, and the bankruptcy will remain on a credit report for up to 10 years. Before filing, individuals should explore all alternatives, such as debt management plans or Chapter 13 bankruptcy, which may be better suited to their situation.</p>
