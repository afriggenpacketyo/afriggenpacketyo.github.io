          <p>Four astronauts from Crew-10 have successfully undocked from the International Space Station aboard a SpaceX Crew Dragon capsule, beginning their journey back to Earth. The crew, commanded by Anne McClain, is scheduled for a Pacific Ocean splashdown off the California coast, marking a 148-day mission completion. During a departure ceremony, the crew expressed gratitude for their time on the ISS, highlighting the importance of international cooperation in space exploration, especially during tumultuous times on Earth. Their replacements, the Crew-11 astronauts, arrived at the station six days prior, allowing for a smooth operational handover.</p>

          <p>The WNBA has issued a strong statement condemning the recent trend of fans throwing sex toys onto the court during games, calling it a significant safety concern. The league announced it is collaborating with local and federal law enforcement to pursue criminal charges, including potential felonies, against those responsible for the disruptions. This response follows multiple incidents across the country, with the league emphasizing that the safety of players, officials, and fans is its highest priority and that such reckless behavior is unacceptable. Two arrests have already been made in connection with the incidents.</p>

          <p>This article details the surprising friendship between U.S. Vice President JD Vance and UK Foreign Secretary David Lammy, two politicians from opposite ends of the political spectrum. Despite their ideological differences, the two have bonded over shared experiences of difficult childhoods, their Christian faith, and their time at elite U.S. universities. The relationship is seen as politically significant, particularly for the UK government in building ties with the Trump administration. The piece highlights how personal relationships can play a crucial role in international diplomacy, even when national interests and policies diverge significantly.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>The new horror film 'Shaman,' directed by Colombian-born Antonio Negret, offers a unique take on the demonic possession genre by grounding it in Andean folklore. The movie follows two American missionaries in a remote region of Ecuador whose son becomes possessed, forcing them to confront local spiritual beliefs and the powerful demon known as the Supay. Filmed on location with the cooperation of an indigenous community, the movie incorporates the Kichwa language and traditional rituals, providing an authentic cultural perspective. The director aimed to create a more personal and raw film that explores themes of cultural conflict and ancient terror.</p>

After an opening round of 63, Fleetwood shot a six-under 64, with seven birdies and a single bogey, to reach 13 under par. His performance puts him in a strong position to claim his first-ever PGA Tour victory.

The initiative aims to streamline the screening process, which is often slowed by strollers, car seats, and other child-related items. Airport officials believe MCO processes more family travel equipment than any other airport globally. The new lanes are expected to reduce congestion and wait times for all travelers, not just families. This program is part of a broader TSA effort to modernize travel, which also includes discounted TSA PreCheck for families.</p>

          <p>The city of Seoul has opened a series of 'warm-hearted convenience stores' to provide a safe and welcoming space for lonely and socially isolated individuals. These centers offer free food, like instant ramen, and a cafe-like atmosphere where visitors can relax, interact, and receive counseling. The initiative was prompted by a rise in 'lonely deaths' and a growing awareness of social isolation, particularly among young people and the elderly in the city's dense, single-person households. The program aims to create low-pressure social environments and has already attracted thousands of visitors seeking connection and a temporary escape from loneliness.</p>

          <p>A new documentary, 'It’s Never Over, Jeff Buckley,' directed by Amy Berg, provides an intimate and honest look at the life of the late musician. The film moves beyond the typical narrative of a doomed artist, instead focusing on Buckley's complex personality, creative process, and internal struggles with sudden fame. Through archival footage, personal writings, and interviews with his mother and close friends, the documentary portrays him as an empathetic but evasive figure. It thoughtfully handles his tragic death at age 30, presenting it as an accident rather than suicide, and offers a dimensionalized view of a talent known for his single iconic album, 'Grace.'</p>

          <p>Independent MP Rupert Lowe admitted to mistakenly identifying a team of charity rowers off the Norfolk coast as potential 'illegal migrants' in a social media post. He had alerted authorities and vowed to ensure their deportation before it was revealed the crew was rowing from Land's End to John O'Groats to raise money for motor neurone disease research. After learning the truth, Lowe apologized for the false alarm and pledged a £1,000 donation to their cause. The rowers, which include a former Royal Marine, said they found the incident 'hilarious' as people on the shore watched them suspiciously.</p>

Sheinbaum emphasized that while Mexico cooperates with the U.S. on security issues, its sovereignty is inalienable and a U.S. military presence will not be accepted. This reaffirms Mexico's long-standing position against foreign military intervention on its territory, a sensitive issue with deep historical roots.</p>

The surge followed CEO Tim Cook's visit to the White House, where he announced plans to spend $100 billion on American companies and parts. President Trump stated that Apple's commitment to U.S. manufacturing would exempt it from potential future tariffs on imported chips, alleviating major investor concerns about the company's profitability. The successful meeting and positive investor sentiment came just two weeks after Apple reported strong quarterly earnings. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>A new report from Realtor.com indicates that home prices are beginning to fall in some U.S. regions, particularly in the South and West. Among the 50 largest metro areas, cities like Austin and Miami have seen the most significant price drops, with median listing prices falling nearly 15% and 19% respectively since 2022. This trend is attributed to rising housing inventory in these areas, partly due to a pandemic-era construction boom. In contrast, markets in the Northeast and Midwest continue to face tight inventory and rising prices, creating a divided national housing market. (not investment advice)</p>
