        </div>
        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>A recent Gallup survey reveals U.S. adult alcohol consumption has dropped to a record low of 54%, a significant decrease from previous years. This decline is primarily driven by a growing public belief, particularly among young adults, that even moderate drinking poses health risks. Increasing scientific consensus linking alcohol to various cancers and other adverse health outcomes is influencing this shift in habits. The article underscores a significant societal change, moving away from past views that suggested potential benefits from moderate alcohol consumption, reflecting a broader public health re-evaluation.</p>

          <p>A federal judge has issued a temporary restraining order, prohibiting ICE from holding detainees at a Manhattan facility unless conditions are significantly improved. The order mandates providing basic necessities such as sleeping mats, hygiene products, regular legal calls, and more meals, citing concerns over "inhumane" and unsanitary conditions. This ruling follows a lawsuit by civil rights advocates and internal government admissions of lacking basic services at the processing center. The Department of Homeland Security plans to appeal the decision, asserting their facilities meet national standards for care and custody.</p>

          <p>The FDA has introduced a new "PreCheck" program aimed at streamlining the establishment of new drug manufacturing sites in the U.S., directly responding to President Trump's executive order to reduce regulatory hurdles. This two-phase initiative seeks to significantly cut the time required for plant approvals, addressing national security concerns about the U.S.'s overreliance on foreign drug production. The program will allow drugmakers closer engagement with the FDA during facility design and construction, and provide early feedback to expedite application assessments, ultimately aiming for a more resilient domestic drug supply.</p>

          <p>Reverse mortgages offer older homeowners a mechanism to convert home equity into cash without incurring additional monthly payments, presenting a potential financial lifeline amidst current inflation and high interest rates. While these loans can significantly improve cash flow and help cover rising medical expenses, financial experts caution about substantial upfront fees, ongoing interest accrual, and inherent risks in declining housing markets. Homeowners must typically be at least 62 years old, and the loan can quickly deplete home equity, potentially leaving nothing for heirs. It is crucial to carefully weigh these factors and consult financial professionals before proceeding. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>Britain's Foreign Minister David Lammy could face a substantial £2,500 fine after admitting he lacked the required fishing license during a recent diplomatic engagement with U.S. Vice President JD Vance at his Chevening country residence. Despite the setting on private land, all anglers in the UK are legally mandated to possess a valid rod license. Lammy's office attributed the lapse to an "administrative oversight" and confirmed he has since acquired the necessary licenses. The incident adds an unusual, albeit minor, legal entanglement to the high-profile bilateral meeting.</p>

          <p>The average two-year mortgage rate in the UK has fallen below 5% for the first time since former Prime Minister Liz Truss's mini-budget in September 2022, now standing at 4.99%. This decline signifies increased competition among lenders and represents a "symbolic turning point" for homebuyers. While interest rates have seen multiple cuts, Moneyfacts suggests significant further reductions are improbable. Hundreds of thousands of borrowers are poised to remortgage this year, benefiting from improved affordability, even as average house prices have seen a modest increase. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>Mortgage professionals offer crucial advice for prospective homebuyers navigating the current market while anticipating potential rate cuts, warning against common pitfalls. Key missteps include changing jobs or opening new lines of credit before loan approval, which can significantly jeopardize eligibility. Experts emphasize the importance of securing mortgage preapproval to accurately understand affordability and gain a competitive edge in bidding. They also caution that Federal Reserve rate cuts do not directly translate to proportional mortgage payment reductions, as market factors and increased demand can offset savings. Instead, buyers should prioritize boosting credit scores and saving for larger down payments. (not investment advice)</p>

The elaborate scam, allegedly orchestrated from call centers in the Dominican Republic, involved impersonating grandchildren in distress or lawyers demanding bail money.
