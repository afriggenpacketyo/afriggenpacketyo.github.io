          <p>Kilauea volcano on Hawaii's Big Island has erupted for the 25th time since December, sending lava fountains over 330 feet into the air. The eruption began from the north vent and has been characterized by gas-pistoning, a process where gas accumulates at the top of a lava column before erupting. The U.S. Geological Survey's Hawaiian Volcano Observatory is monitoring the activity and has warned of potential hazards, including high levels of volcanic gas and falling volcanic fragments. This latest event continues the cycle of eruptive episodes and pauses that have marked Kilauea's activity in recent months.</p>

Online banks often provide the most competitive rates due to lower overhead costs.

          <h2>Officers Sue to Install Jan. 6 Plaque at U.S. Capitol</h2>

          <p>Two police officers who defended the Capitol during the January 6 attack have filed a civil lawsuit seeking a court order to hang a plaque honoring police heroes. The lawsuit cites a 2022 law requiring the plaque's installation, which has been delayed by GOP House Speaker Mike Johnson. The officers argue that the failure to hang the plaque violates the Equal Protection clause and reflects a broader trend of downplaying the events of January 6. The lawsuit highlights the ongoing political divisions surrounding the Capitol riot and the recognition of those who defended it.</p>
