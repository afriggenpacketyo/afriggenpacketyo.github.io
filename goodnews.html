          <p>Deutsche Bank announced second-quarter profits that surpassed analyst expectations, driven by a strong performance in its investment banking division. The German lender reported a net profit of €1.485 billion, outperforming a €1.2 billion forecast, with revenues aligning with market predictions at €7.804 billion. This positive result comes as European banks contend with a lower interest rate environment and geopolitical trade uncertainties, particularly the looming threat of U.S. tariffs that could impact the German economy. The bank also noted increased opportunities in advising clients on defense-related ventures. (not investment advice)</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>After a decade-long legal fight, former City traders Tom Hayes and Carlo Palombo have had their convictions for manipulating the Libor interest rate overturned by a UK court. The ruling raises significant questions about the original prosecutions and may pave the way for at least seven other convicted traders to appeal their sentences. The decision has prompted calls for a public inquiry into the scandal, particularly focusing on the role of senior bank managers and the Serious Fraud Office's reliance on internal investigations conducted by the banks themselves. Hayes and Palombo have maintained they were scapegoats for the broader financial crisis.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>A federal appeals court has ruled that President Trump's executive order aimed at ending birthright citizenship is unconstitutional, affirming a lower court's nationwide block on the policy. The 9th U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals found that the order's attempt to deny citizenship to children born in the U.S. to non-citizen or temporary resident parents violates the 14th Amendment. The 2-1 decision keeps the injunction in place, preventing the administration from enforcing the policy. The ruling marks a significant legal setback for the administration on a key immigration issue and moves the matter closer to a potential Supreme Court review.</p>

          <p>For the first time since before the pandemic, China and Russia have launched a joint oceanographic research mission, signaling renewed scientific and strategic cooperation. A team of 25 scientists set sail from Vladivostok for a 45-day expedition in the Bering Sea and northwestern Pacific Ocean. The mission will study the effects of climate change on deep-sea environments and the geological history of the region. This resumption of joint surveys underscores a shared commitment to addressing climate change and exploring marine science, potentially with an eye toward future ambitions in the Arctic.</p>

          <p>The MLS All-Star game, which saw the MLS team defeat a Liga MX selection 3-1, delivered an entertaining spectacle for fans in Austin. However, the event was overshadowed by the absence of the league's biggest star, Lionel Messi, who skipped the festivities, potentially facing a suspension for his decision. His no-show has ignited a debate about the relevance and format of the All-Star game in a league with increasing global stature. MLS Commissioner Don Garber acknowledged the need to rethink the event to keep it compelling for players and fans alike amid growing fixture congestion.</p>

          <p>A major study published in The Lancet suggests that walking 7,000 steps a day, a more achievable goal than the popular 10,000-step benchmark, can significantly boost health. The research, which analyzed data from over 160,000 adults, linked this step count to a reduced risk of serious conditions like heart disease, cancer, and dementia. The 10,000-step target originated from a 1960s marketing campaign in Japan and lacks a scientific basis. Researchers believe these findings could encourage more people to use step tracking as a practical way to improve their physical and mental wellbeing.</p>

          <p>A Scripps Institution of Oceanography student discovered a rare violet sea snail, Janthina janthina, on a La Jolla beach, a species not seen locally in a decade. These pelagic snails, known for their striking purple shells and bubble rafts for flotation, typically inhabit warmer tropical waters. Their appearance in Southern California often coincides with warmer ocean currents moving toward the coast, raising questions among researchers about a potential link to climate change. Scientists are encouraging the public to report any further sightings as they study whether this is a sign of shifting marine ecosystems.</p>

Ofcom, the media regulator, has outlined several acceptable methods, including credit card checks and photo ID matching, with non-compliant sites facing massive fines. The rules aim to prevent children from accessing explicit material, but concerns remain about user privacy and the potential for circumvention using tools like VPNs.

          <p>In a surprising turn, San Francisco Giants' Rafael Devers admitted he prefers playing a defensive position over being a full-time designated hitter. This admission came after his debut at first base for the Giants, a stark contrast to his public insistence on being a DH while with his former team, the Boston Red Sox. Devers explained that playing in the field keeps him more active and prevents him from overthinking his at-bats. The change in stance follows a tense spring training where he and former manager Alex Cora were at odds over his defensive role.</p>

          <p>South Korea's economy grew by 0.6% in the second quarter compared to the previous one, allowing the country to avoid a technical recession. The growth, which surpassed economists' expectations, was primarily driven by a strong 4.2% quarterly increase in exports, particularly in semiconductors and petroleum products. This surge was partly attributed to firms expediting shipments ahead of potential U.S. trade policy changes and tariff implementations. Despite the positive quarter, analysts remain cautious, as domestic consumption shows weaker signs and the global trade outlook remains uncertain. (not investment advice)</p>
