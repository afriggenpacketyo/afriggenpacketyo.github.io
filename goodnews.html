          <h2>UK Government Reverses Course on Welfare Reforms After Facing Party Rebellion</h2>

        </div>
        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>The UK's Labour government has made significant concessions on its flagship welfare reform bill to avert a major rebellion from over 120 of its own MPs. Health Secretary Wes Streeting admitted the initial rollout was mishandled and stated the government is now in a "better position" after strengthening the proposals. The changes include limiting cuts to the Personal Independence Payment (PIP) to new claimants only and ensuring the health-related component of Universal Credit will rise with inflation. The U-turn followed widespread concern that the original plans would harm disabled and vulnerable people.</p>

In his farewell message, he expressed gratitude to the managers, coaches, and teammates who shaped his career at the club he called home since he was 19.</p>

          <p>A dramatic rescue operation took place off the coast of Cape Canaveral, Florida, where four people were saved from a boat that had caught fire. The U.S. Coast Guard reported that a good Samaritan vessel was instrumental in assisting with the rescue of the passengers from the burning boat. Thick black smoke was visible from the shore as the incident unfolded. Fortunately, no injuries were reported among the rescued individuals, and an investigation into the cause of the fire is currently underway.</p>

          <p>Amid ongoing macroeconomic uncertainty, some top-performing Wall Street analysts are recommending specific dividend-paying stocks as a strategy for enhancing investment returns. This article highlights three such companies: McDonald's (MCD), EPR Properties (EPR), and Halliburton (HAL), detailing the rationale behind their "buy" ratings. The analysis points to factors like McDonald's brand power, EPR's potential for external growth in experiential real estate, and Halliburton's resilient international market presence as key drivers for their positive outlook.

          <p>In a personal essay, author and activist V (formerly Eve Ensler) reflects on the challenge of maintaining hope and finding effective ways to resist in what she describes as an authoritarian and suffocating political climate. She argues against succumbing to despair, advocating for a dual mindset that acknowledges pain while channeling it into purposeful action. Drawing inspiration from activists in the Democratic Republic of the Congo and former congresswoman Cori Bush, the article posits that community organizing, mutual care, and collective action are essential tools for building a new world and that one's humanity is a powerful form of resistance.</p>

          <p>Fifteen years after its initial public offering on June 29, 2010, Tesla's stock has seen a monumental rise, turning a hypothetical $10,000 investment into nearly $3 million today. The article traces the company's journey from a niche electric sports car maker to a trillion-dollar behemoth, driven by the mass-market success of the Model 3 and Model Y. However, it also notes current challenges, including sluggish 2025 sales, increased competition, and the controversy surrounding CEO Elon Musk's recent foray into politics and his divisive public persona.</p>

The liquid-fuel rocket, a joint development by Mitsubishi Heavy Industries and JAXA, has been a reliable workhorse for Japan's space exploration and satellite deployment efforts. This final mission concludes the H2A series' distinguished career, as the country transitions to its next-generation H3 rocket. The new H3 vehicle is designed to be more cost-effective, ensuring Japan remains competitive in the global space launch market.</p>

          <p>One hundred years after a powerful earthquake devastated downtown Santa Barbara, experts say the event still holds crucial lessons for California's seismic preparedness. The 1925 quake exposed the deadly vulnerability of unreinforced brick buildings, a problem that took decades for many cities to address through mandatory retrofitting laws. The article notes that while progress has been made, many potentially vulnerable structures, like soft-story apartment buildings, remain unaddressed in Santa Barbara and elsewhere. The quake also reshaped the city's identity, prompting the adoption of its now-famous Spanish Colonial Revival architectural style during the rebuilding effort.</p>

          <p>Amid economic volatility, financial education startup Dow Janes is seeing a surge in popularity, particularly among Gen Z and millennial women aiming to improve their financial literacy. Founded by Harvard Business School graduate Britt Baker, the company uses accessible social media content and a structured online course to teach money management fundamentals. The trend addresses a documented gap in financial education, as surveys show women are historically less likely to have been taught about investing and wealth-building. The company focuses on both practical skills and the psychological aspects of personal finance.</p>
