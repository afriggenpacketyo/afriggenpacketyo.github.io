          <p>Energy giant Shell announced second-quarter adjusted earnings of $4.26 billion, surpassing analyst expectations despite the impact of lower global oil and gas prices. The company is continuing its robust shareholder return program, launching another $3.5 billion in share buybacks, which marks the 15th consecutive quarter of significant buybacks. Shell's performance and commitment to its strategic plan, focusing on cost savings and prioritizing its liquified natural gas (LNG) business, appear to have resonated well with investors, as its share price has outperformed many of its U.S. and European competitors this year.

          <p>Canada and Malta have declared their intention to formally recognize the state of Palestine in September at the United Nations General Assembly, joining France and potentially the United Kingdom in this diplomatic move. The announcements are designed to increase pressure for a two-state solution to the Israeli-Palestinian conflict and translate the concept from theory into practice. Canada's recognition is conditioned on the Palestinian Authority holding elections in 2026 without Hamas's involvement, while Malta emphasized the decision as a concrete step toward achieving a just and lasting peace in the Middle East.</p>

          <p>Auction house Sotheby's has returned a set of sacred jewels, believed to be linked to the Buddha's remains, to India following pressure from the Indian government and global Buddhist leaders. The Piprahwa Gems, which were set to be auctioned, have been acquired by the Godrej Industries Group and will now be placed on permanent public display in India. The move resolves a controversy over the ethics of selling sacred objects, which many believe should be venerated rather than treated as commodities. Indian Prime Minister Narendra Modi celebrated the return as a "proud and joyous moment" for the nation's cultural heritage.</p>

          <p>Astronauts aboard China's Shenzhou-19 mission have disclosed that their record-setting spacewalk included a surprise, high-pressure repair task. Commander Cai Xuzhe revealed that a payload adaptor unexpectedly jammed during a cargo installation procedure outside the Tiangong space station. The crew had to devise an impromptu solution in real-time, coordinating with ground control without the specialized tools typically required for such a repair. This successful improvisation highlights the crew's problem-solving skills and the growing capabilities of China's human spaceflight program during complex extravehicular activities in orbit.</p>

          <h2>Analysis of 4,000-Year-Old Dental Plaque Reveals Earliest Evidence of Betel Nut Chewing</h2>

          <p>Researchers have found the earliest direct biochemical proof of betel nut consumption in Southeast Asia by analyzing 4,000-year-old dental plaque from a burial site in Thailand. Using advanced liquid chromatography-mass spectrometry, the team identified psychoactive compounds from the betel nut in the molars of an individual, predating previous evidence by at least 1,000 years. This innovative method allows for the detection of ancient practices even without visible evidence like stained teeth, opening new avenues for understanding the diet, culture, and social habits of prehistoric communities through minimally invasive analysis of archaeological remains.</p>

          <p>Shares of South Korean shipbuilder Hanwha Ocean surged over 16% to their highest level since 2015 after the U.S. and South Korea announced a new trade agreement. The deal, which sets a 15% tariff on South Korean exports, is expected to benefit Hanwha, which recently acquired the Philly Shipyard in Philadelphia and is poised to play a key role in revitalizing U.S. shipbuilding. The stock's rally was also supported by a significant jump in the company's second-quarter operating profits and new order announcements, signaling strong business momentum alongside the favorable trade news.

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Despite facing a 25% tariff from the U.S., India has strategically avoided rushing into a trade agreement, prioritizing the protection of its domestic sectors, particularly agriculture. Analysts note that India's large and politically significant farming bloc makes it difficult for the government to concede to U.S. demands for greater market access for agricultural products. Furthermore, India is pursuing a "multi-alignment" strategy, advancing trade talks with other partners like the UK and the EU to diversify its economic relationships. This approach provides India with leverage and softens the impact of U.S. tariffs, reflecting its goal of acting as a rising, independent power. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>Fifteen-year-old attacking midfielder Max Dowman has been a standout performer for Arsenal during their pre-season tour, capturing attention with his skill and confidence against senior opposition. Having first trained with the first team at 14, Dowman has shown significant potential in friendlies against AC Milan and Newcastle. His impressive dribble against Newcastle, which won a match-deciding penalty, particularly highlighted why he is being tipped for a potential Premier League debut this season.

The Dodgers acquired pitching prospect Adam Serwinowski from the Reds, along with reliever Paul Gervase and catcher Ben Rortvedt from the Rays. In exchange, they sent minor league catcher Hunter Feduccia to Tampa Bay. While not the major splash many fans anticipated, the move adds a promising left-handed pitcher in Serwinowski to their farm system. The team is still expected to pursue more significant upgrades for their bullpen and outfield before Thursday's deadline.</p>
