          <p>New Zealand cricket will be without star batter Kane Williamson for the upcoming T20 series against England as he continues to recover from an injury. Williamson, who has not played internationally since March, is expected to be fit for the three one-day internationals that will follow the T20 matches. In his absence, the Black Caps will be led by captain Mitchell Santner, who is returning to the squad after recovering from abdominal surgery, providing a boost to the team's leadership.</p>

          <p>An advisor to Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu expressed strong faith in the Gaza peace plan brokered by President Trump, stating it provides a framework to dismantle Hamas and ensure regional security. The plan's second phase reportedly calls for the demilitarization of Hamas and would be overseen by an International Stabilization Force operating in coordination with the IDF. While Israeli officials see the plan as a way to compel Hamas's compliance, some security experts have raised concerns about vague language regarding enforcement and verification.</p>

          <p>The Denver Broncos defeated the New York Jets 13-11 in a defense-dominated NFL game, with the Jets' offense struggling profoundly. The Broncos' defense was the story of the game, sacking Jets quarterback Justin Fields nine times and holding the offense to a mere 82 total net yards. Despite the offensive woes, the Jets had a final chance to drive for a winning score, but the effort was thwarted by a game-sealing sack on fourth down, dropping the team to an 0-6 record on the season.</p>

          <p>The first phase of the US-brokered peace plan for Gaza includes a ceasefire, increased humanitarian aid, and a reciprocal exchange of hostages held by Hamas for Palestinian prisoners in Israeli jails. A key component is the partial withdrawal of Israeli troops to an agreed-upon line, leaving them in control of about 53% of the territory for now. The agreement will be monitored by a multinational force, though negotiations on more contentious later phases, such as the demilitarization of Hamas and long-term governance, are still pending.</p>
