          <p>King Charles III made his first trip to Canada since his coronation to deliver the Speech from the Throne, opening the 45th session of Canada's parliament. Prime Minister Mark Carney invited the King amidst strained ties with the U.S., where President Trump has imposed tariffs on Canada and made disparaging remarks. Carney emphasized the King's visit underscores Canada's sovereignty, while Governor General Mary Simon highlighted the enduring relationship between Canada and the Crown. The King's visit included meetings with indigenous leaders and a tree-planting ceremony, marking a symbolic gesture of support for Canada.</p>

          <p>Following a car ramming incident in Liverpool that injured dozens, the Merseyside Police quickly released details about the driver, identifying him as a 53-year-old white British man. This swift disclosure was a calculated move to preempt the spread of misinformation, as false anti-Muslim reports had circulated after previous violent episodes in Britain. The police urged the public not to speculate on the circumstances, though online speculation persisted. The decision to release the driver's identity was described by some officials as unusual but necessary to balance the need to avoid prejudicing a future trial against the potential for public disorder.</p>

          <p>In a challenge to Darwinian evolution, Chinese scientists have demonstrated that acquired traits can be inherited without DNA changes. Rice plants subjected to cold stress passed on cold tolerance across five generations through DNA methylation changes. This study revives the theory of Jean-Baptiste Lamarck, who proposed that organisms can pass on learned survival traits. The research team from the Chinese Academy of Sciences found that rice varieties from China‚Äôs frosty northeast exhibited these non-genetic adaptations, suggesting Lamarckism plays a role in evolution.</p>
