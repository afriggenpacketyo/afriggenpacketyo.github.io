          <p>French President Emmanuel Macron and Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky have developed a close relationship built on mutual respect, trust, and a shared commitment to defending Ukraine's sovereignty against Russian aggression. According to interviews with individuals close to both leaders, the two presidents communicate frequently via secure lines and personal calls, discussing strategic matters and offering support during difficult times. Macron's early support for Zelensky's campaign helped the Ukrainian leader gain credibility, and their bond has deepened since the full-scale Russian invasion of Ukraine. Macron has been instrumental in bringing Zelensky together with other world leaders and has advocated for security guarantees for Ukraine, solidifying their alliance.</p>

          <p>A Nigerian Doctor Who fan, Adesoji Kukoyi, expressed his excitement about an upcoming episode set in Lagos, Nigeria, marking the first time the show is primarily set in Africa. The episode features a vibrant barber shop, a Lagos market, and a monstrous spider, possibly Anansi from West African folklore. Writer Inua Ellams suggests the Doctor's character aligns with Nigerian traits, but also considers why the show has rarely visited Africa in its 62-year history. The episode's setting is momentous, especially considering the unearthing of nine lost Doctor Who episodes from the 1960s in a Nigerian TV facility back in 2013.</p>

          <p>Top U.S. and Chinese officials met in Geneva to discuss de-escalating trade tensions, with Treasury Secretary Scott Bessent and U.S. Trade Representative Jamieson Greer meeting with Chinese Vice Premier He Lifeng. The talks aim to reduce tariffs, which have disrupted trade between the world's two largest economies. President Trump hinted at lowering tariffs, suggesting an 80% tariff rate, while the Chinese government has emphasized the need for equality and mutual respect in negotiations. The outcome of the talks could significantly impact global commerce and financial markets.</p>

          <p>Lord Mandelson, the UK's ambassador to the US, hailed the recent UK-US trade deal as a foundation for expanding trade opportunities between the two nations. The deal has reduced or eliminated tariffs imposed by President Trump on some UK imports, including cars, steel, and aluminum. Discussions are ongoing regarding the UK's Digital Services Tax, with Mandelson noting that abolishing the tax was not part of the current trade agreement. The ambassador also highlighted the strong relationship between Prime Minister Starmer and President Trump.</p>
