          <p>Ailish McBride, a 20-year-old makeup artist with color vision deficiency, is a contestant on BBC Three's Glow Up, where she discusses her challenges with distinguishing certain colors like red and orange. Despite this, she experiments boldly with color, aiming to demonstrate that color blindness doesn't limit creativity. While judges noted some simplicity in her looks, they also praised her determination. McBride, who has studied color theory and labels her palettes, was eliminated from the competition after two weeks, but remains proud of her participation and hopes to work in film and theatre.</p>

          <p>Nintendo projects selling 15 million Switch 2 consoles in the fiscal year ending March 2026, with Omdia forecasting even higher sales in 2025 alone. This forecast comes as Nintendo announced a successor to its successful Switch device, set to launch in June. The company's net sales are expected to rise 63% year-on-year, although profits are projected to fall short of estimates due to potential tariffs. President Shuntaro Furukawa expressed concern that additional tariffs, particularly on consoles manufactured in Vietnam, could decrease demand in the U.S., adding uncertainty to sales predictions.</p>

          <p>President Trump is expected to announce a trade agreement with Britain, signaling a potential win for both countries amid ongoing trade tensions. The agreement, teased by Trump on social media, could involve lowering British tariffs on U.S. cars and farm goods, as well as removing British taxes on U.S. technology companies. The deal would be the first since Trump imposed tariffs on numerous trading partners, and comes as Britain seeks to strengthen its economic ties post-Brexit. However, some experts suggest the announcement may only represent an agreement to begin negotiations rather than a finalized deal.</p>

          <p>President Donald Trump is expected to announce a trade deal with the United Kingdom, offering a potential win for both countries amid ongoing trade tensions. The deal would be the first since Trump imposed tariffs on numerous trading partners, though details remain unclear. A British official indicated that the UK may lower tariffs on US cars and cut digital sales tax affecting US tech companies. The announcement comes as the UK seeks to expand global trade ties post-Brexit, but trade experts caution that the deal may be more limited than a traditional trade agreement.</p>

          <p>The impending trade deal between the UK and the US is being hailed as a significant achievement for Prime Minister Keir Starmer, especially following a challenging set of local election results. This news, combined with the free trade agreement with India, provides a political boost for Starmer. The UK has been seeking such a deal with the US since President Trump's global tariffs were announced, making this a highly significant development. The UK-India agreement is estimated to bring in a ¬£25.5bn boost to bilateral trade and a ¬£4.8bn annual increase in UK GDP.</p>

Reynolds stated that they just wanted to connect with the players and offer support, but one player's request for a rental car booking highlighted the unique dynamic between the Hollywood owners and their football club.</p>

          <p>BBC Maestro has launched an online writing course featuring an AI-enhanced avatar of the late Agatha Christie, sparking debate about the ethics of using AI to resurrect historical figures. While Christie's family approved the project and her actual words were used in the script, some ethicists question whether it's appropriate to put words in the mouth of someone who cannot consent. The course combines academic research with a "digital prosthetic" over a real actor, aiming to teach Christie's craft without inventing her views. The project highlights the growing trend of using AI to create posthumous representations of artists and celebrities.</p>
