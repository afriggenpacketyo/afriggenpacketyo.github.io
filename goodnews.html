          <p>A Mexican Navy sailboat, the Cuauhtemoc, carrying 277 people, crashed into the Brooklyn Bridge on Saturday evening, causing injuries to at least 19 individuals aboard. Four people sustained serious injuries, though no one fell into the water, and the bridge appears to have suffered no structural damage. The ship was departing for Iceland when the collision occurred at approximately 8:30 p.m. The National Transportation Safety Board is investigating the incident, with preliminary information suggesting a mechanical issue with the sailboat as the likely cause. The Brooklyn Bridge was temporarily closed but has since reopened after initial inspections.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>President Trump criticized Walmart after the retail giant stated that tariffs would force them to increase prices, urging the company to absorb the costs instead. Trump claimed Walmart made billions and could "EAT THE TARIFFS" to avoid passing costs to consumers. Walmart responded that they would do their best to keep prices low given small retail margins. Economists warn that tariffs will inevitably drive up prices, leaving businesses to choose between raising prices and laying off workers. The situation arose after Trump temporarily reduced tariffs on China following earlier threats of a trade war.</p>

          <p>A Mexican Navy training sailboat, the Cuauht√©moc, collided with the Brooklyn Bridge on Saturday night, injuring at least 20 people. The incident involved 277 people on board, with three critically injured. The ship's tall masts snapped upon impact with the bridge. All lanes of the Brooklyn Bridge were briefly closed for inspection, and the Department of Transportation assessed the structure for damage. The Cuauht√©moc, a three-masted barque, is used to train seamen and officers at Mexico‚Äôs Heroic Naval Military School, and the crash occurred days before New York's Fleet Week.</p>

          <div class="timestamp">2025-05-17 22:36:48 EDT</div>
        </div>
        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>The UK government is exploring plans to have convicted criminals perform unpaid work such as filling potholes and cleaning bins. Justice Secretary Shabana Mahmood aims to expand unpaid work opportunities, partnering probation teams with councils and private companies to assign jobs to offenders. The offenders would not receive wages; instead, the money would go into a fund for victim's groups. The government believes this approach will provide more meaningful punishment and ensure that crime doesn't pay, while also addressing public needs.</p>

          <p>The UK's Eurovision entry, Remember Monday, placed 19th out of 26, despite strong vocals and harmonies. The song, "What The Hell Just Happened," was a mix of musical styles that lacked consistency, despite clever lyrics and memorable hooks. The staging, while fun, didn't have the impact of other performances. Politics and vote trading may have also played a role. The band's performance was praised by Graham Norton and Scott Mills on BBC Radio 2, and they made friends across Europe, becoming great ambassadors for the UK in the contest.</p>

          <p>Pop culture has reshaped the public's perception of Lyle and Erik Menendez, who were convicted of murdering their parents. Thanks to TikTok, Netflix, and figures like Kim Kardashian, a new generation is more sympathetic to their claims of sexual assault. A Los Angeles judge recently reduced their sentence to include the possibility of parole, pending a hearing next month. This shift in public opinion, combined with new evidence of abuse, may influence their chances of freedom. The case highlights society's evolving understanding of trauma and sexual abuse.</p>
