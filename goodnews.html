          <p>CrowdStrike's shares experienced a drop of approximately 5% in extended trading on Tuesday following the company's release of a revenue forecast that fell short of expectations. Despite reporting adjusted earnings per share of 73 cents, surpassing the anticipated 65 cents, and revenue aligning with expectations at $1.10 billion, the company's guidance for the current quarter projected adjusted earnings per share between 82 and 84 cents on revenue of $1.14 billion to $1.15 billion, slightly below analysts' estimates of 81 cents per share and $1.16 billion in revenue. CrowdStrike did increase its full-year earnings guidance but maintained its revenue expectation, and the company also announced a $1 billion share buyback program, reflecting confidence in its future prospects. The company's CEO, George Kurtz, highlighted the share repurchase as a sign of the company's commitment to preventing security breaches. Optimism surrounds the company's long-term financial health.</p>

          <p>The United Kingdom has been exempted from President Donald Trump's executive order that doubled steel and aluminum tariffs from 25% to 50%. The order, which raises import taxes for US firms buying from other countries, maintains the levy at 25% for the UK, contingent on the US-UK Economic Prosperity Deal (EPD) from May 8. The order also stipulates that the UK levy could increase to 50% if the UK does not comply with the terms of the EPD from July 9. The UK government has affirmed its commitment to protecting British business and jobs across key sectors, including steel, as part of its plan for change.</p>

          <p>The Senate Committee on Agriculture, Nutrition, and Forestry began the confirmation hearing for Michael Boren, President Donald Trump's nominee to oversee the U.S. Forest Service, despite his history of clashing with the agency. Boren, an investment consultant and Idaho ranch owner, has faced disputes with the Forest Service, including disagreements over building a cabin, diverting a stream, and managing land within the Sawtooth National Forest, and he has accused the Forest Service of being "aggressive" at times. If confirmed, Boren would be responsible for day-to-day operations at the U.S. Forest Service, managing about 200 million acres of public land, and he has emphasized the importance of timber production on federal lands. The Senate Agriculture Committee will assess Boren's qualifications and vote on his nomination.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>The Federal Reserve Board has lifted the $1.95 trillion asset cap imposed on Wells Fargo since February 2018, a penalty resulting from the bank's past misconduct, including the cross-selling scandal. The removal of the growth restriction signifies the progress Wells Fargo has made in addressing its deficiencies and meeting the conditions for its termination. With the asset cap lifted, Wells Fargo can now expand its deposit base, loan activity, and dealmaking division, and CEO Charlie Scharf has worked to resolve the bank's past issues, clearing 14 consent orders since 2019. While other elements of the 2018 order remain in place, the removal of the asset cap is expected to provide significant growth opportunities for Wells Fargo. (not investment advice)</p>

The girl and her parents, who are from Mexico, had their legal protections rescinded by the Trump administration, but public outrage and advocacy from lawmakers led to the reinstatement of their status. The girl's doctor at Children's Hospital Los Angeles had warned that she could die within days of losing her medical care for short bowel syndrome, and an online fundraiser for her care has amassed over $40,000. The family's attorney emphasized the importance of ensuring that no one is put in harm's way.</p>

The backdrop is dark and blank, contrasting with the previous portrait that featured lighting from below and an American flag backdrop. The new portrait aims to reflect the optimism and resolve of America, especially after a disastrous four years of the Biden administration.</p>
