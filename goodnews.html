        </div>
        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>This article recounts an incident where George Wendt, known for his role as Norm on "Cheers," mistakenly implicated John Boehner in a scandal involving another Ohio politician, Buz Lukens, during Boehner's first congressional race in 1990. Wendt, whose brother-in-law was Boehner's opponent, made the comments on "The Arsenio Hall Show," leading to a public back-and-forth between the campaigns. Boehner ultimately won the election despite the gaffe, and later spoke amicably about Wendt after the actor's recent death. The article highlights the intersection of celebrity, politics, and the potential for missteps in the public eye. The article reflects on the fact that Wendt apologized to Boehner after the fact, and that they had a great conversation.</p>

          <p>Approximately 14 million bees escaped after a tractor-trailer carrying pollinator hives overturned in Whatcom County, Washington. Authorities closed the road and advised the public to avoid the area due to the potential for bee stings, especially for those with allergies. Beekeepers assisted in the rescue efforts, working to re-hive the bees and locate the queen. The road was closed for about 24 hours to facilitate the bee recovery operation, and officials expressed gratitude to those who helped. The event reflects the importance of bees in the ecosystem and the collaborative efforts to mitigate the consequences of such incidents.</p>

          <p>A new TikTok trend suggests that a full-fat coke and salty fries can alleviate migraines, but experts caution against relying on this "McMigraine Meal" as a cure. While caffeine and salt may provide temporary relief for some, they can also trigger migraines in others. Experts emphasize that migraine is a complex neurological condition with no simple solution, and there's not enough research into effective treatments. The article explores the potential benefits and risks of this viral hack, while highlighting the need for evidence-based migraine management strategies. A GP says that the caffeine can act as a nerve disruptor, and for some, that disturbance works in a positive way.</p>
