          <p>Elon Musk's company, Tesla, has formally applied to the UK's energy regulator, Ofgem, for a license to supply electricity to British homes and businesses. If approved, this move would allow Tesla to compete with established energy firms, potentially leveraging its existing customer base of electric vehicle and home battery owners. The application comes as Tesla faces increased competition and a recent decline in its electric vehicle sales across key European markets, suggesting a strategic diversification of its energy business.</p>

Under this policy, deported individuals can still participate in their appeal hearings remotely via video link from their home nations.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>This article explores the phenomenon of gravitational waves emitted by newly formed black holes, which scientists metaphorically describe as a form of "music." During their turbulent formation, such as from a star's collapse, young black holes ring out as they settle into a stable, mathematically perfect shape. These vibrations, which are ripples in spacetime itself, offer a unique opportunity for astronomers to study the fundamental properties of these cosmic objects before they become silent and introverted in their maturity.</p>

          <div class="timestamp">2025-08-10 22:00:08 EDT</div>
        </div>
        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>China has rolled out a national childcare subsidy program, providing families with 3,600 yuan (about $501) annually for each child under three years old to combat declining birth rates. Analysis suggests this policy could have a greater economic impact in less affluent regions. Because the subsidy constitutes a much larger portion of average income in poorer provinces like Gansu (13.5%) compared to wealthier cities like Shanghai (4.1%), it is expected to more significantly boost consumption and potentially birth rates in rural areas.

          <p>Quarterback Trey Lance delivered a strong performance in the Chargers' 27-13 preseason win against the New Orleans Saints, bolstering his case for the backup position. Lance showcased his dual-threat capabilities with both his arm and his legs, rushing for 48 yards and scoring a five-yard touchdown. His solid outing, praised by coach Jim Harbaugh, has intensified the competition with veteran Taylor Heinicke, who appeared rusty in his limited playing time during the game.</p>
