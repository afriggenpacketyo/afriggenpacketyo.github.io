          <p>NBA veteran Brook Lopez has officially signed a two-year, $18-million contract with the Los Angeles Clippers, citing the opportunity to compete for a championship alongside stars like Kawhi Leonard and James Harden. A Southern California native, Lopez expressed his astonishment at the franchise's growth and his eagerness to contribute to its success. Although he has been a career starter, he is prepared to accept any role, including coming off the bench. Lopez is particularly enthusiastic about the possibility of playing alongside fellow center Ivica Zubac, envisioning a dominant defensive and complementary offensive pairing that could significantly benefit the team.</p>

          <h2>Commentary Argues MLB Should Adapt Home Run Derby to Ensure Participation of Stars Ohtani and Judge</h2>

          <p>This article argues that Major League Baseball is missing a significant opportunity by not having Shohei Ohtani and Aaron Judge, its two most popular home-run hitters, participate in the annual Home Run Derby. Ohtani cited the physical toll of the event, based on his 2021 experience, while Judge stated he would only participate if it were held in New York. The author suggests that MLB should be flexible and even allow the players to help write the rules to secure their involvement. The piece contends that their participation would not only boost viewership but also elevate the profiles of other talented players in the competition, which is crucial for the sport's diminishing cultural relevance.</p>

          <p>CNBC's Jim Cramer has advised investors that corporate deal-making is accelerating, suggesting a 'ripple' of activity that will grow into larger waves in the coming months. He pointed to several recent acquisitions, such as Ferrero's purchase of WK Kellogg, as indicators of a heating-up market for mergers and acquisitions. Cramer believes the market is currently in an early, advantageous stage for investors to act. He also suggested that the current administration's Federal Trade Commission appears more favorable to M&A activity, which could encourage more deals, including potential consolidations in the regional banking sector.

          <p>Rookie pitcher Jacob Misiorowski of the Milwaukee Brewers has become a central topic of conversation at the MLB All-Star Game following his surprise selection to the National League team. The 23-year-old, who has only been in the major leagues for a month, gained significant attention after a dominant 12-strikeout performance against the Los Angeles Dodgers. His inclusion has drawn criticism, particularly from members of the Philadelphia Phillies, who felt their own pitchers were more deserving. Despite the controversy, Dodgers manager Dave Roberts, who will manage the NL team, expressed excitement for the young player, highlighting the attention and electricity he brings to the game.</p>

          <p>Kentucky Representative Thomas Massie, a Republican who has publicly broken with President Trump on key issues, has amassed a significant campaign fund of over $1.7 million for his re-election. This strong fundraising performance comes as Trump's political allies have launched a super PAC specifically aimed at unseating Massie in his 2026 primary. Massie, known for his independent stances, including voting against Trump's tax bill, raised over $584,000 in the last quarter alone. The substantial war chest positions him to mount a robust defense in his expensive, multi-market district against the forthcoming challenge from the president's political machine.</p>

          <p>The city of San Francisco is rolling out Microsoft's 365 Copilot Chat, a generative AI tool, for its 30,000 government workers, making it one of the largest local governments to adopt such technology. Mayor Daniel Lurie announced the initiative, stating it will help employees like nurses and social workers improve city services by handling administrative tasks such as data analysis and report drafting. A six-month pilot program involving over 2,000 workers showed productivity gains of up to five hours per week. The city aims to enhance response times for services and improve language translation capabilities, all at no additional cost as the technology is covered under its existing Microsoft license.</p>

          <h2>UK Government Considers Mutual Ownership Model for Post Office's Future</h2>

        </div>
        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>The UK government has launched a public consultation on the future of the Post Office, suggesting that ownership could be transferred to its postmasters through a mutualization model. This move is part of a broader effort to reform the organization's culture and restore trust following the devastating Horizon IT scandal, which led to the wrongful conviction of hundreds of sub-postmasters. While the government does not plan to reduce the current network of 11,500 branches, it is seeking a "fresh vision" for the state-owned service. Any major structural change, such as mutualization or a charter model similar to the BBC, is not expected to occur until 2030 at the earliest.</p>

          <p>A recent report on global university rankings highlights the significant and steady rise of Chinese institutions in academic research and reputation. According to the Best Global Universities list by U.S. News and World Report, Beijing's Tsinghua University has climbed to 11th place, with Peking University and Zhejiang University also making substantial gains to rank 25th and 45th, respectively. This marks a dramatic improvement from 2018, when only two Chinese universities were in the top 100. The success is attributed to decades of sustained national investment in higher education, student development, and the strategic recruitment of international academic talent, reflecting a major shift in the global academic landscape.</p>

          <p>Bob Becker, an 80-year-old runner from Fort Lauderdale, Florida, has made history by becoming the oldest person to ever complete the Badwater 135 ultramarathon. The grueling 135-mile race starts in Death Valley, 282 feet below sea level, and ascends to an elevation of 8,360 feet at the Mt. Whitney trailhead, with temperatures often exceeding 120°F. Becker finished the race with about three hours to spare before the 48-hour cutoff, a redemptive achievement after he narrowly missed the cutoff time in 2022. He credited his experienced coaching crew for his success, demonstrating that age is not a barrier to achieving extraordinary endurance feats.</p>

          <p>The Trump administration has announced that the U.S. dairy industry has voluntarily agreed to eliminate the use of synthetic dyes in ice cream. Health Secretary Robert F. Kennedy Jr. and representatives from the International Dairy Foods Association presented the agreement as a major step towards healthier food options. Over 40 ice cream companies have committed to the change. The announcement also included the FDA's approval of a new plant-based dye, "gardenia blue," as an alternative. This move continues the administration's pattern of working with industries on voluntary health-focused initiatives and aligns with its support for dairy products in national dietary guidelines.</p>

          <p>Social media platform Reddit is introducing age verification for its UK users to prevent minors from accessing mature content, in compliance with the country's new Online Safety Act. Starting this week, a third-party firm named Persona will verify users' ages by checking a government-issued ID or a selfie. Reddit stated it will not access the photo itself but will retain the user's verification status and date of birth. The new UK rules, which require sites with adult material to have robust age-checking systems, come into force on July 25. Regulator Ofcom expects other companies to adopt similar measures or face significant fines and potential business disruption.</p>
