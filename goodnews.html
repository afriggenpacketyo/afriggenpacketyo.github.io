        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>A notable political divide is emerging between young men and women in the UK, with polling suggesting young men increasingly lean rightward while young women adopt more liberal views. A 2025 survey revealed 20% of young British women identified as left-wing compared to 13% of young men, with significant support for the Green Party among women and Reform UK among men. Researchers attribute this growing trend to various factors, including higher education rates among women, where socially liberal attitudes are more prevalent, and the pervasive influence of social media. Experts suggest that some young men may be drawn to traditional masculinity, while young women are actively seeking a more progressive future.</p>

          <p>Pop star Katy Perry is preparing to testify in a protracted legal battle over her $15 million Montecito, California mansion, a case that has spanned years. The dispute originated when Carl Westcott, a U.S. Army veteran and founder of 1-800-Flowers, attempted to rescind his agreement to sell the property, asserting he lacked the mental capacity to sign the transaction due to a recent surgery and brain disorder. Although a judge previously ruled in favor of the sale, Perry is now counter-suing for damages, including those related to structural defects, deferred maintenance, and lost rental income. The non-jury trial will also involve Perry's ex-fiancé, Orlando Bloom, who has been subpoenaed to testify.</p>

This impressive victory, marking their 28th consecutive win, showcased dazzling performances from key players like Ellie Kildunne, who earned player of the match honors with two tries and two assists. Despite the dominant performance, head coach John Mitchell identified specific areas for improvement, including intricacies in midfield passes and applying greater defensive pressure. The team aims to build on this strong start, with upcoming pool matches against Samoa and Australia, as they pursue a path to the final at Twickenham's Allianz Stadium.</p>

          <p>Ether (ETH) reached a new record high, its first since 2021, following Federal Reserve Chair Jerome Powell's dovish speech hinting at potential rate cuts. Powell's remarks from Jackson Hole, Wyoming, reportedly caught traders off-guard, triggering significant short liquidations in the crypto market and fueling a "panicked repositioning." This surge underscores Ether's emerging leadership in the crypto market, driven by regulatory tailwinds and booming institutional interest around stablecoins, with Ethereum powering over half of them. Analysts suggest this momentum could continue, positioning Ether as a major macro trade for the coming 10 to 15 years, especially with Wall Street engaging blockchain. (not investment advice)</p>
