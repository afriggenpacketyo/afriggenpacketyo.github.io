          <p>Citigroup announced third-quarter earnings that surpassed Wall Street expectations, with every business division achieving record revenue. The bank's net income rose 15% to $3.8 billion, and overall revenues increased by 9%, driven by strong performance in its services, banking, and markets segments. CEO Jane Fraser attributed the success to strategic investments in new products, digital assets, and AI, which have enhanced the company's capabilities and are delivering consistent growth. The positive report caused Citigroup's shares to rise by over 4%. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>With silver prices reaching nearly $50 per ounce, investors are evaluating the easiest ways to liquidate their holdings for cash. This article explains that liquidity varies significantly depending on the form of the silver investment. Government-minted coins like American Silver Eagles are highly liquid due to their guaranteed purity and recognizability, while silver bars from reputable mints are also easy to sell. Other viable options include popular silver rounds, exchange-traded funds (ETFs) for immediate trading, and pre-1965 U.S. "junk silver" coins sold for their melt value. (not investment advice)</p>

Speaking at a conference, Powell noted that while the balance sheet runoff might stop in the coming months, the Fed has no plans to return to its smaller, pre-COVID size. He offered no new guidance on the future direction of interest rates but acknowledged that downside risks to employment appear to have increased, reinforcing the rationale for the recent quarter-point rate cut.</p>

          <p>A notable disconnect exists between the values of Gen Z employees and the expectations of hiring managers, according to recent research. The study found that Gen Z prioritizes self-care, authenticity, and helping others, whereas employers seek candidates who value achievement, learning, and hard work. This values gap has led some executives to label the generation as "unemployable." The article's author, a CEO and professor, advises young workers to be honest about their financial goals and, if necessary, strategically embrace more traditional work ethics for a period to build a career, suggesting a pragmatic approach to navigating this challenging landscape.</p>

          <p>The U.S. Supreme Court has rejected an appeal from conspiracy theorist Alex Jones, leaving in place the nearly $1.5 billion defamation judgment against him. Jones was ordered to pay the damages to families of the Sandy Hook Elementary School shooting victims for falsely claiming the 2012 massacre was a hoax. His lawyers had argued for First Amendment protections and claimed the financial penalty was excessive, but the court denied the request without comment. Jones, who has filed for bankruptcy, has not yet paid any of the damages he owes to the families.</p>

Governor Shapiro and his family were evacuated safely from the blaze, which was set hours after they had celebrated Passover. In a statement, Shapiro emphasized the importance of holding individuals accountable for acts of political violence and not allowing them to become normalized.</p>

          <p>A court has heard that a DNA test "conclusively proved" that Julia Wandelt, a woman who claimed to be the missing Madeleine McCann, is not the girl who vanished in 2007. This evidence was presented during the trial where Wandelt and a co-defendant are charged with stalking Madeleine's parents, Kate and Gerry McCann. The court was told that Wandelt had persistently contacted the McCanns with messages, calls, and even visited their home demanding a DNA test, causing them serious alarm and distress. The DNA sample was taken upon Wandelt's arrest, and the results confirmed she was not their missing daughter.</p>

          <p>Following the U.S.-brokered peace agreement for Gaza, the European Union is positioning itself to play a significant role beyond providing humanitarian aid. While European leaders were present at the signing, their involvement in negotiations was minimal, and they are now seeking a larger part in the plan's next phases. The EU has pledged substantial funding for Gaza's reconstruction and expressed readiness to contribute to a temporary international stabilization force. However, securing a seat on the so-called "Board of Peace" led by President Trump and committing troops remain points of discussion and potential disagreement among member states.</p>

          <p>Meta is rolling out new content settings for Instagram users under 18, designed to align their experience with a PG-13 movie rating standard. The accounts of teens will now default to a more restrictive setting, which blocks search results for sensitive topics like "gore" and prevents them from following or interacting with accounts that post age-inappropriate content. The new rules also apply to the platform's AI, ensuring it does not provide responses unsuitable for a younger audience. Parents will also have the option to choose an even more restrictive "Limited Content" setting for their teens.</p>
