          <p>Secretary of Agriculture Brooke Rollins testified that the USDA is actively recruiting to fill key positions after offering over 15,000 employees deferred resignations with salaries and benefits paid through September. Rollins stated that the department loses 8,000 to 10,000 employees annually through attrition, but Senator Patty Murray questioned the efficiency of letting experienced employees go only to seek replacements. Rollins invited some former employees to return and denied that key positions were accepted in the second round of the deferred resignation program, despite conflicting accounts from APHIS employees.</p>

          <p>Salt Lake City and Boise have adopted official pride flags to circumvent Republican-led state bans on flying "unofficial flags" on government property. Salt Lake City Mayor Erin Mendenhall introduced three new city flags featuring the city's sego lily design superimposed over a pride flag, a trans flag, and a Juneteenth flag. Boise Mayor Lauren McLean issued a proclamation making the pride flag an official city flag. These actions are a response to legislation restricting flag displays to state, US, and military flags.</p>

Nvidia welcomed the decision, stating it would allow America to lead the next industrial revolution.

          <p>The current charitable tax deduction system in the United States disproportionately benefits wealthy donors and the charities they support, according to this article. The author proposes replacing the deduction with a system where the government matches private donations or provides a tax credit based on the donation amount, not the donor's income. This change would create a more equitable system, removing the incentive for charities to prioritize wealthy donors over those in lower-income communities.</p>
