          <p>Musician Paul Simon has canceled two concerts on his tour due to chronic and intense back pain that has become unmanageable. The 83-year-old singer is scheduled to undergo a minor surgical procedure in the coming days to address the issue. This health concern follows his recent revelation of significant hearing loss in his left ear. Promoters are hopeful that Simon will be able to complete the remainder of his tour dates after the procedure and may reschedule the canceled shows.</p>
