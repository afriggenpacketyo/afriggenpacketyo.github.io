          <div class="timestamp">2025-08-14 18:00:08 EDT</div>
        </div>
        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>As economic growth slows and spending in China's major cities tightens, a new engine for consumption is emerging from the nation's smaller, lower-tier cities and counties. Residents in these areas are experiencing faster income growth and have lighter economic burdens, leading to increased purchasing power and a greater willingness to spend. This expanding middle class, with access to e-commerce, is driving a new wave of consumption, from electric vehicles to imported goods. Experts believe this untapped potential is crucial for China's shift towards a consumption-driven economic model, away from its traditional reliance on exports and investment.</p>

        </div>
        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>A U.S. district judge has invalidated two Trump administration directives that aimed to eliminate diversity, equity, and inclusion (DEI) initiatives at educational institutions by threatening to withdraw federal funding. Judge Stephanie Gallagher ruled that the Department of Education violated procedural law with memos that ordered an end to all "race-based decision-making." The ruling sided with plaintiffs like the American Federation of Teachers, who argued the policy created a chilling effect on lawful speech and educational practices. While not ruling on the merits of DEI itself, the judge found the administration's actions initiated a "sea change" in regulation without proper procedure, causing widespread fear and chaos among educators.</p>

          <p>While the consumer rollout of OpenAI's GPT-5 was met with criticism, the new AI model is rapidly gaining traction in the lucrative enterprise sector, challenging rival Anthropic's dominance. Startups and major companies like Box are adopting GPT-5, citing its superior performance on complex reasoning and coding tasks, faster setup, and significantly lower price point. This strategic push into the enterprise market is backed by OpenAI's growing sales team, operating independently of its key partner, Microsoft. Despite the high operational costs, OpenAI is aggressively working to secure long-term enterprise clients and build a sustainable business around its advanced AI technology.</p>

The King's message vows that the soldiers who fought and died in the Pacific and Far East will "never be forgotten." He and the Queen, along with Prime Minister Sir Keir Starmer, will attend a remembrance service to commemorate the estimated 71,000 British and Commonwealth soldiers who died in the war against Japan. The King's tribute will emphasize the importance of international collaboration in protecting freedom, echoing his grandfather King George VI's broadcast 80 years ago.</p>

          <p>A Texas state judge has appointed a receiver to seize and sell the assets of Alex Jones's company, Infowars, to help satisfy the more than $1 billion he owes to the families of Sandy Hook victims. The order allows the receiver to take control of Infowars' property and equipment, potentially shutting Jones out of his studio. This move comes after a federal bankruptcy judge's plan to auction the assets was derailed. Jones, who was found liable for defamation for calling the 2012 school shooting a hoax, has vowed to continue broadcasting from another location if he is locked out.</p>

          <p>A recent regulatory filing revealed that Warren Buffett's Berkshire Hathaway has acquired a new stake in the beleaguered health insurer UnitedHealth, purchasing over 5 million shares valued at around $1.6 billion. The move is characteristic of Buffett's bargain-hunting investment style, as UnitedHealth's stock had fallen nearly 50% this year amid public backlash over healthcare costs and a Justice Department investigation. Shares of the insurer jumped 6% in extended trading following the disclosure. Berkshire also reported new, smaller stakes in companies like Nucor and Lennar while slightly reducing its holdings in Apple and Bank of America. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>Since its 2020 public debut, AI software company Palantir has seen its stock surge over 1,700%, reaching a market valuation of over $430 billion. A key driver of this growth has been substantial government contracts, particularly with the U.S. military, which accounted for 55% of its revenue last quarter. Despite its astronomical rise and a valuation that dwarfs tech giants with far greater revenue, the company's commercial business is also showing strong growth. Investors are paying a significant premium for the stock, betting on its AI-powered tools, as reflected in its forward price-to-earnings ratio of over 280. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>David Zervos, chief market strategist at Jefferies and a potential candidate for Federal Reserve chair, has advocated for aggressive interest rate cuts to stimulate the economy. Arguing that current monetary policy is too restrictive, Zervos stated that the central bank should not be deterred by recent inflation data and should move to ease policy to prevent a labor market slowdown. Zervos, whose name has been added to a growing list of potential successors to Jerome Powell, believes his market-focused background would be a benefit to the Fed's decision-making process.
