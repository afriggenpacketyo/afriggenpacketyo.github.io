          <p>U.S. and Chinese trade officials are reportedly continuing negotiations in London, aiming to resolve trade differences after a recent call between the two countries' leaders. President Trump's trade officials, including Treasury Secretary Scott Bessent and Commerce Secretary Howard Lutnick, are meeting with their Chinese counterparts. Trump has reportedly authorized his team to consider easing U.S. restrictions on sales of chipmaking software, jet engine parts, and ethane. National Economic Council Director Kevin Hassett stated the U.S. seeks confirmation that China will restore the flow of critical minerals, anticipating a swift resolution following a handshake agreement.

          <p>New government guidance in England permits teachers to use artificial intelligence (AI) to expedite marking and compose letters to parents, aiming to free up time for face-to-face interaction with students. The Department for Education (DfE) emphasizes that AI should be used for low-stakes tasks and that teachers must verify the results. While the Association of School and College Leaders (ASCL) acknowledges the potential for AI to enhance teaching, concerns remain regarding data breaches and errors. Experts suggest teachers have a responsibility to learn how to use AI effectively, while cautioning against fully outsourcing tasks to AI.</p>

China mines about 70 percent of the world's rare earths, which are used in the production of smartphones, personal computers, and vehicles. (not investment advice)</p>
