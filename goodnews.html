          <p>A vote on a megabill intended to advance President Trump's agenda failed in the House Budget Committee due to opposition from Republican hard-liners. Representatives Andrew Clyde, Josh Brecheen, Lloyd Smucker, Ralph Norman, and Chip Roy voted against the bill, defying Trump and Speaker Mike Johnson, primarily because the majority of the savings would not take effect until after Trump's presidency. The House Freedom Caucus has stated they are prepared to continue negotiations throughout the weekend. House Republican leaders will continue to negotiate with holdouts behind closed doors, and the Budget Committee will reconvene on Sunday night.</p>

          <p>Oscar Piastri led Lando Norris in both Friday practice sessions at the Emilia-Romagna Grand Prix. Lewis Hamilton, in his first race for Ferrari in Italy, finished 11th in the second session after being fifth in the first. Pirelli has widened its range to six compounds this season, introducing a softest tyre that was originally intended only for street circuits, where tyre degradation is usually low. The first practice session had been brought to a premature end when Sauber's Gabriel Bortoleto crashed at the second Rivazza corner, flicking into the barriers pretty much front-on and damaging his front wing and nose.</p>

          <p>The Federal Reserve plans to reduce its headcount by 10% over the next couple of years, according to a memo from central bank chair Jerome Powell. The reduction will include offering deferred resignation to some older employees.

One method for shrinking the staff will be to offer a voluntary deferred resignation program to employees of the Federal Reserve Board who would be fully eligible to retire at the end of 2027.</p>
