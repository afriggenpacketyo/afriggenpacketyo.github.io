          <p>Tirso ‚ÄúTJ‚Äù Dominguez, Pablo Escobar's former cocaine pilot, recounted how he initially declined Escobar's employment offer because he was already earning $4 million a month. He was later swayed by Escobar's offer of $20 million monthly, leading to a lavish lifestyle involving numerous Lamborghinis and expensive attire. Dominguez's involvement in drug smuggling began after his father's death and subsequent financial struggles, eventually leading him to work exclusively for Escobar, later transitioning from smuggler to dealer. Now, at 73, Dominguez aspires to become a legitimate entrepreneur after serving over a decade in prison.</p>

          <p>Overcapacity in China's manufacturing sector is causing producer prices to stay in deflationary territory, leading to a flood of cheap exports into global markets. While this has raised concerns among Asian economies about squeezing local industries, economists suggest it could lower costs for consumers in inflation-worn economies. This influx of low-cost Chinese goods may offer central banks relief as they balance lowering living costs and reviving growth amid rising trade tensions. Nomura predicts that emerging growth risks and subdued inflation may lead to more rate cuts across Asia.</p>

          <p>Thomas Mann, a Nobel laureate and literary exile, is remembered as a cultural icon 150 years after his birth, with his work reflecting his life spent wandering between diverse worlds. Mann gained fame for novels like "Buddenbrooks" and "The Magic Mountain," and after escaping Nazi Germany, he wrote political essays and radio speeches against the dictatorship. He emigrated to the US in 1939 and called on Germans to resist, later returning to Switzerland where he died in 1955.

          <p>India's central bank exceeded market expectations by cutting its benchmark policy rate by 50 points, bringing it to 5.5%, the lowest since August 2022. RBI Governor Sanjay Malhotra cited softened inflation and lower growth aspirations as reasons for the move. Despite better-than-expected GDP growth in the fiscal fourth quarter, the central bank maintained its full-year GDP estimate at 6.5%. The RBI also revised its inflation outlook to 3.7% for the current financial year and shifted its monetary policy stance to "neutral" due to limited room for further support.</p>
