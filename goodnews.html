          <p>London's Royal Albert Hall is hosting the Grand Sumo Tournament, marking only the second time in the sport's 1,500-year history that the event has been held outside Japan. The competition features over 40 professional wrestlers, known as Rikishi, and required significant logistical efforts, including shipping 11 tons of special clay from Japan to construct the sacred ring, or dohyo. Organizers have worked to respect the deep cultural and religious Shinto traditions of sumo while making the competition accessible to a Western audience through English commentary and video replays. The five-day tournament highlights the sport's global reach, featuring competitors from various countries.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Recent polling indicates that while Democratic socialist Zohran Mamdani maintains a double-digit lead in the New York City mayoral race, his advantage has shrunk. Independent candidate and former Governor Andrew Cuomo has gained ground, largely absorbing support from former Mayor Eric Adams, who dropped out of the race. A Quinnipiac University survey places Mamdani at 46% among likely voters, with Cuomo at 33% and Republican Curtis Sliwa at 15%. Despite the tightening race, the poll also shows Mamdani's supporters are significantly more enthusiastic than those backing his rivals, setting the stage for a competitive final stretch before the election.</p>

Laplanche stated the new capital will strengthen the company's balance sheet and provide liquidity for employees as it eyes a potential IPO within the next 12 to 18 months, positioning itself to compete with both traditional banks and other fintech giants.

          <h2>Instagram's New Teen Settings Highlight Challenges of Creating an Age-Appropriate Internet</h2>

          <p>Instagram's new default setting for teen accounts, which limits content to a "PG-13" level, reflects a broader trend of tech platforms attempting to create a tiered, age-appropriate internet. This move aligns with legislative efforts like the Kids Online Safety Act (KOSA), which aim to protect young users from harmful content and addictive algorithms. However, creating these separate online experiences faces significant hurdles, particularly the difficulty of effective age verification, which raises privacy, security, and free speech concerns. While safer feeds for children are a positive step, the article suggests the challenge of policing an infinite content landscape remains immense.</p>

          <p>The New York City mayoral race is set for a televised debate featuring its three main candidates: Democratic socialist Zohran Mamdani, former Governor Andrew Cuomo running as an independent, and Republican Curtis Sliwa. Mamdani, a 33-year-old state assemblyman, is currently the frontrunner after a surprise primary win with a highly progressive platform. Cuomo, an established political figure, is aiming to attract moderate voters, while Sliwa's presence could further split the vote. The debate is a crucial opportunity for the candidates to address key issues like affordability and the city's budget deficit before the November election.</p>

          <p>Following the signing of a ceasefire plan between Israel and Hamas, Germany has outlined its role in supporting Gaza's future, focusing on humanitarian aid and reconstruction. German Chancellor Friedrich Merz confirmed that Germany will not send soldiers but has pledged an initial €29 million for immediate aid and promised a much larger, nine-figure sum for long-term rebuilding. Germany will also co-host a donor conference with Egypt to raise funds for the estimated $53 billion reconstruction effort. The ceasefire has also reignited debate within Germany over resuming full weapons exports to Israel, a decision the government is approaching cautiously.</p>

        </div>
        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Uruguay's senate has passed a law decriminalizing euthanasia, making it the first country in Latin America to do so through legislative action, rather than a court ruling. The law permits a healthcare professional to perform euthanasia for mentally competent adult patients suffering from an incurable illness that causes "unbearable suffering," without requiring a terminal diagnosis. The move reinforces Uruguay's reputation as one of the most socially liberal nations in the region, having previously legalized recreational marijuana, same-sex marriage, and abortion. The legislation was passed despite opposition from the Catholic Church in the highly secular country.</p>

          <p>The British Library has posthumously reissued a reader's card to acclaimed Irish writer Oscar Wilde, 130 years after his original was revoked following his 1895 conviction for "gross indecency." At the time, his library access was rescinded due to his imprisonment for homosexual relationships, which were then criminalized. The new card, accepted by his grandson Merlin Holland, is a symbolic gesture to "acknowledge the injustices and immense suffering" Wilde endured. Holland praised the act as one of forgiveness, honoring the legacy of the celebrated playwright whose original manuscripts are held in the library's collection.</p>

          <p>Albania's Prime Minister Edi Rama has appointed a virtual artificial intelligence entity named "Diella" as a cabinet minister, a world first. Originally a digital assistant on a government portal, Diella's promotion is intended to usher in an era of transparency and incorruptibility in public administration. However, the move has raised significant legal and ethical questions, as Albania's constitution requires ministers to be natural persons capable of bearing political responsibility. Critics argue the AI minister has no legal basis and may serve as a political distraction, while concerns remain about the lack of transparency regarding its code, data, and human oversight.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Investigators have revealed how they identified the suspects in what is believed to be the largest jewelry heist in U.S. history. The thieves, who stole up to $100 million in jewels from a Brink's big rig in 2022, were tracked using cell tower data from burner phones used during the operation. A critical mistake was made when one suspect gave his burner phone number to police after witnessing an unrelated traffic collision the night before the heist. This, combined with pings along the truck's route, allowed authorities to connect the suspects to the crime, leading to the indictment of seven men from the Los Angeles area.</p>

          <p>Californians are participating in the annual ShakeOut drill to practice safety measures for the inevitable "Big One." Experts emphasize the "drop, cover, and hold on" technique as the safest response, noting that most injuries in past major quakes were caused by falling objects. The drill also serves as a reminder for residents to secure their homes by strapping down furniture and water heaters, and to consider seismic retrofits for older buildings. Officials are encouraging the use of the MyShake app, which can provide crucial seconds of early warning before shaking begins, allowing people time to take protective action.</p>

          <p>Governor Gavin Newsom has signed a bill designed to accelerate the study of psychedelic drugs for treating PTSD, depression, and other mental health conditions, a move strongly backed by veterans' advocacy groups. The new law, AB 1103, streamlines the approval process within California for studies on Schedule 1 drugs like ibogaine and psilocybin that have already received FDA approval. This aims to remove bureaucratic delays from the state's Research Advisory Panel, which has previously held up research. Proponents, including former Navy SEALs, argue that these therapies show immense promise for veterans struggling with trauma where conventional treatments have failed.</p>
