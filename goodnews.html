        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>China's Zhiyuan Research Institute has unveiled the world's first tri-ducted wearable electric vertical takeoff and landing (eVTOL) aircraft, designed for individual use. The aircraft features a tri-ducted propulsion system for stability and efficiency, along with a one-click separation system and low-altitude parachute for safety. Zhiyuan envisions the eVTOL being used in emergency rescues, infrastructure maintenance, sightseeing, and border patrol. This development is part of China's growing ‚Äúlow-altitude economy,‚Äù with the government supporting commercial spaceflight and next-generation air mobility technologies.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Home Depot CFO Ted McPhail announced that the retailer will not raise prices due to tariffs, citing its scale, supplier partnerships, and productivity. More than half of Home Depot's sales originate in the U.S., and the company has diversified its import sources to reduce reliance on any single country. This strategy contrasts with Walmart's plan to increase prices in response to tariffs. While Home Depot missed first-quarter earnings expectations, it beat sales estimates and reaffirmed its full-year forecast, indicating confidence in its ability to navigate the challenging economic landscape.

        </div>
        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>The American College of Obstetricians and Gynecologists (ACOG) has released new recommendations emphasizing the urgent need for better pain management during in-office gynecological procedures like IUD insertions and cervical biopsies. ACOG directs clinicians to have thorough conversations with patients about potential pain and offer options like paracervical blocks and topical anesthetics. The guidelines aim to address historical inequalities in pain treatment and improve patient experiences, aligning with recent CDC guidance on shared decision-making and pain management. This shift reflects growing awareness of patient autonomy and the importance of addressing pain in gynecological care.</p>

          <p>Leicester City has been referred to an independent commission by the Premier League for an alleged breach of EFL financial rules during the 2023-24 season when they were in the Championship. While a tribunal ruled the Premier League couldn't punish the club for breaching Premier League rules in 2022-23 due to their relegation, it confirmed the league's jurisdiction to investigate the EFL breach. The commission will also assess alleged failures to provide accounts and cooperate with inquiries. Leicester intends to cooperate with the investigation.</p>

          <p>Acclaimed Russian ballet choreographer Yuri Grigorovich has died at the age of 98. Grigorovich was the artistic director of the Bolshoi Ballet from 1964 to 1995, revitalizing male dance and redefining Soviet ballet with productions like "Ivan the Terrible" and "Romeo and Juliet". His departure from the Bolshoi in 1995 led to the first-ever dancers' strike at the theatre. His work was steeped in the traditions of classical ballet, and he created parts for men demanding exceptional strength and artistry.</p>

          <p>Astronomers are warning of increased solar activity over the coming days and weeks as an active region of the Sun rotates into view, potentially causing auroras and blackouts on Earth. NASA's Solar Dynamics Observatory recently captured the most powerful eruption of 2025, an X2.7 flare, which triggered radio blackouts across parts of the Middle East. Ongoing flares and solar eruptions from this region could impact radio communications, electric power grids, navigation signals, and spacecraft. The Met Office notes that the most active region on the Sun is currently rotating to face Earth, leading to forecasts of more significant space weather.</p>

          <p>NASA engineers successfully revived dormant thrusters on Voyager 1 after a broken thruster jeopardized the spacecraft's ability to communicate with Earth. Faced with a ground-based radio antenna shutdown, engineers revisited the primary roll thrusters, dormant for two decades, and managed to reactivate them. This remote fix ensures Voyager 1's antenna remains pointed at Earth, allowing the mission to continue. The Voyager team remains optimistic about keeping the two spacecraft operational long enough to celebrate their 50th anniversary in 2027.</p>
