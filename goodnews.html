        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Media executive Barry Diller's new memoir, "Who Knew," explores his career and emphasizes the importance of instinct over relying solely on data when making creative and business decisions. Diller recounts his time at ABC, where he helped popularize the "Movie of the Week," and shares anecdotes about trusting his gut when selecting projects like "Brian's Song" and "The Night Stalker." He argues that too much information can overload and obscure the essence of a good idea, and that simple human instinct is often a better predictor of success.</p>

          <p>Google has agreed to pay nearly $1.4 billion to the state of Texas to settle allegations of violating users' data privacy rights, according to Texas Attorney General Ken Paxton. The lawsuit, filed in 2022, accused Google of unlawfully tracking and collecting users' private data, and the settlement covers allegations related to Chrome's incognito mode, location history on Google Maps, and biometric claims related to Google Photos. While Google did not admit wrongdoing, the settlement follows a similar $1.4 billion settlement with Meta and resolves several old claims related to product policies the company has already changed.</p>

          <p>Elana Cohen-Roth, a retired IRS agent from Southern California, has been sentenced to 12 years in prison for defrauding an elderly woman in Sonoma County out of $1 million in life savings. Cohen-Roth, who began preparing the victim's taxes in 2013, gained her trust and offered fraudulent "investment opportunities" promising high returns with no risk. Prosecutors revealed Cohen-Roth was running a Ponzi scheme, using money from new "investors" to pay off earlier ones and fund a lavish lifestyle, ultimately leaving the victim financially destitute.</p>

          <p>Climate change is altering bird migration patterns, affecting their ability to feed and breed successfully. Rising sea levels are impacting coastal stopover locations, while ocean acidification threatens the crustaceans that migratory birds rely on for food. Extreme weather events and warmer temperatures are also influencing migration routes, leading to conflicts with resident animals. While humans often feed birds, it can do more harm than good, so wildlife experts recommend expanding protected areas and creating bird-friendly habitats to help migratory birds on their journeys.</p>
