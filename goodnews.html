          <p>David Gergen, a distinguished political analyst and adviser who served in the White House for four presidents from both parties, has passed away at the age of 83 after a long illness. Gergen's career spanned the administrations of Richard Nixon, Gerald Ford, Ronald Reagan, and Bill Clinton, where he held roles such as communications director and presidential counselor. He was widely respected for his character, integrity, and commitment to bipartisanship. In addition to his public service, Gergen was a senior political analyst for CNN and the founding director of the Center for Public Leadership at Harvard's Kennedy School.</p>

          <p>A judge has denied TikTok's motion to dismiss a lawsuit filed by the state of New Hampshire, allowing the case to move forward. The lawsuit alleges that the social media company knowingly uses manipulative and addictive design features to exploit its younger users, keeping them engaged longer for commercial purposes. The state's Attorney General hailed the decision as a key step toward holding the platform accountable for practices that put children at risk. This case is one of several recent legal challenges by states targeting the design of tech platforms rather than user-generated content, focusing on their potential harm to youth mental health.</p>

          <p>Google has hired Varun Mohan, the co-founder and CEO of AI coding startup Windsurf, along with other senior members of his team, in a deal that underscores the intense competition for top AI talent. While not a full acquisition of the company, Google will gain a nonexclusive license to some of Windsurf's technology, which is popular for its "vibe coding" tools. The move, often termed an "acquihire," allows Google to absorb specialized expertise to advance its own AI projects, particularly within its DeepMind division. This follows a trend of major tech companies like Meta and Microsoft making similar talent-focused deals.</p>
