          <p>Walmart has announced that consumers should expect to see price increases on certain items due to tariffs, despite recent temporary tariff reductions on Chinese imports. CFO John David Rainey explained that the company will absorb some costs but shoppers will likely see increases starting late May, with more significant markups expected in the fiscal second quarter. CEO Doug McMillon mentioned that tariffs on countries like Costa Rica and Colombia have already impacted prices on items like bananas, avocados, and coffee, and that Walmart is exploring alternative materials and sourcing locations to mitigate the tariff impact. Walmart believes its value proposition could attract more shoppers during times of higher prices. (not investment advice)</p>

Following the speech, the student's profile on the NYU Gallatin website was removed, and the university is pursuing disciplinary actions. This incident follows previous controversies at NYU, including updated student conduct guidelines that include "code words, like 'Zionist'" as examples of discriminatory speech.</p>

Despite being known for his sports opinions, Smith's political thrill-seeking reflects the blurring lines between news and entertainment, and the Democratic Party's efforts to connect with a wider audience. He has said he is considering a 2028 run, claiming that politicos, strangers and his pastor have encouraged him.</p>

          <p>Federal Reserve Chair Jerome Powell warned that the U.S. could face more frequent and persistent supply shocks, posing challenges for the economy and central banks. This comes after the Fed decided to hold interest rates steady amidst economic uncertainty, partly due to the Trump administration's tariff policies. Powell noted that longer-term interest rates are higher now and cautioned that higher real rates could lead to greater inflation volatility. He made these comments as the administration negotiates trade deals ahead of the lifting of the tariff pause in July.</p>

          <p>The Food and Drug Administration announced it will work to remove fluoride supplements for children from the market, citing potential health risks such as alterations to the gut microbiome and possible links to lower I.Q., despite limited rigorous research supporting these claims. This decision coincides with several states restricting fluoride use in public water supplies. Experts argue that the move is not based on strong evidence and that fluoride supplements provide a valuable level of protection against tooth decay for children in areas without fluoridated water. The FDA plans to review the safety of ingestible fluoride products by October 31.</p>

          <p>Patrick McGee's "Apple in China" argues that Apple's decision to manufacture most of its products in China has created an existential vulnerability for the company and the United States. The book highlights how Apple has trained millions of Chinese workers and transferred technology, enabling China to advance its own technology sector. McGee contends that China wouldn't be where it is today without Apple's investment and training, but that Xi Jinping's consolidation of power has made this relationship increasingly problematic. The review notes that McGee's reporting is meticulous and his conclusion is startling.</p>

          <p>The Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) is investigating whether Coinbase, the largest U.S. cryptocurrency exchange, misstated its user numbers in past disclosures. The investigation, which began during the Biden administration and has continued under President Trump, focuses on the company's claim of having over 100 million "verified users." Coinbase has hired legal counsel and is cooperating with the SEC, which has dropped several lawsuits against crypto firms since Trump took office. The company also revealed it was the victim of a data breach.</p>

          <p>China has temporarily lifted export restrictions on 28 American companies following a trade truce with the Trump administration, but continues to block exports of seven rare earth metals to the United States. These metals are crucial for U.S. defense, energy, and automotive industries, and are viewed by Beijing as leverage in trade negotiations. The Chinese Commerce Ministry's statement emphasized the need for broader government control of the metals for national security, while a social media account linked to CCTV hinted at their importance around trade talks.</p>

          <p>Warner Bros. Discovery announced that the streaming service Max will revert to its original name, HBO Max, two years after the name change. Executives hope that the return of the HBO brand will drive the service forward and emphasize the unique, high-quality content subscribers expect. The 2022 name change, following the merger of WarnerMedia and Discovery, was intended to reflect a broader mix of programming, but it never gained traction. The rebrand is slated for this summer, with no announced changes to pricing or subscription tiers.</p>

          <h2>Trump Expresses Desire for Twin-Engine Version of F-35 Fighter Jet</h2>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>President Trump stated that he wants the United States to develop a twin-engine version of the F-35 Joint Strike Fighter, dubbed the F-55, citing a preference for two engines over one for safety. The concept raises questions about the future of both the F-35 and the F-47, the Air Force's next-generation crewed stealth fighter. The development could involve engines from the Next Generation Adaptive Propulsion (NGAP) program, and would require a redesign of the F-35 airframe. While a twin-engine design could increase performance and payload, it would also add weight and cost.</p>

          <p>Donald Trump Jr. has transitioned into a prominent Washington figure since his father won the 2024 election, joining multiple corporate boards and becoming a key representative of the MAGA base.
