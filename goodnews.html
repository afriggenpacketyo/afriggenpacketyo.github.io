          <p>A recent Kyodo News survey reveals that nearly 60% of Japanese citizens anticipate a decline in rice prices following the appointment of a new farm minister, Shinjiro Koizumi.

The poll also indicates that 44.7% believe rice prices should fall below 3,000 yen per 5 kg, contrasting with the government's pledged target.

          <p>Ozeki Onosato won the Emperor's Cup with a 14-1 record at the Summer Grand Sumo Tournament, despite losing his final match to yokozuna Hoshoryu. Onosato had already secured consecutive championships and promotion to yokozuna prior to the final bout. The Japan Sumo Association is expected to recommend Onosato's promotion to yokozuna, making him the fastest to reach the rank under the modern six-tournament calendar. Hoshoryu's victory improved his head-to-head record against Onosato.</p>
