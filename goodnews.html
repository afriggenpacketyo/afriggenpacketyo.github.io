          <p>The government is set to unveil a 10-year industrial strategy focused on lowering energy costs for thousands of UK businesses, potentially slashing energy bills by up to 25% for over 7,000 firms. The plan involves exempting businesses from some green energy levies through a new British Industrial Competitiveness Scheme, set to begin in 2027. The strategy also includes measures to speed up connections to the energy grid and support the creation of over one million new jobs over the next decade. While some business groups welcome the plan, others, particularly in the retail and leisure sectors, express disappointment over their exclusion. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>Texas Governor Greg Abbott vetoed a bill that would have banned all THC consumables, allowing the state's booming market of THC-infused products to continue. The bill would have made it a misdemeanor to own, manufacture, or sell consumable THC products, representing one of the most restrictive THC bans in the country. Critics argued the ban would limit access for those unable to obtain marijuana through the state's medical program, while supporters cited concerns about the lack of federal oversight. The veto preserves the legal access to THC products in Texas, which offers a similar high to marijuana, despite the state's strict marijuana laws.</p>

Dozens of plans under insurers like CVS Health, UnitedHealthcare, and Cigna have committed to implementing changes across markets, including establishing a common standard for electronic submissions by 2027. The goal is to have at least 80% of electronic prior authorization approvals answered in real-time and to reduce the types of claims subject to prior authorization requests by 2026. The move is expected to benefit 257 million Americans and builds on previous efforts to simplify the process.</p>

Ticks can carry various disease-causing agents, with Lyme disease being the most common tick-borne illness in the U.S. Risks vary by region, with the Northeast, Mid-Atlantic, and Upper Midwest having the highest incidence of tick bites and Lyme disease, while the South is more concerned with ehrlichiosis and Alpha-gal syndrome. Experts recommend careful tick checks, using insect repellents, and seeking medical care if symptoms develop, as tick-borne diseases are spreading to new areas due to climate change and reforestation.</p>

          <p>Prescriptions for the weight loss injection Mounjaro will be available at GP surgeries in England starting today, but only for individuals meeting very strict criteria. Mounjaro, initially licensed for type 2 diabetes, helps with weight loss by making people feel full, leading to reduced eating and potential 20% body weight loss. NHS England emphasizes a phased approach to reach those most in need, manage GP workload, and conserve NHS resources, and patients will receive wrap-around care including check-ups and exercise support. The trade association for large pharmacies cautions that the planned GP provision might not meet patient demand, and some GP practices have indicated that very few patients on their lists will initially qualify for the medicine.</p>
