          <h2>Semaglutide Shows Promise in Reversing Liver Disease in Clinical Trial</h2>
          <div class="timestamp">2025-05-03 05:00:56 EDT</div>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>A new clinical trial published in The New England Journal of Medicine reveals that semaglutide injections can reverse life-threatening cases of liver disease. The drug, traditionally used for type 2 diabetes, was administered to participants diagnosed with metabolic dysfunction-associated steatohepatitis (MASH). After 72 weeks, 62.9% of participants experienced reduced inflammation and fat accumulation in their livers, compared to only 34.3% in the placebo group. While some adverse effects like nausea and diarrhea were more common in the semaglutide group, researchers are optimistic about its potential as a new treatment option for fatty liver disease.</p>

          <p>Five people survived for 36 hours in an alligator-infested swamp in the Amazon after their plane made an emergency landing due to engine failure. The pilot, Andres Velarde, managed to land the plane near the Itanomas River, where they were surrounded by alligators. The survivors stood on top of the plane, eating cassava flour while awaiting rescue. Fishermen eventually discovered the craft, leading to a helicopter rescue and transport to a hospital.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>South Korea and Turkey are poised to join the elite ranks of countries producing 5th-generation fighter jets, challenging the existing monopoly held by superpowers. South Korea's KF-21, while currently a 4.5-generation fighter, is planned for upgrade to full stealth capabilities, while Turkey's TAI TF Kaan is claimed to be a fully fledged stealth fighter. These developments could make advanced stealth aircraft more accessible to countries previously unable to acquire them due to cost and geopolitical constraints. This shift may signal a future where more nations, including those not traditionally considered global powers, possess advanced, undetectable aircraft.</p>

          <h2>Singapore Holds Elections Amid Trade Tensions</h2>
          <div class="timestamp">2025-05-03 03:55:00 EDT</div>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Singapore held general elections amid concerns over potential trade disruptions stemming from U.S. tariffs. Prime Minister Lawrence Wong faces his first major test as the People's Action Party (PAP) seeks to maintain its long-standing dominance against a rejuvenated opposition. The election serves as a gauge of Wong's leadership and the PAP's popularity, particularly in light of economic uncertainties and rising living costs. While the PAP is expected to retain power, the opposition aims to increase its representation in Parliament and provide greater scrutiny of government policies.</p>

          <h2>Man's Antivenom Research Yields 'Unparalleled' Results</h2>
          <div class="timestamp">2025-05-03 02:29:15 EDT</div>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Scientists have developed an 'unparalleled' antivenom using the blood of a US man, Tim Friede, who has been deliberately injecting himself with snake venom for nearly two decades. Antibodies in Friede's blood have demonstrated protection against fatal doses from various venomous snakes in animal tests. Current antivenoms are species-specific, but Friede's mission could lead to a universal antivenom, potentially saving thousands of lives annually. Friede's dedication stems from a desire to improve snakebite treatments, particularly for those in remote areas.</p>

          <p>The Hong Kong Monetary Authority (HKMA) intervened in the financial market to manage the Hong Kong dollar's appreciation against the U.S. dollar. The intervention was triggered by a surge in capital inflow ahead of a potential U.S. Federal Reserve interest rate cut. The HKMA bought US$6.005 billion and sold HK$46.539 billion to maintain the local currency's trading band. This action underscores the challenges Hong Kong faces in managing its currency amid global economic shifts and capital flows.</p>
