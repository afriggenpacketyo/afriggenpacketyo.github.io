          <p>A runway at Newark Liberty International Airport, which had been closed for renovations, reopened nearly two weeks ahead of schedule, aiming to alleviate recent flight delays and cancellations. The temporary closure of runway 4L-22R in mid-April had left only two other runways operational, leading to flight restrictions. The Port Authority accelerated the construction schedule, hiring additional crews and coordinating with contractors to complete the project ahead of the original June 15 deadline. The FAA is working to certify the runway for arriving flights, which would further increase the airport's capacity, and while the runway is open, some weeknight and weekend closures are still expected to fully complete the project by the end of the year.</p>

          <p>The Supreme Court has declined to hear an appeal from gun rights advocates seeking to overturn Maryland's ban on assault-style rifles and high-capacity magazines, leaving in place a ruling that the state can prohibit the sale and possession of these weapons. Justices Alito, Gorsuch, and Thomas dissented, stating they would have taken up the case, and Justice Kavanaugh agreed with the decision but called the appeals court ruling "questionable." Maryland enacted the legislation in 2013 after the Sandy Hook elementary school shooting, and officials credit a series of gun control measures with a decline in gun violence in the state.</p>
