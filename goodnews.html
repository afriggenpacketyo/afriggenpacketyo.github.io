          <p>Texas megachurch Gateway Church has installed Pastor Daniel Floyd as its new lead pastor, aiming to begin a new chapter following a major scandal. The move comes fourteen months after founding pastor Robert Morris stepped down amid allegations of child sexual abuse, for which he now faces criminal charges in Oklahoma. In his first sermon, Floyd promised to lead with integrity and vision, while the church continues to navigate multiple lawsuits related to the scandal. The transition represents an effort by the prominent church to move forward and rebuild trust with its large congregation.</p>

Now 91, Dwight recently became the oldest person to travel to space and is also a renowned sculptor with over 130 memorials dedicated to Black history. Despite being selected for astronaut training by President John F. Kennedy in 1961, he faced prejudice that led him to resign from the program. His remarkable life of perseverance, entrepreneurship, and artistic contribution is being recognized through this proposed honor.</p>

          <p>Spending by Premier League clubs during the summer transfer window is projected to set a new record, already reaching £2.26 billion with two weeks remaining. This figure surpasses last year's total and is expected to exceed the all-time high of £2.36 billion set in 2023. The data reveals that English top-flight clubs have outspent the combined total of Serie A, Bundesliga, Ligue 1, and La Liga. This financial dominance is further highlighted by the fact that six clubs have broken their own transfer records this summer, underscoring the immense financial power of the league.

The study, published in JAMA Network Open, found that nearly a third of users of the OTC pill, Opill, had not been using any form of contraception before. Those accessing the pill without a prescription were more likely to be uninsured, younger, and living in rural areas. These findings suggest that removing the prescription barrier is effectively helping to expand reproductive healthcare access for populations facing the greatest obstacles to care.</p>

          <p>Los Angeles Rams quarterback Matthew Stafford participated in practice for the first time since the beginning of training camp. The 37-year-old veteran had been sidelined with a back issue but was a full participant in both individual and team drills with the first-team offense on Monday. Head coach Sean McVay confirmed Stafford's return but stated that the team would continue to monitor his condition on a day-to-day basis. Stafford's recovery is a crucial development for the Rams as they prepare for their season opener against the Houston Texans.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>The article explains the advantages of using dividend reinvestment plans (DRIPs) as a strategy to enhance investment returns through the power of compound interest. A DRIP automatically uses the cash dividends paid by a stock to purchase more shares of that same stock, often including fractional shares. This passive approach ensures that money is consistently put to work, accelerating portfolio growth over the long term. Using the S&P 500 ETF (SPY) as an example, the article demonstrates that reinvesting dividends resulted in a total return of 239% over a decade, compared to 185% from price appreciation alone.

          <p>Ismael "El Mayo" Zambada, a long-time and influential leader of Mexico's Sinaloa cartel, is scheduled to plead guilty in a U.S. federal court to extensive drug trafficking charges. The indictment accuses the 77-year-old of overseeing a global criminal enterprise responsible for smuggling vast quantities of narcotics into the U.S. and committing acts of violence, including murder and torture. Zambada's change of plea comes after prosecutors confirmed they would not seek the death penalty. His conviction would mark a major victory for U.S. law enforcement in its decades-long effort to dismantle the powerful cartel.</p>

          <h2>Expert Guidance on Determining the Optimal Age for a Reverse Mortgage</h2>
          <div class="timestamp">2025-08-18 13:01:47 EDT</div>
        </div>
        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Financial experts suggest that the best age to take out a reverse mortgage depends on an individual's specific circumstances, including health, long-term goals, and immediate income needs. While homeowners can qualify at age 62, waiting until their late 60s or early 70s often allows them to access a larger portion of their home equity. A reverse mortgage can provide a crucial income stream for retirees on a fixed budget by eliminating mortgage payments and providing tax-free funds. However, it's essential to consider that this reduces the home's equity, impacting potential inheritances and funds available if one needs to move later. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>Manchester United manager Ruben Amorim staunchly defended his decision to start goalkeeper Altay Bayindir over André Onana in the team's recent match against Arsenal. During a tense post-match press conference, Amorim pushed back against questions about his choice, explaining that Bayindir had performed well during the preseason while Onana was recovering from an injury. The manager's forceful rebuttal was compared to tactics used by former manager Sir Alex Ferguson to protect players and create a unified team mentality. The decision and subsequent defense highlight the pressure and scrutiny involved in managing a top-tier football club.</p>

          <p>State health officials have officially declared that the measles outbreak in Texas, which began in January and resulted in 762 confirmed cases, is over. The declaration was made after 42 days—double the disease's maximum incubation period—passed without a new reported case in affected counties. The outbreak predominantly affected children, and tragically, two unvaccinated children died from the virus. The Texas Department of State Health Services credited a comprehensive public health response for containing the highly contagious disease but urged continued vigilance as measles outbreaks persist elsewhere in the U.S.</p>

          <p>The cable news channel MSNBC is set to change its name to MS NOW and will no longer use the iconic NBC peacock logo. This rebranding is part of a larger corporate restructuring, as MSNBC and other NBCUniversal channels like CNBC and USA are being spun off into a new independent company called Versant. The new name, which stands for My Source News Opinion World, is intended to establish a separate identity for the brand. The change marks a significant shift for the channel, which was founded nearly 30 years ago as a partnership between Microsoft (MS) and NBC.</p>
