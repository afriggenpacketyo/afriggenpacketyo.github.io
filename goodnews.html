          <p>Shares of identity management software firm CyberArk surged following a report that it is in acquisition talks with cybersecurity giant Palo Alto Networks. The potential deal, valued at over $20 billion, would be Palo Alto's largest ever and highlights a trend of consolidation within the increasingly critical cloud security industry. This move comes amid a series of major acquisitions in the sector, as companies bolster their defenses against new threats posed by artificial intelligence and ransomware.</p>

          <p>Despite recent interest rate cuts, opening a certificate of deposit (CD) account could still be a strategic move for savers. Current rates remain competitive, often in the 4% to 4.5% range, offering consistent returns on deposits. With no Federal Reserve meeting in August, savers have a stable window to lock in these rates before potential further cuts in September. This period may represent a final opportunity to secure higher yields before monetary policy potentially eases again. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>The University of California, Los Angeles (UCLA) has agreed to a nearly $6.5 million settlement in a lawsuit filed by Jewish students who alleged the university permitted antisemitic discrimination during pro-Palestinian campus protests. The suit claimed protesters blocked Jewish students from accessing parts of campus, an issue for which the university admitted it had "fallen short." The settlement includes payments to Jewish community groups, an anti-antisemitism initiative, and the individual plaintiffs.</p>

          <p>Manchester City has re-signed goalkeeper James Trafford from Burnley for a reported fee of £27 million plus add-ons, just a year after he left the club.
