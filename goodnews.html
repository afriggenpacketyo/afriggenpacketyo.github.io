          <p>A child life specialist and therapist shares six strategies for parents to build trust with their children. These include normalizing discussions about feelings, not avoiding difficult topics, being honest about personal challenges, modeling behavior instead of interrogating, making real talk part of the routine, and teaching coping strategies. The expert emphasizes that trust is built through consistent, small moments of open communication and emotional vulnerability. Creating a safe space for children to express themselves is crucial for fostering a strong and trusting relationship.</p>

Yurong ‚ÄúLuanna‚Äù Jiang, the first Chinese woman selected as a student speaker at a Harvard graduation ceremony, delivered her emotional address on the same day a federal judge blocked a Department of Homeland Security order seeking to prevent the Ivy League university from enrolling international students. The US State Department announced last week that it would intensify screening and ‚Äúaggressively‚Äù revoke student visas for Chinese nationals, including ‚Äúthose with connections to the Chinese Communist Party or studying in critical fields‚Äù.</p>

          <p>Researchers in China have created an infrared contact lens that enables humans to see in the dark by converting infrared light into visible light. The lenses combine conventional soft contact lenses with nanoparticles made of gold, sodium gadolinium fluoride, ytterbium, and erbium ions. These upconversion contact lenses (UCLs) convert infrared light with wavelengths between 800 and 1,600 nanometers into visible light. While the resulting images are somewhat blurred, the lenses allow users to recognize patterns, letters, and flashing infrared signals in the dark, and work even better with closed eyes.</p>
