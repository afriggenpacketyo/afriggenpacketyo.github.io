          <p>An international team of astronomers has discovered a strange object in the Milky Way galaxy emitting both X-rays and radio waves in a repeating cycle. The object, located 15,000 light-years away, emits these signals every 44 minutes, leading scientists to describe it as unlike any known Galactic object. It could be a highly magnetized dead star or something entirely new, according to Ziteng Andy Wang of Curtin University, lead author of the study. NASA's Chandra X-ray Observatory first spotted the X-ray emissions while observing a supernova remnant, marking the first time X-rays have been seen from a long-period radio transient.</p>

          <p>Renewed discussions about reviving the cancelled Constitution Pipeline are pitting Republican President Donald Trump against Democratic New York Governor Kathy Hochul, with Coterra Energy potentially benefiting. The pipeline, which met opposition during Trump's first term, could provide Coterra with easier and more cost-effective transportation of natural gas. Coterra CEO Tom Jorden stated that the company is seriously participating in the pipeline conversation, and if built, Coterra would commit to delivering long-term volumes into the line. The article explains that the financial benefits could boost Coterra shares, as the company shifts its focus towards natural gas due to positive macro conditions. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>Toyota Motor is targeting growth in plug-in hybrid electric vehicles (PHEVs) as a strategy. PHEVs are able to function as all-electric vehicles for a certain number of miles. Toyota plans to increase PHEVs from 2.4% of its U.S. sales volume last year to roughly 20% by 2030, although this could change based on regulations, customer acceptance of electrified technologies and affordability, among other factors. The article explains that Toyota's PHEV expansion comes amid regulatory uncertainty and slower-than-expected adoption of all-electric vehicles, which the company also continues to invest billions of dollars in annually.</p>
