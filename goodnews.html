          <p>David Gergen, a distinguished political adviser who served in the administrations of four U.S. presidents—Nixon, Ford, Reagan, and Clinton—has passed away at the age of 83 after a long illness. Known for his bipartisan approach and integrity, Gergen held various roles, including communications director and presidential counselor. Beyond his government service, he was a prominent media analyst for CNN and the founding director of the Center for Public Leadership at the Harvard Kennedy School. Colleagues and political figures like Al Gore remembered him for his kindness, sound judgment, and dedication to public service.</p>

          <p>The Wimbledon women's final will feature a compelling matchup between five-time Grand Slam champion Iga Swiatek and Amanda Anisimova, a former prodigy making a powerful return to the sport. While Swiatek holds the edge in major finals experience, her relationship with grass courts has been historically uneasy, potentially creating an opening for Anisimova. Analysts suggest Anisimova's aggressive, free-swinging style could thrive in an underdog role with less pressure. The final will mark their first professional tour-level meeting and will crown a first-time Wimbledon women's singles champion for the eighth consecutive year, highlighting the unpredictability of the grass-court season.</p>

          <h2>Australian Prime Minister Articulates 'Australia First' Foreign Policy Amid US-China Tensions</h2>
          <div class="timestamp">2025-07-11 20:00:12 EDT</div>
        </div>
        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Australian Prime Minister Anthony Albanese is charting a more independent foreign policy course, emphasizing national sovereignty in an era of heightened US-China rivalry. In a recent speech invoking wartime leader John Curtin, Albanese signaled a doctrine of "Australia first," aiming to shape the nation's own future rather than simply aligning with tradition or larger powers. This recalibration comes as his government faces domestic debate over the AUKUS security pact and defense spending. While maintaining the US alliance as a pillar of security, the new approach suggests a more assertive and self-determined posture for Australia on the global stage.</p>

          <p>Justin Bieber has released a surprise 21-track album titled "Swag," his first since 2021, marking a return to his R&B-infused "R&Bieber" sound. The album's lyrics directly address the intense public scrutiny of his life, including rumors about his marriage to Hailey Bieber, whom he reaffirms his commitment to on the track "Walking Away." Other songs celebrate his wife's success and their journey into parenthood with their son, Jack. The project also incorporates viral moments of his recent paparazzi encounters, turning his much-memed "standing on business" phrase into a theme of confronting the pressures of fame head-on.</p>

          <p>Viraj Dhanda, a 19-year-old with non-speaking autism and apraxia, has been accepted to the Massachusetts Institute of Technology (MIT) after his father discovered a way for him to communicate. For 14 years, Viraj was unable to speak or type, leading many to assume he was severely mentally disabled. However, his father, Sumit, realized Viraj could type using his right thumb on an iPad, revealing a brilliant mind. In less than three years, Viraj progressed from basic math to calculus, achieved a near-perfect ACT score, and graduated high school, aiming to be an inspiration for the entire non-speaking autistic community.</p>

          <p>One year after the attempted assassination of President Trump in Butler, Pennsylvania, the U.S. Secret Service is showcasing enhanced security protocols. The agency has deployed a fleet of military-grade drones to improve aerial surveillance, addressing a key failure from the Butler incident where the shooter operated a drone undetected. Additionally, new mobile command posts, costing up to $1.5 million each, have been established to ensure direct and reliable radio communication between Secret Service agents and local law enforcement. These upgrades, along with the suspension of six personnel, are part of the agency's effort to prevent a repeat of the security lapses.</p>

          <p>Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky has confirmed that the United States has resumed sending military supplies to Ukraine, following a temporary halt on some critical arms shipments last week. The renewal of aid includes a deal for NATO to purchase and provide U.S.-made Patriot air defense systems, which are crucial for intercepting Russian missiles. This comes as Russia has escalated its aerial assaults on Ukrainian cities, causing record civilian casualties in June. The U.S. is also encouraging European allies to send their existing Patriot batteries to Ukraine more quickly to address the urgent need for enhanced air defenses.</p>

          <p>The U.S. Air Force is accelerating its development of next-generation air combat capabilities by conducting advanced tests integrating crewed fighter jets with uncrewed "loyal wingman" drones. In a recent exercise, pilots in an F-16 and an F-15 each successfully controlled two semi-autonomous XQ-58A Valkyrie drones, testing real-time coordination in a combat training scenario. This push to pair human pilots with AI-driven drones is a key part of the American military's strategy to maintain air supremacy. The developments are being closely watched as the U.S. engages in a technological race with China in the field of uncrewed aerial systems.</p>

          <p>The grounds of the South Carolina State Capitol will soon feature a statue of Robert Smalls, a formerly enslaved man who became a Civil War hero and U.S. congressman. This will be the first statue honoring a Black man at the state's capitol, a significant milestone for a site where most existing monuments commemorate white men with ties to the Confederacy and the Jim Crow era. Smalls is celebrated for his daring escape from slavery in 1862, where he commandeered a Confederate transport ship and delivered it to the Union Navy. His statue represents a major step in acknowledging the contributions of African Americans to the state's history.</p>
