          <p>Columbia University has agreed to a significant settlement with the Trump administration to resolve investigations into antisemitism on campus. The deal includes a $200 million payment to the federal government and $21 million to the EEOC, in exchange for the restoration of hundreds of millions in frozen research grants. As part of the agreement, the university will implement reforms, including a ban on protest masks and ending its DEI policies, a move praised by the administration as a model for other universities. The university stated it does not admit wrongdoing but acknowledges the need for reform.</p>

          <p>A rare violet sea snail, known as Janthina, was discovered on a La Jolla Shores beach, marking the first sighting by Scripps researchers in a decade. These pelagic snails typically live in warmer subtropical waters and float using a self-secreted bubble raft. The oceanographer who found them noted the water was unusually warm, leading to speculation about a potential connection to climate change. Researchers are encouraging the public to report any further sightings of these distinctive purple creatures, which are voracious predators of Portuguese man o' war, to better understand their changing distribution patterns.</p>

          <p>Columbia University will pay a $200 million settlement to the U.S. government to end a dispute over its handling of on-campus antisemitism and restore frozen federal funding. This agreement codifies several reforms, including stricter rules for protests and the appointment of an independent monitor. The article contrasts Columbia's compliance with Harvard University's decision to sue the administration over similar funding cuts and political pressures. U.S. Education Secretary Linda McMahon praised Columbia's actions as a potential "roadmap" for other universities facing scrutiny over campus culture and DEI programs.</p>

          <p>South Korean semiconductor firm SK Hynix announced record-breaking operating profit and revenue for the second quarter, significantly exceeding market expectations. This surge is attributed to the high demand for its advanced high bandwidth memory (HBM) chips, which are essential components for artificial intelligence technologies used by companies like Nvidia. The company's success in the HBM market has allowed it to challenge its rival, Samsung Electronics, for dominance in the global memory space. SK Hynix expects strong demand to continue, driven by ongoing AI investments from major tech firms. (not investment advice)</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>A U.S. Court of Appeals for the 9th Circuit has ruled that President Trump's executive order aimed at curtailing birthright citizenship is unconstitutional. The court found the order invalid because it contradicts the plain language of the Fourteenth Amendment, which grants citizenship to all persons born in the United States. The administration had argued the amendment's "subject to the jurisdiction thereof" clause excludes children of undocumented immigrants, an interpretation the court rejected. While the policy is already on hold due to other court actions, this decision marks a significant appellate-level judgment on the merits of the case.</p>

It details how the band, fronted by Ozzy Osbourne, developed its signature dark and heavy sound, influenced by horror films and an industrial accident that forced guitarist Tony Iommi to innovate his playing style. The piece explores the band's iconic albums like "Paranoid" and "Master of Reality," which established the template for countless rock bands that followed.

          <p>After making his debut at first base for the San Francisco Giants, Rafael Devers made a surprising admission, stating he prefers playing a defensive position over being a full-time designated hitter. Devers explained that being on the field keeps him active and prevents him from overthinking his next at-bat. This contrasts with his time at the Boston Red Sox, where he had been adamant about his desire to exclusively handle DH duties, even publicly rebuffing suggestions he might play first base. Devers' change of heart comes after he was traded to the Giants and immediately put into a defensive role.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>South Korea's economy grew by 0.6% in the second quarter compared to the first, surpassing expectations and allowing the nation to avoid a technical recession. The growth was primarily driven by a 4.2% increase in exports, particularly in semiconductors and petroleum products, as some firms reportedly expedited shipments ahead of potential U.S. tariff adjustments. While domestic consumption also saw a modest increase, analysts express concern that this growth may not be sustainable. They predict that global trade softening and the impact of tariffs could pressure externally facing sectors for the remainder of the year. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>The United States has finalized new trade agreements with Indonesia and the Philippines, which will see imports from these nations face a 19% tariff while U.S. exports to them will be duty-free. Analysts suggest these deals are an indirect strategy to counter China's economic influence by reshaping regional supply chains and securing access to resources like rare earth minerals. However, the report notes that the effectiveness of this strategy may be limited, as Chinese companies are increasingly localizing production within Southeast Asian countries, reducing their reliance on traditional transshipment routes that could be affected by such deals.</p>

The mission aims to better understand and predict "space weather," which can disrupt satellites, power grids, and communication systems. The twin spacecraft will fly in tandem, allowing for precise measurements of how energy from the sun couples with Earth's magnetosphere. The launch also carried five other small satellites for various missions, including testing new multi-protocol space communication technology and measuring Earth's energy balance.</p>
