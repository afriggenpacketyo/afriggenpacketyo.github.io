          <p>The small mountain town of Marshall, North Carolina, is reopening to visitors after being devastated by Hurricane Helene nearly nine months prior. The town, located along the French Broad River, experienced significant flooding, damaging homes and businesses. Business owners are expressing eagerness to welcome tourists back, with many remembering the extensive mud damage caused by the storm. Volunteers from across the country assisted in the cleanup efforts, allowing businesses like Flow Gallery and Zuma's Coffee to reopen, signifying a victory for the community.</p>

          <p>President Donald Trump has signed an executive order confirming parts of a trade deal between the UK and the US, reducing tariffs on UK cars being shipped to the US. The agreement allows up to 100,000 cars into the US at a 10% tariff, instead of the 25% import tax imposed earlier in the year, and it also removes tariffs on certain aerospace products. While the deal is seen as a positive step, it does not address the expected removal of charges on steel imports, and the UK government is continuing to work towards 0% tariffs on core steel products. The Society of Motor Manufacturers and Traders expressed reassurance about the deal, which is expected to provide a competitive edge for UK manufacturers.</p>

          <p>British Steel has secured a five-year, ¬£500 million contract to supply train tracks for Network Rail, safeguarding the short-term future of the Scunthorpe steelworks. The contract, starting on July 1, ensures that British Steel will continue to provide Network Rail with 80% of its track needs, and the deal follows government intervention to prevent the closure of the plant's blast furnaces. The government has not ruled out full public ownership but is also seeking private investors to fund steelmaking operations, which have been raised as a national security issue. Transport Secretary Heidi Alexander stated that the contract "truly transforms the outlook for British Steel."</p>

          <p>Hong Kong and Shanghai are set to strengthen their financial ties through a new agreement at the Lujiazui Forum, aiming to enhance collaboration and withstand geopolitical tensions. Financial Secretary Paul Chan Mo-po will attend the signing of an action plan for collaborative development between the two cities, outlining a blueprint for cooperation in multiple areas. Speculation suggests that Shanghai and Hong Kong will expand the "connect" schemes for cross-border trading and initiate trials of financial derivative products involving foreign currencies and commodities. The agreement is expected to mark the most significant cooperation between the cities since the launch of the Stock Connect scheme in 2014.</p>

          <p>The Leipzig Bach Festival features contemporary arrangements of Johann Sebastian Bach's masterpieces that address oppression and conflict, including the "Queer Passion" and the "Arabian Passion." The "Queer Passion," with a new libretto by Thomas H√∂ft, focuses on the suffering of LGBTQ people, particularly in Russia and the USA, while the "Arabian Passion," arranged by Vladimir Ivanoff, promotes peace between the West and the East. This year's festival theme is "transformation," and it includes a digital concert featuring Bach as an avatar, and the Bach Archive is celebrating its 75th anniversary with a new collection of letters and writings from Bach's sons. The festival attracts visitors from over 50 countries and showcases Bach's works in their original venues.</p>

Berrada outlined 'Project 150' to staff in September 2024, setting a target to return to the summit of English football despite the men's team's recent struggles and the women's team needing to surpass Chelsea's unbeaten Treble winners. Berrada emphasized the importance of aiming high and doing everything in their power to achieve the goal, despite the seemingly impossible task.</p>

          <p>Bullet train services on a route between Tokyo and northeastern Japan were suspended due to an inspection on an out-of-service train that stopped between stations. JR East reported that services were suspended between Tokyo and Sendai stations on the Tohoku shinkansen line, with operations expected to resume around 7 p.m. The out-of-service train, which debuted in spring last year on the Yamagata shinkansen line, stopped between Utsunomiya and Nasushiobara stations, forcing two other trains to also stop between the stations.</p>
