          <p>Charter Communications and The Walt Disney Co. have announced a new distribution agreement that restores several Disney-owned channels to the Spectrum TV service. The deal, which follows a contentious 2023 blackout, will also provide Spectrum TV Select customers with the ad-supported version of Hulu at no extra cost. This agreement is described as "financially net positive" for both companies and signals a more flexible approach from media giants and cable providers as they navigate the decline of traditional pay TV and the rise of streaming.</p>

          <p>Shares of the recently-public stablecoin issuer Circle experienced a significant rally, recovering from a brief pullback and highlighting the volatile nature of post-IPO crypto-related stocks. The surge also positively impacted Coinbase, which is the main distribution platform for Circle's USDC stablecoin and shares in the revenue generated from its reserves. This interplay demonstrates the growing investor interest and interconnectedness within the digital currency sector, as both companies' stock movements appear increasingly linked to developments in stablecoin regulation and Federal Reserve interest rate decisions.
