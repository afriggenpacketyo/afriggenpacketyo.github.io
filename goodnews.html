          <p>Grant Hardin, a former police chief and convicted killer known as the ‚ÄúDevil in the Ozarks,‚Äù was captured on Friday near the Arkansas prison from which he escaped nearly two weeks prior. Hardin, who was serving lengthy sentences for murder and sexual assault, had escaped on May 25, triggering an intensive manhunt. The successful capture brings an end to the search and ensures that Hardin will be returned to custody. Given that a dangerous criminal was captured, the optimism score is relatively high.</p>

          <p>Grant Hardin, a former police chief, convicted killer, and rapist known as the ‚ÄúDevil in the Ozarks,‚Äù was captured by law enforcement 1.5 miles north-west of the prison he escaped from following a 13-day manhunt. Hardin had been held at the Calico Rock prison since 2017 after pleading guilty to first-degree murder in a fatal shooting. To escape, he had impersonated a corrections officer ‚Äúin dress and manner,‚Äù according to a court document. Searchers had been using bloodhounds, officers on horseback, drones, and helicopters in their hunt for Hardin since he escaped on May 25. The optimism score is relatively high given that a dangerous criminal was apprehended.</p>

          <p>Homeowners whose homes were severely damaged or destroyed by fires in the Pacific Palisades and Altadena communities may qualify for up to $20,000 in mortgage relief. The state is launching the CalAssist Mortgage Fund on June 12, providing grants to displaced homeowners whose homes are uninhabitable. The program recognizes disasters that received a state of emergency declaration between January 2023 and January 2025, including the Eaton and Palisades fires. The CalAssist Mortgage Fund can award up to three months of mortgage payments, up to a maximum of $20,000, paid directly to the mortgage service provider. The optimism score is high given the financial relief available to those affected by the fires.</p>
