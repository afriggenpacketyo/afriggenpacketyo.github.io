          <p>Top economic officials from the United States and China met in Geneva for a second day of high-stakes negotiations aimed at easing tensions stemming from President Trump‚Äôs trade war. The talks have major implications for the global economy, which has been disrupted by tariffs imposed by both countries, impacting supply chains and potentially slowing global growth. Mr. Trump has imposed a minimum tariff of 145 percent on all Chinese imports, while China has hit American products with a 125 percent import tax. Ahead of the meetings, Mr. Trump suggested he might lower tariffs to 80 percent if China makes concessions, though China has been steadfast in its refusal to do so.</p>

Generative AI platforms primarily enhance search capabilities and are not reliable enough for core business operations. Building AI systems is expensive and requires giving up data and intellectual property to tech companies, which many businesses are hesitant to do. While AI will eventually transform the workforce, that day is still years away, and businesses should be wary of believing it exists today.</p>
