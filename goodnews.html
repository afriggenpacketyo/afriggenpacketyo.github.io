          <div class="timestamp">2025-10-01 10:10:13 EDT</div>
        </div>
        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Ford Motor reported an 8.2% increase in its third-quarter U.S. sales, largely fueled by strong demand for its electric vehicles and large SUVs. The automaker's all-electric vehicle sales surged by 30.2%, setting a new quarterly record, while sales of its larger SUVs also saw significant gains. This growth is part of a broader industry trend, with overall EV sales expected to hit a record high for the quarter as consumers moved to purchase vehicles before federal incentives expired in September. Analysts at Cox Automotive forecast that EV sales likely reached 410,000 units in the third quarter, representing a record 10% market share.</p>

          <p>Healthcare experts are advising new Medicare enrollees about the critical importance of the Medigap open enrollment period, a six-month window that begins when an individual turns 65 and enrolls in Medicare Part B. During this specific timeframe, insurance companies are legally required to offer any Medigap supplemental plan without considering pre-existing health conditions. Missing this window can result in being denied coverage or facing significantly higher premiums later, especially if one's health deteriorates. As healthcare costs continue to rise, Medigap policies are essential for many seniors to cover out-of-pocket expenses like deductibles and copayments that are not covered by Original Medicare.</p>

          <p>The Cleveland Browns have announced that rookie quarterback Dillon Gabriel will make his first NFL start this Sunday against the Minnesota Vikings, replacing veteran Joe Flacco. The decision comes after the team's 1-3 start to the season, during which the offense has struggled significantly, ranking near the bottom of the league in scoring. Flacco, 40, has posted a league-low 60.3 passer rating and thrown six interceptions through the first four games. The move to Gabriel, a third-round draft pick, also brings renewed attention to fifth-round pick Shedeur Sanders, who has been the third-string quarterback but generated considerable interest during the preseason.</p>

          <p>Microsoft's Chief Technology Officer, Kevin Scott, revealed that the company plans to predominantly use its own custom-designed chips in its data centers for artificial intelligence workloads in the future. This strategic shift could reduce Microsoft's dependence on current market leaders like Nvidia and AMD for the powerful GPUs that underpin AI development. While Microsoft currently relies heavily on Nvidia's chips for their price-performance, the company has already developed its own silicon, including the Azure Maia AI Accelerator. Scott emphasized that the goal is to optimize the entire data center system, from chips and networking to cooling, to best suit specific AI workloads.</p>

          <p>Walmart has announced a major initiative to reformulate its private-label food products, committing to remove synthetic dyes and 30 other ingredients, including artificial sweeteners and certain preservatives, by 2027. The change will impact approximately 1,000 products across its store brands, such as Great Value and Marketside, with some reformulated items expected to appear on shelves soon. The retailer stated the decision is a direct response to consumer demand for products with simpler and more familiar ingredients. This move aligns with a broader industry trend and increased federal scrutiny on the potential health effects of artificial food additives.</p>

          <p>Amazon has launched a new private-label grocery brand named 'Amazon Grocery,' aimed at attracting budget-conscious shoppers with most of its products priced under $5. The new brand consolidates over 1,000 items from its existing Happy Belly and Amazon Fresh labels, covering a wide range of categories from fresh produce and meat to pantry staples. This move comes as consumers continue to face inflationary pressures and as Amazon seeks to refine its strategy in the competitive grocery market. The launch reflects the company's focus on growing its sales of everyday essentials through its online platform, even as it streamlines its physical grocery store operations.</p>

          <p>Internet connectivity was restored across Afghanistan on Wednesday, ending a nationwide shutdown imposed by the Taliban government that lasted for more than 48 hours. The unexplained blackout paralyzed the country, disabling digital communications, halting flights due to offline air traffic control systems, and blocking access to banking services. The Taliban has not provided any official reason for the shutdown or its subsequent restoration. The outage drew criticism from the United Nations, which warned that it was exacerbating the country's severe humanitarian crisis by disrupting vital services and threatening economic stability in the already struggling nation.</p>

          <p>The Michigan Department of Transportation (MDOT) is issuing a reminder to drivers in Oakland County to pull all the way up to the stop line when encountering a red light at the new freeway ramp meters. These traffic signals were recently installed on eight entrance ramps along the I-96 Flex Route to help manage the flow of traffic and reduce congestion by breaking up platoons of merging vehicles. For the system to work correctly, vehicles must trigger sensors located at the white stop bar. MDOT is installing temporary signs to educate drivers on the new rules, which are intended to improve traffic flow and reduce crashes.</p>

          <p>England captain Harry Kane is enjoying a remarkable start to his career at Bayern Munich, having scored 17 goals in his first nine games for the German champions. His prolific form has already set records, as he became the fastest player this century to score 100 goals for a single club in one of Europe's top five leagues, achieving the milestone in just 104 games. Kane's initial goal tally outpaces the best starts of superstars like Lionel Messi, Cristiano Ronaldo, and former Bayern striker Robert Lewandowski. This incredible run of form has established him as a dominant force in the Bundesliga early in the season.</p>

          <p>A British High Court has ordered the company PPE Medpro to repay the government over £121 million ($163 million) for breaching its contract to supply sterile surgical gowns during the COVID-19 pandemic. The judge ruled that the 25 million gowns supplied by the firm, which is linked to entrepreneur Michelle Mone, were not sterile and therefore could not be used by the National Health Service. This case has become symbolic of the vast sums of public money wasted on hastily awarded contracts through a fast-track procurement process. The new Labour government welcomed the ruling as a victory in its efforts to claw back funds lost to pandemic-related fraud and contract failures.</p>

          <p>A major retrospective at the Tate Britain museum is celebrating the pioneering career of American photographer Lee Miller, spanning her work from a surrealist muse in 1920s Paris to a groundbreaking war correspondent during World War II. The exhibition, the largest ever held in the UK, showcases her artistic evolution and unique perspective. After starting as a Vogue model, Miller moved behind the camera, collaborating with Man Ray and developing her own distinct surrealist style. During the war, she was one of the few female photojournalists accredited to cover combat zones, capturing iconic and haunting images of the conflict, including the liberation of concentration camps.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>As of today, every general practitioner's practice in England is now mandated by the government to offer patients the ability to book appointments online throughout the entire workday. This new requirement is aimed at ending the frustrating "8am scramble" where patients compete to get through on busy phone lines to secure a consultation. However, the rollout has been met with some challenges, as many patients report that their local surgeries are either unaware of the change or have no available slots online. The British Medical Association has also warned that the system could be overwhelmed, potentially leading to missed diagnoses without proper safeguards in place.</p>
