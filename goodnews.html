          <p>In a game where Xavier Williams rushed for 122 yards and a touchdown, Iowa defeated Albany 34-7, allowing Kirk Ferentz to tie Woody Hayes as the Big Ten's all-time winningest coach. Quarterback Mark Gronowski, in his first start for Iowa, contributed a passing and rushing touchdown before experiencing cramping issues. Albany briefly led in the second quarter, but Iowa quickly responded with a touchdown drive led by Williams. Ferentz, now in his 27th season, has a 205-124 record at Iowa and a 217-145 career record, marking his 23rd season-opening win. With Gronowski aiming to improve Iowa's passing game, the Hawkeyes prepare to face Iowa State next week after the dominant victory. The author's tone is celebratory in light of the victory and Kirk Ferentz's achievement.</p>

The new trains hold 80 more passengers, feature upgraded seats, larger windows, faster Wi-Fi, and a self-serve food bar. The Acela trains are assembled in upstate New York, and all 28 are expected to be in service by 2027. The trains are designed to lean into curves, allowing them to maintain higher speeds on older tracks, and meet stronger crashworthiness standards. The implementation of these technologically advanced trains signifies a step forward for high-speed rail in America.</p>

          <p>Chicago Mayor Brandon Johnson signed an executive order to protect residents' rights amid concerns of a potential federal agent deployment. The order seeks to prevent the Chicago Police Department from cooperating with federal authorities on immigration enforcement and restricts officers from concealing their identities. Johnson criticized the President's approach as unconstitutional and a dangerous power grab, vowing to defend the city's democracy. The order directs city departments to provide information on residents' rights and submit Freedom of Information Act requests to the Department of Homeland Security. The Mayor's actions aim to reassure residents and send a message to the White House.</p>

          <p>German beer sales are declining, but non-alcoholic beer is becoming increasingly popular, with sales more than doubling since 2013. The Erdinger brewery is adapting to changing drinking habits by promoting its alcohol-free beer at sporting events. At Café Kosmos in Munich, customers are more health-conscious, opting for alcohol-free beverages in between alcoholic ones. While full-strength beer is still dominant, there's a noticeable shift towards mindful consumption. While some traditional beer festivals, such as the Sandkerwa folk festival in Bamberg, maintain strong beer-drinking traditions, there is an overall trend towards reduced alcohol consumption.</p>

          <p>Konami has released a remake of Metal Gear Solid 3, years after the departure of series creator Hideo Kojima.

          <p>Learner drivers in the UK are facing increasing abuse and intimidation from other road users, with many experiencing tailgating and aggressive behavior. Instructors are installing dashcams to capture evidence of such incidents, which can lead to legal action. Police forces have received over 170,000 dashcam clips in the last five years, resulting in action being taken in about 70% of the cases. Impatience from other drivers towards learner drivers and their instructors is growing, prompting calls for more empathy and kindness on the roads. The challenges faced by learners highlights the need for greater awareness and consideration.</p>

          <p>UK government scientists are employing drones, sniffer dogs, and nuclear waste models to combat the spruce bark beetle, which poses a significant threat to the UK's forests. The beetle has destroyed millions of spruce trees in Europe, and the UK government is working to prevent its spread. Drones survey forests for signs of infestation, while entomologists inspect trees on foot, searching for pioneer species. Sniffer dogs are used to detect the beetles by their scent, and cameras on bug traps identify them in real-time. These efforts have led to the eradication of the beetle in at-risk areas, though climate change and global trade pose ongoing challenges.</p>

The Education Secretary is urging schools and parents to prioritize attendance at the start of the 2025 term. The study underscores the importance of establishing good attendance habits early in the school year.</p>
