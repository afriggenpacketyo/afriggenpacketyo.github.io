          <h2>Australian Prime Minister's China Visit Focuses on Trade Deals, Sidestepping Major Disputes</h2>

          <p>During Prime Minister Anthony Albanese's visit to China, Beijing has prioritized securing numerous trade and investment agreements, effectively setting aside major political disputes. The discussions have centered on expanding Chinese market access for Australian agricultural products, greenfield investments, and potential tariff reductions. Notably, the contentious issue regarding the Chinese-operated Darwin Port, which Australia wants to reclaim on security grounds, has been deliberately avoided by both sides. Analysts suggest this focus on economic common ground is a strategic effort by China to strengthen ties amid ongoing trade tensions with the United States.</p>

          <p>A tsunami advisory for parts of southern Alaska was canceled after being briefly issued following a 7.3 magnitude earthquake off the coast. The quake, which struck about 50 miles south of Sand Point, initially prompted a stronger tsunami warning, leading to evacuations in some coastal towns like Seward. However, authorities later downgraded the alert, stating that large, widespread waves were not expected because the event occurred in shallow water. While the quake was felt across the region and followed by aftershocks, no major damage or injuries were immediately reported, and the threat to populated areas passed.</p>

          <p>The Duke of Sussex, Prince Harry, visited Angola to support the Halo Trust, a charity dedicated to clearing landmines, following in the footsteps of his late mother, Princess Diana. His visit aimed to bring renewed attention to the persistent danger that unexploded landmines pose to civilians, particularly children, decades after the country's civil war. Princess Diana's iconic walk through a minefield in 1997 brought global focus to the issue, and the area she visited is now a thriving community. Prince Harry emphasized that the "remnants of war still threaten lives every day" and met with government officials to support the ongoing demining efforts.</p>

          <p>A new photograph of Queen Camilla has been released by Buckingham Palace to celebrate her 78th birthday. The picture, taken by photographer Chris Jackson, shows the Queen smiling at her private home in Wiltshire. Unlike last year, she is expected to celebrate her birthday privately. The release comes after a busy period of public engagements for the Queen and King Charles, including a state visit and a trip to Canada. Recently, during a visit to a nuclear submarine, she was recognized for her support of the Royal Navy with an appointment as a Vice Admiral of the United Kingdom.</p>

          <h2>Used Electric Vehicle Batteries Are Being Repurposed to Power the AI Industry's Growth</h2>
          <div class="timestamp">2025-07-16 20:47:00 EDT</div>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>In a novel approach to meet the massive energy demands of the artificial intelligence boom, used electric vehicle batteries are being repurposed for power storage. Companies like Crusoe are using these recycled batteries, supplied by firms such as Redwood Materials, to power data centers with renewable energy from solar farms. This strategy provides a reliable power source that bypasses the need for new fossil fuel plants and addresses the growing concern over the AI industry's electricity consumption. The system is designed to be simple and scalable, offering a second life for EV batteries that have lost some capacity but are still highly functional for stationary storage.</p>

          <h2>Congress Passes Bipartisan Bill to Help Veterans Avoid Home Foreclosure</h2>
          <div class="timestamp">2025-07-16 20:24:26 EDT</div>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>The Senate has passed a bipartisan bill aimed at preventing thousands of veterans from losing their homes to foreclosure. The legislation addresses a crisis created after the Department of Veterans Affairs ended a homeowner assistance program, leaving veterans with fewer affordable options to manage missed mortgage payments. The new law will allow veterans to move delinquent payments to the end of their loan term, making their mortgages current and allowing them to resume payments. This fix comes after months of pressure from veterans' groups and the mortgage industry to rectify the gap in support for struggling veteran homeowners.</p>

          <p>A mother and her 9-year-old son were successfully rescued from a remote California forest after she strategically left a trail of handwritten notes for searchers to follow. The pair became lost after their vehicle's GPS led them onto remote roads where they lost signal. In addition to the notes, the son blew a whistle in a distress pattern, and they used their car's hazard lights at night. The rescue was also aided by a ham radio operator who relayed an emergency message when other communications failed. Authorities praised the mother for her resourcefulness and for informing someone of their travel plans beforehand.</p>

          <p>Coinbase has launched a new "everything app," replacing its Wallet app, in a bid to attract a wider consumer base beyond cryptocurrency traders. The new Base App combines wallet, trading, and payment functions with social media and messaging, all running on the company's Base blockchain. A key feature is Base Pay, a one-click checkout system for the USDC stablecoin, developed with Shopify to facilitate seamless online and eventually in-store payments. The move is seen as an effort to drive utility for crypto in everyday life and create new economic models for content creators, reducing the company's reliance on volatile trading revenue.

          <p>President Trump announced that Coca-Cola has agreed to replace high-fructose corn syrup with cane sugar in its beverages sold in the United States. The move follows advocacy from Health Secretary Robert F. Kennedy Jr., who has raised concerns about the health impacts of corn syrup. While Coca-Cola has not explicitly confirmed the change, a spokesperson acknowledged the president's enthusiasm. The potential switch is seen as a win for health advocates but could negatively impact American corn farmers, who warn it could cost jobs and increase reliance on foreign sugar.</p>

          <h2>UK Flat Owners Pursue Legal Action Over Alleged Secret Insurance Commissions</h2>
          <div class="timestamp">2025-07-16 19:04:13 EDT</div>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Thousands of UK flat owners are planning a class-action lawsuit against the companies that own their buildings, known as freeholders, over alleged secret commissions on insurance policies. The legal claim asserts that freeholders received undisclosed fees from insurance companies, which were then passed on to leaseholders through inflated service charges. Lawyers argue these commissions are unlawful and are seeking compensation that could amount to £2,000 per flat owner. The issue has gained prominence as building insurance costs have soared since the Grenfell Tower fire, potentially increasing the value of these percentage-based commissions for freeholders.</p>

          <p>In a move to attract younger, online audiences, Fox News Media has signed a licensing deal with the popular conservative podcast "Ruthless." This marks another instance of a legacy media outlet partnering with digital-native creators to expand its reach beyond traditional television. The podcast's hosts will also serve as contributors on the Fox News Channel, while retaining editorial control of their show. The deal reflects a broader industry trend where established media giants like ESPN and Fox Corp. are acquiring or partnering with successful podcasters and YouTubers to connect with audiences who have shifted away from pay-TV.</p>
