          <h2>Single-Stair Housing Reform Gains Momentum to Address Housing Shortage</h2>
          <div class="timestamp">2025-05-29 06:08:00 EDT</div>
        </div>
        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>A movement is growing to modernize U.S. building codes to allow single-staircase apartment buildings up to six stories, a design common in Europe and other parts of the world. Advocates argue that this change could significantly reduce construction costs and increase the supply of "missing middle" housing, which includes two- to 19-unit buildings that are increasingly rare in the U.S. By eliminating the need for a second staircase, developers could cut costs by about 10 percent and create more varied unit layouts, including family-friendly three- and four-bedroom apartments. Fire safety officials, however, express concerns about the safety of single-stair buildings, leading to ongoing debates and research efforts to evaluate the design's viability. The article notes that at least 15 states are considering or have already adopted single-stair reforms. </p>

          <p>Japanese Prime Minister Ishiba is scheduled to have phone discussions with former U.S. President Trump later today, according to sources. The article does not provide any further information regarding the content or purpose of the phone call.

The call is likely a diplomatic effort to strengthen relations between Japan and the United States, particularly given Trump's previous role and potential future influence. </p>

          <p>Nvidia shares experienced a significant surge in premarket trading following the release of a positive earnings report, triggering a widespread rally in semiconductor stocks globally. Despite challenges stemming from U.S. semiconductor export restrictions to China, Nvidia's financial results surpassed market expectations, bolstering confidence in the broader semiconductor industry and artificial intelligence-related stocks. The company wrote off $4.5 billion of H20 chip inventory due to export curbs, but still posted strong financial results, demonstrating the continued demand for its graphics processing units in AI model training. The article notes that the U.S. has ordered companies to stop shipping goods to China without a license, but Nvidia's performance allayed concerns about dwindling demand.</p>

          <p>The US Women's National Team (USWNT) is navigating a period of transition as key players from the "Triple Espresso" trio‚ÄîMallory Swanson, Sophia Wilson, and Trinity Rodman‚Äîare currently unavailable due to pregnancy and injury. Coach Emma Hayes is using this time to build depth and experiment with the roster in preparation for the 2027 World Cup, providing opportunities for emerging talents like Alyssa and Gisele Thompson, Michelle Cooper, and Ally Sentnor to gain valuable experience. The team's upcoming matches against China and Jamaica will serve as important tests for the new-look squad, with Hayes emphasizing the importance of club form in player selection. While the absence of the 'Triple Espresso' presents a challenge, it also allows for the development of a broader player pool and the discovery of new goal-scoring options.</p>

          <p>New York City has unveiled a $335 million plan to renovate Damrosch Park at Lincoln Center, aiming to improve the aging site and open it to the surrounding neighborhood. The project will repair the leaky garage roof that the park occupies and construct a new amphitheater, eliminating the need for costly temporary stages. Most significantly, the renovation seeks to address historical injustices by connecting the park to the west side, previously walled off by urban renewal projects. By tearing down a garage wall and creating tiered gardens, the plan aims to heal a civic wound and create a more accessible and inclusive space for the community.</p>
