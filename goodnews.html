        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>U.S. nonfarm payrolls increased by a stronger-than-expected 147,000 in June, signaling surprising resilience in the labor market and likely removing a July interest rate cut from consideration. The unemployment rate notably fell to 4.1%, its lowest since February, despite a slight decrease in the labor force participation rate. This robust jobs report has significantly shifted market expectations, with traders now seeing the next Fed reduction not before September. The report also detailed modest average hourly earnings growth and substantial job gains, particularly in state and local government, alongside health care and social assistance, reflecting diverse sector contributions to the economy's stability.</p>

          <p>The Trump administration has released its annual report, providing transparency on the salaries of every White House staffer, with compensation ranging from $59,070 to a top earning of $225,700. Jacalynne Klopp, a senior adviser, leads the list, followed by Edgar Mkrtchian and 33 other prominent figures like Press Secretary Karoline Leavitt and Chief of Staff Susan Wiles, earning $195,200. Interestingly, eight employees, including Secretary of State Marco Rubio, are listed as receiving no White House salaries, often due to their primary compensation coming from other government departments. This detailed report offers a comprehensive overview of the administrative payroll.</p>

          <p>All 15 individuals on board a small skydiving plane survived with injuries after the aircraft crashed at Cross Keys Airport in Williamstown, New Jersey, on Wednesday. The pilot reported engine trouble shortly after takeoff and attempted to return for an emergency landing but was unsuccessful. Three people were transported to a trauma center with critical or serious injuries, while eight others received treatment for less severe conditions, and four had minor injuries. Emergency crews, who had recently conducted a mass casualty training exercise at the same airport, were credited for their swift and effective response. Federal agencies are investigating the incident, noting the plane had a prior landing incident in 2023.</p>

          <h2>California Democrats Advance Housing Construction by Easing Environmental Regulations</h2>
          <div class="timestamp">2025-07-03 08:00:00 EDT</div>
        </div>
        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>California Governor Gavin Newsom has signed two housing bills into law, significantly easing environmental review procedures for urban multifamily developments and simplifying zoning changes. This move by California Democrats prioritizes material abundance and the general public's needs over traditional anti-development progressivism and intra-party harmony. The article argues that this shift, despite vigorous objections from some environmental groups and labor unions, offers a potential blueprint for Democrats nationwide to address housing shortages and infrastructure challenges. It suggests the party can effectively guide its stakeholders towards policies that genuinely benefit the broader public, rather than succumbing to scarcity and internal political tension.</p>

          <p>Ken Casey, the outspoken founder and frontman of the Celtic punk band Dropkick Murphys, remains steadfast in his political stance against Trumpism, despite potential backlash from some fans. He views the band's thirty-year history as a preparation for the current political moment, aiming to persuade working-class Americans that they are being misled by political figures. Casey famously challenged a Trump supporter's "Made in America" shirt at a show, using the moment to highlight perceived hypocrisy. He voices frustration with identity politics and the Democratic Party's inability to connect with working-class male voters, advocating for a centrist leader who can effectively bridge this significant ideological divide.</p>

          <h2>Exploring the Feasibility of "Lazy Summers" for Children in the Digital Age</h2>
          <div class="timestamp">2025-07-03 07:45:00 EDT</div>
        </div>
        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>This article explores the challenges of providing children with traditional "lazy summers" of unstructured playtime in the modern digital age. Parents face difficulties due to full-time work and increased supervision norms, while the ubiquity of smartphones and tablets has transformed children's downtime, with significant time spent on gaming. Experts suggest that while screen time is different from past entertainment, gaming can offer benefits like relationship building and critical thinking skills. Older teens, in particular, demonstrate a growing awareness and ability to manage their own device use, offering a more reassuring outlook on their capacity for self-directed engagement.</p>

          <p>Chinese tech giant Baidu has implemented its most significant overhaul of its core search platform in a decade, deeply integrating advanced artificial intelligence features. This strategic move aims to counter increasing pressure from fast-moving AI rivals like DeepSeek and short video platforms, rather than traditional search engines. Users can now engage with the search engine more conversationally, using voice, pictures, and files, and leverage Baidu's Ernie Bot AI for content generation. This aggressive enhancement reflects Baidu's proactive approach to staying competitive and demonstrating leadership in the rapidly evolving AI landscape, mirroring global trends seen with companies like Google.

          <p>Amazon is set to discontinue its standalone free streaming TV service, Freevee, in August, as part of a strategic move to consolidate its content offerings under its main Prime Video platform. Launched in 2019, Freevee offered a library of free, ad-supported video, including original series, primarily through its dedicated app. Following the shutdown, users will still be able to access Freevee's entire catalog of shows and movies for free within Prime Video, even without an Amazon Prime subscription. This decision aligns with Amazon's recent introduction of ads on Prime Video in January 2024, aiming to simplify the overall customer viewing experience.</p>

          <div class="timestamp">2025-07-03 07:30:00 EDT</div>
        </div>
        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>This article delves into the transformative shift in women's fitness from conventional weight-loss obsessions to the empowering pursuit of strength through weight lifting. Drawing on Casey Johnston's book, "A Physical Education," it illustrates how strength training can redefine body image and mental well-being, prioritizing function and growth over aesthetics. The piece critiques the pervasive influence of diet culture and its "busywork bullshit" exercises, advocating for a more sustainable and fulfilling approach to physical activity that emphasizes proper fueling and embracing gradual progress. It posits that lifting serves as a powerful metaphor for balanced striving, incorporating effort, rest, and acceptance of challenges.</p>
