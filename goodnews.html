          <p>President Trump is actively working to arrange the first face-to-face meeting between Russian President Vladimir Putin and Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy, following recent White House discussions with Zelenskyy and European leaders. Trump confirmed a call with Putin to set up the initial bilateral meeting, after which he would join to 'wrap it up.' This diplomatic push aims to secure a peace deal for Ukraine, with security guarantees emerging as a key issue, though Trump stated Ukraine would not join NATO but European nations would provide ground troops.</p>

          <p>Apple is reportedly increasing iPhone production in India, expanding operations at five factories in preparation for the iPhone 17 launch. This strategic move comes as the U.S. Treasury Secretary accused India of 'profiteering' from discounted Russian oil and threatened higher tariffs. Apple's shift aligns with its broader goal to reduce reliance on China, while its significant investments in U.S. manufacturing, including a $100 billion expansion, may help mitigate the impact of potential India-related tariffs and secure its supply chain.</p>

The deal, which still requires union ratification, addresses key deadlocked issues like pay and 'unpaid work,' with the union stating that 'unpaid work is over.' While full service may take up to a week to stabilize, this resolution follows government intervention and union defiance of a back-to-work order, signaling a positive step for both the airline and its employees.</p>

          <p>Nvidia is evaluating a new artificial intelligence chip, tentatively named B30A and based on its Blackwell architecture, for the Chinese market, reportedly more powerful than its current H20 offering. This consideration follows a recent agreement where Nvidia and AMD consented to give the U.S. government a 15% cut of their China sales for permission to resume chip exports. The company's efforts to develop new products align with its strategy to compete within government-allowed parameters, indicating a complex balancing act between market access and national security concerns.</p>
