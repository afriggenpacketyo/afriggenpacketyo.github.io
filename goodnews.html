          <p>The United States and China have initiated high-level discussions in Geneva aimed at de-escalating trade tensions, marking the first in-person engagement between the world's two largest economies since President Trump imposed substantial tariffs on imports earlier in the year. Key figures such as U.S. Treasury Secretary Scott Bessent, U.S. Trade Representative Jamieson Greer, and Chinese Vice Premier He Lifeng are participating in these negotiations. These talks signal a potential move towards resolving the ongoing trade disputes that have significantly impacted global markets and economic relations.

          <p>A recently introduced bill, the Evidence-Based Drug Policy Act of 2025 (EBDPA), aims to ease research restrictions on cannabis and other Schedule I substances, potentially allowing for more clinical studies on medical cannabis. Representatives Dina Titus and Ilhan Omar introduced the EBDPA which would allow research to catch up with the US‚Äôs increasing cannabis consumption. The Biden administration's efforts to reschedule cannabis have stalled, and this bill seeks to repeal provisions that restrict federal funding for research on Schedule I drugs, prioritizing evidence over ideology. Experts have mixed opinions on the bill's likelihood of passage, but it is viewed as a neutral step towards informed cannabis policy.</p>

          <p>Kosmos-482, a Soviet spacecraft intended for Venus in 1972, re-entered Earth's atmosphere after 53 years and crashed into the Indian Ocean. Launched during the Cold War, the mission failed due to a rocket booster malfunction, leaving the spacecraft stranded in Earth orbit. The event serves as a reminder of the ambitious space exploration efforts of the Soviet Union and the enduring legacy of the space race. While most modern re-entries are controlled, Kosmos-482's uncontrolled return highlights the increasing amount of space debris orbiting the planet.</p>
