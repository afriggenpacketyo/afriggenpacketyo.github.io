          <p>Spanish and Barcelona midfielder Aitana Bonmati has been awarded the women's Ballon d'Or for a historic third time, cementing her status as a dominant force in world football. The 27-year-old finished ahead of her national teammate, Mariona Caldentey, in the voting for the prestigious prize. This victory continues a five-year streak of Barcelona players winning the award, following Alexia Putellas's wins in 2021 and 2022 and Bonmati's own previous wins in 2023 and 2024. The top ten also featured a strong presence from England's Lionesses, with five players recognized for their outstanding performances over the past year.</p>

          <p>ABC's parent company, The Walt Disney Co., announced that "Jimmy Kimmel Live!" will return to the air on Tuesday after a brief suspension. The network decided to preempt the show last week, stating that Kimmel's comments regarding the death of conservative influencer Charlie Kirk were "ill-timed and thus insensitive." The company explained that after several days of thoughtful conversations with the host, they mutually reached the decision to resume production. The suspension had followed a call for action from the FCC chairman and sparked a significant public debate about free speech, media responsibility, and political pressure on entertainment programming.</p>

These accolades follow the Lionesses' victory at Euro 2025, where Hampton's crucial saves in a penalty shootout against Spain secured the title. Wiegman, who led the team to its second consecutive European championship, used her acceptance speech to advocate for inclusivity and speak out against misogyny and racism in sports. Hampton paid tribute to the late women's football manager Matt Beard, highlighting his pioneering role in the game.</p>

          <p>A Massachusetts jury has found Karen Read not guilty of second-degree murder and manslaughter in the 2022 death of her boyfriend, Boston police officer John O'Keefe. She was, however, convicted of driving under the influence of alcohol. This verdict concludes a highly publicized retrial that followed an initial mistrial due to a hung jury. Prosecutors had accused Read of striking O'Keefe with her SUV and leaving him to die in the snow, while her defense team argued she was framed in an elaborate cover-up involving law enforcement. The case captivated public attention with its complex timeline and dramatic courtroom battles over evidence and witness credibility.</p>

          <p>The White House has detailed a plan to restructure TikTok's U.S. operations into a new American-based joint venture, aiming to address national security concerns while avoiding an outright ban. Under the proposed framework, the new entity would have a majority of U.S. investors and board members, with software company Oracle serving as the security provider to monitor the platform's algorithm and data. Although a senior White House official expressed confidence that China has approved the deal, Beijing has not publicly confirmed an agreement. The move comes after President Trump paused enforcement of a congressional law that would have forced TikTok's Chinese parent company, ByteDance, to divest.</p>

          <p>Shares of mortgage lender Better Home & Finance Holding Co. skyrocketed by more than 46% on Monday after hedge fund manager Eric Jackson recommended the stock. Jackson, known for his influence in the trading of Opendoor, called Better Home "the Shopify of mortgages" and suggested it has the potential to be a "350-bagger" within two years. He highlighted the company's use of artificial intelligence to innovate in the mortgage industry and pointed to its low valuation compared to newly public competitors like Figure Technology Solutions. The endorsement triggered a massive rally, at one point causing the stock to more than double in price during the session. (not investment advice)</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Following the Federal Reserve's recent interest rate cut, homeowners looking to borrow $50,000 against their home equity face a choice between a home equity loan and a Home Equity Line of Credit (HELOC). Currently, a HELOC is slightly cheaper, with monthly payments for a 15-year term being about $7 less than a fixed-rate home equity loan. However, the key difference lies in the rate structure: HELOCs have variable rates that can change over time, while home equity loans offer a fixed rate for the life of the loan. Borrowers must weigh the immediate savings of a HELOC against the long-term payment stability of a home equity loan. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>A federal judge has overturned a stop-work order from the Trump administration, allowing Danish energy company Orsted to resume construction on its Revolution Wind farm off the New England coast. The Interior Department had ordered a halt to the project, which is 80% complete, despite it being fully permitted. Judge Royce Lamberth granted Orsted a temporary injunction, ruling the company would likely suffer irreparable harm if the order remained. This decision marks a significant setback for the Trump administration's efforts to curtail the offshore wind industry, which the Interior Secretary has stated has no future due to its cost and reliability issues.</p>

          <p>Sportswear giant Nike is being viewed by some analysts as a promising turnaround story, prompting its addition to investment watch lists. The company has struggled in recent years with challenges in China and a loss of innovation, allowing competitors to gain market share.

The company's last earnings report showed positive signs, and management expects to achieve a clean inventory position by November, ahead of the crucial holiday season, which could improve margins and signal a return to growth.
