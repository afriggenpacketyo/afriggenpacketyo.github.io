          <p>The Trump administration has announced plans for a new 90,000-square-foot ballroom at the White House, a project estimated to cost $200 million. The construction will be privately funded by President Trump and other anonymous donors, with work slated to begin in September. This new facility, to be built alongside the East Wing, is designed to host large formal functions for up to 650 guests, eliminating the need for temporary tents for state dinners. The project fulfills a long-stated desire by the president to add a grand ballroom to the executive mansion.</p>

          <p>Amazon reported second-quarter results that surpassed analyst estimates for both earnings and revenue, with sales growing 13% year-over-year to $167.7 billion. Despite the strong performance, which was boosted by its advertising business, the company's shares fell in after-hours trading. The decline was attributed to a weaker-than-expected operating income forecast for the current quarter, raising investor concerns about the significant costs of its ongoing investments in artificial intelligence. Amazon's cloud unit, AWS, also saw its growth trail competitors Microsoft and Google. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>Apple announced third-quarter financial results that significantly exceeded Wall Street expectations, with overall revenue growing 10%, its fastest pace since December 2021. The strong performance was driven by a 13% year-over-year increase in iPhone sales, particularly the popularity of the iPhone 16 model among upgrading users. The Mac division also saw robust growth of nearly 15%, while the company's services business continued its steady expansion. However, sales for the iPad and the wearables division, which includes the Apple Watch, both experienced declines during the quarter. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>President Trump has directed 17 major pharmaceutical companies to take significant steps to lower U.S. drug prices within the next 60 days, threatening to use every available tool to address "abusive drug pricing practices" if they fail to comply. In letters to executives at firms like Pfizer and Eli Lilly, he called for prices on existing and new drugs to be tied to the lowest prices offered in other developed nations. This move revives his "most favored nation" policy and aims to provide immediate relief to American consumers, who often pay significantly more for prescriptions than people in other countries.

          <p>A recent high-profile meeting in France involving LeBron James, his business partner Maverick Carter, and Nikola Jokić's agent was reportedly about a new $5 billion international basketball league intended to rival the NBA. The proposed venture, inspired by LIV Golf and Formula One, would feature touring men's and women's teams and offer players equity stakes, a practice currently forbidden for active NBA athletes. The plan is seen as a potential competitor to the NBA's own expansion efforts into Europe. The league would likely require full-time commitments, creating a direct challenge for talent.</p>

The original test, which included challenges like a one-mile run and pull-ups, will be brought back to promote physical wellness and competition among students. The administration's "Make America Healthy Again" movement, led by Health Secretary Robert F. Kennedy Jr., will oversee the program.

          <p>A new study published in the journal Cell reveals that the modern potato originated from an ancient hybridization event between a tomato ancestor and a wild potato-like species. Scientists have long been puzzled by the potato's origins, but this research suggests that a crucial gene from the tomato, combined with genetics from a non-tuber-producing Chilean species, enabled the evolution of the starchy tuber we know today. By analyzing hundreds of potato genomes, the research team solved the long-standing mystery. The findings demonstrate how interbreeding between species can spark the development of entirely new traits and organisms.</p>

Despite favorable bowling conditions, England's inconsistency, coupled with a late-day injury to Chris Woakes, meant they couldn't fully capitalize. India, in turn, struggled to assert dominance, with their batters appearing unsettled by the varied and at times chaotic English bowling.</p>

With high interest rates, borrowers are advised to be wary of variable-rate HELOCs if they need predictable payments, as rates could still rise. Another key mistake is borrowing more than is necessary, which can become risky if income changes or home values decline. Finally, homeowners should carefully compare closing costs and hidden fees from multiple lenders, as these can significantly impact the overall cost of a home equity loan or line of credit.
