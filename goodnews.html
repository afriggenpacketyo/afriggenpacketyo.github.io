        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>For the third consecutive quarter, public companies have acquired more bitcoin than exchange-traded funds (ETFs), signaling a strategic shift in institutional investment. This trend is driven by companies emulating the "MicroStrategy playbook" of holding bitcoin as a treasury reserve asset to enhance shareholder value, a move encouraged by a more crypto-friendly regulatory environment under the Trump administration. While ETFs still hold a larger total amount of bitcoin, corporate buying is noted for being less sensitive to short-term price fluctuations and more focused on long-term accumulation.

          <p>Matt Maasdam, a former Navy SEAL, has announced his candidacy for Michigan's 7th Congressional District, becoming the second Democrat to challenge incumbent Republican Tom Barrett. The district is considered one of the most competitive in the country and is a key target for Democrats seeking to regain a House majority in the 2026 midterm elections. Maasdam is highlighting his military service, including his role as a military aide to former President Obama, to position himself as a candidate focused on service over partisan politics.

          <p>This article provides an overview of current interest rates for certificates of deposit (CDs), noting that top accounts are offering returns that outpace inflation. While national average yields for one-year to five-year CDs are relatively low, online banks are offering significantly higher rates, with some one-year CDs yielding over 4.4%. The article advises savers to look at online banks and consider short-term CDs, which currently offer higher rates due to an inverted yield curve, to maximize their returns in the current economic environment.

          <p>This article examines the career of Claire McCardell, a highly influential American fashion designer from the 1930s to the 1950s who is now largely forgotten by the public. McCardell championed comfortable, practical, and stylish clothing for women, introducing innovations like ballet flats, dress pockets, and mix-and-match separates that defined the "American Look." She rejected the restrictive European styles of the era, focusing instead on freedom of movement and ease of wear. The piece reflects on why her name faded from memory despite her revolutionary impact on modern womenswear.</p>

          <p>The CEO of Marks & Spencer has stated that the retailer's online operations, which were severely disrupted by a major cyber-attack in April, are expected to be fully functional within four weeks. The attack locked up M&S systems, impacting sales for six weeks and leading to the theft of some customer data, with an estimated profit hit of ¬£300 million. While online orders have resumed in most of the U.K., services like click-and-collect remain offline. The company is focused on restoring full service and getting its main distribution center running again by August.</p>

          <p>Jim Cramer's CNBC Investing Club is selling a portion of its shares in the semiconductor company Broadcom to realize a significant profit. The stock has seen a substantial rally, gaining nearly 90% since its lows in April and outperforming the S&P 500. The decision to trim the position is described as a disciplined move to avoid greed and to raise cash while the market is considered overbought. Despite the sale, the club remains bullish on Broadcom's long-term potential, particularly in the artificial intelligence sector. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>Internet infrastructure company Cloudflare will now automatically block AI crawlers from scraping data from its customers' websites, a significant move to protect content creators. The new policy requires website owners to explicitly grant permission for AI bots to access their data, aiming to curb the practice of training large language models on web content without consent or compensation. Cloudflare, which handles a substantial portion of global internet traffic, is also introducing a "pay per crawl" model for publishers who wish to charge AI companies for access. The change could significantly impact how AI developers train their models.</p>
