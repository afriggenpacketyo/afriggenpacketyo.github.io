          <p>Will Hutchins, known for his role as Tom Brewster in the 1950s television western "Sugarfoot," passed away at the age of 94 due to respiratory failure. The New York Times article details how Hutchins' character was a comically genteel sheriff who preferred cherry soda to whiskey, a stark contrast to typical western protagonists. After "Sugarfoot," Hutchins continued acting in television and film, including appearances in Elvis Presley movies and a role in "The Shooting" alongside Jack Nicholson. Later in life, he worked as a traveling clown, finding fulfillment in bringing laughter to audiences around the world.</p>

          <p>Former Vice President Mike Pence received the John F. Kennedy Profile in Courage Award for his refusal to overturn the 2020 election results. In his acceptance speech, Pence repeatedly invoked the Constitution and emphasized its importance in uniting Americans. The ABC News article highlights Pence's subtle contrast with Trump, who, in a separate interview, expressed uncertainty about whether everyone in the U.S. is entitled to due process. Pence's actions on January 6, 2021, were recognized as a defense of the constitutional transfer of power.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>The BBC article explores the growing popularity of silent book clubs, where readers gather to read in a shared space without talking. Unlike traditional book clubs, members can read any book they choose, followed by an optional discussion. The original Silent Book Club was founded in San Francisco in 2012 and has since expanded to over 1,600 chapters in 54 countries. The appeal lies in the opportunity to unplug, socialize in a low-pressure environment, and enjoy the comfort of reading alongside others.</p>

          <p>The National Institutes of Health (NIH) has closed its last in-house beagle laboratory on the NIH campus, following scrutiny over alleged animal abuse. Fox News reports that the lab was accused of conducting deadly experiments on beagles for over 40 years. The White Coat Waste (WCW) project detailed the lab's history of pumping pneumonia-causing bacteria into beagles' lungs and bleeding them out. Animal rights groups and lawmakers have praised the closure, calling it a victory for ethical treatment of animals.</p>

          <p>Lando Norris suggested that Max Verstappen's racing strategy was not very smart during the Miami Grand Prix, according to the BBC. McLaren team principal Andrea Stella noted that Norris could have been more patient in overtaking Verstappen. Norris was further delayed because he had to give a position back to Verstappen after passing him by going off track. Stella saw no difference in the approaches of his two drivers to racing Verstappen.</p>

May gave up two home runs to Austin Riley on poorly executed sweepers, sinking his performance. While May was largely effective outside of those pitches, the Dodgers' offense couldn't complete a comeback. May acknowledged the need for more consistency, especially in executing his sweeper.</p>

          <p>The Trump factor is shaping global politics, but not always to the president‚Äôs taste, according to The New York Times. In Canada and Australia, right-wing parties that borrowed from the MAGA playbook were punished in recent elections. The article suggests that voters have Mr. Trump somewhere on their mind as they make decisions, and centrists are seeing their fortunes revived. The Trump factor has been felt in Germany and Britain, too, although its effect has been more mixed.</p>
