          <p>Sir Keir Starmer met with Indian Prime Minister Narendra Modi in Mumbai to discuss expanding business and trade ties following a landmark trade deal signed in July. Starmer addressed a fintech conference and was warmly welcomed in India, with the visit intended to strengthen UK-India relations. The UK-India trade deal is projected to increase the UK's GDP and boost trade between the two countries significantly by 2040. Starmer stated that the UK would not relax visa rules for India, but emphasized the opportunities to improve trade and cultural connections. (not investment advice)</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>China has launched the world's first thermal power station utilizing dual towers in the Gobi Desert, constructed by the China Three Gorges Corporation. The plant employs nearly 27,000 mirrors to focus sunlight onto two 200-meter towers, producing concentrated heat that melts and stores salt at high temperatures. This system generates steam to power turbines, ensuring continuous electricity production even after sunset or on cloudy days. The dual-tower design, with overlapping mirror fields, enhances efficiency by approximately 25% compared to single-tower setups, reducing mirror requirements and overall construction costs.</p>

The recent GENIUS Act in the US is expected to further boost stablecoin adoption, with BVNK aiming to expand its customer base to include digital banks. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>Sanae Takaichi, a protégé of Shinzo Abe, is poised to lead Japan, raising concerns about potential trade tensions with the U.S. due to her support for loose monetary policy, which could weaken the yen. A weaker yen benefits exporters but raises import costs, potentially reviving accusations of unfair trade practices from the U.S. However, analysts believe Takaichi will likely proceed cautiously to avoid straining relations with Washington. While the yen has weakened since Takaichi's rise, experts anticipate that concerns over imported inflation will limit her ability to enact policies that further depreciate the currency.

          <p>President Trump announced that Israel and Hamas have agreed to the first phase of a US peace plan, two years after the start of the Gaza military campaign. The initial phase involves the release of all hostages and the withdrawal of Israeli troops to an agreed line. Israel's government is set to vote on the deal, and if approved, troop withdrawal is expected within 24 hours, followed by the release of hostages. Key issues like Hamas disarmament and future governance of Gaza remain unresolved, with differing views among the parties. Despite these challenges, relatives of hostages and people in Gaza have expressed relief and hope.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>European officials, including European Commission President Ursula von der Leyen, are acknowledging that Russia is waging "hybrid warfare" against Europe through various disruptive tactics. These tactics include airspace incursions, cyberattacks, and election interference, designed to destabilize and weaken the bloc. While not directly blaming all incidents on Moscow, von der Leyen emphasized that Russia seeks to sow division. Experts define hybrid warfare as blending conventional military methods with subversive tactics to undermine adversaries, with Eastern European countries being particularly exposed. Europe is now taking steps to bolster regional security and defenses against these malign activities.</p>
