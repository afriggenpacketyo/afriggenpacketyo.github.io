        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>A significant ceasefire deal aimed at ending the two-year conflict between Israel and Hamas is pending approval from the Israeli cabinet. Brokered with assistance from the U.S., Egypt, and Qatar, the agreement's first phase mandates the release of all remaining hostages from Gaza in exchange for an undetermined number of Palestinian prisoners. The plan also requires the Israel Defense Forces to pull back to a pre-agreed demarcation line within Gaza. This development follows intense negotiations and has been announced as a major step toward a lasting peace, with the initial hostage exchange potentially occurring within days of ratification.</p>

        </div>
        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>The Internal Revenue Service has updated the federal income tax brackets and standard deductions for the 2026 tax year to account for inflation. This annual adjustment is designed to prevent "bracket creep," where inflation pushes taxpayers into higher tax brackets without a real increase in income. For 2026, the standard deduction will rise to $32,200 for married couples filing jointly and $16,100 for single filers. These changes mean Americans will need to earn more before moving to a higher tax rate, providing potential relief when they file their taxes. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>Analysts at Cantor have raised their price target for Nvidia to a Street-high of $300, suggesting a potential 55% upside from its current price and pushing its market cap over $7 trillion. This optimistic forecast is based on the belief that spending on artificial intelligence infrastructure is growing, dismissing concerns of an AI bubble. Additionally, Goldman Sachs has identified Disney and Broadcom as tactical buys ahead of their earnings reports. Broadcom's significant backlog and Disney's expected profitability in streaming and parks are cited as key drivers for their positive outlook. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>Jennifer Lopez shared that her role in the new musical film "Kiss of the Spider Woman" is a project she has wanted to do her entire life. The movie, based on a 1970s novel, explores the bond between a transgender character and a political revolutionary, with a message of love and acceptance that Lopez feels is necessary in today's climate. In the film, she plays three distinct iterations of the same woman, a challenge she found thrilling. Lopez also expressed her admiration for artist Bad Bunny, who is set to perform at the Super Bowl, praising his ability to transcend language through music.</p>

          <p>Delta Air Lines has issued a strong financial outlook for the end of 2025, with projected earnings and revenue growth surpassing Wall Street estimates.

          <p>The Texas Court of Criminal Appeals has halted the execution of Robert Roberson just one week before it was scheduled to take place. Roberson was convicted of killing his two-year-old daughter in 2002 based on a diagnosis of shaken baby syndrome, a theory that has since faced significant scientific scrutiny. His defense team argues that new medical evidence shows the child died from pneumonia, not abuse. The court has ordered a review of his case under a Texas law that allows convictions to be challenged if the scientific evidence used against them is no longer considered credible.</p>

While the storm's core is expected to remain offshore, its effects will be felt inland, with officials anticipating numerous instances of flash flooding in central Arizona.

          <p>The newly signed Israel-Hamas ceasefire agreement represents a major breakthrough and the first realistic chance to end the two-year war, but its success is far from guaranteed. The deal's framework leaves many critical details, such as the complete demilitarization of Gaza and Israel's full withdrawal, to be negotiated in later phases. Key obstacles remain, including Hamas's refusal to fully disarm and Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu's insistence that Hamas be completely destroyed. Sustained U.S. pressure on both sides will be essential to prevent the process from collapsing after the initial hostage exchange is complete.</p>

          <p>California has enacted a pioneering law to phase out ultra-processed foods from its public school meals over the next decade. The legislation requires the state to define and then prohibit certain highly processed products, which are often high in sugar, salt, and unhealthy fats. This move builds on California's previous initiatives to provide free meals for all students and ban synthetic food dyes. While some critics worry about the costs for school districts, proponents and public health experts praise the law as a crucial step toward improving child nutrition and combating chronic diseases.</p>

          <p>The proposal to abolish stamp duty on primary homes in the UK is gaining political traction, but its economic consequences could be complex. Analysts suggest that while it would be popular with homebuyers, it could lead to a rise in house prices, as the tax savings might be absorbed into higher asking prices. The policy would disproportionately benefit wealthier individuals and those in southern England, where property values and tax bills are highest. While it could improve labor mobility and free up larger homes for families, the significant loss of tax revenue would need to be addressed elsewhere in the budget.</p>

          <p>Orson Welles' 1938 radio adaptation of "The War of the Worlds" remains a landmark event in media history, demonstrating the power of broadcasting to shape public perception. The realistic news-bulletin format famously caused some listeners to panic, believing a real Martian invasion was underway. This article reflects on how the incident sparked one of the first major discussions on media literacy and the credibility of new technologies. Welles himself later admitted the broadcast was an intentional assault on the public's uncritical acceptance of radio, a lesson that is more relevant than ever in the current era of social media and AI-generated deepfakes.</p>
