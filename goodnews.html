          <p>After a 1-0 aggregate win over Fredrikstad, Crystal Palace has qualified for the Conference League league phase for the first time. Manager Oliver Glasner called it a "huge achievement" and the club's second goal of the season after winning the Community Shield. Despite recent success, the team faces challenges with a weakened squad following key player departures and is looking to make new signings before the transfer deadline to remain competitive in both domestic and European competitions.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>This opinion article argues that as Indonesian President Prabowo Subianto cracks down on millions of hectares of illegal palm oil plantations, global demand, particularly from China, is a key factor. The author contends that palm oil is not just a commodity but a reflection of civilization, with its expansion erasing ecosystems and local heritage for economic gain. The piece suggests that China, as a major importer, has the leverage to help Indonesia shift towards more sustainable practices, thereby rewriting the destructive narrative associated with the industry.</p>

          <p>The Dallas Cowboys have traded three-time All-Pro linebacker Micah Parsons to the Green Bay Packers in a major move that reshapes the NFC. As part of the deal, Parsons has agreed to a four-year, $188 million contract extension with the Packers, making him the highest-paid non-quarterback in NFL history. The trade follows a period of growing friction between Parsons and the Cowboys, with the 26-year-old player having requested a trade and not participating in full practices since last season.</p>

          <p>Governor Gavin Newsom announced plans to expand the deployment of special California Highway Patrol (CHP) crime suppression teams to major cities across the state, including Los Angeles, Sacramento, and the Bay Area. While touting that overall crime numbers are down, Newsom stated the targeted, data-driven operations are necessary because residents' perceptions of safety are paramount. The move is seen as a contrast to President Trump's threats to use military forces for local crime, with Newsom emphasizing that his approach involves collaboration with local law enforcement rather than federal overreach.</p>

          <p>As evidence suggests that employee burnout is at its highest level since 2016, a lifestyle expert advises workers to focus on simple strategies to reduce stress. Maisha Wynn, a CBS News contributor, recommends channeling energy by tackling demanding tasks early in the day and saving simpler activities for later. She also suggests building "micro routines," such as doodling or listening to music, to create moments of joy and relief at the desk. A key component to avoiding burnout, Wynn notes, is learning to set boundaries and occasionally say "no," prioritizing one's own well-being.</p>

          <p>Meme del Real, the versatile keyboardist and vocalist for the iconic Mexican rock band Café Tacvba, is releasing his first solo album. The project emerged unexpectedly during a five-year period of retreat in Valle de Bravo, where del Real says the songs "rose out of the floor to meet me" rather than being intentionally sought. The album explores a wide range of genres, from electronic and ambient to bolero and norteña, reflecting a playful and intuitive creative process. Del Real describes the experience as transformative and a "now-or-never moment" to express a solitary part of his musical identity.</p>

          <h2>Dell Shares Decline After Company Issues Cautious Third-Quarter Profit Outlook</h2>

        </div>
        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Dell Technologies stock fell despite the company reporting second-quarter revenue and earnings that surpassed Wall Street expectations. The decline was attributed to a third-quarter earnings-per-share forecast that came in below analyst predictions. While Dell raised its full-year revenue outlook, driven by a 69% annual increase in its Servers and Networking division from strong demand for AI servers, the softer near-term profit guidance and a 3% decline in its storage business concerned investors. The company now expects to ship $20 billion in AI servers in its next fiscal year. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>Average interest rates for home equity loans have dropped to their lowest point of the year, making them a more attractive option for homeowners seeking financing. With rates now around 8.22%, they are competitive with variable-rate home equity lines of credit (HELOCs). The article suggests that beyond the low fixed rates, these loans are appealing because U.S. homeowners currently have record levels of home equity to borrow against. Additionally, interest paid on funds used for eligible home improvements may be tax-deductible, adding another financial benefit for borrowers. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>Amazon is expanding its grocery business by integrating fresh and perishable items into its existing same-day delivery service for Prime members in over 1,000 cities. This strategic move allows customers to order items like eggs and produce alongside non-perishables and have them delivered together from retrofitted same-day fulfillment hubs. The initiative aims to close the convenience gap with traditional grocers like Walmart and Instacart by leveraging Amazon's powerful logistics network.
