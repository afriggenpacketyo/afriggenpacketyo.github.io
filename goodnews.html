          <p>China has approved qualified rare earth export applications and expressed willingness to deepen dialogue with other nations regarding export controls. This comes as rare earths, a strategic resource, remain central to Beijing's trade negotiations with Washington. The Chinese Ministry of Commerce stated it has observed growing global demand for medium and heavy rare earths, particularly in sectors like robotics and new energy vehicles. Rare earth export controls are expected to be a key topic when Vice-Premier He Lifeng meets with US trade and Treasury officials in London this week.</p>

          <p>A new study suggests that subsidizing men's participation in household chores and childcare could help reverse declining birth rates in countries like China. The research argues that subsidies for fathers produce greater long-term fertility gains than solely subsidizing mothers. China faces a rapidly aging population, shrinking workforce, and strained social welfare system, making the decline in fertility rates particularly urgent. The study highlights the persistence of traditional expectations that place the burden of childcare on women, clashing with rapid economic changes.</p>

          <p>NTT Docomo Inc., a Japanese telecom giant, will retire its set of original emoji after 26 years, as Google's emoji have become more common globally. The Docomo emoji were introduced in 1999 with the company's i-mode service and became popular in Japan before spreading globally. The Museum of Modern Art in New York included NTT Docomo's set of 176 emoji in its collection in 2016, recognizing their role in humanizing electronic communication.</p>

          <p>Japan is not doing enough to avoid "toilet panic" in disasters, according to a feature by Kyodo News. After the Noto Peninsula earthquake, public restrooms became unsanitary, highlighting the need for better disaster preparedness. Experts emphasize the importance of maintaining sanitary toilets to save lives. The government is required to make efforts to prevent people from defecating in evacuation center toilets, and it is recommended to stockpile portable toilets at home and in workplaces.</p>

          <h2>European Startups Resist China‚Äôs ‚Äò996‚Äô Work Culture</h2>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>European startup founders are pushing back against pressure to embrace China's grueling '996' work culture, where employees work from 9 a.m. to 9 p.m., six days a week. While some VCs argue overwork is necessary to compete globally, many founders insist it is unsustainable and detrimental to employee well-being. Instead, they advocate for increased funding and resources to foster innovation and scale effectively. They emphasize that Europe's success lies in sustainable innovation cultures and access to capital rather than overworking employees.</p>
