          <p>Rivian Automotive beat Wall Street's expectations for the first quarter, but adjusted its 2025 targets for vehicle deliveries and capital spending due to tariff pressures. The company acknowledged the impact of the global economic environment, particularly evolving trade regulations and tariffs, on consumer sentiment. Despite this, Rivian reconfirmed plans to achieve a modest positive gross profit this year. The automaker achieved its second consecutive quarter of gross profit during the first quarter, unlocking an expected $1 billion from Volkswagen Group as part of its investment in Rivian following the formation of their joint venture.</p>

          <p>The UK and India have agreed to a trade deal aimed at boosting trade between the two nations by an estimated ¬£25.5 billion a year by 2040.

UK consumers are expected to benefit from lower tariffs on goods coming from India, while UK firms will gain from expanded exports to India. The deal also includes provisions on the services sector and procurement, allowing British firms to compete for more contracts.</p>

          <p>Tariffs enacted by President Trump are expected to raise prices on flowers ahead of Mother's Day. While Mr. Trump paused hefty tariffs he announced in early April for 90 days, a 10% baseline tariff on all U.S. imports is in effect. About 80% of flowers bought in the United States are grown elsewhere, with the bulk coming from Colombia and Ecuador. Some florists say they'll try not to pass on costs to customers, while others are trying to source more wild, local flowers to avoid the tariffs.</p>
