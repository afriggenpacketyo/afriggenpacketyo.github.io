          <p>The Japanese government has begun releasing its stockpiled rice through direct contracts with retailers in an effort to lower the soaring price of rice. Major supermarket operator Ito-Yokado Co. and home appliance company Iris Ohyama Inc. were the first to start selling the rice at a reduced price of 2,160 yen ($15) for a 5 kilogram-bag. The initiative aims to alleviate the financial burden on households struggling with rising rice costs, and the cheaper rice has been met with enthusiasm by consumers, with some stores selling out within minutes. This measure is a response to the increasing financial strain on Japanese households. (not investment advice)</p>
