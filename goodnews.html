          <p>American Eagle shares surged following the announcement of a limited-edition collaboration with football star Travis Kelce, whose recent engagement to Taylor Swift generated significant public attention. The partnership, which was over a year in the making, sees Kelce's Tru Kolors brand teaming up with American Eagle for a collection that includes vintage-inspired T-shirts and revamped varsity jackets. This article highlights how the news of the celebrity engagement also briefly boosted shares of other companies like Signet Jewelers, and prompted various brands to leverage the event for their own promotions. The collaboration aims to capitalize on Kelce's current high profile, though American Eagle previously faced criticism for a separate campaign with actress Sydney Sweeney.</p>

She candidly recounted the significant challenges she faced with sleep training Jaxon, who, after learning to walk, consistently came into her room every single night for four years. Cavallari explained that while she values these moments, their presence in her bed in the mornings creates a need for her to be extremely quiet during her own routine.

          <p>Kohl's shares surged over 20% after the retailer surpassed Wall Street's expectations for its fiscal second-quarter earnings and revenue, despite an overall decline in sales. The company narrowed its full-year sales guidance and revised its earnings per share outlook upwards, signaling cautious optimism. Interim CEO Michael Bender attributed slower sales to economic pressures on lower and middle-income customers, but outlined efforts to improve performance, including reintroducing petite sections and overhauling discount strategies. This article notes that while the retailer's market value has declined significantly in recent years amid leadership turmoil, the latest results reflect progress in inventory reduction and customer engagement.

          <p>United States Ryder Cup captain Keegan Bradley, 39, has announced his decision not to select himself as a player for the upcoming match against Europe at Bethpage Black. Bradley, who is the youngest US captain since Arnold Palmer in 1963, revealed his six wildcard picks to complete his 12-member team for the event. Despite his world ranking and previous backing from President Donald Trump for a playing-captain role, Bradley chose to focus entirely on his captaincy duties. This article highlights the finalization of the US team, while Europe's captain Luke Donald is set to announce his own six picks on September 1 as they prepare to defend their title.</p>

          <p>An analysis of U.S. container data reveals that retailers like Abercrombie & Fitch, Best Buy, and Five Below are employing distinct "front-loading" strategies to manage the impact of tariffs. Abercrombie & Fitch benefits from a diversified supply chain, while Best Buy, less reliant on China, pulled forward freight in June, albeit less than in 2024. Discount retailer Five Below, despite high exposure to Chinese tariffs, leverages its flexible inventory to adapt. This article explains that these varied approaches reflect each company's product categories and customer base, with experts predicting tariffs will be a larger headwind in the latter half of the year, particularly for general merchandise retailers.

          <p>A Chinese woman, identified only by her surname Zhou, was dramatically rescued after being trapped in a locked guesthouse room for 30 hours in China's Sichuan province. She had entered the bedroom without her phone, only to discover a malfunctioning lock prevented her exit, leaving her without food or a toilet on the sixth floor. In a desperate bid for help, Zhou bit her finger and used her own blood to write "110 625" – the emergency number and her room number – on a pillow, which she then threw out the window. A vigilant food delivery driver, Zhang Kun, noticed the distress call and promptly alerted the police, leading to Zhou's successful rescue and a reward for Zhang.</p>

This substantial increase indicates a strategic shift in focus towards Central Asia, while funding in regions like Europe, East Asia, and the Middle East has seen a reduction. Kazakhstan has become the leading destination for Chinese capital, receiving $23 billion in the first six months, notably including a $12 billion aluminum complex.

The article notes that despite antitrust concerns, Google's search dominance remains strong, even in markets like Europe where users are prompted to choose search engines.

This campaign involved the non-consensual insertion of intrauterine devices (IUDs) into roughly half of Greenland's 9,000 Inuit women, resulting in many experiencing sterility and various physical or psychological problems. Frederiksen acknowledged "other dark chapters" of systematic discrimination and accepted responsibility on behalf of Denmark for these failures.
