          <p>A potential tragedy was averted at Hartsfield-Jackson Atlanta International Airport after authorities arrested Billy Cagle, 49, who had threatened to "shoot it up" via social media. His family alerted police, leading to his swift apprehension in the terminal. Officers discovered an AR-15 assault rifle with 27 rounds of ammunition in his parked truck. Cagle, identified as a felon with mental health issues, was believed to be scouting the area before retrieving his weapon. This collaborative effort between concerned family members and law enforcement was praised for preventing a mass shooting at the world's busiest airport, highlighting the importance of community vigilance.</p>

          <p>A hobbyist's discovery of a human skull on an Indiana riverbank led to the astonishing revelation that it is approximately 4,270 years old. Found near the West Fork of the Whitewater River, the skull likely belonged to a Native American from around 2300 B.C. The Fayette County Coroner's Office, after months of forensic and radiocarbon analyses, is now working with the Indiana Department of Natural Resources and the Miami Tribe of Oklahoma to determine next steps for repatriation and site management. This remarkable archaeological find highlights the rich, ancient history of the region and the ongoing efforts to respectfully manage such discoveries, despite current challenges posed by the government shutdown.</p>

        </div>
        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>White House economic advisor Kevin Hassett expressed optimism that the government shutdown could conclude this week, hinting at a potential shift from moderate Democrats. He cautioned that failure to reach an agreement might lead the Trump administration to impose "stronger measures" to force negotiations. The shutdown, now spanning three weeks, is fueled by a partisan impasse over federal funding, where Republicans push for a short-term resolution while Democrats insist on including expanded Affordable Care Act tax credits. Hassett's remarks underscore the political maneuvering surrounding the budget, with both sides navigating public opinion and legislative leverage in the ongoing dispute. (not investment advice)</p>

          <h2>Jim Cramer Advocates Holding Apple Stock Amid Record Rally Driven by Strong Product Cycle</h2>
          <div class="timestamp">2025-10-20 18:39:33 EDT</div>
        </div>
        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>CNBC's Jim Cramer asserted that Apple's recent surge to a record high, fueled by bullish analyst calls, reinforces the strategy of holding rather than trading the stock. He cited the strong demand for the iPhone 17 lineup and Apple's ability to monetize its ecosystem, such as Google paying over $20 billion to be the default search engine, as key drivers. Cramer criticized investors who sold during negative sentiment, missing the rally, and suggested Apple could apply a similar monetization approach to artificial intelligence. This article emphasizes Apple's enduring product strength and market influence, despite earlier skepticism from some analysts and traders. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>Panama's Minister of Canal Affairs, Jose Ramon Icaza, revealed the government is exploring options for CK Hutchison's concession to operate the Balboa and Cristobal ports, following legal challenges. The 25-year contract, renewed in 2021, faces potential nullification by the Supreme Court due to alleged procedural missteps. Icaza outlined a contingency plan for the Panama Maritime Authority to take control, ensuring no disruption to the supply chain. He also highlighted the possibility of a mutual agreement with CK Hutchison to facilitate an "orderly transition" of the port concessions, signaling a proactive approach to this significant infrastructure and business dispute.

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>This opinion article critically examines the Western lens through which China is often viewed, arguing that it risks an avoidable war. The author suggests that the "Thucydides Trap" framework, rooted in Western historical narratives of rising and ruling powers, leads to a misinterpretation of China's intentions. Instead of projecting its own history of conquest, the West must understand China's unique 5,000-year cultural DNA, shaped by defending its land-bound agricultural heartlands rather than outward expansion. The article advocates for shattering this "conceptual trap" and adopting a more nuanced understanding of China to prevent a potentially catastrophic conflict.</p>

          <p>Cannabis-infused beverages, featuring THC and sometimes CBD, are rapidly gaining traction as Americans increasingly reduce their alcohol consumption. A recent Gallup survey shows U.S. adult alcohol intake at its lowest since 1939, partly due to growing beliefs that even moderate drinking is unhealthy. The market for THC beverages is forecast to expand dramatically, from $1.1 billion to nearly $5.6 billion by 2035, with many brands promoting them as healthier, low-calorie, non-alcoholic alternatives. While major retailers like Target are exploring sales, medical experts advise caution regarding potential side effects such as anxiety, paranoia, and impaired coordination.
