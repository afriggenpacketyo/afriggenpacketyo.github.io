        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>The consumer price index (CPI) for April 2025 showed a decrease in inflation, with a 2.3% increase over the past 12 months, the smallest since February 2021, primarily driven by lower prices for groceries and gasoline. Economists, however, warn that tariffs imposed by President Trump could reignite inflation, potentially impacting the May CPI report. Current tariff policies could cost the average U.S. household an additional $2,800 in the short term, with a 10% average tariff potentially adding 1 percentage point to the CPI within six to nine months. Some economists suggest early signs of tariff effects, such as increases in audio and photographic equipment prices, were already visible in the April report. (not investment advice)</p>

The U.S. had designated Syria as a State Sponsor of Terrorism since 1979, with additional sanctions imposed in 2004 and 2011. Trump expressed hope that Syria would emulate Saudi Arabia's success.</p>

          <p>Senate Minority Leader Chuck Schumer announced he is blocking Department of Justice political nominations to protest President Trump's plan to accept a luxury jet from Qatar. Schumer described the move as corrupt and a national security threat, demanding Attorney General Pam Bondi testify before Congress to explain why the gift doesn't violate the Emoluments Clause. This action slows down the confirmation process, although Republicans hold a majority in the Senate. Trump's plan to accept the jet has faced criticism from both Democrats and some Republicans due to legal and ethical concerns.</p>

Researchers found only one home with benzene levels slightly above the state's limit, which can be resolved by flushing the lines. The quick restoration of safe drinking water is attributed to the hard work of local utilities and state regulators, following a post-fire playbook developed after previous fires. Experts emphasize the importance of homeowners flushing their pipes to ensure complete removal of contaminants.</p>
