          <p>A bear sighting on a golf course in central Japan led to the cancellation of the final round of the Twinfields Ladies tournament, marking the second time in two weeks that wild animals have disrupted a pro golf event. Reina Maeda, the leader after the second round, was declared the winner. This incident highlights the increasing human-animal encounters in Japan, where bear attacks have reached record levels due to climate change affecting food sources and depopulation leading bears into towns more frequently. The Japanese government has approved a bill allowing hunters to shoot bears in populated areas.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Politicians are trying to boost manufacturing, prompting an examination of whether these jobs are truly special. Economists debate if romanticizing this sector is rational, with some citing nostalgia over practical benefits for workers and the economy. Research indicates that manufacturing jobs still offer a wage premium, especially for those without a college education, though this premium varies by subsector. Factors contributing to this premium include a history of unionization, the handling of expensive machinery, and potentially unpleasant working conditions, but the industry may also offer opportunities to those without college degrees.</p>

          <h2>China's Greenhouse Gas Emissions Fall Amid Clean Energy Expansion</h2>
          <div class="timestamp">2025-05-27 06:30:00 EDT</div>
        </div>
        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>China, the world‚Äôs largest greenhouse gas emitter, has experienced a drop in overall greenhouse gas emissions for the first time, even as energy demand increased. This decline is largely attributed to the country‚Äôs aggressive deployment of wind, solar, and nuclear power, which outpaced electricity demand growth. The shift puts China ahead of schedule in meeting its climate targets, as it had committed to peaking emissions before 2030. China's role as a major producer of clean energy technologies also benefits developing countries, but the sustainability of this decline depends on economic growth and trade dynamics.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Researchers are exploring the potential to delay or eliminate menopause, challenging long-held assumptions about women's reproductive health. Newer treatments aim to slow ovarian aging, potentially reducing the risk of illnesses associated with menopause, such as cardiovascular disease and osteoporosis. While extending ovarian lifespan could offer significant health benefits, it also raises ethical questions about societal pressures on women to remain young and fertile. Experts emphasize the importance of balancing medical advancements with the need to accept aging and prioritize overall well-being.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Shipments of iPhones from India to the U.S. surged by 76% in April, while shipments from China fell by 76%, due to Apple's efforts to diversify its manufacturing base amidst the trade war. Apple's shift to India began during the COVID-19 pandemic to mitigate the impact of tariffs. However, growth in India's iPhone shipments is expected to plateau as manufacturing capacity is not growing quickly enough to meet U.S. demand. President Trump has threatened tariffs on iPhone shipments from India, pushing for domestic manufacturing.</p>
