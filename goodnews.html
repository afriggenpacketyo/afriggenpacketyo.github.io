        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>A federal judge has ruled that the Trump administration's efforts, spearheaded by the Department of Government Efficiency (DOGE) and Elon Musk, to dismantle the U.S. Institute of Peace (USIP) were unlawful and a 'gross usurpation of power'. The judge ordered the reinstatement of George Moose as acting president, stating that the administration's actions to dismantle USIP, including the removal of board members and staff, were illegitimate. The court emphasized USIP's independence from the executive branch, highlighting its role as a think tank supporting both executive and legislative bodies, dealing a blow to the administration's efforts to slash the size of the federal government. The White House has not yet responded to the ruling.</p>

          <p>JPMorgan Chase will now permit its clients to purchase bitcoin, a significant move for the largest U.S. bank, despite CEO Jamie Dimon's longstanding criticism of cryptocurrency. While the bank will not custody the bitcoin, it will include it in client statements. Dimon, a known skeptic, cited concerns such as money laundering, lack of ownership clarity, sexual assault, and terrorism associated with the digital currency. He likened his stance to defending the right to smoke, even though he personally disapproves. This decision reflects the increasing acceptance of bitcoin into mainstream investing.</p>

          <p>Richard Garwin, the physicist who designed the world's first hydrogen bomb, has died at age 97, leaving behind a complex legacy of nuclear weaponry and efforts to counter its dangers. Garwin's role in designing the H-bomb was largely obscured for decades, even from his family, as he advised presidents and dedicated his life to undoing the potential devastation his creation could cause. Inspired by a conversation with Enrico Fermi, Garwin felt a responsibility to speak out on public policy issues related to nuclear arms control. Throughout his career, he advised 13 presidents and worked to advance arms control measures, viewing his efforts as a mission to save the world from his own creation.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>With credit card balances still high and interest rates remaining elevated, it is crucial for borrowers to consider several key factors when tackling their debt. Credit card interest rates are unlikely to decline materially soon, and debt compounds daily, making it difficult to pay off. Borrowers should explore debt relief options tailored to their specific circumstances, such as debt consolidation loans, debt management programs, or credit counseling. In some cases, credit card debt forgiveness programs may be an option, potentially eliminating a significant portion of the debt. (not investment advice)</p>
