She shared on social media that she and her baby are fine but that she required surgery for a wound on her thigh, describing it as the "worst day of my life." Officials are investigating the incident to determine the type of shark involved. Gallinari, a native of Italy, played in the NBA for 16 seasons before retiring in 2024.</p>

The top two finishers, Lunden Esterline and Giuseppe Puebla, earned the automatic bids for the prestigious junior event.

          <p>A traffic jam with a quirky cause occurred on Interstate-83 in Pennsylvania when a tractor-trailer experienced a mechanical issue and spilled its entire load of hotdogs. The incident, which happened near the Maryland line during the morning commute, resulted in minor injuries for four people and a significant cleanup effort. The fire chief on the scene noted the unusual challenge of the cleanup, stating that hotdogs are surprisingly slippery. The spilled food was deemed garbage and had to be discarded, leaving motorists temporarily steamed over the delay.</p>

          <p>A small clinic in Buffalo, New York, is achieving remarkable success in combating the Hepatitis C epidemic, which affects millions of Americans. La Bodega, a clinic at Erie County Medical Center, uses a model that provides treatment in a single visit, curing about 98% of its more than 7,000 patients. By using new, rapid FDA-approved testing machines, the clinic can confirm a diagnosis and start medication on the same day, removing barriers to care. This success has drawn the attention of policymakers who are considering a national plan to eliminate the disease.</p>

          <p>ESPN is reportedly finalizing a deal to acquire several NFL media properties, including the popular NFL Network and RedZone channel. In return, the NFL will receive an equity stake in ESPN that could be worth billions of dollars, potentially as much as 10%. The agreement, which has been in negotiation for years, would also grant ESPN access to more regular-season games and the league's fantasy football operations. The deal requires regulatory approval and comes as ESPN prepares to launch its own direct-to-consumer streaming service.</p>

          <p>After five years of heightened tensions following a deadly border clash, India and China are taking steps to mend their relationship. New Delhi has resumed issuing visas to Chinese citizens, and China has allowed Indian pilgrims to return to Tibet, signaling a potential diplomatic reset. Direct flights, suspended during the pandemic, are also expected to resume soon. Experts believe these moves, prompted by shifting global alliances and trade dynamics, could pave the way for deeper cooperation, although the unresolved Himalayan border dispute remains a significant obstacle.</p>

          <p>The Los Angeles Dodgers made several moves before the MLB trade deadline to strengthen their team for a playoff run, though they avoided top-market deals. The team added right-handed relievers Brock Stewart and Paul Gervase to improve the bullpen and acquired versatile outfielder Alex Call to add depth to the lineup. Manager Dave Roberts expressed confidence that the new additions will raise the team's floor. The front office hopes the biggest improvements will come from the existing star players on the roster performing more consistently in the final months of the season.</p>

          <p>ByteDance, the parent company of TikTok and Douyin, disclosed internal data on employee tenure during a recent town hall meeting. The social media giant revealed that the median service length for its current 120,000 employees is 2.9 years, with an average tenure of three years. This data was shared to counter online speculation that the company had a much higher turnover rate. The figures suggest that ByteDance is a relatively attractive employer within China's competitive tech industry, which is known for its demanding "996" work culture.</p>

          <p>U.S. Treasury Secretary Justin Bessent has expressed optimism following a week of trade negotiations with Chinese officials in Stockholm. In a social media post, Bessent stated that the talks have "advanced" and that he believes "we have the makings of a deal that will benefit both of our great nations." This positive assessment comes amid mixed messages from the Trump administration regarding its aggressive tariff strategy. A Chinese official also indicated that a pause on new tariff increases would be extended, though this has not yet been confirmed by the U.S. side.</p>

          <p>A federal judge in California has temporarily blocked the Trump administration from terminating Temporary Protected Status (TPS) for tens of thousands of immigrants from Honduras, Nepal, and Nicaragua. The ruling provides a reprieve for over 60,000 people who have been living and working legally in the U.S., some for decades. The judge found that the plaintiffs were likely to succeed in arguing that the decision to end the programs was "preordained" and potentially "motivated by racial animus." The Department of Homeland Security criticized the ruling and stated its intention to appeal.</p>

          <p>A federal appeals court has signaled it may declare President Trump's executive order restricting birthright citizenship unconstitutional, a move that would align with other court rulings against the policy. Judges on the First U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals sharply questioned the Justice Department's argument that the 14th Amendment does not grant citizenship to the U.S.-born children of undocumented parents. The order, which directs agencies to deny citizenship to children without at least one citizen or permanent resident parent, has been blocked by multiple lower courts, and its fate will likely be decided by the Supreme Court.</p>
