          <p>A 15-year-old boy from Gaza, who suffered a shattered jaw from an Israeli tank shell, has become the first child to be brought to the United Kingdom for treatment of war-related injuries. His arrival is part of an initiative called Project Pure Hope, a privately funded group of volunteer medical professionals working to provide UK-based care for critically injured Gazan children. The boy will undergo complex reconstructive surgery at Great Ormond Street children's hospital. This development follows months of advocacy and comes shortly after the UK Prime Minister promised to evacuate more injured children from the conflict zone.</p>

          <p>The Brazilian government has granted Chinese electric vehicle manufacturer BYD a short-term exemption from import taxes, but for a shorter period than the company had requested. BYD will be permitted to import up to $463 million in semi-assembled vehicles tariff-free for the first half of 2026 to support the ramp-up of its new local factory. However, Brazil also decided to accelerate a broader tariff hike, with the import tax on EV kits set to reach 35% in January 2027, a year and a half earlier than planned, representing a compromise amid backlash from domestic auto manufacturers.</p>

        </div>
        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Scientists have identified a new species of stick insect in a remote Australian rainforest that is believed to be the heaviest insect ever found in the country. The new species, named Acrophylla alta, measures 40 centimeters long and weighs 44 grams, comparable to a golf ball. It was discovered in the high-altitude canopies of the Wet Tropics region in Far North Queensland. Researchers suggest its large body mass may be an evolutionary adaptation to survive the colder conditions of its high-altitude habitat, which has also kept it hidden from discovery until now.</p>

          <p>Amid economic uncertainty, some pre-retirees are considering rolling over their 401(k) savings into an annuity to secure a guaranteed income stream. With interest rates remaining elevated, annuities are currently offering attractive payout rates, providing a potential buffer against market volatility and inflation. However, this article cautions that such a move is not suitable for everyone, as annuities often come with high fees, surrender charges, and limited liquidity, which can restrict financial flexibility. A partial rollover is suggested as a possible compromise to balance security with growth potential. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>The U.S. Department of Defense has reversed its recent decision to stop sharing crucial satellite weather data that forecasters rely on, particularly for tracking hurricanes. The Navy had planned to phase out the data flow as part of a modernization effort, but it reconsidered after receiving significant feedback from government partners and scientists. The information, which helps monitor storm formation and sea ice levels, is considered vital for providing timely and accurate hurricane warnings. The data will now continue to be shared until the satellite sensor fails or the program formally concludes in 2026.</p>

          <p>The San Diego Padres have significantly bolstered their pitching staff by acquiring All-Star closer Mason Miller and left-handed pitcher JP Sears from the Oakland Athletics in a major trade deadline deal. Miller, known for his 101mph fastball, has 20 saves this season and is under team control through 2029. In exchange, the Athletics received a package of prospects, including highly-touted shortstop Leo De Vries. The trade signals the Padres' intent to make a strong push for the postseason, as they currently hold the final National League wildcard spot.</p>

          <p>The Pentagon has announced the withdrawal of approximately 1,350 National Guard members from Los Angeles, nearly two months after their controversial deployment to support federal immigration raids. The troops' presence was fiercely contested by California's Democratic leaders, including Governor Gavin Newsom, who sued the federal government, calling the deployment an illegal usurpation of state power. Newsom's office stated that President Trump's 'political theater backfired,' as the troops had a limited role and their presence was seen as an unnecessary militarization that inflamed local tensions. About 250 Guard members will remain to protect federal buildings.</p>

Initially gaining fame in Asia, the dolls' profile was elevated globally by celebrities like Lisa of Blackpink, turning them into a status symbol.

          <p>A late-stage trial by Eli Lilly showed its blockbuster diabetes drug, Mounjaro, offered significant heart health benefits when compared directly to its older treatment, Trulicity. While Mounjaro was found to be at least as effective as Trulicity in reducing major cardiovascular events, it also demonstrated a 16% lower rate of death from any cause and provided greater kidney protection. These comprehensive results are expected to strengthen Mounjaro's position as a first-choice treatment for patients with Type 2 diabetes, who face a higher risk of heart disease, ahead of Trulicity's patent expiration in 2027.</p>
