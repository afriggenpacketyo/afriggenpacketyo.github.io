The species, found in Mongolia, is considered the closest known ancestor of all tyrannosaurs, including T. rex. The discovery provides insights into how tyrannosaurs evolved from small hunters to formidable giants. The new species also shows early evolutionary stages of features that were key to the tyrannosaurs' tyranny, including skull anatomy that gave it a strong jaw.
