          <h2>Los Angeles Carves Out Curfew Exemption for Downtown Arts Venues</h2>
          <div class="timestamp">2025-06-12 19:08:00 EDT</div>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Los Angeles city officials have created a curfew exemption for ticket holders attending indoor events at downtown performing arts venues, including the Music Center, allowing evening performances to proceed. This decision follows the implementation of an 8 p.m.-to-6 a.m. curfew in the civic center area, which has negatively impacted arts organizations, restaurants, and other businesses. While some events, like a performance by Ozomatli and a Metro Art event, have been postponed, L.A. Opera will continue with its scheduled performances, requiring attendees to leave immediately after the show and carry proof of attendance. The exemption aims to balance public safety with the cultural and economic vitality of downtown Los Angeles.</p>
