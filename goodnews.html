          <p>President Donald Trump announced a 90-day extension of existing tariffs on Mexican goods, postponing a threatened increase to 30% to allow for further trade negotiations. The current duties include a 25% tariff on most imports and cars, along with a 50% tariff on metals. The decision followed what the president described as a successful discussion with Mexican President Claudia Sheinbaum. Trump also stated that Mexico agreed to terminate its non-tariff trade barriers, though specific details were not provided, as both nations aim to finalize a comprehensive trade deal within the next three months.

          <p>Comcast reported second-quarter earnings and revenue that surpassed Wall Street expectations, causing its stock to rise despite a continued decline in broadband customers. The company lost 226,000 broadband subscribers, which was fewer than anticipated, as it implements a new market strategy with revised pricing and simplified service tiers to combat intense competition. While the traditional pay-TV business continued to shrink, Comcast saw record growth in its mobile division, adding 378,000 new lines. The content and experiences segment, including NBCUniversal and theme parks, also saw strong revenue growth, boosted by successful film releases and the new Epic Universe park.

While Bessent expressed confidence after two days of tough negotiations in Stockholm, he noted that some technical details still need to be resolved and that he has not yet discussed the specifics with President Trump.

          <h2>Study Suggests Potatoes Evolved from an Ancient Hybrid of Tomato and Another Plant</h2>

        </div>
        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>A new genetic study proposes a surprising evolutionary origin for the potato, suggesting its lineage began from the hybridization of an ancient tomato and a different nightshade plant. This chance encounter, occurring 8 to 9 million years ago, resulted in a new plant that, unlike its parents, could form tubers. This unique adaptation allowed the proto-potato to thrive in colder, drier climates and propagate asexually, leading to the diversification of over 100 potato species, including the modern cultivated crop. The finding challenges previous views of hybridization as an evolutionary dead end, showing it can sometimes produce radical and successful new traits.</p>

          <p>JPMorgan Chase has reached a major milestone in its expansion strategy, opening its 1,000th new branch since 2018 in Charlotte, North Carolina. This aggressive growth has given JPMorgan the largest branch network in the U.S., with approximately 5,000 locations, and has solidified its presence in all 48 lower states. The expansion counters a long-term trend of branch closures across the banking industry and comes as competitors like Bank of America also announce plans to grow their physical footprints. The bank's investment aims to capture more deposits in fast-growing markets, with newer branches expected to contribute over $160 billion in deposits. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>The European Union is operating under the assumption that a 15% U.S. tariff on most of its exports will take effect on Friday, following a political agreement between President Trump and EU Commission President von der Leyen. However, a key joint statement clarifying the terms, including exemptions for strategic goods like aircraft and certain chemicals, has not yet been finalized. An EU spokesman stated that the U.S. has committed to the 15% ceiling and exemptions, and the ball is now in their court to implement them. This development aims to avert a wider trade war after Trump had previously threatened tariffs as high as 30%. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>CVS Health delivered second-quarter earnings and revenue that exceeded Wall Street estimates, leading to a more than 6% jump in its share price. The company raised its adjusted profit forecast for the fiscal year, citing strong performance in its retail pharmacy business and improvements in its Aetna insurance unit, which has been managing high medical costs. The positive results were driven by higher pharmacy volume and new pricing models, though they were partially offset by a decline in the health services segment. This marks the third full quarter under CEO David Joyner, who is overseeing a broad turnaround plan for the company. (not investment advice)</p>

While acknowledging the long-term potential of AI, Field expressed skepticism that a "superintelligence" capable of replacing human creativity and complex software development is approaching quickly. He argued that Figma's complex graphics engine and proprietary technology are not easily replicable by current AI models. The company, which recently priced its IPO at $33 per share for a valuation of $19.3 billion, is set to begin trading on the NYSE.</p>

          <p>The United States is planning a new measure to restrict exports of high-quality copper scrap, requiring at least 25% to be retained for domestic use starting in 2027. The goal is to bolster domestic supply chains for the critical metal, which is vital for construction and the power grid. Currently, the U.S. exports nearly one million metric tons of copper scrap annually, with a significant portion going to China. Analysts suggest that if this scrap were processed domestically, it could substantially reduce the country's reliance on imports of refined copper, though industry sources question how the opaque scrap market could be effectively policed.

          <p>An independent regulatory commission has cleared West Ham midfielder Lucas Paqueta of charges that he deliberately received yellow cards to influence betting markets. The English Football Association had charged the Brazilian international with four breaches related to spot-fixing, which could have resulted in a lifetime ban. After a nearly two-year investigation, the commission found the four charges to be "not proven." However, Paqueta was found guilty of two separate charges for failing to cooperate with the investigation, and he will face a sanction for those breaches at a later date. Paqueta has maintained his innocence throughout the entire process.</p>
