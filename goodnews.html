          <p>The FDA has approved Moderna's new COVID-19 vaccine, mNexspike, for adults 65 and older and individuals aged 12 to 64 with health conditions that increase their risk from the coronavirus. This approval adds another option to combat COVID-19, but it comes with restrictions that differentiate it from Moderna's existing vaccine, Spikevax, which is available for anyone ages 6 months and older. The new vaccine uses a lower dose and targets the immune system more precisely. The restrictions reflect concerns from Health Secretary Robert F. Kennedy Jr. and other Trump officials, marking a departure from previous COVID-19 vaccine policies.</p>

          <p>Cameron Norrie beat fellow British player Jacob Fearnley in a French Open third-round match, which was disrupted by fireworks from nearby Paris St-Germain's stadium. Norrie won 6-3, 7-6 (7-1), 6-2, using his experience to overcome the distractions, which he described as hard to manage. The former world number eight subdued French Open debutant Fearnley, who called the noise "brutal" but didn't attribute his loss to it. Norrie advances to the last 16 of the clay-court Grand Slam for the first time, potentially facing Novak Djokovic. </p>
