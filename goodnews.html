          <p>Martha's Rule, which empowers families to request an urgent second medical opinion for deteriorating loved ones, is now being rolled out across all acute hospitals in England. This significant expansion follows a successful pilot program in 143 sites since April 2024, where nearly 5,000 calls led to 241 potentially life-saving interventions, including changes in treatment and improved communication. The initiative, championed by Martha Mills' parents after her death from sepsis due to care failings, aims to foster a more equitable doctor-patient relationship. Martha's mother expressed delight at the broader access, underscoring the proven need for the rule and advocating for its further extension across the entire UK, including maternity care.</p>

          <p>The BBC has launched an interactive online tool, "Cooler Than Me?", designed to allow users to compare their local weather conditions with forecasts from cities across the globe. This engaging feature taps into the cultural observation that complaining about the weather is a "true national sport" in Britain, offering a fun way to ascertain if other locations genuinely experience more sunshine. By enabling direct comparisons, the tool provides a unique perspective on diverse climatic patterns and encourages users to explore meteorological data. It also serves as a gateway to the broader BBC Weather website for up-to-date forecasts, promoting a lighthearted yet informative approach to understanding global weather.</p>

        </div>
        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>European stock markets are poised for a slightly higher open as investors closely monitor the legal battle surrounding President Donald Trump's trade tariffs. A federal appeals court recently ruled most of these tariffs illegal, leading Trump to petition the Supreme Court for an expedited review. Major European indices, including the FTSE, DAX, and CAC 40, are projected to see modest increases. Beyond the tariff developments, traders are also focused on key economic data releases, such as the latest EU retail sales figures and upcoming U.S. labor market reports, including the ADP private payrolls and jobless claims. These reports are crucial for shaping the near-term outlook of an already sensitive global stock market. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>The Powerball jackpot has surged to an estimated $1.7 billion for the upcoming Saturday drawing, establishing itself as the second-largest in the lottery's history. This significant increase occurred after no winning tickets were sold for Wednesday's $1.4 billion grand prize. The estimated cash value for the Saturday jackpot stands at $770.3 million before taxes. This current streak marks the sixth instance in Powerball's 33-year history where the jackpot has exceeded $1 billion, with the last top prize winner recorded on May 31. The odds of securing the grand prize remain statistically challenging, at 1 in 292.2 million.</p>

His victory extends an impressive 16-0 unbeaten record against Italian opponents and marks his fifth consecutive major semi-final appearance. Sinner is now set to face Felix Auger-Aliassime, as he pursues his goal of becoming the first man since Roger Federer in 2008 to successfully defend the US Open title, showcasing his formidable authority on hard courts.</p>

          <p>Asia-Pacific markets exhibited a mixed performance on Thursday, primarily influenced by an overnight tech rally on Wall Street, even as broader economic concerns persisted. Japan's Nikkei 225 saw an increase, although shares of Nidec Corp experienced a significant plunge following allegations of improper accounting. Australia's S&P/ASX 200 benchmark rose, buoyed by positive household spending data for July, while South Korea's Kospi index also traded higher. In contrast, Hong Kong's Hang Seng index reversed course to fall, and mainland China's CSI 300 retreated. Global bond markets are also under scrutiny, with the U.S. 30-year Treasury yield surpassing 5% after a court decision regarding Trump administration tariffs raised questions about future government revenues.

          <p>A recent survey conducted by the Chicago Council on Global Affairs and The Carter Center has shed light on the nuanced and flexible perspectives held by ordinary Chinese citizens regarding their nation's rivalry with the United States and its alliances. The findings indicate a public that is largely optimistic about China's future, economic trajectory, military strength, and cultural influence. Notably, nearly half of the respondents expressed a preference for China to assume a "shared leadership role" on the global stage, which experts interpret as an inclination towards peaceful coexistence with the United States and Western nations. This nuanced sentiment could potentially offer pathways to de-escalate US-China tensions, although the survey's authors acknowledge the possibility of self-censorship influencing some responses.</p>

          <p>A US federal court has decisively overturned the Trump administration's freeze of billions in research funding for Harvard University, ruling that the government violated the Ivy League college's First Amendment free speech rights. Judge Allison Burroughs concluded that the administration's actions constituted "a targeted, ideologically-motivated assault on this country's premier universities," suggesting antisemitism was used as a "smokescreen" rather than the true objective. While acknowledging Harvard's past failings in addressing antisemitism, the judge emphasized the lack of connection between the funding cuts and the issue. The White House, however, has vowed to appeal the "egregious decision," maintaining that Harvard does not have a constitutional right to taxpayer funds and remains ineligible for future grants.</p>

This initiative underscores China's ambition to deepen economic cooperation and expand its presence in the global aviation market, particularly within Southeast Asia, where its smaller C909 regional jets have already accumulated 470,000 passenger trips.

          <p>Xiaohongshu, a popular Chinese social media platform often likened to Instagram, has experienced a remarkable 19% surge in its valuation over just three months, now standing at $31 billion in transactions recorded by a GSR Ventures Management fund. This substantial increase underscores the robust investor appetite for a Chinese equivalent to Instagram, particularly as its competitor, TikTok, faces ongoing threats of a ban in the United States. The company's accelerated growth is indicative of a resurgence in investor confidence within China's start-up ecosystem, partly driven by the government's commitment to supporting private enterprises. Xiaohongshu, known as RedNote in the US, constituted a dominant 92% of the GSR fund's total assets as of June, highlighting its considerable market influence. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>Former Republican Senator John E. Sununu is seriously contemplating a bid to return to the Senate, representing New Hampshire, after receiving encouragement from both state constituents and senior White House officials. The upcoming 2026 election presents an open seat, as Democratic Sen. Jeanne Shaheen will not be seeking re-election, creating a significant opportunity for the GOP in a state that has historically proven challenging for Republican Senate candidates since 2010. Sununu, a member of a prominent political dynasty, intends to spend the next month traveling across the state to gather support and finalize his decision. Should he enter the race, he would likely face a competitive GOP primary, potentially against figures like Scott Brown and State Sen. Dan Innis.</p>

The artwork, valued at approximately $50,000, originally belonged to Dutch-Jewish art collector Jacques Goudstikker, who died while attempting to escape Amsterdam in 1940, leading to his extensive collection being seized by the Nazis and later acquired by Hermann Göring. The painting was located after Dutch journalists, researching a Nazi lawyer who fled to Argentina, identified it in an online real estate listing in Mar del Plata. Two of the lawyer's daughters have since been placed under house arrest, facing charges of concealment and obstruction of justice, marking a significant step in art restitution efforts.</p>

Sydney Sweeney's "Great Jeans" campaign, which generated 40 billion impressions and quickly sold out her signature jeans, even garnered attention from President Trump despite sparking public debate. The company also projected an additional $70 million in tariff-related costs for the second half of its financial year, though these impacts have been partially mitigated through supplier negotiations and strategic price adjustments.
