          <h2>UK to Extend Bereavement Leave for Early Miscarriages</h2>
          <div class="timestamp">2025-07-07 04:33:51 EDT</div>
        </div>
        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>The UK government plans to amend the Employment Rights Bill, granting parents legal entitlement to bereavement leave for miscarriages occurring before 24 weeks of pregnancy. Currently, leave is only available for losses after 24 weeks or the death of a child under 18. This significant change aims to provide crucial time for grieving, acknowledging pregnancy loss at any stage as a profound bereavement rather than just sick leave. Deputy Prime Minister Angela Rayner emphasized that no one experiencing such heartbreak should return to work before they are ready, a sentiment strongly supported by campaigners who have long advocated for this vital recognition in law.</p>

          <p>Former multiple world champion Ricky Hatton, aged 47, has announced his return to boxing after a 13-year retirement from the sport. He is set to fight the UAE's Eisa Al Dah in a middleweight bout on December 2 in Dubai. Hatton confirmed his comeback via livestream during a show promoted by Al Dah, despite accidentally injuring his eye with sunglasses, which prevented his in-person attendance at the announcement. Hatton expressed his excitement and assured fans the injury was not permanent, eagerly anticipating his return to the professional boxing ring after such a long hiatus.</p>

          <div class="timestamp">2025-07-07 04:04:00 EDT</div>
        </div>
        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Denmark, during its six-month EU Council presidency, is prioritizing the "green" agenda, despite a recent shift in European policy away from climate issues due to geopolitical realities and economic concerns. Climate and Energy Minister Lars Aagaard emphasizes framing the green transition as crucial for Europe's military independence and economic competitiveness, reducing reliance on fossil fuels. While ambitious EU emissions targets are enshrined in law, lower-profile green legislation faces challenges as some member states prioritize easing burdens on businesses. Denmark seeks to keep climate action moving by linking it to broader security and economic resilience, navigating skepticism from countries like Italy, Czechia, and Poland regarding ambitious emission cuts.</p>

          <p>A recent report reveals that 50 of the world's top 100 AI experts work at research institutes or companies in China and are of Chinese origin. Additionally, half of the 20 top AI experts in the US are also of Chinese descent, bringing the total to 65 out of 100 Chinese-origin scientists globally. The analysis, spanning from 2015 to 2024, covered over 96,000 high-level papers from leading publications and conferences in the sector. This significant presence underscores China's growing prominence and substantial influence in the global field of artificial intelligence research and development, highlighting a notable shift in the landscape of scientific expertise.</p>

          <p>Artificial intelligence semiconductor startup Groq, a competitor to Nvidia, announced the establishment of its first European data center in Helsinki, Finland, in partnership with Equinix. This expansion aims to capitalize on rising AI service demand in Europe, particularly in the Nordics, known for easy access to renewable energy and cooler climates. Groq's Language Processing Units (LPUs) are designed for inferencing, a high-volume, lower-margin segment of AI, allowing them to avoid expensive components used by Nvidia. The company boasts rapid deployment, with the Helsinki center expected to be serving traffic within a week of its decision to build. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>British teenager Marcus Fakana, 19, who was jailed in Dubai for having consensual sexual relations with a 17-year-old girl, has been released and returned to the UK. Fakana received a royal pardon from Dubai ruler Sheikh Mohammed bin Rashid Al Maktoum, following a year of imprisonment. The age of consent in the UAE is 18, which led to his conviction after the girl's mother reported him. Campaign group Detained in Dubai highlighted the case, raising concerns about the criminalization of tourists and disproportionate sentencing in the UAE, advocating for expedited legal processes for foreign nationals and safeguards against unnecessary custodial sentences.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Chocolate flavors vary significantly worldwide, influenced by consumer preferences and regional regulations. US chocolate often contains butyric acid, giving it a slightly sour note, and prioritizes a long shelf life, leading to a denser, sweeter product with high sugar content and additives like corn syrup. In contrast, European chocolate, especially from Switzerland and Belgium, emphasizes fine taste and high quality, with stricter regulations on cocoa solids and fat content. Emerging markets like India and Africa are developing their own distinct chocolate cultures, while Japan offers unique flavors like matcha and wasabi KitKats, showcasing global diversity in this popular treat.</p>

          <p>A 14-member team of UK engineers has arrived in India's Kerala to assess and repair a state-of-the-art British F-35B fighter jet, which has been stranded at Thiruvananthapuram airport for over three weeks. The $110 million jet, diverted due to bad weather and then reporting a technical snag, was unable to return to its carrier, HMS Prince of Wales. Its prolonged presence has generated public curiosity and jokes in India, making it a subject of memes. The team, equipped with specialist equipment, will determine if the advanced stealth jet can be repaired on-site or needs to be dismantled for transport.</p>

          <p>China's Commercial Aircraft Corporation of China (Comac) is set to sustain production of its C919 aircraft and expand into foreign markets following the U.S. lifting its ban on selling American jet engine parts and technology. The agreement allows Comac to import components from a GE-invested joint venture, crucial for fulfilling hundreds of C919 orders as China does not yet mass-produce domestic engines. Analysts suggest that while this deal is vital for Comac's immediate growth and EU market ambitions, earlier U.S. export restrictions might still accelerate Beijing's resolve to develop indigenous aviation components.

          <p>Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu's visit to the U.S. and meeting with President Donald Trump has sparked cautious optimism for a Gaza ceasefire. Trump expressed confidence in reaching a deal this week, while Netanyahu stated they are working towards an agreement under agreed conditions. Indirect talks between Israel and Hamas resumed in Qatar on a U.S.-sponsored proposal for a 60-day ceasefire and hostage release. Despite ongoing challenges and Hamas's reservations, the recent war with Iran is seen as creating more favorable conditions for a breakthrough, with both leaders seemingly keen to move on to other regional priorities and Israeli public pressure for a deal growing.</p>
