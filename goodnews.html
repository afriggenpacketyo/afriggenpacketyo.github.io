          <h2>Syria Sanctions Relief Could Benefit Lebanon's Economy</h2>
          <div class="timestamp">2025-05-16 16:10:00 EDT</div>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>The United States is considering lifting sanctions on Syria, a move that could have significant implications for Lebanon. President Joseph Aoun believes that stability in Syria could positively impact Lebanon and the region. The potential lifting of sanctions could lead to increased regional trade, the return of Syrian refugees, and economic recovery for Lebanon, which faces soaring inflation and political turmoil. Analysts suggest that economic integration between Lebanon and Syria could exceed any competition, with the opening of land corridors linking Lebanon to Jordan, Iraq, and the Gulf countries.</p>

          <p>The Illinois House passed legislation requiring more thorough background checks for police officers before hiring, following the death of Sonya Massey, who was killed by a Sangamon County Sheriff's deputy. The legislation, sponsored by state Rep. Kam Buckner, mandates that law enforcement agencies inspect all prior employment records of potential hires. This includes "duty-related physical and psychological fitness-for-duty examinations; work performance records," and any criminal or investigation records. The bill aims to prevent future tragedies by ensuring that concerns about an officer's conduct are shared among police agencies during the hiring process.</p>
