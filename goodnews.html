          <p>Bill Belichick's family is reportedly worried that his relationship with Jordon Hudson could negatively impact his legacy, particularly after Hudson's recent interruption of a CBS interview with Belichick. Hudson has been increasingly involved in Belichick's professional life, including influencing decisions related to his coaching role at UNC. Sources close to the family expressed concerns that Hudson's presence and involvement are detrimental to Belichick's reputation and career, with UNC athletic staff allegedly restricting her access to the football facilities. The article suggests that Belichick's family is actively investigating Hudson's background and influence.</p>

          <p>President Donald Trump suggested that he is willing to lower tariffs on China to 80% ahead of key trade talks, but this level may still be higher than what investors and business leaders were hoping for. He indicated that Treasury Secretary Scott Bessent would be discussing the matter with Chinese counterparts in Switzerland. An 80% tariff would be a substantial reduction from the current 145% tariff on many Chinese goods, however, it is much higher than the 10% baseline tariff in the U.S.-U.K. trade agreement.</p>

          <p>President Donald Trump is scheduled to visit Saudi Arabia, Qatar, and the United Arab Emirates, with a focus on oil, trade, investment deals, and nuclear programs. The trip takes place amid ongoing geopolitical tensions, including Israel-Gaza war ceasefire talks, with Wall Street and Silicon Valley leaders also attending a Saudi-U.S. investment forum. Discussions will likely cover US semiconductor exports, Saudi Arabia's desire for a civilian nuclear program, and potential renaming of the Persian Gulf to the Arabian Gulf. Trump's close relationships with Gulf Arab states may strengthen their negotiating positions, while also raising conflict-of-interest concerns.</p>

          <p>The Trump administration has reached a preliminary trade deal with the United Kingdom, reducing tariffs on British-made cars, eliminating duties on steel and aluminum, and opening the UK market to American farmers. However, the agreement is not a comprehensive trade deal and requires further negotiations and Congressional approval. While the deal is expected to save jobs in the British auto and steel sectors, concerns remain about the impact on US automakers and outstanding issues such as pharmaceuticals and digital services tax.</p>

          <p>Representatives from U.S. forces in Japan and Okinawa authorities convened their first meeting to discuss joint safety measures, following alleged sexual assault cases involving American service members. The U.S. military outlined existing preventive measures, and both sides agreed to work toward holding regular joint community patrols. The forum was launched after revelations of alleged sexual assault cases in June sparked renewed safety concerns among locals, given the high concentration of U.S. military installations in Okinawa.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Japan Rugby League One is planning to change player registration rules to ensure more playing time for Japanese players, starting in the 2026-27 season. The new rules will require at least eight of the 15 players on the pitch to meet certain conditions, such as being Japanese-born. This plan is likely to generate controversy, and aims to give local players more opportunity to participate and develop within the league.</p>
