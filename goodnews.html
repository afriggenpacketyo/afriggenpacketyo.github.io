          <div class="timestamp">2025-09-03 10:05:00 EDT</div>
        </div>
        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Alphabet shares surged 9% following a U.S. District Judge's ruling that largely favored Google in its antitrust case, avoiding the Department of Justice's proposed breakup. Although Google was found to hold an illegal monopoly in internet search, the judge rejected calls to divest its Chrome browser or Android operating system. The company can also continue making payments for preloading products, crucially maintaining its lucrative deal with Apple to be the default search engine on iPhones. This decision is viewed as a "monster win" for Google, significantly reducing regulatory uncertainty and bolstering investor confidence in its core search business and its ambitious AI initiatives, such as Gemini.

          <p>Macy's shares jumped 20% after the retailer reported fiscal second-quarter earnings that significantly surpassed Wall Street expectations, attributing the success to revamped stores and a resilient consumer. The company also raised its full-year earnings and sales guidance, expressing cautious optimism despite previous concerns about tariffs. CEO Tony Spring highlighted the retailer's best comparable sales growth in 12 quarters, driven by strength in key categories across its Macy's, Bloomingdale's, and Bluemercury brands. The CFO noted that further price hikes on certain products are being explored to mitigate ongoing tariff impacts, ensuring continued competitiveness in the market. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>Federal Reserve Governor Christopher Waller, a potential successor for Fed chair, expressed strong support for initiating a rate-cutting cycle in two weeks, arguing the central bank has flexibility to adjust its pace. Waller, who notably dissented from the July FOMC decision to hold rates, believes multiple cuts are warranted over the next few months, seeing current interest rates as significantly above their "neutral" level. While acknowledging tariffs as a consumer tax that could slow growth, he does not foresee a recession in his economic forecast. Waller also emphasized the critical importance of the Fed's independence, despite ongoing concerns surrounding President Trump's actions regarding Governor Lisa Cook. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>Amazon is phasing out its Prime Invitee Program, which previously allowed Prime members to share free shipping benefits with one adult outside their immediate household. Starting October 1, 2025, individuals not residing with the account holder will be required to sign up for their own Prime memberships. The company is transitioning to Amazon Family, which permits sharing benefits with one other adult, four children, and up to four teens, under the strict condition that all members share the same primary residential address. This policy adjustment follows reports of lower-than-expected Prime sign-ups in the U.S. ahead of this year's Prime Day, despite Amazon's assertions of record-breaking global membership growth.</p>

          <p>Houston Astros pitcher Framber Valdez denied deliberately hitting his catcher, César Salazar, with a pitch during a game against the New York Yankees, shortly after giving up a grand slam. The incident, which saw Salazar appear surprised and stare at Valdez, sparked speculation that the pitcher was upset. However, Valdez clarified that they had a "crossed up" play, immediately apologized to Salazar in the dugout, and took full responsibility for the errant pitch. Both players confirmed they had resolved the issue and that everything was "good between us," emphasizing that such misunderstandings can happen in baseball.</p>

          <p>A theft charge against Parviz Jafari, who was accused of stealing flowers from tributes left for rock legend Ozzy Osbourne in Birmingham city center, has been dropped by prosecutors. The court was informed that a security guard had actually granted Jafari permission to take the flowers, thereby undermining the prosecution's ability to prove dishonesty, a key element for conviction. The incident occurred amidst thousands of floral tributes left near the Black Sabbath bench and mural following Osbourne's death in July at age 76. This resolution clarifies a minor legal matter that arose from the public outpouring of grief for the iconic heavy metal pioneer, bringing closure to the case.</p>

          <p>Naomi Osaka has rediscovered her winning form and positivity, preparing for her first Grand Slam quarter-final since 2021 at the US Open. Her resurgence follows a challenging period, including a 14-month break after childbirth and a discouraging Wimbledon exit where she felt apathetic. A key factor in her turnaround was hiring Polish coach Tomasz Wiktorowski, known for guiding Iga Swiatek. Osaka attributes her renewed success to a more encouraging coaching approach, which has restored her renowned ball-striking, confidence, and fighting spirit. This shift has allowed her to enjoy the game again, evident in her strong performances and improved statistics against top opponents, marking a significant comeback.</p>
