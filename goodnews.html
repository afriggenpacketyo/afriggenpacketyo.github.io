          <p>Chinese biotechnology firms are increasingly entering into mega drug-licensing agreements with multinational pharmaceutical companies, driven by the need for cost savings. These deals often utilize a "newco structure," combining traditional intellectual property licensing with fundraising through newly established corporate entities. CSPC Pharmaceutical Group recently announced potential multibillion-dollar deals to license development and marketing rights for its drug candidates, including a targeted cancer therapy. This trend reflects a strategic shift among Chinese biotech firms to leverage their intellectual property amid depressed valuations and seek partnerships with global players.</p>

          <p>The Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) has formally dropped its lawsuit against Binance and founder Changpeng Zhao, concluding one of the last remaining crypto enforcement actions by the agency. The lawsuit, initiated in June 2023, accused Binance of illegally serving U.S. users, inflating trading volumes, and commingling customer funds. This dismissal signifies a potential shift in regulatory approach towards the crypto industry, particularly as the Trump administration aims to be an ally to the sector. Binance is also taking a $2 billion investment from the Emirati state fund MGX entirely in USD1, a stablecoin newly launched by the World Liberty team.</p>
