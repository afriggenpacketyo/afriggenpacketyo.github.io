        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Governor Newsom has signed Senate Bill 79, a landmark piece of legislation aimed at addressing California's housing crisis by increasing density near public transit. The new law, effective in 2026, will override local zoning regulations in eight counties to permit the construction of taller, denser residential buildings near subway, rail, and bus stops. Proponents, including YIMBY groups, praise the move as a crucial step toward creating more affordable housing and promoting public transportation. However, some cities like Los Angeles opposed the bill, arguing it undermines local control over development.</p>

          <p>The Department of Labor will temporarily bring back furloughed staff to complete and release September's consumer price index (CPI) report, despite the ongoing government shutdown. A White House official confirmed the Bureau of Labor Statistics will resume work on the crucial inflation data, which will now be released on October 24. The decision was made because the Social Security Administration requires the data to calculate its annual cost-of-living adjustments for beneficiaries. Other key economic reports, such as the nonfarm payrolls report, remain delayed due to the funding lapse in Washington.</p>

          <p>A cargo van containing $200,000 worth of Apple products, stolen near Sparks, Nevada, was recovered in Los Angeles following a traffic stop. The California Highway Patrol, alerted by law enforcement in the region, located the vehicle after it was spotted by a sheriff's helicopter. Officers arrested two suspects, Daniel Rodriguez Gomez and Anthony Jose Castro Vera, after discovering the boxes of stolen goods inside the van. The successful recovery highlights a collaborative law enforcement effort to combat the growing issue of organized cargo and retail theft in the state.</p>

She reported that Putin responded in writing and that the reunifications were facilitated by both Russia and Ukraine.

          <h2>IRS Announces Inflation-Adjusted Tax Brackets and Deductions for 2026</h2>

        </div>
        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>The IRS has released its annual inflation adjustments for federal income tax brackets and standard deductions for the 2026 tax year. This routine update aims to prevent "bracket creep," where inflation pushes taxpayers into higher tax brackets without a real increase in income. For 2026, the standard deduction will rise to $32,200 for married couples filing jointly and $16,100 for single filers. The adjustments will affect how much Americans owe in taxes and are based on the Chained Consumer Price Index, as mandated by the 2017 Tax Cuts and Jobs Act.</p>

          <p>With interest rates on home equity lines of credit (HELOCs) falling, this article analyzes the potential monthly payments for a $200,000 loan in the current market. Based on an average rate of 7.84%, a 10-year HELOC would cost approximately $2,410 per month, while a 15-year term would be around $1,893 per month. These costs are notably lower than they were in the previous year due to declining rates. The article advises potential borrowers to calculate payments based on various potential rate changes to ensure long-term affordability, given the variable nature of HELOC rates.

          <p>NBA Commissioner Adam Silver has indicated that the WNBA could soon play games in China, aiming to expand the league's international presence. Speaking from an NBA event in Macao, Silver noted the significant interest in women's basketball in the country and stated he would "love to bring a WNBA game" there. The move would follow the NBA's own return to China after a six-year break, as the league seeks to grow its second-largest market. Any potential expansion would occur after a new collective bargaining agreement is settled with the WNBA players' association.</p>

          <p>Rhun ap Iorwerth, the leader of Welsh political party Plaid Cymru, has pledged to provide universal free childcare for children aged nine months to four years if his party wins the next Senedd election. The "transformative" policy would offer at least 20 hours of care for 48 weeks a year by 2031, which the party claims would be the most generous offer in the UK. Ap Iorwerth positioned the pledge as a key part of his platform to replace the long-governing Labour party in Wales. The plan would be rolled out in stages and is estimated to cost an additional £500 million annually once fully implemented.</p>

          <p>In an excerpt from his new memoir, "Life, Law & Liberty," former Supreme Court Justice Anthony Kennedy reflects on how his upbringing in Sacramento, California, shaped his judicial philosophy. Kennedy writes that the American West taught him the importance of individual liberty, economic freedom, and fair treatment under the law. He describes his journey to the nation's highest court and the immense responsibility he felt as one of only 116 justices in U.S. history. Kennedy hopes his perspective, forged on the frontier, helped him apply the Constitution with honesty, civility, and tolerance.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>This analysis piece posits that the recent Gaza ceasefire was achieved primarily because President Donald Trump finally used the full weight of his office to pressure Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu. The article argues that after Netanyahu became isolated from other allies, he was solely dependent on the U.S., giving Trump the leverage to demand an end to the war. Trump's decision to intervene was reportedly triggered by an Israeli strike on a Hamas negotiating team in Qatar, which he viewed as a personal affront. While crediting Trump for stopping the violence, the article also notes he could have acted much earlier.</p>

          <p>A recent study indicates that the surge in cryptocurrency values has created approximately 70,000 new millionaires in the past year alone, bringing the global total to over 240,000. Research into their financial behavior shows that these investors tend to spend about 9.7 cents of every dollar gained, more than double the rate of those with stock market or real estate wealth. This spending is primarily on restaurants, entertainment, and general merchandise rather than stereotypical luxury items. The study suggests that crypto wealth has contributed significantly to consumer spending, but also warns that a market crash could have a proportionally negative impact. (not investment advice)</p>

Cohen expressed hope but said it is too early to celebrate, as the family has received no information on his son's condition. He also directed sharp criticism at Prime Minister Netanyahu, whom he blames for obstructing previous deals and for the security failures that led to the initial attack.</p>
