          <p>Caelan Doris, the Ireland captain and a prospective British and Irish Lions captain, is set to undergo a shoulder procedure this week, casting doubt on his availability for the Lions tour to Australia. Leinster Rugby announced the procedure after Doris sustained an injury during their Champions Cup semi-final defeat. The full implications for the summer will be determined post-procedure, with Doris already ruled out of Leinster's upcoming United Rugby Championship game.
