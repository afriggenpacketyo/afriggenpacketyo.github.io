Goldman Sachs is boosting its payout by 33% to $4 per share, while Wells Fargo is raising its dividend by 12.5% to 45 cents per share. These hikes are part of a broader trend among major corporations in 2025, signaling management's confidence in future cash flow and profitability.

          <p>The U.S. government is reviving a scientifically proven method to combat the new world screwworm fly, a pest whose flesh-eating larvae can devastate livestock, wildlife, and pets. The plan involves breeding billions of male flies, sterilizing them with radiation, and releasing them from aircraft over Mexico and southern Texas. These sterile males then mate with wild females, whose eggs subsequently fail to hatch, causing the population to collapse over time. This sterile insect technique was used to eradicate the pest from the U.S. decades ago and is being reinstated after the fly reappeared in southern Mexico, posing a significant threat to the American beef industry.</p>

Tarvet's impressive performance through qualifying and the first round earned him significant prize money, though he is limited in what he can accept due to U.S. college athletic rules.

          <h2>Seven Signs That Credit Card Debt Settlement Could Be a Suitable Option</h2>

        </div>
        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>For individuals struggling with significant credit card debt, debt settlement may be a viable strategy, and this article outlines seven key indicators that it might be the right choice. These signs include having minimum payments consume over 20% of take-home income, making no progress on the principal balance, and considering borrowing from retirement accounts to cover payments. Other indicators are maxed-out credit cards, resorting to cash advances to pay other bills, and accumulating debt due to uncontrollable life events like job loss or medical emergencies. If a traditional credit counseling plan seems unrealistically long, settlement could offer a faster resolution. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>Amidst recent disruptions at U.S. air traffic control (ATC) centers, this article explores the redundant systems and rigorous training pilots undergo to handle such outages. Pilots are trained from their earliest days to manage a loss of communication, with procedures including switching to backup radio frequencies and using an emergency channel. Modern airliners are also equipped with text-based messaging systems and a collision avoidance system (TCAS) that communicates directly with other aircraft to ensure separation. While ATC outages can cause significant delays and inconvenience for passengers, multiple layers of safety protocols are in place to prevent them from becoming a critical safety issue.</p>

        </div>
        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>This article suggests that July could be an opportune time for investors to consider physical gold, such as bars and coins, for several reasons. In an unpredictable economy, gold offers a tangible asset that investors can physically control, providing a sense of security that stocks do not. It is also increasingly easy to purchase from various retailers and specialized companies. Furthermore, with the price of gold near record highs, fractional gold bars and coins offer a more affordable entry point, allowing for portfolio diversification and a hedge against inflation without a massive capital outlay.

Companies that have shifted their strategy to include holding or staking ETH, such as BitMine Immersion Technologies and Bit Digital, saw significant stock price jumps. This enthusiasm is fueled by the growing use of stablecoins and the potential for tokenizing real-world assets on blockchain networks like Ethereum. Despite a difficult year for the coin's price, recent inflows into ether-based ETFs and announcements from platforms like Robinhood suggest a renewed confidence in its underlying technology.

          <p>A new study published in The Lancet Oncology indicates that the type of hormone therapy used for menopause symptoms significantly affects breast cancer risk for women under 55. The research found that a combination of estrogen and progesterone increases the risk, whereas using estrogen alone actually reduces it. This distinction is critical, as women who have a uterus must take the combined therapy to prevent endometrial cancer, while those who have had a hysterectomy can take estrogen alone. The findings represent an evolution in the understanding of hormone therapy, refining knowledge from a controversial early 2000s study and emphasizing the need for personalized medical consultation.</p>

          <p>A commentary piece from the Los Angeles Times highlights Mayor Karen Bass's strong public opposition to the Trump administration's immigration crackdown in her city. Bass has accused the president of political theatrics and intimidation, defending L.A.'s sanctuary city policies and framing the federal actions as an "all-out assault against Los Angeles." The author notes that this confrontational stance is a shift for the typically coalition-building mayor, but one that appears to be unifying Angelenos against what they see as federal overreach. The piece suggests that by picking a fight with Los Angeles, Trump may have inadvertently strengthened Bass's political standing by allowing her to lead a unified resistance.</p>

The provision builds upon the 2022 CHIPS and Science Act, furthering Washington's goal of onshoring the semiconductor supply chain and strengthening domestic production.
