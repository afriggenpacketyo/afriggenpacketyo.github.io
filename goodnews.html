The deal faces anti-competition concerns, but analysts anticipate a favorable review from the Trump administration's Federal Trade Commission, and TD Cowen called the deal a strategic mistake. </p>

          <p>Walmart CFO John David Rainey has indicated that consumers are likely to see higher prices later this month due to tariffs, despite the retailer beating quarterly earnings expectations. Rainey noted that the magnitude of the tariff increases is beyond what retailers can absorb, but Walmart will try to keep price gaps below competitors. While net sales are expected to increase, Walmart declined to provide specific earnings guidance due to fluctuating tariff policies. The company's first profitable quarter for e-commerce was also announced, benefiting from growth in online advertising and third-party marketplace sales.</p>

These price increases are expected to take effect later this month. Amid global economic uncertainty, Walmart has also adjusted its quarterly profit outlook, as President Trump aims to secure favorable trade deals with countries facing import levies.</p>

          <p>This article distinguishes between "showboater" and "real cop" approaches to policing, with the former focused on appearances and indiscriminate enforcement, and the latter on upholding the law while safeguarding freedom. The author argues that real policing requires a legal sensibility and nuanced understanding of communities. The article critiques both the political left and right for failing to adequately support effective, community-oriented policing strategies. It asserts that real toughness lies in imposing the law within a constitutional framework.</p>

          <h2>UK Economy 'Beginning to Turn a Corner,' Says Chancellor</h2>
          <div class="timestamp">2025-05-15 07:22:13 EDT</div>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>UK Chancellor Rachel Reeves has declared that the UK economy is "beginning to turn a corner" after growth exceeded expectations in the first quarter of the year. The economy grew by 0.7% from January to March, driven by increased consumer spending and business investment. While the strong growth is encouraging, analysts caution that it may not be sustained due to upcoming US tariffs and rising employer taxes. The Labour government emphasizes boosting the economy as its top priority.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>The UK economy's growth rate of 0.7% at the start of the year surpassed expectations, but this level of growth is not predicted to last. This growth rate is higher than that of other large economies and was driven by strong spending on services. However, the effects of US tariffs, which came into force after the period measured, are expected to slow growth. Despite a recent UK-US tariff deal, economists remain cautious about the outlook.</p>

          <h2>Trump's Agenda in Congress Faces Hurdles Over Spending and Divisions</h2>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Congressional Republicans are advancing President Trump's agenda, including tax cuts and immigration funding, but face divisions over spending cuts. The legislation proposes extending Trump's 2017 tax cuts while making significant changes to Medicaid and clean energy programs. Republicans are divided over the level of spending cuts, with fiscal conservatives seeking more and moderates expressing concerns about the impact on working-class Americans. The bill's passage remains uncertain due to these internal divisions.</p>
