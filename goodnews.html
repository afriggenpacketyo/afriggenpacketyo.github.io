          <p>Indirect negotiations between Israel and Hamas are scheduled to commence in Egypt following Hamas's conditional acceptance of a peace plan proposed by former President Donald Trump. The deal requires Hamas to release all remaining Israeli hostages, give up its weapons, and relinquish governance in Gaza in exchange for amnesty for its members. While the plan envisions a gradual Israeli withdrawal and a provisional government, key details, such as a timeline for withdrawal and Hamas's disarmament, remain unresolved. Skepticism persists as negotiators head to Egypt, with the outcome of these talks being critical for ending the conflict and addressing the severe humanitarian crisis in Gaza.</p>

This initiative aims to replicate the success of the country's fintech sector, which has issued the most licenses in the European Union by creating a favorable regulatory environment. Founders hope the new hub will foster creativity and innovation, with the ambitious goal of having the startup sector contribute 25% of the nation's GDP by 2030. However, challenges remain, including access to capital and the need for more skilled talent to support this rapid growth.</p>

          <p>Actor George Clooney has expressed his concerns about raising his children in the intense culture of Hollywood, which prompted his family's move to a farm in France. In a recent interview, he explained that he and his wife, Amal, wanted their 8-year-old twins to have a more grounded upbringing, away from iPads and the pressures of being children of famous parents. Clooney stated that life in France allows his children to have a "much better life" without the constant worry of paparazzi or public comparisons. He emphasized the importance of creating private moments and a sense of normalcy for his family.</p>

          <p>Nike CEO Elliott Hill acknowledged that the company's path back to profitable growth will "take a while" as it navigates a comprehensive turnaround strategy. In his first year, Hill has focused on reversing his predecessor's direct-to-consumer strategy by re-engaging with wholesale partners to regain lost shelf space. The company is also restructuring internally to focus more on individual sports categories to reignite innovation. Despite these efforts, Nike's stock has declined about 12% over the last year, and the company faces macroeconomic headwinds, including an expected $1.5 billion impact from tariffs in the current fiscal year.</p>

          <p>OpenAI has entered a major agreement to purchase tens of billions of dollars worth of AI chips from AMD, a significant move in a market long dominated by Nvidia. The deal, which includes warrants that could give OpenAI a 10% stake in AMD, focuses on chips for inference, the process of running AI models. While Nvidia remains a key partner for OpenAI, particularly for training models, this partnership diversifies OpenAI's supply chain and intensifies competition. The massive investment reflects the surging demand for computational power needed to scale AI services like ChatGPT to a global audience. (not investment advice)</p>

The pause was attributed to legal challenges surrounding the separate SAVE repayment plan, which affected how payment counts were calculated.

          <p>The superstructure, or "island," on an aircraft carrier is almost always located on the starboard (right) side of the flight deck for a critical aerodynamic reason related to propeller-driven aircraft. The clockwise rotation of most Western aircraft engines creates a natural tendency for planes to yaw to the left upon takeoff and landing due to phenomena like the P-factor and spiraling slipstream. Placing the island on the right side provides pilots with a clear visual reference for landings without obstructing the natural leftward drift of the aircraft. This design choice, established early in carrier history, has become a standard for naval aviation.</p>
