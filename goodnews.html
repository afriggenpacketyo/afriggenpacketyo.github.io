          <p>Carlos Alcaraz has been labeled the "red-hot favorite" for Wimbledon after winning the Queen's Club title, marking his second time claiming the crown and extending his winning streak to 18 matches. Despite arriving in London with "no expectations," Alcaraz's performance has sent a strong message to his rivals. Former Wimbledon champion Pat Cash noted that Alcaraz is the player to beat, citing his excellent form. Winning Queen's is considered a good omen for Alcaraz, as he went on to triumph at Wimbledon in 2023 after winning the Queen's title.</p>

Juventus will qualify for the last 16 if Al Ain fail to beat City on Sunday evening. The win eliminates Wydad from the competition.</p>
