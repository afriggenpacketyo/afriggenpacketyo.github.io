          <p>This article previews the highly anticipated Premier League match between Newcastle United and Liverpool, emphasizing the intense atmosphere expected at St James' Park, particularly for Newcastle's first home game of the campaign. A central narrative involves the Alexander Isak transfer saga, with Liverpool as a suitor for the Newcastle striker, adding significant tension to the fixture. The piece also details Liverpool's prior acquisition of Hugo Ekitike, a player Newcastle had long pursued, further fueling the rivalry and complicating Newcastle's striker recruitment. Eddie Howe aims to harness crowd energy while focusing on the game, acknowledging Newcastle's formidable home record against traditional top teams.</p>

        </div>
        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Singapore's July inflation rate eased to a lower-than-expected 0.6%, marking its lowest level since January 2021, with core inflation also dipping to 0.5%. This moderation was attributed to falling retail and other goods prices, alongside reduced electricity and gas costs. The Monetary Authority of Singapore forecasts continued moderate inflation and slower economic growth in the latter half of the year, influenced by easing global crude oil prices and contained food commodity hikes. The central bank has already eased monetary policy twice this year to navigate a "downshift" in the global trade environment and rising trade tensions, signaling a path of weaker growth.

Rooney, who debuted at a similar age, shared personal insights on the unique challenges of early fame and the crucial importance of staying grounded amid growing profile. He lauded Dowman's impressive debut, which notably included winning a penalty, and stressed the necessity for the young player to remain close to family and trusted friends, filtering out external influences. Rooney's overarching message to Dowman is to wholeheartedly enjoy the experience and maximize his burgeoning talent.</p>

          <p>Shares of China's Dongfeng Motor Group surged to an eight-year high after its parent company announced plans to take the automaker private, valuing it at approximately $7 billion. This move aligns with China's broader strategy to consolidate its state-owned carmakers and enhance competitiveness. Additionally, Dongfeng is preparing to spin off and list its electric-vehicle unit, VOYAH, in Hong Kong. Despite a challenging automotive landscape and a nearly 15% drop in overall vehicle deliveries in the first half of 2025, sales of pure electric and plug-in hybrid models, particularly the VOYAH series, saw significant growth.

This widespread optimism follows Federal Reserve Chair Jerome Powell's dovish remarks at Jackson Hole, signaling potential interest rate cuts next month. Mainland China's CSI 300 also extended gains to a 37-month high, fueled by expectations of maturing time deposits shifting to equities and potential capital rotation from the U.S. to China. Taiwan's Taiex and South Korea's Kospi indices also saw strong advances, reflecting a broad positive market sentiment across the region. (not investment advice)</p>

This shift, driven by new "offer and order management" systems, aims to personalize booking processes, enable easier changes, and allow airlines to sell more than just flights, competing directly with online travel agents.
