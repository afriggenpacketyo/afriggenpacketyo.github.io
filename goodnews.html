          <p>A recent analysis by RentCafe.com has identified Southern cities as offering the best overall value for renters in the United States for 2025. The study evaluated 150 cities based on affordability, economic strength, and quality of life, with McKinney, Texas, claiming the top spot. Other leading cities included Sarasota, Florida, and Atlanta, Georgia, which scored highly for their low cost of living and robust local economies. The report highlights a trend where renters are finding favorable conditions in the South, while cities in the Northeast and West offer higher quality of life but at a greater cost.</p>

          <p>Denim manufacturer Levi Strauss has raised its full-year sales and earnings guidance after reporting second-quarter results that surpassed Wall Street expectations. The company now anticipates revenue growth of 1% to 2%, a significant improvement from its previous forecast, driven by strong consumer demand and growth in its direct-to-consumer and women's apparel segments. Despite concerns over potential U.S. tariffs on goods from Southeast Asia, Levi's stated it plans to absorb the initial financial impact, which it currently estimates at $25 to $30 million. The company's stock rose approximately 8% in extended trading following the positive report. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>Thousands of fans, including some who traveled internationally, gathered at Thailand's Khao Kheow Open Zoo to celebrate the first birthday of Moo Deng, a baby pygmy hippo who became a global internet star. The zoo organized a multi-day event for the beloved animal, whose name means "bouncy pork" and who gained fame through adorable social media posts by her keeper. The celebration included a fruit-and-vegetable birthday cake and auctions to raise funds for the zoo's conservation programs. Moo Deng's popularity has significantly boosted zoo attendance and raised awareness for her endangered species.</p>

          <h2>End of Airport Shoe Screening Rule Analyzed as Populist Theater</h2>

          <p>The Department of Homeland Security has ended the two-decade-old requirement for air travelers to remove their shoes for screening, a policy enacted after the 2001 shoe-bomber attempt. An analysis in The Atlantic frames this change not as a result of technological advancement but as a form of "populism theater." The rule had long been criticized as "security theater," and bypassing it was a perk for those who paid for services like TSA PreCheck. The article argues that ending the mandate for everyone democratizes this convenience, but does so without a clear security-based rationale, simply making the system less burdensome for all.</p>

The Trump administration has restricted sales of certain processors to China for national security reasons, impacting Nvidia's planned orders.
