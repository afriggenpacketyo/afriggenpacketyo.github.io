          <p>Saudi Aramco reported a 5% year-on-year decrease in net profit for the first quarter, primarily due to reduced oil prices and production levels. The company's net income for the quarter reached $26 billion, slightly surpassing analyst expectations, while free cash flow decreased to $19.2 billion, signaling financial strain amid sluggish crude prices and global demand. Aramco reduced its performance-linked dividend payout for both the fourth quarter of 2024 and the first quarter of 2025 to $200 million, though the base dividend saw a 4.2% increase to $21.1 billion. This article highlights the challenges faced by the Saudi state oil giant due to market conditions.</p>

          <p>A report indicates that China is increasingly directing its energy investments in Africa towards renewable projects, with solar and wind power now comprising 59% of its energy initiatives on the continent. Between 2010 and 2024, China's energy sector investment and construction activity in Africa totaled US$66 billion, with the continent becoming a key market for Chinese solar and wind technology. This shift aligns with global trends as China moves away from fossil fuels and highlights Africa's growing energy demand and China's dominance in solar panel production, and the adoption of Chinese wind and solar tech is mainly due to its global competitiveness and Africa's growing energy needs.</p>

          <p>In this guest essay, Dr. Mathilde Ross, a psychiatrist, challenges the notion of perfect motherhood and encourages mothers to embrace their flaws. She argues that striving for perfection is harmful and that children learn valuable lessons about accepting imperfections from their flawed mothers. The article highlights the historical tendency of psychiatry to blame mothers for their children's problems and offers a lighthearted quiz to reassure mothers that being imperfect is perfectly fine, and that mothers should give themselves some slack.</p>
