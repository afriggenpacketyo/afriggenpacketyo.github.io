          <p>Canada is in discussions with the United States regarding participation in President Donald Trump's "Golden Dome" missile defense program, as confirmed by Prime Minister Mark Carney. The proposed $175 billion system aims to defend against a range of missile threats, including drones and intercontinental ballistic missiles. Carney emphasized the importance of having protections in place for Canadians, acknowledging the growing missile threats that could originate from space in the near future. These discussions occur amidst evolving US-Canada relations, with Canada also exploring trade and security alliances beyond the United States.</p>

          <p>The Marks & Spencer website experienced a complete outage, preventing users from browsing, as the retailer continues to manage the aftermath of a cyber attack from the previous month. The company estimates that the cyber attack will reduce this year's profits by around ¬£300 million, with online services expected to be disrupted until July. Some personal customer data, including telephone numbers and addresses, was stolen in the attack, though payment details and passwords were not compromised. Police are investigating a group of English-speaking hackers known as Scattered Spider, believed to be behind attacks on other retailers as well.</p>

          <p>House Republicans are proposing a bill to provide $1,000 for every American baby born between January 1, 2025, and January 1, 2029, to be invested in financial markets. Initially referred to as "MAGA accounts," the proposal has been amended to call them "Trump accounts." The funds could be withdrawn later in life for expenses such as college or buying a house. However, tax experts have noted that the accounts would function much like typical investment accounts, with post-tax income contributions and taxed gains upon withdrawal.</p>

The EU's foreign policy chief, Kaja Kallas, announced a ‚Ç¨6.2 million contribution to support the network's independent journalism. This move underscores the value Europeans place on RFE/RL's reporting, particularly on Russia and Hungary, and raises the possibility of a more stable, collaborative funding model in the future.</p>

          <p>Chinese electric-vehicle maker Xpeng saw its shares in Hong Kong surge over 10% following upbeat earnings and a stronger-than-expected revenue forecast for the second quarter. The Guangzhou-based carmaker's first-quarter revenue more than doubled from a year earlier, driven by robust sales, with 94,008 vehicles delivered. The improved top line helped narrow its net loss for the first quarter to 664 million yuan, and lifted its gross margin to 15.6%. For the second quarter, Xpeng anticipates a revenue of 17.5 billion yuan to 18.7 billion yuan, with expected deliveries of 102,000 to 108,000 electric cars. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>The Japanese government has initiated a revamped gasoline subsidy aimed at reducing prices by 10 yen per liter to ease cost-of-living pressures for consumers. The subsidy is designed to reduce the wholesale gasoline price by 7.40 yen per liter in the first week, with further reductions planned weekly until it reaches 10 yen lower by mid-June. The program has no set end date, but with around 1 trillion yen allocated, it could last until the end of March 2026. The reintroduction of the subsidies comes ahead of the House of Councillors election slated for the summer.</p>

          <p>Japanese Finance Minister Katsunobu Kato and U.S. Treasury Secretary Scott Bessent discussed currency issues connected to ongoing bilateral tariff negotiations, agreeing that the dollar-yen exchange rate currently reflects economic fundamentals. This acknowledgement suggests that the yen's recent weakness against the dollar should no longer be a point of contention in tariff talks. The two reaffirmed their shared belief that exchange rates should be market-determined and expressed concern about the impact of the Trump administration's tariffs on the global economy. Japan has also started considering an option to back off from seeking a full removal of the U.S. tariffs.</p>

The goal is to create a family of devices that provides seamless access to AI assistants, addressing the clunky user experience of current AI products.
