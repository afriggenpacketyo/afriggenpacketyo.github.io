          <h2>How a Coaching Change Transformed Scottie Scheffler's Putting and Led to a Dominant Season</h2>
          <div class="timestamp">2025-07-15 01:30:20 EDT</div>
        </div>
        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>World number one golfer Scottie Scheffler overcame a significant weakness in his game by enlisting putting coach Phil Kenyon in late 2023. Previously ranked outside the top 150 in putting despite being the best from tee to green, Scheffler saw a dramatic turnaround after Kenyon helped with his green reading and facilitated a switch to a mallet putter. This change was a catalyst for a remarkable season, in which Scheffler won seven PGA Tour events, including his second Masters and an Olympic gold medal. The collaboration highlights how a targeted adjustment can elevate an elite athlete to a new level of dominance.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>A federal appeals court has issued a temporary stay, preventing the Trump administration from ending Temporary Protected Status (TPS) for nearly 12,000 Afghans in the U.S. The Department of Homeland Security had announced the termination of these protections, which shield recipients from deportation and provide work authorization, arguing conditions in Afghanistan had improved. Immigrant advocacy group CASA challenged the decision, leading to the court's intervention, which keeps the protections in place for at least another week while the case is reviewed. The move provides a brief reprieve for Afghans who fled their country, many of whom assisted the U.S. during its two-decade presence there.</p>

          <h2>Norway's Pro-EV Policies Result in Widespread Electric Vehicle Adoption</h2>
          <div class="timestamp">2025-07-15 01:03:37 EDT</div>
        </div>
        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Norway has become a global leader in the transition to electric vehicles, with EVs now accounting for over 93% of new car sales and up to 40% of all passenger cars in its capital, Oslo. This success is attributed to long-standing government policies that combine significant incentives for EV buyers, such as tax exemptions and reduced fees, with high taxes on polluting internal combustion engine cars. The country has also invested heavily in public charging infrastructure, with 10,000 fast chargers now available nationwide. This comprehensive approach has effectively transformed the nation's automotive landscape, making EVs a common sight.</p>

          <p>A district in Stockholm named Sickla is being redeveloped into what its developer calls the "world's largest wooden construction project," utilizing mass timber instead of traditional steel and concrete. The $1.25 billion project will create a 2.7 million-square-foot area of homes, offices, and shops, aiming to showcase a more sustainable model for urban construction. Building with timber significantly reduces carbon emissions compared to conventional materials, a key factor in a sector responsible for 37% of global emissions. The project reflects Sweden's deep cultural connection to its forests and a growing global interest in sustainable architecture.</p>

          <p>Nvidia has announced it will soon resume selling its H20 artificial intelligence chips to China, a significant development after a U.S. government license requirement had effectively halted sales. The company stated it received assurances from Washington that licenses for the chips, which were specifically designed to comply with earlier export controls, will be granted. The reversal follows lobbying efforts by CEO Jensen Huang, who argued that the restrictions were harming American tech leadership. This move is expected to help Nvidia reclaim market share in China and serves as a key indicator of a potential easing in U.S.-China tech trade tensions. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>Chinese private aerospace company Space Pioneer announced its Tianlong-3 rocket successfully passed a critical ground-based stress test. The test simulated key mission phases for the rocket's nine-engine first stage, which held up under all conditions. This success is a major milestone for the company, coming a year after a similar static-fire test in 2024 ended in a dramatic explosion when the rocket unexpectedly lifted off and crashed. The Tianlong-3 is a key part of China's growing commercial space sector, which aims to compete with Western companies like SpaceX in the satellite launch market.</p>

          <p>Meta founder Mark Zuckerberg has revealed plans for the company to invest hundreds of billions of dollars in constructing enormous artificial intelligence data centers across the United States. The first facility, named Prometheus, is slated to be operational in Ohio by 2026, with another multi-gigawatt cluster, Hyperion, planned for Louisiana. Zuckerberg stated that one of the sites could cover an area nearly the size of Manhattan, underscoring the immense scale of the investment. This move signals Meta's aggressive strategy to build "superintelligence" and secure a leading position in the competitive AI landscape, despite concerns about the massive energy and water consumption of such facilities.</p>

          <p>New research from Tel Aviv University provides the first evidence of an animal responding to sounds produced by plants. Scientists found that female moths avoided laying eggs on tomato plants that were making high-frequency "screaming" sounds, which plants emit when they are stressed or dehydrated. Though inaudible to humans, these sounds can be perceived by many insects and some mammals. The discovery opens up a new field of study into a potential invisible ecosystem of sound-based communication between plants and animals, which could influence behaviors like pollination, feeding, and seeking shelter.</p>

          <p>The BBC's annual salary report often raises questions about why many of its biggest stars are not included, and the reason lies in how they are paid. Many high-profile presenters and actors are not directly employed by the BBC but are instead contracted through independent production companies, including the BBC's own commercial arm, BBC Studios. Because these companies operate in a competitive commercial market, their salary details are not disclosed to maintain a level playing field. This means the earnings of stars like Claudia Winkleman, Michael McIntyre, and the casts of shows like "Strictly Come Dancing" and "The Traitors" do not appear on the publicly funded list.</p>

The team from Dalian University of Technology created a method for rapidly cooling the forged metal, a key challenge in producing durable parts capable of withstanding extreme temperatures and pressures. This technological advancement could be a breakthrough for China's aerospace industry, which has historically struggled to develop high-performance jet engines domestically.

          <p>The U.S. Department of Justice has formally urged the Supreme Court to deny the appeal of Ghislaine Maxwell, who is serving a 20-year prison sentence for her role in Jeffrey Epstein's sex trafficking scheme. Maxwell's lawyers argued that a co-conspirator clause in Epstein's 2007 non-prosecution agreement should have barred her from being prosecuted. However, the DOJ countered that the agreement was only intended to apply within the Southern District of Florida and that Maxwell was, at most, an incidental third-party beneficiary. Lower courts have already rejected her argument, and the DOJ is asking the high court to uphold those decisions.</p>
