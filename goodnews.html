          <p>Federal Reserve Chair Jerome Powell indicated the central bank is nearing the conclusion of its bond-holding reduction program, known as quantitative tightening, citing signs of tightening liquidity conditions. Speaking at a business economics conference, Powell refrained from offering specific guidance on future interest rate movements, maintaining the Fed's cautious stance amid a less dynamic labor market. He emphasized the Fed's commitment to monitoring economic data, despite recent government shutdown impacts, and defended the practice of paying interest on bank reserves as crucial for policy control.

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>The article clarifies that homeowners retain legal ownership of their property when taking out a reverse mortgage, as the loan is secured by the home's equity, not a transfer of title. Borrowers remain responsible for taxes, insurance, and maintenance, while the lender places a lien on the property. The loan balance grows as proceeds are received, decreasing equity, and becomes due upon the homeowner's death or permanent move. Heirs can choose to repay the loan or sell the home, with federal insurance covering any shortfall if the sale price is less than the loan. (not investment advice)</p>
