          <p>The unique monster character "Labubu," created by Hong Kong-born artist Kasing Lung and marketed by Chinese maker Pop Mart, has become a global phenomenon. Labubu, a rabbit-like plush toy, is popular due to celebrity endorsements and a savvy marketing strategy, including the use of "blind boxes." The success of Labubu reflects China's transformation in the toy market, from subcontractor to creator of original products, with Pop Mart shares valued significantly higher than those of Sanrio, the maker of Hello Kitty.</p>
