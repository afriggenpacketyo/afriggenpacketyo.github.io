          <p>UK Prime Minister Sir Keir Starmer has praised US President Donald Trump, stating his actions have brought the end of the war in Ukraine "closer than ever before." This statement was issued despite the recent Alaska summit with Russia's president concluding without a formal ceasefire agreement. Starmer emphasized that any path to peace must involve Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky and affirmed the UK's continued support for Ukraine. He also welcomed the US commitment to providing robust security guarantees as part of a potential future peace deal.</p>

          <p>The fashion brand Topshop is planning a major comeback with the confirmed return of standalone stores to the UK High Street, years after its physical locations closed following the collapse of the Arcadia group. To mark its relaunch, the brand hosted its first catwalk show in seven years, signaling a renewed push to regain its former "cool" status. While aiming to appeal to nostalgic millennial shoppers, industry experts note the brand faces challenges in attracting a new Gen-Z customer base and competing in a market with fast-fashion giants. The company is focusing on product quality and its unique "London girl" aesthetic.</p>

          <p>John Cruickshank, the last surviving British recipient of the Victoria Cross from World War II, has passed away at the age of 105. The Aberdeen native was awarded the nation's highest military honor for his valor during an attack on a German U-Boat in 1944, where he sustained 72 injuries but successfully destroyed the submarine. After leaving the RAF, he pursued a career in banking and rarely spoke of his wartime experiences, viewing his actions simply as his duty. His passing marks the end of an era for the 181 individuals who received the Victoria Cross during the conflict.</p>

According to White House officials, the letter raised concerns about the thousands of Ukrainian children who have been abducted and forcibly transferred to Russia during the war. This issue is considered a war crime by the International Criminal Court, which has indicted Putin for his alleged role. Ukraine's foreign minister later expressed gratitude for the First Lady's "act of humanism," highlighting a diplomatic side-channel focused on a key humanitarian crisis.</p>

          <p>The S&P 500 and Nasdaq Composite indexes both closed the week higher, setting several new records driven by investor optimism about potential Federal Reserve interest rate cuts. Wall Street sentiment was boosted early in the week by a consumer price index report showing inflation had cooled more than expected, increasing the odds of a rate cut in September. While a subsequent wholesale inflation report was higher than anticipated, it did not significantly dampen market expectations for monetary easing. Several major companies, including Goldman Sachs, BlackRock, and Nvidia, also hit all-time highs during the week's trading sessions. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>In Phoenix, Arizona, architect Brian Stark is repurposing old shipping containers to create sustainable and rapidly deployable housing shelters for the city's unhoused population. His "X-WING" shelters are constructed from four containers arranged in an 'X' shape, creating five individual, air-conditioned rooms and shared courtyard spaces. The units, which can be built in just one week, offer a cost-effective and environmentally friendly approach to tackling the affordable housing crisis. The project provides residents with private, secure spaces, with Stark now planning a larger 105-unit apartment complex for low-income seniors using the same method.</p>

Thompson clocked a time of 9.87 seconds for the victory, matching the meet record, while Lyles finished second in 9.90 seconds. The result serves as a measure of revenge for Thompson, who lost the Olympic gold to Lyles by just five-thousandths of a second in Paris. Despite the loss, Lyles remained positive, viewing the sub-10-second performance as a "great stepping stone" ahead of the upcoming world championships in Tokyo.</p>

The man, Ryan Wardwell, was rappelling down a series of waterfalls known as the Seven Teacups when the force of the water pushed him off his lines, trapping him. After he was reported missing, a search operation was launched, and a rescue team eventually located him using a drone. The California Highway Patrol then conducted a hoist rescue, lifting him to safety where he was treated for minor injuries and dehydration.</p>

          <p>A leading academic from the Chinese Academy of Sciences is urging China to implement a top-down strategy to accelerate its development of space-based solar power. This technology involves building large solar facilities in orbit to convert sunlight into electricity and transmit the energy back to Earth using microwaves or lasers. The scientist, Ge Changchun, argues that a more coordinated national effort is needed to close the technological gap with the United States. Unlike ground-based solar, space stations can generate power continuously without being affected by weather or nighttime, offering a potentially more efficient and stable energy source.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>An article highlights the concept of the "Lighthouse Parent" as a healthier alternative to the prevalent trend of intensive parenting. This approach, advocated by pediatrician Kenneth Ginsburg, encourages parents to act as a steady, guiding presence rather than controlling every aspect of a child's life. While the instinct to solve every problem for a child is strong, this intensive style can be exhausting for parents and detrimental to a child's development of confidence and resilience. The lighthouse metaphor suggests parents should be ready to provide guidance when needed but also know when to stand back and let their children navigate their own challenges.</p>

          <p>Devon and Cornwall Police have seized a £180,000 deposit that influencer Andrew Tate placed for a special-edition Aston Martin Valhalla supercar in 2021. A court order granted the forfeiture after the police argued the funds were the proceeds of tax evasion and money laundering, an order which Tate and his brother did not oppose. This seizure is in addition to £2.7 million of the brothers' funds forfeited to the same police force in December 2024 for failure to pay taxes on business revenue. The seized money will be reinvested into crime prevention and victim support initiatives.</p>
