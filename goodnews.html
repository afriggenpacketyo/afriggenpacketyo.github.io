          <p>A new report from Germany's Federal Motor Transport Authority indicates that people are driving more, with total kilometers driven increasing for the first time since 2018, largely due to a higher number of vehicles on the road. The vast majority of the distance was covered by gasoline and diesel cars, though average mileage per car continued a decade-long decline. In separate news, Germany's Constitutional Court dismissed a lawsuit filed by Yemeni citizens against the German government concerning the US military's use of Ramstein Air Base for drone operations, ruling there was no clear violation of its duty of care.</p>

        </div>
        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>New government guidance for sex and relationships education in English schools will require teaching children to recognize and act against misogyny. The updated curriculum will also focus on identifying positive male role models and proactively engaging with parents about the material being taught. The plan scraps previous proposals for strict age limits on topics like sex education, instead outlining what should be covered by the end of primary and secondary school. Secondary curriculum additions will address topics like incel ideology, AI-generated sexual imagery, and suicide prevention, reflecting the need to update guidance for the modern digital landscape.</p>

          <p>Google is rolling out a 'Manage Subscriptions' tool for Gmail on desktop and mobile, designed to help users easily clean up their inboxes. The feature consolidates all mailing list subscriptions onto a single page, showing the sender and recent message frequency, allowing for bulk unsubscribing with just a few clicks. This provides a more secure alternative to clicking potentially malicious unsubscribe links within individual emails and doesn't require third-party apps that access personal data. The article suggests this tool, combined with other habits like using filters and secondary emails, can help users regain control over their digital correspondence.</p>

          <p>A nine-year-old boy in Minnesota has made a full recovery after a freak accident where he fell and an arrow penetrated his brain, nearly exiting the back of his skull. The boy, Gus Deterding, was helping his father pack for a hunting trip when he slipped on ice. Scans later revealed the arrow had passed through the middle of his brain, an injury that medical professionals considered would typically be fatal. Doctors and his family have described his survival without any lasting effects as a miracle, as he appeared remarkably normal shortly after the incident.</p>

          <p>Amid new geopolitical realities, including the war in Ukraine and a potential shift in U.S. security guarantees, France is emerging as a pivotal player in Europe's push for defense autonomy. Having maintained its defense industry and a 'war culture' since the 1960s, France possesses a comprehensive defense sector with major players in all segments. President Macron has announced significant increases in defense spending, aiming to double the budget by 2027. Experts note that while France is a forerunner in high-tech military systems, it faces challenges in raw material sourcing and will need to cooperate diplomatically with EU partners to lead effectively.</p>

          <p>Tesla has officially entered the Indian market, opening its first showroom in Mumbai and launching sales of its Model Y electric SUV. However, the vehicle is priced at a hefty $69,770, significantly higher than in other markets, due to India's steep 70% import tariff and additional luxury taxes. This pricing positions Tesla in the premium segment against brands like BMW, rather than mass-market EV competitors. Analysts suggest this is a 'soft power' move to test the market, as Tesla has not yet committed to local manufacturing, which would be necessary to lower prices and compete on a larger scale.</p>

          <p>Left-arm spinner Liam Dawson has been called up to the England Test squad for the first time in eight years as a replacement for the injured Shoaib Bashir. The 35-year-old's selection for the fourth Test against India is a reward for his outstanding domestic form, having been named the Professional Cricketers' Association player of the year for the last two seasons. Dawson, who also boosts England's batting lineup, gets an unexpected opportunity to press his claim for a regular Test spot ahead of this winter's Ashes tour. The call-up sees him selected ahead of fellow left-armer Jack Leach.</p>

          <p>The UK government is launching a new £650 million scheme offering grants to reduce the cost of new electric cars and encourage drivers to switch from fossil fuels. Buyers of eligible vehicles costing up to £37,000 can receive discounts ranging from £1,500 to £3,750 at the dealership. While the government aims to make zero-emission cars more affordable, critics and industry leaders point out a significant barrier remains the lack of public charging infrastructure. The country currently has about 82,000 public chargers, far short of the 300,000 targeted by 2030, which especially affects households without private driveways.</p>

This move allows the firm to tap into Hong Kong's growing crypto market, which is expanding as digital assets gain acceptance from traditional financial institutions. However, the license comes with strict boundaries that prevent direct participation from mainland China, reflecting a careful balance between financial innovation and legal constraints.

Speaking to a sports streaming channel during the FIFA Club World Cup final, Trump acknowledged the global preference for the term 'football' and laughed that a change could be made 'very easily' via executive order. While the seriousness of the suggestion is unclear, it follows his appearance at the tournament final in New Jersey, where he joined the winning club, Chelsea, on the field as they celebrated their victory.

          <p>England midfielder Jordan Henderson has completed a move to Premier League club Brentford on a two-year contract. The 35-year-old former Liverpool captain joins after short, separate stints at Saudi club Al-Ettifaq and Dutch side Ajax, where his contract was terminated a year early. Brentford's manager stated the decision was simple given Henderson's availability, fitness, and motivation, highlighting his leadership experience as a key asset to replace recently departed senior players. Henderson, who has 84 England caps, effectively fills the midfield void left by Christian Norgaard's departure from the club.</p>

Huang stated it is important for American companies to compete in China's dynamic market, which is home to half of the world's AI researchers.

          <p>Stablecoins are a rapidly growing segment of cryptocurrency, designed to maintain a stable value by being backed by reserves like the U.S. dollar. Their appeal lies in the potential for instantaneous, low-fee global money transfers, attracting interest from companies like Amazon and major banks. However, significant risks remain, including questions about whether issuers truly hold sufficient one-to-one reserves and their use by illicit actors for money laundering. Critics also fear a 'run on the bank' scenario could destabilize the broader financial system, a concern that looms as Congress considers new regulations for the burgeoning sector.</p>
