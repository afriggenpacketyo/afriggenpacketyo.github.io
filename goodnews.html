          <p>The Welsh Rugby Union has appointed Steve Tandy, the former Scotland defence coach, as the new head coach for the men's national team. Tandy, a 45-year-old Welshman, will take charge on September 1, signing a contract that runs until at least the 2027 World Cup. He succeeds Warren Gatland and is tasked with rebuilding a team that has struggled recently, briefly falling to a record-low world ranking of 14th. Tandy, who previously coached Ospreys and was part of the British and Irish Lions staff, expressed that leading his home country is a "massive honour."</p>

          <h2>New Biography Explores Clint Eastwood's Views on Marriage and Infidelity</h2>
          <div class="timestamp">2025-07-21 06:00:56 EDT</div>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>A new biography, "Clint: The Man and The Movies," by author Shawn Levy, delves into Clint Eastwood's complex personal life and his views on monogamy. The book claims the Hollywood icon often found traditional marriage to be a "form of confinement" and followed his own instincts regarding other women, even during his long marriage to his first wife, Maggie Johnson. Citing past interviews, the book notes Eastwood's own admission that his affairs became "addictive." The author suggests that while Eastwood respected the institution of marriage, his desire for personal liberty often took precedence.</p>

          <h2>Congress Considers Scrapping Decades-Old 'Permanent Chassis' Rule to Boost Housing Affordability</h2>
          <div class="timestamp">2025-07-21 06:00:00 EDT</div>
        </div>
        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>A simple legislative change to a 50-year-old federal law could help alleviate the U.S. housing crisis by making manufactured homes more affordable and accessible. The rule requires these homes to be built on a "permanent chassis," a steel trailer frame that adds cost, limits design flexibility, and creates zoning hurdles. Housing advocates and industry leaders argue that eliminating this mandate could significantly scale up production and provide relief for first-time buyers and seniors. After decades of legislative inertia, the Senate Banking Committee is expected to take up the issue, signaling new urgency in Congress to address housing supply.</p>

          <p>In a personal essay, a long-time Los Angeles resident reflects on the deep connection to her home garden of nearly 45 years as she and her husband contemplate downsizing. The author finds daily joy in the prolific fruit trees and fragrant flowers, which have become central to her life and a symbol of the home she may soon leave behind. She grapples with the idea of aging, the changing neighborhood, and the difficult decision of when to move closer to family.

          <p>The Huntington Library in San Marino is anticipating the bloom of its rare Amorphophallus titanum, commonly known as the corpse flower. The massive plant, nicknamed "Green Boy," is expected to unfurl its giant, maroon-colored structure and release its infamous odor of rotting flesh for only 24 to 48 hours. This pungent smell is a natural strategy to attract pollinators in its native Sumatra but has become a popular public spectacle at the botanical garden. The event also highlights The Huntington's conservation efforts for the endangered species, as it maintains one of North America's largest collections.</p>

          <p>The UK government is reviving the Pensions Commission to address a looming retirement savings crisis, warning that future pensioners could be worse off than today's. The Department for Work and Pensions (DWP) highlighted that nearly half of working-age adults, particularly low earners and the self-employed, are not saving into a private pension. The commission will bring together experts, unions, and employers to build a consensus on a future strategy, nearly 20 years after the original commission led to the creation of automatic enrolment. The goal is to find solutions for the growing gap in retirement savings. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>A group of Democratic lawmakers has introduced the "Safer Beauty Bill Package," a set of four bills aimed at increasing federal oversight of the cosmetics industry. The legislation seeks to ban hazardous chemicals like formaldehyde and phthalates, require greater supply chain transparency, and mandate full ingredient disclosure on labels. The bills also aim to provide protections for women of color and salon workers, who are disproportionately exposed to toxic ingredients. This legislative push follows a 2022 law that advocates say did not go far enough to ensure the safety of personal care products sold in the U.S.</p>
