          <p>Chinese authorities are launching "property supermarkets" in response to declining housing prices and subdued buyer sentiment. These platforms, both online and offline, aim to provide consumers with a centralized location to view available homes. Chengdu is the latest city to launch such a platform, partnering with developers to feature over 50 projects on a mobile app. These initiatives seek to improve transaction efficiency and transparency by consolidating information and bundling services like mortgage applications and property registration. The effectiveness of this model in reviving China's property sector remains to be seen. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>Jane Dorotik, convicted of murdering her husband in 2001, had her conviction overturned after spending two decades in prison. New testing of evidence, conducted with the Loyola Project for the Innocent, revealed inconsistencies and raised doubts about the original findings. The prosecution admitted that the DNA evidence was different in quality and quantity than what was presented at trial. While the charges were dismissed without prejudice, Dorotik is now working to rebuild her life and advocate for incarcerated women. Justice may have been served.</p>

The departures include ambassadors from Senegal, Guinea, Burkina Faso, Mali, and Niger, all of whom have served in their respective posts for varying lengths of time. The situation raises questions about China's diplomatic strategy in the region. The situation is still developing.</p>
