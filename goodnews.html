          <p>A federal judge in Boston has extended a temporary restraining order against the Trump administration's attempt to block the entry of Harvard University's international students into the U.S. until June 23. Judge Allison Burroughs issued the extension while she considers a longer-term injunction, following Trump's proclamation on June 4 that cited the university's engagement with China and national security concerns. Harvard has amended its lawsuit, arguing that the proclamation circumvents Burroughs' previous decision and violates the First Amendment. The Department of Homeland Security had previously sought to limit Harvard's ability to enroll students, but Burroughs blocked that action last month.</p>

          <p>President Trump attended the G7 summit in Canada amidst trade tensions, commenting on the Israel-Iran conflict and Putin's absence. Trump stated Iran would "like to talk" but needs to make a deal and confirmed messages through intermediaries indicating a wish to de-escalate. He emphasized his stance as a "tariff person" and suggested considering China's inclusion in the G7, also mentioning Putin's ouster in 2014. Trump's approach to allies and tariffs have created unease, and his past musings about acquiring Canada and Greenland have strained relations, as Canadian Prime Minister Carney clarified that Canada is not for sale during a meeting at the White House.</p>

          <p>The Federal Reserve is expected to hold interest rates steady, impacting various aspects of personal finance. Credit card rates remain high, with consumers encouraged to consider balance transfers or personal loans. Mortgage rates have shown little movement, keeping housing affordability a challenge, while auto loan rates are fixed but rising car prices are increasing payments, and shopping around for financing is advised. Federal student loan rates are fixed annually, shielding borrowers from immediate Fed moves, though many face headwinds and fewer forgiveness options. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>Aaron Levant, CEO of Complex, says he does not value college degrees when hiring, focusing instead on ambition, aspirations, and a history of job loyalty. He looks for a side hustle as an indicator of a candidate's propensity to be a hustler, valuing passion projects and secondary revenue streams. Levant considers frequent job changes a red flag, suggesting a lack of loyalty or competence. He also prioritizes useful skills and non-college experience when assessing potential hires, emphasizing practical abilities and a track record of commitment.</p>

          <p>U.S. Steel shares increased after President Trump approved its merger with Japan's Nippon Steel, contingent upon a national security agreement with the U.S. government. The agreement includes a golden share for the U.S. government, granting the president veto power over decisions to relocate U.S. Steel's headquarters, move the company outside the U.S., rename the company, transfer production or jobs abroad, and close or idle plants prematurely. Trump described the transaction as a "partnership," but U.S. Steel confirmed it will become a wholly owned subsidiary of Nippon Steel North America, with the transaction expected to be completed promptly following customary closing conditions.</p>

Spaun's success, including a remarkable final-green putt, provided a positive highlight to a tournament marked by chaos and difficult course conditions. The US Open's setup, with dense rough and slick greens, emphasized attitude over skill, leading to concerns about luck playing an overly influential role. While Spaun's resilience was commendable, the tournament's overall setup left many questioning whether the cream truly rose to the top, with numerous top players exiting early.</p>

Seventy-two percent of respondents believe the CPPIB should invest wherever it earns the most returns, while 28 percent support increased Canadian investment. Support for investing more in Canada is highest among younger adults aged 18 to 24. The CPPIB's objective is to maximize long-term investment returns without undue risk, and it had assets of $714.4 billion as of March. (not investment advice)</p>
