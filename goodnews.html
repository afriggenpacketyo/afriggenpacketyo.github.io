          <p>Former White House National Security Advisor Mike Waltz was observed using a modified version of the Signal encrypted messaging app during a Cabinet meeting, raising questions about data privacy and security protocols. The article reports that the app appeared to be a "fork" of Signal by TeleMessage, which adds archiving capabilities, potentially undermining Signal's end-to-end encryption. Despite the White House's claim that Signal is an approved app, the use of a modified version raises concerns about adherence to records retention laws and the security of communications. The incident follows controversy over the use of Signal by top Trump administration officials.</p>
