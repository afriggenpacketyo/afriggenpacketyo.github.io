          <p>Ahead of the 2025 Open Championship, those present recall the day a 16-year-old Rory McIlroy shot a record-setting 61 at Royal Portrush in 2005. Playing partners describe how a small group of spectators swelled to over a thousand as word spread of his incredible performance, which included an eagle and five consecutive birdies to finish. They remember a supremely confident teenager who seemed destined for superstardom, relishing the pressure and displaying the focus that would define his career. The article contrasts this early triumph with his later professional struggles, highlighting his resilience and enduring connection with fans.</p>

          <p>Shares of Chinese toymaker Pop Mart International fell over 6% despite the company forecasting a significant increase in first-half earnings, with profits expected to rise by at least 350%. The company, known for its popular "blind box" toys like the Labubu character, attributed its positive forecast to growing global brand recognition and strong overseas sales. However, some analysts suggest the stock's decline reflects investor concern that the company's growth may have peaked, leading to profit-taking. Despite the dip, many investment banks maintain a bullish outlook on the company. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>Dutch semiconductor equipment manufacturer ASML reported second-quarter earnings that surpassed analyst expectations, with net sales reaching 7.7 billion euros against a forecast of 7.52 billion. The company's net bookings, a key indicator of future demand, were particularly strong at 5.5 billion euros, well above the anticipated 4.19 billion. As the sole producer of extreme ultraviolet (EUV) lithography machines, ASML is critical to the manufacturing of advanced chips for companies like Apple and Nvidia. The positive results come as the company navigates market uncertainty related to U.S. tariff policies. (not investment advice)</p>
