          <h2>New Regulations Mandate Solar Panels for Most New Homes in England</h2>
          <div class="timestamp">2025-06-05 19:59:04 EDT</div>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>The Labour government is set to introduce regulations requiring developers to install solar panels on the "vast majority" of new build homes in England. Energy Secretary Ed Miliband stated the move is "just common sense" and would save households ¬£500 annually on energy bills. The Home Builders Federation supports fitting more panels but cautions against burdensome paperwork that could hinder the construction of 1.5 million new homes by 2029. While developers will be required to add panels unless buildings fall under certain exemptions, local authorities will need to be vigilant to ensure compliance with the new rules.</p>

          <p>The Supreme Court unanimously ruled that anti-discrimination laws protect all employees equally, regardless of their majority or minority group status. The justices rejected the view that "members of a majority group" must present more evidence of discrimination to win a lawsuit. The ruling revives a discrimination lawsuit brought by a heterosexual woman who claimed she was demoted by a lesbian supervisor. The decision clarifies that the Civil Rights Act of 1964 prohibits workplace discrimination against any individual based on race, color, religion, national origin, and sex, including sexual orientation.</p>
