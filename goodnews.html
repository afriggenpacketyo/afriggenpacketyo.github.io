          <p>American fund managers are urging Congress to revise Section 899 of the "One Big Beautiful Bill Act," fearing it could trigger a rapid withdrawal of foreign investments from the U.S. The Investment Company Institute (ICI) warns that the provision, intended to penalize firms from countries with "unfair foreign taxes," inadvertently impacts most foreign investments in U.S. stock markets. The ICI argues that the bill could depress U.S. equity markets and harm both U.S. companies and investors, with foreign investors owning trillions in U.S. stocks, bonds, and credit. They propose clarifying the scope of Section 899 to avoid discouraging foreign investment in U.S. equity markets. (not investment advice)</p>

He added that many companies in China are making chips and doing well, with Huawei being just one of them. Sanctions since 2019 have curtailed Huawei's access to U.S.-made components, forcing it to diversify its growth strategy.</p>

          <p>Japan plans to release an additional 200,000 tons of rice from government stockpiles through direct contracts with retailers to address elevated rice prices, according to Farm Minister Shinjiro Koizumi. The released rice will consist of 100,000 tons each from the 2020 and 2021 harvests, with the 2020 rice expected to be sold at 1,700 yen per 5 kilograms. This move will reduce the country's rice reserve to around 100,000 tons, and Koizumi has expressed interest in increasing rice imports to ensure a stable domestic supply. The government aims to distribute the rice quickly to consumers at lower prices. </p>

          <p>Chinese exports to major industrial centers in Southeast Asia have risen significantly in the first five months of the year, driven by growing consumer markets and offshore factory investments. Shipments to Vietnam increased by 18.8%, exports to Thailand grew by 20.9%, and Indonesia saw a 16.8% increase in shipments from China. This expansion is partly due to Chinese manufacturers shipping more to Southeast Asian factories to produce finished goods for local sale or export, including to the U.S., in response to import tariffs imposed by the U.S. This diversification of exports underscores the increasing importance of Southeast Asian countries as trading partners.</p>

          <p>A recall on cases of Dr Pepper Zero Sugar has been upgraded to Class II by the FDA due to a serious health risk. The cans, produced by Pepsi Beverages Company, were mislabeled and contained the full amount of sugar found in regular Dr Pepper, around 39 grams, despite being labeled "zero sugar." This poses a risk to individuals who need to avoid sugar, particularly those with diabetes, as consuming too much sugar can lead to hyperglycemia and potentially fatal complications. The recalled cans have the product code XXXXRS05165 and a "best by" date of February 16, 2026, and were distributed in Florida, Georgia, and South Carolina.</p>

          <p>Kelsey Plum voiced her frustration over the lack of foul calls during the Sparks' 89-81 overtime loss to the Golden State Valkyries. Plum, who led the Sparks with 24 points, felt she was consistently fouled without receiving the appropriate calls, leading to a difficult game. Coach Lynne Roberts echoed Plum's sentiments, noting that the scouting report appeared to allow excessive physicality against Plum. Despite the challenges, Plum delivered a clutch three-pointer late in the game, but the Sparks ultimately fell short, highlighting the ongoing struggle for the team this season.</p>
