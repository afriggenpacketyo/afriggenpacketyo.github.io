          <p>The Federal Reserve is expected to maintain its current policy due to uncertainty surrounding President Trump's tariffs and mixed economic signals. Market expectations have shifted, with futures pricing implying little chance of an interest rate cut this week and only a modest probability in June. Fed Chair Jerome Powell faces the challenge of explaining the Fed's cautious stance amid conflicting data, including consumer pessimism, business executive concerns, and solid employment figures. The article highlights the Fed's need to assess the impact of trade policies on inflation expectations before making any significant moves. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>Judge Jefferson Griffin, the Republican challenger in a North Carolina Supreme Court race, conceded after a six-month legal battle to overturn the victory of Democratic incumbent Justice Allison Riggs. The concession followed a federal court ruling ordering the state elections board to certify Justice Riggs's victory, which had been affirmed by two recounts. Griffin's challenge, which sought to invalidate thousands of ballots, drew criticism from democracy watchdog groups and others who feared it could set a dangerous precedent for future elections. Justice Riggs expressed relief that the will of the voters was finally heard after a protracted and costly process.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Congress is considering bipartisan legislation to end penny production due to economic concerns, despite resistance from collectors. It costs nearly four cents to produce each one-cent coin, leading to calls for its elimination. While some, like Copper Penny Grille owner Shelly Gref, value the penny's historical significance and artistic potential, economists argue it's a waste of time and resources. The Kilcoyne family, who create collectible pennies, worry about their business if the coin is discontinued, but also see potential for increased value if it becomes rare.</p>

These rates are determined annually by the government and are based on the May auction of the 10-year Treasury note. The calculation for these rates is based on the Treasury Department's announced high yield rate on Tuesday of 4.34%.</p>
