          <h2>Tariff Uncertainty Clouds Chinese Car-Parts Makers' Expansion Plans</h2>

          <p>Lower tariffs on Chinese goods following trade talks in Geneva have prompted mainland-based auto-parts producers to reassess plans for building production facilities in the US. The US agreed to lower tariffs on most Chinese imports from 145% to 30% for 90 days, offering a temporary reprieve for vendors who export nearly 100 billion yuan worth of auto parts to the US annually. However, uncertainty remains as the outlook is unclear, with tariffs potentially jumping again after 90 days, impacting the ability of Chinese vendors and American customers to strike deals. The current tariff on Chinese-made EV batteries stands at 58.4%.</p>

          <p>In talks with American negotiators, Iran has proposed the creation of a joint nuclear enrichment venture involving regional Arab countries and American investments as an alternative to Washington‚Äôs demand that it dismantle its nuclear program. Foreign Minister Abbas Araghchi presented the idea to American special envoy Steve Witkoff during talks in Oman. The proposal suggests Iran would enrich uranium to a low grade and ship it to other Arab countries for civilian use, with oversight from international representatives. This plan aims to provide a permanent solution, unlike the 2015 nuclear deal, and would allow President Trump to claim a significant achievement.</p>

The researchers warn that DeepSeek's tendency to generate factually incorrect outputs could lead to substantial clinical risk, despite its strong reasoning capabilities.

She isolated rhizobia bacteria that convert nitrogen into a form that feeds plants and documented benefits from Azospirillum, which stimulates root growth.

          <p>Pandora, the Danish jewelry company, is preparing to raise prices and reroute shipments due to potential tariffs imposed by the Trump administration, which could cost the company millions. CEO Alexander Lacik stated that the company is "battle ready" but is waiting to see how investors, customers, and competitors react before making major strategic decisions. Pandora has been making jewelry in Thailand since 1989 and is building a new plant in Vietnam, both countries subject to potential tariffs. The company is also streamlining its supply chain and considering price adjustments to mitigate the impact.</p>

          <p>Pete Rose and "Shoeless" Joe Jackson were reinstated by Major League Baseball Commissioner Rob Manfred, making them eligible for the Hall of Fame after their careers were marred by gambling scandals. Manfred changed the league's policy on permanent ineligibility, stating that bans would expire at death. Rose's reinstatement occurred after his death, and Jackson was also reinstated, along with other players involved in the 1919 Chicago Black Sox scandal. The Hall of Fame will now consider their candidacies, although voters are instructed to consider a player's integrity and character.</p>
