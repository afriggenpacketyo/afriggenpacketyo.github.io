          <p>Sources indicate that Republican National Committee chairman Michael Whatley is preparing to run for the U.S. Senate seat in North Carolina being vacated by Republican Thom Tillis. His planned entry into the 2026 race reportedly has the endorsement of the White House. On the Democratic side, former North Carolina Governor Roy Cooper is also expected to announce his candidacy for the same seat. This development follows Lara Trump's announcement that she will not be running, setting the stage for a high-profile contest in the battleground state.</p>

          <p>McDonald's plans to test a new line of beverages, including cold brews, refreshers, and flavored sodas, at more than 500 restaurants this summer. The move aims to attract younger consumers and capitalize on the trend of flavorful, customizable drinks, a strategy influenced by its recently shuttered CosMc's spinoff. This beverage expansion is part of an effort to boost sales, which have been lackluster in recent quarters. The test will initially be limited to locations in and around Wisconsin and Colorado to gauge customer preferences and operational feasibility.</p>

          <p>Two wallabies that escaped from a private enclosure in Mouscron, Belgium, have prompted a multi-day, cross-border search involving police and firefighters. One of the marsupials was safely captured in a residential garden in northern France, but its companion remains at large. The animals escaped while their owner was on vacation, and footage of them hopping through urban areas has circulated widely on social media. Authorities are now relying on public sightings to locate the second wallaby, highlighting a quirky incident of escaped exotic pets.</p>

          <p>Former Labour leader Jeremy Corbyn, now an independent MP, is launching a new political party alongside fellow independent MP Zarah Sultana. The yet-to-be-named party aims to "take on the rich and powerful" and offer an alternative to what they describe as Labour's "control freaks" and Reform UK's "dangerously divisive" politics. Corbyn stated the new organization will be community-led and grassroots-focused, distinguishing it from the top-down structure of the Labour Party. The move signals a formal split on the British left and could potentially draw votes away from Labour in future elections.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Shares of retailer American Eagle Outfitters jumped significantly, positioning it as the latest company to be swept up in a meme stock rally. The surge appears to be fueled by individual investors on platforms like Reddit's Wall Street Bets, who were drawn to the stock's high short interest. This renewed retail trader activity was sparked in part by the company's announcement of a new marketing campaign featuring actress Sydney Sweeney. The rally provides a potential boost for the stock, which had fallen approximately 35% year-to-date before the recent trading frenzy. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>Three British nationals convicted of smuggling cocaine into Bali, Indonesia, have avoided a potential death sentence and will instead serve 12-month prison sentences. Lisa Stocker, Jon Collyer, and Phineas Float were arrested in February after nearly a kilogram of cocaine, disguised in packets of Angel Delight dessert mix, was found. Under Indonesian law, drug trafficking can carry the death penalty, but the country has maintained a temporary halt on executions since 2017. With time already served, the three could be eligible for release by early 2026.</p>
