          <p>Australian investment firm Washington H. Soul Pattinson (Soul Patts) and Brickworks announced a A$14 billion ($9 billion) merger, leading to a surge in both companies' stock prices. The deal involves a new company acquiring all outstanding shares of Soul Patts and Brickworks, creating an entity with holdings across real estate, private equity, and credit totaling A$13.1 billion. This merger unwinds a 56-year mutual ownership designed to prevent hostile takeovers, but critics argued it suppressed shareholder value and corporate transparency. The simplification of the structure and increased scale are expected to create a more investable company. (not investment advice)</p>
