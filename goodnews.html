          <p>Paraguay's President Santiago Peña has pledged to defend the nation's 68-year diplomatic relationship with Taiwan, describing it as a strategic alliance rooted in shared democratic values. Speaking at a business forum, Peña emphasized that the ties are a matter of sovereign foreign policy, not merely economic interest. This statement reinforces Paraguay's position as one of Taiwan's few remaining diplomatic allies, coming after Paraguayan authorities previously accused a Chinese envoy of attempting to persuade opposition lawmakers to switch recognition to Beijing.</p>

          <p>A Jefferies report indicates that China is becoming a "biotech supermarket" due to its cost and efficiency advantages in drug development. At a recent major cancer research conference, nearly one-third of drug candidate presentations involved Chinese companies, a significant increase from just one a decade ago. Global pharmaceutical multinationals are increasingly seeking partnerships with Chinese firms to access novel drugs. These deals typically grant the international partners rights to develop and market the drugs globally, while the Chinese innovators retain rights in their domestic market.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Rumors about legendary coach Nick Saban returning to football intensified during SEC Media Days, fueled by comments from prominent figures in the sport. Former Alabama quarterback Greg McElroy mentioned that a well-connected source believes Saban is not finished with coaching. Additionally, Ole Miss coach Lane Kiffin and LSU coach Brian Kelly both expressed their belief that Saban will eventually return to the sidelines, either in college football or the NFL. Saban, who cited the changing landscape of college sports as a reason for his retirement, has not commented on the speculation.</p>

          <p>The unhoused population in Los Angeles County has decreased by 4% to an estimated 72,308 people, marking the second year in a row with a reported decline. Mayor Karen Bass highlighted the progress, attributing it to encampment resolutions and increased funding for housing. Despite the overall drop, the majority of those experiencing homelessness remain people of color. The positive trend faces uncertainty, however, as the Los Angeles Homeless Services Authority (Lahsa) faces potential budget cuts that could jeopardize future counts and services.</p>

          <p>CNBC's Jim Cramer has told investors to anticipate a rise in corporate deal-making, stating that the market is currently in the "ripple stage" before a larger wave of mergers and acquisitions (M&A). He pointed to recent deals, such as Ferrero's acquisition of WK Kellogg, as harbingers of more activity to come in the fall. Cramer suggested that a more M&A-friendly Federal Trade Commission under the current administration is encouraging companies to pursue such deals. He advised investors to look toward this future potential rather than focusing on past regulatory hurdles. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>Milwaukee Brewers rookie pitcher Jacob Misiorowski has become a central topic of conversation at the MLB All-Star Game following his surprise selection to the National League team. The move was controversial, with some players and critics calling it a "joke" due to Misiorowski's limited big-league experience. His selection was largely propelled by a recent dominant performance against the Los Angeles Dodgers, where he struck out 12 batters. Despite the backlash, NL manager Dave Roberts expressed excitement about the rookie's inclusion, highlighting the attention it brings to the game.</p>

          <p>Kentucky Republican Representative Thomas Massie, who has publicly broken with former President Trump on key issues, has reported a strong fundraising quarter. His campaign announced it raised over $584,000 from April to June and now has more than $1.7 million in cash on hand for his re-election bid. This financial strength comes as Trump's political operation has launched a super PAC specifically aimed at unseating Massie in his 2026 primary. The fundraising success signals Massie's readiness to mount a significant defense against the challenge from the former president's allies.</p>

          <p>The UK government has launched a public consultation on the future of the Post Office, suggesting that ownership could eventually be transferred to the postmasters who run its branches. This idea of "mutualisation" has been discussed for over a decade but was sidelined by the Horizon IT scandal. The government aims to transform the organization's culture and restore trust following the wrongful conviction of hundreds of sub-postmasters. Any change in ownership structure is unlikely before 2030, but the consultation will also explore the future services the Post Office should offer.</p>

The grueling 135-mile race starts in Death Valley and involves extreme heat and significant elevation gain. Becker finished the race with about three hours to spare, successfully settling a "score" after he narrowly missed the 48-hour cutoff time in 2022. Having started running marathons at age 60, Becker credited his dedicated coaching crew for his success in this year's event, demonstrating remarkable endurance and determination.</p>

          <p>The U.S. dairy industry has voluntarily agreed to stop using synthetic dyes in ice cream, according to an announcement from the Trump administration. Health Secretary Robert F. Kennedy Jr. framed the move as a positive response from the industry to the administration's focus on removing "bad chemicals" from food. The announcement also included the FDA's approval of a new plant-based blue dye. This voluntary agreement is consistent with the administration's approach of working with industries on health and food standards, rather than imposing new regulations.</p>
