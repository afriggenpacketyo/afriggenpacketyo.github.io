          <p>A WWF report highlights the vital role of UK saltmarshes in carbon sequestration and flood protection.  These tidal habitats store significant amounts of greenhouse gases in their mud.  The report calls for their inclusion in the UK's carbon inventory to incentivize restoration and protection.  This is crucial given the 85% loss of saltmarshes since 1860 due to agricultural practices.</p>
