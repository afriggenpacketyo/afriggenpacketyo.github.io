          <p>Millions of underused single-family homes on spacious lots could be refitted for multiple occupancy, offering a potential solution to the affordable housing crisis. Developer Monte Anderson is experimenting with "roommate houses," converting single-family homes into multiple studio apartments while navigating zoning regulations. This approach addresses the housing mismatch between older people living in large homes and the growing demand for smaller, more affordable units. Cities and states are increasingly encouraging such conversions through policies that allow backyard homes and lot subdivisions, adding housing in existing neighborhoods without major disruption.</p>
