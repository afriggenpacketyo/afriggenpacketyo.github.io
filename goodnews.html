          <p>The Seattle Mariners have established a commanding 2-0 lead over the Toronto Blue Jays in the American League Championship Series, winning 10-3 in the latest game. The Blue Jays' offense has struggled, with star Vladimir Guerrero Jr. going hitless in the series so far. In the National League, the Los Angeles Dodgers secured a 2-1 victory against the Milwaukee Brewers to open their championship series. Historically, teams that win the first two games on the road in a best-of-seven series have a very high probability of advancing.</p>

          <p>Los Angeles Dodgers pitcher Blake Snell delivered a masterful performance, pitching eight scoreless innings to secure a 2-1 win over the Milwaukee Brewers in Game 1 of the NLCS. Snell struck out ten batters and faced the minimum, erasing the only baserunner he allowed. The Dodgers' offense overcame a frustrating fourth inning, where a potential grand slam was nullified by an unusual double play, with Freddie Freeman hitting a solo home run in the sixth for the decisive run. This victory gives the Dodgers an early 1-0 lead in the series.</p>

          <p>In her first public appearance since her federal indictment on bank fraud charges, New York Attorney General Letitia James received a standing ovation at a rally for mayoral candidate Zohran Mamdani. Without mentioning President Trump directly, James delivered a defiant speech, stating she would not break or capitulate to what she calls "baseless" charges. The indictment stems from a house purchase in Virginia. A spokesperson noted her reelection campaign has seen a surge in donations since the charges were announced last week.</p>

In another Monday night game, the Chicago Bears secured a 25-24 victory over the Washington Commanders. The win came down to a final-play 38-yard field goal by kicker Jake Moody, extending the Bears' winning streak to three games.</p>

          <p>A woman named Tina, who was left with severe speech difficulties after a traumatic brain injury from a fall in 2018, has regained her confidence and ability to communicate by learning British Sign Language (BSL). The journey, which began after she and her husband moved to a retirement village, was featured in a BBC series with deaf actress Rose Ayling-Ellis. Learning BSL has provided Tina with an alternative method to express herself when words fail. Her husband Mark now leads practice sessions for others in their community, highlighting the language's benefits beyond the deaf community.</p>

          <p>China's Ministry of Commerce has confirmed that working-level talks were held with the United States, despite an ongoing and recently escalated trade dispute. The ministry urged the U.S. to demonstrate "sincerity for dialogue" rather than engaging in intimidation or threatening new restrictions. This communication occurred under a bilateral consultation mechanism established earlier this year. The statement came after a U.S. trade official noted that Beijing had expanded rare earth export controls and had been unwilling to discuss the matter, highlighting the continued friction between the two economic powers.</p>

          <p>NATO Secretary General Mark Rutte made a joking reference to a Russian submarine that was observed being shadowed and possibly towed through the English Channel and North Sea. Rutte quipped that the situation seemed more like "the hunt for the nearest mechanic" than a Tom Clancy novel, suggesting the vessel was "limping" home. Russia's Black Sea Fleet denied any malfunction, stating the submarine Novorossiysk surfaced to comply with navigation rules. The incident occurred as the Royal Navy and Dutch navy monitored the Kilo-class submarine during its transit from the Mediterranean.</p>

          <p>SpaceX successfully conducted the eleventh test flight of its massive Starship rocket, launching it from South Texas on a journey halfway around the world. The booster section separated as planned and performed a controlled splashdown in the Gulf of Mexico, while the upper-stage spacecraft continued into space before descending into the Indian Ocean. The flight achieved its primary objectives, including deploying mock satellites, marking another significant step for the program. Starship is central to both NASA's plans for landing astronauts on the moon and Elon Musk's long-term goal of human missions to Mars.</p>

          <p>President Donald Trump joined over 20 world leaders in Sharm El-Sheikh, Egypt, to sign a declaration aimed at solidifying a peace plan for Gaza. The ceremony followed the release of all living Israeli hostages by Hamas and the freeing of Palestinian prisoners by Israel. The document, co-signed by the leaders of Egypt, Turkey, and Qatar, outlines broad commitments to diplomacy and prosperity but is largely symbolic. Notably absent from the summit were representatives from Israel, with Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu citing a Jewish holiday, despite having praised Trump in Israel's parliament just hours earlier.</p>

          <p>Missouri has enacted a new hands-free driving law to combat the dangers of distracted driving, which on average kills nine people daily in the U.S. The state is one of 32 to ban handheld cellphone use while driving. To enhance enforcement and education, the Department of Transportation is now using anonymized smartphone and vehicle data, known as telematics, to identify distracted driving hot spots. This data-driven approach aims to target problem areas more effectively, a change championed by advocates like Adrienne Siddens, whose husband was killed by a distracted driver in 2019.</p>

This creates a peculiar situation where voters can choose between the Republican incumbent and the vanished Democrat.

          <p>Governor Gavin Newsom has signed legislation that significantly increases the pay for incarcerated individuals who volunteer to fight California's wildfires. The new law raises their wages from approximately $1 an hour to the federal minimum wage of $7.25 per hour. This measure, which takes effect immediately, acknowledges the dangerous and crucial work performed by prison fire crews, who are a vital part of the state's wildfire response. The move follows growing calls for social justice and better compensation for inmates performing one of the most hazardous jobs available in the prison system.</p>

          <p>While the initial phase of the Gaza peace plan has seen hostages and prisoners exchanged, significant challenges remain for achieving a lasting resolution. Key unresolved issues include Israel's demand for Hamas to completely disarm, a condition the group rejects, and the lack of agreement on Gaza's postwar governance. The U.S.-brokered plan proposes an international body to oversee the territory, but the current Israeli government opposes a role for the Palestinian Authority and the creation of a Palestinian state. The fragility of the truce means negotiations on these core issues could easily break down.</p>

Born Lizette Gutierrez, San Cha draws from her upbringing of watching telenovelas and studying the Bible.
