        </div>
        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Experts suggest that adequate protein intake is crucial for maintaining healthy hair, as strands are primarily composed of keratin, a protein. Dr. Ross Kopelman, a hair transplant surgeon, notes that protein deficiency can lead to diffuse shedding and brittle hair, as the body prioritizes essential organs. The article explains that correcting protein intake can improve hair density within months, with amino acids like lysine and cysteine being particularly important for keratin production. While supplements can help, a balanced diet rich in protein sources like eggs, fish, and legumes is recommended for overall hair health.</p>

          <p>Kansas City Chiefs head coach Andy Reid publicly praised tight end Travis Kelce's 'passion' following their second sideline confrontation in as many weeks. During the Chiefs' 22-9 victory over the New York Giants, Reid and Kelce had an animated exchange in the second quarter. Reid dismissed concerns, stating that Kelce's emotional intensity is a key part of his greatness, and that he sometimes needs to act as a 'policeman.' The article notes a similar incident during the Super Bowl, but quarterback Patrick Mahomes affirmed the strong relationship between the coach and player.</p>

          <p>London Gatwick Airport's £2.2bn privately-financed plan for a second runway has been approved by Transport Secretary Heidi Alexander, aiming to boost economic growth. The project involves moving the existing Northern Runway 12 meters to bring it into regular use, increasing annual flights from 280,000 to an estimated 389,000 by the late 2030s. While the Chancellor Rachel Reeves lauded the potential for thousands of jobs and billions in investment, environmental groups like the Green Party condemned it as a 'disaster' for climate efforts. The article notes new conditions, including stricter noise controls and public transport targets, to mitigate local impact.</p>

          <h2>Understanding Key Differences Between ETFs and Mutual Funds for Investors</h2>
          <div class="timestamp">2025-09-22 07:00:01 EDT</div>
        </div>
        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>This article outlines the crucial distinctions between Exchange-Traded Funds (ETFs) and mutual funds, both popular investment vehicles for diversification. A primary difference lies in trading: ETFs trade like stocks throughout the day, while mutual fund transactions are priced at day's end. More significantly for long-term investors, ETFs offer greater tax efficiency due to their 'in-kind' transaction mechanism, which typically avoids capital gains distributions common in mutual funds. Additionally, ETFs generally have lower expense ratios, making them a cheaper option, though mutual funds still offer a broader universe of funds and are more commonly found in 401(k) plans.

          <p>A Citi Private Bank survey reveals that ultra-wealthy family offices are optimistic about their 2025 returns, with most expecting 5-10% or over 10%. While seven out of ten family offices made direct investments in private companies, showing a bullish trend in risk assets, there's a notable retreat from early-stage startup and seed funding. This article highlights a shift towards growth-stage investments and opportunistic plays in secondary sales, driven by a focus on specific long-term themes like AI rather than broad asset classes. Family offices, often with controlling stakes in operating businesses, benefit from reliable cash flow to fund private equity. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>Bill McKibben, a prominent climate voice, expresses optimism about the rapid global transformation in solar and wind power, despite the bleak political landscape and a potential second Trump presidency. His new book, 'Here Comes the Sun,' highlights that renewables are now the cheapest energy sources, with regions like California often running on over 100% clean energy. The article emphasizes that while political damage from a Trump administration is significant, the economic realities of cheap clean energy are changing politics even in red states.

          <p>The Liberal Democrats are advocating for cigarette-style health warnings on social media apps for children, alongside a two-hour 'doomscrolling cap' for under-18s. The party cites concerns over 'addictive algorithms' and the documented risks of excessive phone usage, including anxiety, sleep disruption, and shortened attention spans. Technology spokesperson Victoria Collins argues that social media, like cigarettes or alcohol, should carry mandatory health alerts to inform teenagers of the risks. This article notes that while the Labour government is considering similar time curbs and a 22:00 curfew, the Liberal Democrats criticize ministers for not delivering stronger online safety measures.</p>

          <p>A groundbreaking experimental device, implanted in the neck to stimulate the vagus nerve, has been approved by the FDA for rheumatoid arthritis patients unresponsive to traditional drugs. This article details how the device works by sending signals to the brain and spleen, instructing cells to reduce inflammation-regulating cytokines. Lynn Milam, a patient who experienced a dramatic recovery from debilitating pain, describes it as a 'rebirth.' While not all patients achieve such a profound outcome, the pivotal clinical trial showed meaningful improvement in 35% of a difficult-to-treat group. This technology represents a significant turning point in managing autoimmune diseases.</p>
