          <p>The leaders of France, Germany, Britain, and Poland made a joint visit to Kyiv to demonstrate their support for Ukraine and to encourage Russia to agree to a 30-day cease-fire. This marks the first time these four European nations have traveled together to Ukrainian soil. The visit occurs after President Putin welcomed leaders from China and Brazil to Moscow, showcasing a non-Western world order. The European leaders reiterated their backing for President Trump‚Äôs call for a peace deal and urged Russia to cease obstructing efforts for lasting peace, aiming to ensure Ukraine's prosperity within its recognized borders. They also plan a virtual meeting with other Western leaders to discuss a "coalition of the willing" to secure Ukraine post-conflict.</p>

Despite the ongoing conflict in Gaza, these nations are prioritizing business and investment opportunities, particularly in defense, artificial intelligence, and advanced weaponry. Saudi Arabia has offered $600 billion in trade and investment over four years, while the UAE plans to invest $1.4 trillion in the US over the next decade, focusing on AI and semiconductors. Trump's visit may also address regional security cooperation, potentially including the Saudi civil nuclear program and defense agreements, independent of the Israeli normalization process.</p>

          <p>Japan's former Emperor Akihito was discharged from a Tokyo hospital after undergoing medical tests for myocardial ischemia, a condition involving reduced blood flow to the heart muscle. Although the 91-year-old showed no symptoms, the Imperial Household Agency stated that he will require careful follow-up care. Akihito was admitted to the hospital after an earlier checkup detected signs of the heart condition. He previously received treatment for heart failure in 2022 and abdicated the throne in April 2019, marking the first abdication by a Japanese monarch in approximately 200 years.</p>

          <p>Kosmos-482, a robotic Soviet spacecraft launched in 1972 with the intention of landing on Venus, is predicted to re-enter Earth‚Äôs atmosphere. Due to a rocket malfunction, the spacecraft remained in Earth orbit for 53 years and is now slowly spiraling back. The spacecraft, weighing approximately 1,050 pounds and equipped with a protective heat shield, has a chance of surviving its descent. Experts estimate the re-entry will occur soon, but the exact location remains unknown, though it will be somewhere between 52 degrees north and south latitude.</p>

After a lengthy legal battle, South Korea's Supreme Court upheld a decision to return the statue to Kannonji Temple in Japan.
