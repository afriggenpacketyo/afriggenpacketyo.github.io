          <p>Everton's women's team will move to Goodison Park, the club's former stadium, after plans to demolish the 132-year-old venue were cancelled. The club will relocate to a new 53,000-seat arena at Bramley-Moore Dock this summer, but a feasibility study led to the decision to maintain Goodison Park for the women's team. With a capacity of nearly 40,000, Goodison Park will be the largest dedicated women's football stadium in the country. The move aims to generate economic opportunities for local businesses and support the ambition of creating a competitive team.</p>
