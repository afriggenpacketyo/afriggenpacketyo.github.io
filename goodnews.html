          <p>Elon Musk announced at the Qatar Economic Forum that he plans to significantly decrease his political spending in the future, a notable shift after donating over $250 million to help Donald Trump win a second term. Musk stated he feels he has "done enough" but may reconsider if he sees a future reason for political spending. This decision could impact Republicans running for reelection, as Musk's super political action committee was a major spender in recent elections. Public opinion of Musk and his companies has declined, coinciding with a drop in Tesla's market value, though shares have recently rebounded. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>President Donald Trump is set to announce plans for a massive missile shield system, dubbed the 'Golden Dome,' to protect the U.S. from missile threats, potentially costing tens to hundreds of billions of dollars. The project, led by Gen. Michael Guetlein, echoes President Ronald Reagan's 'Star Wars' program. Trump's push for the shield, inspired by Israel's Iron Dome, was met with cheers at rallies, leading to its inclusion in the Republican party platform. Questions remain about the system's scope and potential impact on other vital programs, such as the Air Force's intercontinental ballistic missile replacement.</p>

          <p>This article discusses the complexities of prostate cancer screening, highlighting that even diligent testing may not detect aggressive forms of the disease. Guidelines advise against screening after age 70, as many men have slow-growing cancers that pose no threat. The article references the recent diagnosis of former President Joe Biden, noting that fast-growing cancers can emerge between screenings or remain undetected by PSA tests. Experts emphasize the importance of discussing the risks and benefits of screening with doctors, as treatments can have devastating side effects, particularly in older men.</p>

The 30-page treaty lays out a framework for boosting surveillance of animals to lower the risk of viruses spilling over to humans and for responding more effectively once pandemics do come. However, the agreement's ultimate impact remains unclear due to a lack of enforcement mechanisms and robust funding, and the absence of the U.S. The agreement's success depends on countries ratifying the agreement internally.</p>

Another study revealed that losing Medicaid coverage leads to reduced prescription drug access and increased mortality rates. The studies underscore the importance of careful consideration when making changes to the program, as restricting access could have deadly consequences.</p>

          <p>In his 'Dear James' advice column, James Parker addresses a reader's question about dealing with the prevalence of hate in the world. He distinguishes between elemental hate, which is rare and destructive, and petty hate, which is becoming more common due to psychic atomization. Parker suggests detaching from hate, limiting smartphone and social media use, and practicing kindness towards others and oneself. He also acknowledges the overuse of the word 'existential' due to the current state of the world.</p>
