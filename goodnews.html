          <p>China is conducting a 14-day aviation training workshop for representatives from eight Southeast Asian nations, aiming to promote its home-grown civilian aircraft like the C919. This initiative, organized by the Civil Aviation Administration of China, covers critical areas such as safety management, airworthiness certification, and new technologies. The move signifies China's strategic effort to expand its aviation industry's reach and challenge the dominance of Western manufacturers like Airbus and Boeing. Southeast Asia is already a leading region for Chinese jet deliveries, indicating growing regional cooperation.</p>

With Democratic Senator Jeanne Shaheen not seeking re-election in 2026, the field is open, and Sununu is considered a top GOP recruit. Senior White House officials have reportedly endorsed his potential campaign. Sununu stated he would "seriously consider a run" and aims to appeal broadly across the political spectrum, including seeking President Trump's support.</p>

          <p>Authorities in Argentina have successfully recovered "Portrait of a Lady," an 18th-century Italian painting by Giuseppe Ghislandi, which was looted by the Nazis during World War II. The artwork, valued at approximately $50,000, was part of Dutch-Jewish art collector Jacques Goudstikker's collection before his death in 1940. The painting was discovered last month after being spotted in an online real estate listing by journalists researching a Nazi lawyer who had escaped to Argentina. This recovery marks a significant step in restituting stolen art.</p>

The American player attributed her success to a changed mindset after taking a mental health break, emphasizing a positive outlook. Anisimova will now face Naomi Osaka in what promises to be a highly anticipated semi-final match.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>A federal judge has ruled that the Trump administration's freeze of $2.2 billion in grant funds for Harvard University was illegal, characterizing it as a "targeted, ideologically-motivated assault." Judge Allison Burroughs agreed with Harvard that the freeze was retaliatory, imposed after the university refused demands for reforms that violated First Amendment protections. The ruling vacates the freezing orders and bars their enforcement, with the White House vowing to appeal. The judge noted the administration conditioned funding on ideological terms, not solely antisemitism.</p>

          <p>China is making significant strides in artificial intelligence "agentic frameworks," which are essential tools for building AI agents, with major tech companies like Tencent and ByteDance joining the global competition. Tencent recently open-sourced its new Youtu-Agent framework, demonstrating strong performance on web traversal benchmarks. This follows ByteDance's release of its Coze Studio and Alibaba's Qwen-Agent earlier this year. These developments highlight China's concerted effort to compete with U.S. players like AutoGen and OpenAI Swarm, aiming to enable AI agents to autonomously perform complex tasks.</p>

        </div>
        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>A federal appeals court has ruled against the Trump administration's use of the 18th-century Alien Enemies Act to rapidly deport Venezuelan migrants, determining there was "no invasion or predatory incursion." The ruling blocks the use of this obscure wartime law, which the administration had employed to remove hundreds of alleged Tren de Aragua gang members. The court rejected the argument that "mass illegal migration" constituted an invasion. This decision marks a significant legal setback for the administration's immigration strategy, with the ACLU calling it an "incredibly important win" for oversight.</p>

          <p>Shaoxing, a Chinese city, has unveiled a stimulus plan offering subsidies of up to 5,000 yuan to banquet holders who host large events and spend over 10,000 yuan.

The local government is navigating the challenge of boosting spending while adhering to Beijing's anti-corruption campaign, which emphasizes limiting extravagance. Officials expect the new measures to inject an additional 178 million yuan into the economy this year.</p>

          <p>Four Marine League football coaches who forfeited games against Narbonne last season in protest of alleged rule violations now feel vindicated. A Narbonne booster admitted to paying parents of players to transfer, confirming the coaches' suspicions that the City Section and LAUSD failed to investigate. The forfeits, which led to repercussions for the coaches, aimed to highlight systemic issues in high school football. An LAUSD investigation later found Narbonne players ineligible and imposed a three-year playoff ban, validating the coaches' controversial stand against unfair practices.</p>

          <p>Salesforce reported better-than-expected Q2 results, yet its stock fell due to cautious Q3 revenue guidance and an unchanged full-year outlook. Despite this, the CNBC Investing Club, holding a position in CRM, remains confident, citing strong performance in key "clouds" and the growth of its AI-powered Agentforce platform. The company's annual recurring revenue from "Data Cloud and AI" reached $1.2 billion, up 120% year-over-year, indicating strong AI product adoption. While acknowledging challenges, the article suggests upcoming events like the Dreamforce conference could be catalysts for renewed growth. (not investment advice)</p>
