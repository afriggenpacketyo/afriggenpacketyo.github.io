        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>A growing number of multigenerational, high-value "trophy" ranches are being listed for sale as heirs find themselves in disagreement or have little interest in managing the vast properties. Brokers report a significant increase in inventory for these legacy estates, some of which are on the market for the first time in over a century. The trend is fueled by the generational transfer of wealth and the complexities of shared family ownership. While some heirs prefer to cash out, there is strong demand from wealthy buyers, often influenced by the "Yellowstone" effect, seeking privacy and a connection to the American West.</p>

          <p>The American Gaming Association projects that Americans will legally wager a record-breaking $30 billion on the upcoming NFL season, an 8.5% increase from the previous year. Major sportsbooks like FanDuel and DraftKings are preparing for a surge in activity, but they face growing competition from both established rivals and unlicensed offshore operators. In response to the threat from illegal gambling, which costs states an estimated $4 billion in tax revenue, law enforcement is increasing its crackdown. Recent data suggests that states with active enforcement against illegal sites see significantly higher growth in their legal betting markets.</p>

In the second session, he narrowly edged out Aston Martin's Fernando Alonso, while his teammate Oscar Piastri was third. The sessions were eventful, featuring spins from Lewis Hamilton and crashes involving Lance Stroll and Alex Albon, which caused significant damage to their cars. The performance signals a strong start to the weekend for McLaren as they look to challenge their rivals.</p>

          <p>Alibaba's U.S.-listed shares climbed as much as 12% after the company reported better-than-expected net income for its fiscal first quarter, driven by strong performance in its cloud computing unit. Revenue for the cloud division grew 26% year-on-year, fueled by robust demand for artificial intelligence services, which have seen triple-digit growth for eight consecutive quarters. While overall company revenues slightly missed forecasts, investors were encouraged by the acceleration in the high-margin cloud business. The company is continuing to balance heavy investment in AI and competitive e-commerce against maintaining profitability. (not investment advice)</p>

CEO Max Levchin highlighted continued consumer strength and robust growth in transaction volume, driven by key partnerships with Shopify and Amazon.

          <p>North Korean leader Kim Jong-un is set to attend a military parade in Beijing, an event that will mark his first participation in a multilateral summit with other heads of state. The visit was confirmed by both China's foreign ministry and North Korea's state news agency. Analysts suggest this move could signal a realignment in the relationship between the two allied nations. Kim will be among 26 foreign leaders at the parade, which commemorates the 80th anniversary of the end of Japanese colonial rule on the Korean peninsula, providing a significant diplomatic stage for the typically reclusive leader.</p>

          <p>Philadelphia Phillies' designated hitter Kyle Schwarber hit four home runs in a game against the Atlanta Braves, becoming just the 21st player in MLB history to achieve this rare feat. Leading the league with 49 home runs this season, Schwarber accomplished the milestone in the first, fourth, fifth, and seventh innings. He had an opportunity to hit a historic fifth home run in the eighth inning but popped out against a position player, infielder Vidal Bruján. This harmless final at-bat averted potential controversy over the legitimacy of such a record against a non-pitcher, a practice that has drawn criticism in baseball.</p>

          <p>Yoga, the ancient Indian practice, has evolved into a significant tool of "soft power" for India, shaping its cultural identity on the world stage. Spearheaded by Prime Minister Narendra Modi's government, the establishment of the International Day of Yoga has helped transform the practice from a wellness trend into a symbol of India's civilizational influence. Through cultural exchanges and collaborations with international bodies like the WHO, India is promoting yoga as a non-controversial and universally appealing vehicle for strengthening people-to-people ties. However, this global rise has also sparked criticism regarding over-commercialization and cultural appropriation in the West.</p>

          <p>The Personal Consumption Expenditures (PCE) index, a key inflation metric for the Federal Reserve, indicated that prices rose at a 2.6% annual rate in July, unchanged from the previous month. However, core inflation, which excludes food and energy, edged up slightly to 2.9%, its highest level since February. The report also revealed a 0.5% increase in consumer spending, the largest jump since March, suggesting that Americans have not significantly curtailed their purchasing habits. These figures present a mixed picture for the Fed, which is cautiously considering its first interest rate cut while inflation remains above its 2% target. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>Crystal Palace is reportedly working to sign two new central defenders before the transfer deadline, a move that could pave the way for defender Marc Guehi to join Liverpool. The Premier League champions have been in talks for a £35 million transfer for Guehi, who has indicated he will not sign a new contract with Palace. While Palace manager Oliver Glasner publicly insists Guehi must stay, the club is reluctant to lose him on a free transfer next summer. The club is in advanced talks for Toulouse's Jaydee Canvot and is also pursuing an experienced defender to bolster its backline.</p>

          <p>The U.S. Department of the Interior has drafted a proposal to add 51 commodities, including copper, silicon, and silver, to its official List of Critical Minerals. This expansion is designed to guide government investment and streamline permitting to reduce reliance on foreign sources, particularly China, and prevent potential supply-chain disruptions. By designating these materials as critical, the U.S. aims to onshore more production for key industries like semiconductors, automotive manufacturing, and solar panels. The list identifies minerals essential to the economy and national security where the U.S. is vulnerable to import interruptions. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>Controversial Harvard astrophysicist Avi Loeb has co-authored a thought experiment suggesting that the interstellar object 3I/ATLAS, currently passing through our solar system, exhibits anomalies that could be consistent with an alien spacecraft. The object's unusual orbit, which is remarkably close to Earth's orbital plane, and its trajectory near several planets are statistically unlikely coincidences. While acknowledging that the object is almost certainly natural, Loeb argues that analyzing such anomalies is a useful exercise for identifying potential extraterrestrial technology in the future. The dominant scientific opinion is that 3I/ATLAS is a natural object, likely a comet, despite some atypical characteristics.</p>
