          <p>The UK and India have officially agreed to a trade deal after three years of negotiations, which aims to reduce tariffs on various goods and services between the two countries. The agreement will make it easier for UK firms to export products like whisky and cars to India, while also cutting taxes on India's clothing and footwear exports. Expected to boost trade by an additional ¬£25.5 billion a year by 2040, the deal includes provisions on services and procurement, allowing British firms to compete for more contracts. Both Prime Ministers Starmer and Modi hailed the agreement as a significant milestone that will promote economic growth and job creation in their respective countries.</p>

          <p>Conservative leader Friedrich Merz secured the chancellorship of Germany in a second parliamentary vote, overcoming an unprecedented initial defeat. Merz failed to secure an absolute majority in the first secret ballot, creating hours of uncertainty and confusion in the Bundestag. Despite his coalition's expected majority, some members dissented, leading to the need for a second vote, which he ultimately won with a margin of nine votes. Merz was then sworn in as chancellor, averting a potential political crisis and paving the way for his team of 17 ministers to take office, signaling the creation of a stable government ready to tackle pressing issues like migration and the economy.</p>

          <p>This article from the New York Times profiles Friedrich Merz, Germany's newly elected chancellor, highlighting his background, political approach, and the challenges he faces. Despite securing the chancellorship after a second round of voting in Parliament, Merz enters office at a critical time for Germany's economy, security, and European role. Critics point to his tendency to break promises and struggle with long-term planning, while supporters emphasize his preparedness and potential to address key issues like growth, defense, and immigration. The article suggests that Merz's ability to wrangle lawmakers and confront domestic and international crises will be crucial as he leads Germany forward.</p>

          <p>The Trump administration has removed Alvin Brown, the vice chair of the National Transportation Safety Board, who was appointed during the Biden administration. Brown, a Democrat and former mayor of Jacksonville, Florida, had served on the safety panel since March 2024. The move leaves the NTSB with members solely appointed during Trump's tenure, amid concerns about recent transportation accidents and delays. Transportation Secretary Sean Duffy has announced plans to overhaul America's air traffic control system to address these issues, promising a new system with updated technology and increased staffing.</p>

This agreement is expected to boost bilateral trade by ¬£25.5 billion, with the vast majority of goods becoming tariff-free within a decade.

          <p>Palantir shares experienced a significant drop of over 10% despite the company's ongoing revenue growth acceleration, driven by strong U.S. commercial sector performance. Analysts raised concerns about the modest full-year revenue guidance increase, the sequential margin decline, and the year-over-year decline in international commercial revenue. William Blair analyst Louie DiPalma noted that Palantir's high software multiple makes it vulnerable to compression as revenue growth slows, despite the company exceeding revenue expectations and increasing its revenue guidance for the year.</p>
