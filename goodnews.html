          <p>Following its merger with Skydance, Paramount has secured the exclusive U.S. broadcasting rights for the UFC in a landmark seven-year, $7.7 billion deal starting in 2026. The agreement will shift all UFC events, including marquee fights and 'Fight Nights,' to the Paramount+ streaming service, effectively ending the pay-per-view model for American audiences. This strategic acquisition is the first major move under new CEO David Ellison, who aims to leverage the year-round popularity of UFC to drive subscriber growth and solidify Paramount's position in the competitive live sports market.</p>

Citing an 'urgent moment' due to administration policies on diversity, immigration, and social programs, the organization aims to recruit volunteers and develop local strategies to increase voter turnout. The initiative follows the 2024 election cycle, where President Trump saw increased support among Black voters, particularly men. The town halls will begin in New Jersey and are also planned for key states like Texas, California, and Georgia amid contentious national debates over redistricting.</p>

          <p>As interest rates on savings products begin to decline, experts are advising on the best placement for cash between high-yield savings accounts (HYSAs) and certificates of deposit (CDs). HYSAs are recommended for those needing liquidity for emergency funds, as they offer flexibility without penalties despite having variable rates. Conversely, CDs are favored for guaranteeing a higher fixed return over a set term, making them ideal for investors who believe interest rates will continue to fall and can afford to lock their money away. For those seeking a balanced approach, experts suggest a strategy of dividing funds between both options to achieve both liquidity and higher interest earnings. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>Cannabis stocks surged following a report that President Trump is considering reclassifying marijuana to a less restrictive drug schedule under federal law. Currently a Schedule I drug alongside heroin, a move to Schedule III could be a 'gamechanger' for the industry by easing tax burdens and attracting institutional investment. The potential policy shift, reportedly discussed by Trump at a recent fundraiser, has generated significant optimism in a sector where many stocks have been trading at historic lows. Experts note that while the trade remains complex, reclassification appears to have bipartisan support, signaling a major potential shift in U.S. drug policy. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>Liverpool's performance in the Community Shield showcased both the promise of its new offensive signings and significant defensive frailties. Newcomers Hugo Ekitiké and Florian Wirtz made encouraging debuts, contributing to the team's attack, but the team appeared startlingly open at the back, a recurring issue throughout their pre-season. The team is adapting to a new 4-2-3-1 formation, and the absence of key midfielders highlighted structural vulnerabilities, particularly in the space between the midfield and defense. While the attacking possibilities are exciting, the article suggests Liverpool may face defensive challenges as they integrate new players and tactics early in the season.</p>

          <p>Following several weather-related delays, Amazon successfully launched another batch of 24 Kuiper internet satellites aboard a SpaceX Falcon 9 rocket, bringing its total number in orbit to 102. This marks the fourth Kuiper mission and the second time Amazon has relied on its primary competitor, SpaceX's Starlink, for a launch. Amazon is working to meet a Federal Communications Commission deadline requiring it to have approximately 1,600 satellites, half of its planned constellation, in orbit by July 2026. The company has already secured government contracts and aims to begin commercial service later this year.</p>

          <p>Lithium futures and stocks of major producers like Albemarle surged after Chinese battery giant CATL suspended operations at its Jianxiawo mine, one of the world's largest lithium sources. The mine, which accounts for an estimated 6% of global lithium supply, ceased production because its operating license expired, though the company is seeking renewal. The halt has intensified fears of a supply crunch in the lithium market, which was already strained by a previous suspension at another Chinese mine in July. This disruption has had an immediate positive impact on the share prices of competing lithium producers. (not investment advice)</p>

Grant stated the move was to preserve the company's family-oriented and Christian-based values, which would have been at risk in a conventional sale. The transition ensures the legacy of the 160-store chain continues under a model similar to the John Lewis Partnership.</p>

The comments came after rookie Shedeur Sanders delivered an impressive preseason debut, completing 14 passes for 138 yards and two touchdowns. While veteran Joe Flacco is considered the likely starter, Sanders' performance has intensified the competition. Stefanski declined to name a starter for the upcoming second preseason game, stating he will have a better sense of the plan later in the week as the quarterback competition continues.</p>

The upward momentum is attributed by some analysts to increased buying during Asian trading hours, fueled by the rapid expansion of U.S. debt, which is seen as a tailwind for hard assets. The rally has also boosted crypto-related stocks, with companies like Coinbase and various Bitcoin miners seeing notable gains as investor confidence in the sector grows. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>After a remarkable surge that saw gold prices climb from $2,000 to over $3,400 per ounce, the momentum has recently stalled, prompting questions about its future trajectory. However, precious metals experts suggest this is likely a consolidation phase rather than the end of the rally. They point to structural forces, including record-high purchasing by central banks and strong retail demand, as indicators of continued strength. Experts advise that gold remains a crucial portfolio diversifier and a hedge against geopolitical instability and currency debasement, suggesting that the current pause may still be a good entry point for investors.

          <p>In a notable shift in Malawian politics, several presidential candidates have selected women as their running mates for the upcoming September election. This trend aligns with civic campaigns advocating for 50% female representation in a country where women constitute a majority of registered voters. However, political analysts note that most of these female candidates are with smaller parties, suggesting the move may be more strategic than a fundamental shift toward gender inclusion. While it is seen as a step in the right direction, experts believe voters will prioritize pressing issues like food shortages and the economy over the gender ticket alone.</p>

Rescuers then located him near his shelter after he had etched 'help' on a rock and drawn 'SOS' in the mud.

This proposal is part of a new road safety strategy that also includes potentially lowering the drink-driving limit in England and Wales to match Scotland's. The move follows a coroner's report that called the U.K.'s current self-reporting system for vision problems the 'laxest in Europe' after an inquest into four deaths caused by drivers with failing eyesight.

The company posted revenue of nearly $1.4 billion and a net loss of just $4.7 million, or 1 cent per share, a substantial improvement from the $32.8 million loss a year prior. CEO Adam Aron attributed the positive results to a recovering box office and growth in premium offerings, noting that the company has successfully addressed its 2026 debt maturities.
