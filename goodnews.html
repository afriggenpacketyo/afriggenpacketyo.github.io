        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>During the Pittsburgh Steelers' training camp, wide receiver DK Metcalf revealed a peculiar rule established by his suitemate, quarterback Aaron Rodgers. The two are sharing a dorm with a connecting bathroom, and Rodgers requested that they refrain from flushing the "super loud" toilet at night to avoid disrupting his sleep. Metcalf shared a humorous anecdote about texting Rodgers for permission to flush one evening. Rodgers, a four-time MVP, expressed that he enjoys the dorm life and the opportunity it provides to connect with his teammates, adding he was glad to be paired with someone who cares about hygiene.</p>

          <h2>UK Government Proposes New Rules to Protect Pubs and Music Venues from Noise Complaints</h2>
          <div class="timestamp">2025-07-26 17:30:04 EDT</div>
        </div>
        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>The UK government is planning to reform licensing rules to shield pubs and live music venues from noise complaints, particularly from residents of new property developments. Under the proposed changes, developers building near existing venues would be responsible for soundproofing the new buildings. The government hopes these reforms will also streamline the process for opening new establishments in disused shops and encourage outdoor dining and performances to revitalize town centers. While the government touts the changes as bringing "vibrancy," the opposition has criticized the move as hypocritical, blaming the government's tax policies for harming the hospitality industry.</p>

          <h2>India Strengthens Ties with Maldives Amidst Growing Chinese Influence</h2>
          <div class="timestamp">2025-07-26 15:47:00 EDT</div>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Indian Prime Minister Narendra Modi completed a diplomatic visit to the Maldives aimed at reinforcing ties with the island nation, which has recently pivoted towards China. Maldives President Mohamed Muizzu, who was elected on an anti-India platform, has since softened his rhetoric, calling India the nation's "closest and most trusted partner." During the visit, Modi announced a $565 million credit line, reduced repayment terms on a previous loan, and inaugurated several India-funded infrastructure projects. The engagement is seen as a strategic move by New Delhi to counteract Beijing's growing influence in the geopolitically important Indian Ocean region.</p>

          <p>England's hopes for a victory in the fourth Test against India may be hampered by uncertainty over captain Ben Stokes's fitness to bowl on the final day. After taking five wickets in the first innings and scoring a century, Stokes did not bowl on day four as India mounted a strong defense, reportedly due to being "a bit stiff and sore." Stokes has a history of injury issues, and his heavy workload in the current series is a concern for the team's management. His absence from the bowling attack would be a significant blow to England's chances of winning the match at Old Trafford.</p>

          <p>More than two decades after its original release, the acclaimed film "Bend It Like Beckham" is set to get a sequel, director Gurinder Chadha has confirmed. The 2002 movie, which starred Parminder Nagra and Keira Knightley, was a cultural phenomenon credited with inspiring a generation of female soccer players. Chadha stated that the recent success of England's Lionesses and the growth of women's soccer made it a good time to revisit the characters. While the format is undecided, she hopes to reunite the original cast and is targeting a 2027 release to coincide with the film's 25th anniversary.</p>

          <p>Actress Gwyneth Paltrow has been hired as a "very temporary" spokesperson for Astronomer, the tech company whose CEO resigned after a viral KissCam incident at a Coldplay concert. The former CEO and a human resources executive were filmed in an intimate embrace, leading to their resignations after the company launched an investigation. In a promotional video, Paltrow, the ex-wife of Coldplay frontman Chris Martin, humorously addressed the company's newfound attention while promoting its data workflow automation services. The move appears to be a public relations effort to shift the narrative and move past the recent controversy.</p>

          <p>An advertising campaign for clothing brand American Eagle featuring actress Sydney Sweeney has coincided with a significant rise in the company's stock price. The article suggests that the campaign's embrace of Sweeney's traditional visual appeal marks a shift away from recent advertising trends that prioritize social messaging over direct product appeal. This move is presented as a return to a more conventional and effective marketing strategy, with investors seemingly predicting a spike in sales as a result. The author posits that other brands may follow suit, choosing profit-driven advertising over what is described as ineffective, politically motivated messaging.</p>

          <p>In a closely watched recall election, Taiwanese voters have rejected a bid to remove 24 lawmakers from the opposition Nationalist Party (KMT). The result is a setback for the ruling Democratic Progressive Party (DPP), which had hoped to flip control of the legislature. The KMT and its allies, who are generally seen as more friendly toward China, will retain their majority bloc, likely continuing the political gridlock that has characterized President Lai Ching-te's government. The KMT framed the result as a victory for stability over political fighting, while the DPP stated it humbly accepted the outcome.</p>

          <p>An unprecedented mass recall attempt against 24 opposition Kuomintang (KMT) lawmakers in Taiwan has failed, according to election results.

The KMT, which advocates for closer ties with China, accused the DPP of a politically motivated power grab. KMT chairman Eric Chu stated that voters chose stability over political infighting, while the DPP said it would reflect on the public's response and humbly accept the results.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>While recent studies suggest daily coffee consumption can have health benefits, including links to healthy aging and heart health, experts emphasize that the right amount is highly individual. The FDA recommends a general limit of 400 milligrams of caffeine per day, which is about two to three cups, but this can vary greatly from person to person. Factors like pregnancy, pre-existing conditions such as hypertension, and individual sensitivity to caffeine's effects on anxiety or sleep should guide consumption. Experts advise moderation and being mindful of how your body responds, rather than adhering to a one-size-fits-all rule.</p>
