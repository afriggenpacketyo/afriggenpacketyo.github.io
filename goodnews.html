          <p>Mahmoud Khalil, an anti-Israel activist and Columbia University graduate student, was released on bail from an immigration detention center following a judge's order, allowing him to return to his family in New York. The judge cited that Khalil was not a flight risk or a danger to the community, and deemed his imprisonment an "exceedingly rare" decision by the government. Khalil was arrested in March at Columbia for his pro-Palestinian activism, leading to an immigration judge ruling for his removal based on a memo citing his protests being at odds with U.S. foreign policy interests. Khalil's case has become a focal point for anti-Israel protesters and immigration rights advocates, who argue the Trump administration is retaliating against him for his views. The Trump administration is appealing the preliminary injunction and Khalil's release.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>As summer approaches, the debate over whether it's appropriate to wear shorts in the office persists, despite many companies relaxing their dress codes. Stylists agree that the appropriateness of shorts depends on the context, with tailored shorts generally being more acceptable than casual options like beach or sports shorts. Many companies now expect employees to dress professionally and comfortably, trusting them to make appropriate decisions. However, some companies still consider shorts too casual for client-facing roles, while others, particularly in creative industries, embrace more relaxed attire. The perception of shorts may also differ between men and women, with some men feeling less comfortable wearing them outside of vacation settings.</p>

          <p>Romance and fantasy books are experiencing a surge in popularity, pushing UK fiction revenue above ¬£1 billion, with romantasy leading the charge. Romantasy, a blend of romance and fantasy, has gained a significant following on TikTok's BookTok community, driven by series like Fourth Wing and A Court of Thorns and Roses. Readers are drawn to tropes such as "enemies to lovers" and "second-chance romance," as well as the "spice level" of the books, which often focuses on female pleasure and emotional connection. Despite the commercial success, some industry experts believe sexism continues to prevent the genre from gaining mainstream recognition, though attitudes are slowly changing as more people openly share their love of romance novels online.</p>
