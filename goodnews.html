          <p>South Korea's newly elected progressive President Lee Jae-myung is expected to adopt a more cautious approach to Taiwan and prioritize strengthening economic ties with China. This contrasts with his predecessor's emphasis on closer military cooperation with the US and Japan, who expressed concerns about China's military activities. Lee previously faced criticism for describing US Forces Korea as "occupation forces," indicating a potential shift in Seoul's foreign policy. However, continuity is expected in trilateral military cooperation with the US and Japan.</p>

          <p>Manchester United has reported a profit in the third quarter of 2025, despite previous concerns about the club's financial stability. The club attributes the profit to increased revenue across all key streams, driven by participation in the UEFA Europa League and high demand for hospitality offerings. However, debt and cash flow remain concerns, necessitating player sales to fund transfer activities. While the club's financial situation has improved, continued monitoring and strategic financial management are essential for long-term stability.</p>

          <p>Devi Sridhar argues that achieving a long and healthy life requires more than just diet and exercise; it necessitates a collective responsibility fostered by public policy and community support. While individual optimization efforts are helpful, societal factors such as access to nutritious food, clean air, and preventive healthcare play a crucial role in determining health outcomes. Countries like Japan and South Korea, where healthy living is normalized by government and culture, demonstrate the importance of creating environments that support overall well-being. Therefore, focusing on public health initiatives and policies is essential for improving health and longevity for everyone.</p>
