          <p>Meta CEO Mark Zuckerberg has announced plans to invest hundreds of billions of dollars into artificial intelligence compute infrastructure, aiming to build the industry's most elite research team. The company's first AI supercluster, named Prometheus, is scheduled to come online in 2026, with several other multi-gigawatt clusters in development. This major investment follows a lukewarm reception to Meta's Llama 4 AI models and is part of a strategic revamp to better compete with rivals like OpenAI and Google in the race for superintelligence.</p>

          <p>Starbucks has officially launched its previously unofficial "secret menu" within its mobile app, making popular fan-created drink combinations directly available to rewards members. The move aims to streamline the ordering process for both customers and baristas and is part of a broader strategy to revive the brand and improve customer service. The coffee giant is also hosting a contest for new custom beverage ideas, with winners eligible for up to $25,000 in prize money, further engaging its customer base.</p>

        </div>
        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>In the current high-interest-rate environment, savers are weighing the benefits of short-term versus long-term certificates of deposit (CDs). While short-term CDs currently offer slightly higher annual percentage yields, long-term CDs can generate substantially greater total returns over time due to the extended earning period. For example, a five-year CD at 4.20% on a $5,000 deposit could earn over $1,140, significantly more than the $220 earned on a one-year CD at 4.40%. The choice depends on an individual's financial goals and need for liquidity. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>On CNBC's "Morning Meeting," Jim Cramer expressed disagreement with a "sell" rating initiated by Melius for Starbucks, voicing confidence in CEO Brian Niccol's store-by-store revitalization efforts. Conversely, he supported Melius's "buy" rating for Texas Roadhouse, highlighting it as a rare, traffic-driven growth story in the casual dining sector. Cramer's commentary provides a counter-perspective to recent analyst coverage on the two restaurant chains, reflecting his bullish outlook on their performance. (not investment advice)</p>

Advocates believe this change is critical for designing safer cars for all drivers and reducing preventable injuries and fatalities.</p>

While effective against many of the threats Russia uses, the system is expensive and requires about 90 troops to operate.
