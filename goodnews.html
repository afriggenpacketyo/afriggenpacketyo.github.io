          <p>Los Angeles Dodgers' two-way star Shohei Ohtani demonstrated significant progress in his return from elbow surgery, pitching two scoreless innings against the Kansas City Royals. During his outing, he threw the fastest pitch of his MLB career at 101.7 mph and allowed just one hit while striking out one batter. Despite his strong performance on the mound, Ohtani went hitless in four at-bats. The Dodgers' five-game winning streak came to an end as they lost to the Royals 9-5.</p>

          <p>President Trump's extensive domestic policy and spending package cleared a critical procedural hurdle in the Senate late Saturday, advancing after a tense and prolonged vote. The motion to proceed passed 51-49, with three Republican holdouts eventually siding with the majority, narrowly avoiding the need for a tie-breaking vote from Vice President JD Vance. The bill's passage was a key victory for Majority Leader John Thune, who aims to get the legislation to the president's desk by July 4. However, it still faces a final vote and challenges in the House.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>The UK government has announced new plans for supermarkets and food manufacturers in England to voluntarily encourage healthier eating habits among customers. To combat rising obesity rates, retailers will decide on methods such as offering promotions on healthy items, adjusting loyalty point systems, or reformulating products. The initiative, part of a 10-year NHS plan, will require major food retailers to report on healthy food sales to increase accountability. This comes as reports show healthy food is significantly more expensive than less healthy options, and over a fifth of children are obese by the time they leave primary school.</p>

          <p>Following a single-medal performance at the Paris Olympics, Japan's national swimming team is adopting a new strategy to improve results for the 2028 Los Angeles Games. Athletes are living together in a "virtual athletes' village" during competitions to simulate the Olympic environment and build resilience to unfamiliar conditions. The camp, held at a remote venue, forces athletes to cope with challenges like travel and shared living spaces. Officials and athletes, including Paris silver medalist Tomoyuki Matsushita, believe the experience fosters a stronger team spirit and better prepares them to perform under pressure.</p>

          <p>A new pilot program in Kent, UK, is teaching primary school children as young as five about sun safety to address rising melanoma rates. The initiative, planned for nationwide rollout by 2026, educates students on UV levels, proper sunscreen application, and the risks of sun exposure. Experts emphasize that sunburn in childhood significantly increases the risk of skin cancer later in life, and with melanoma diagnoses projected to rise, early education is crucial. The program aims to empower children with the knowledge to protect themselves and reverse the trend of increasing skin cancer cases.</p>

          <p>Japan successfully launched its 50th and final H2A rocket, marking the end of the vehicle's 24-year career as a cornerstone of the nation's space program. The rocket, developed by Mitsubishi Heavy Industries and JAXA, lifted off from Tanegashima Island, placing a government climate-monitoring satellite into orbit. The H2A series, which had a 98% success rate, is now being replaced by the more cost-effective H3 rocket. The H3 is designed to make Japan more competitive in the global satellite-launch market, which is increasingly dominated by private companies like SpaceX.</p>

The large turnout was partly a reaction to government attempts to ban the event, citing a controversial 2021 law that equates homosexuality with pedophilia. Budapest's mayor, Gergely Karacsony, defied the ban by organizing the march as a council event. The peaceful and celebratory demonstration was seen as a significant act of solidarity against the government's increasingly restrictive policies.</p>
