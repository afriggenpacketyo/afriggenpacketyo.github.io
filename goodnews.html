          <p>SpaceX successfully launched the Axiom Space Ax-4 mission, carrying a four-person crew to the International Space Station (ISS). The crew includes retired NASA astronaut Peggy Whitson, who will command the mission and oversee approximately 60 experiments during their 14-day stay. Shubhanshu Shukla of India, S≈Çawosz Uzna≈Ñski-Wi≈õniewski of Poland, and Tibor Kapu of Hungary are also part of the crew, marking a return to human spaceflight for their respective countries after more than 40 years. The mission faced delays due to weather and a leak on the Falcon 9 rocket, but the crew is now en route to the ISS aboard SpaceX's Dragon capsule, which will remain docked until their return. Optimism regarding the mission's success and international collaboration in space exploration is high.</p>

          <p>Chinese Premier Li Qiang addressed the World Economic Forum in Tianjin, urging countries to collaborate on trade and avoid turning it into a political or security issue. He emphasized that globalization is irreversible and that engaging in the international economy is a way of "reshaping the rules and order." Li's comments come amid rising tariffs and trade barriers, though he did not directly mention US trade tensions or the Israel-Iran conflict. Adam Tooze, a professor at Columbia University, interpreted Li's remarks as a call for a "pluralization" of the global order, focusing on processes rather than a single entity setting the order.</p>

          <p>Jane Qiu argues that the controversy over the origins of COVID-19 is not merely a right-wing conspiracy but a symptom of public distrust in science. She contends that framing the debate along political lines does a disservice to the public and that the issue reflects longstanding anxieties over virus research. Qiu points to a crisis of trust fueled by a lack of transparency and inclusiveness in decision-making, particularly regarding gain-of-function studies. She emphasizes the need for scientists to cultivate trust through transparency, accountability, humility, and relationship-building.</p>

          <p>A China-led study suggests that a global interconnected solar-wind energy system could meet the world's energy demands by 2050, producing three times the necessary power at a lower cost than independent regional systems. The study emphasizes the need for regions with abundant renewable energy potential to supply areas with high energy needs. While such a system faces geopolitical challenges, its success could improve energy efficiency, reduce decarbonization costs, and enhance resilience against conflict and climate extremes. The researchers highlight the vast potential of solar and wind resources to surpass human demand.</p>

          <p>Antoinette Lattouf, an Australian journalist, won her case against the Australian Broadcasting Corporation (ABC), with a court ruling that she was unfairly sacked over a social media post about the war in Gaza.
