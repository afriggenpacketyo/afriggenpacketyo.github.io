          <p>General Motors (GM) plans to invest $4 billion in three American assembly plants, including shifting production of the Chevrolet Blazer and Equinox from Mexico to the United States. This move comes as President Donald Trump's administration has implemented tariffs on imported vehicles and auto parts. GM's investment will also involve converting an idled plant in Michigan to produce gas-powered vehicles, a change from previous plans to manufacture all-electric trucks there. CEO Mary Barra stated that the investment demonstrates GM's commitment to American innovation and manufacturing, aiming to provide customers with a broad range of vehicle choices. </p>

          <p>Google has offered buyouts to employees in several divisions, including Search, Ads, and central engineering, as part of ongoing efforts to reduce headcount since the 2023 layoffs. The "voluntary exit program" applies to U.S.-based employees, and some teams are mandating office returns for remote workers near offices. The move follows CFO Anat Ashkenazi's emphasis on cost-cutting as Google increases spending on AI infrastructure. The buyouts offer a supportive exit for those not aligned with the company's strategy, while those performing well are encouraged to stay. </p>

Reeves is expected to emphasize stability, highlighting her experience at G7 finance ministers' meetings. A key decision is the allocation to the NHS, which constitutes a large portion of government spending, and the government's desire to increase defense spending amid low economic growth. </p>

          <p>An article in *The Atlantic* argues that "good taste" is becoming increasingly important in a world saturated with AI-generated content. The author defines taste as "judgment with style," combining the ability to make sound decisions with a sense of aesthetics and appropriateness. AI can generate countless variations of content, but it lacks the human discretion and cultural intuition to discern what is truly meaningful or resonant. The article suggests that taste is a skill that can be developed through exposure, curation, and reflection, and that it has an ethical dimension, guiding us to make choices that are respectful and considerate. </p>

The U.S. is currently the largest exporter of LNG, and this deal could further increase its export capacity by 2030.

          <p>A major international study of nearly 300,000 children has found a two-way link between screen time and emotional well-being, with children who spend more time on devices at higher risk of aggression, anxiety, and low self-esteem. The study, published in *Psychological Bulletin*, also found that children already struggling with social or emotional challenges tend to spend more time on screens. Gaming consoles were particularly linked to emotional issues, while moderate screen time for educational purposes showed a lower risk. Experts recommend that parents set limits and ensure that screen time doesn't interfere with sleep and physical activity. </p>
