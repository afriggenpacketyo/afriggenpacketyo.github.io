        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Bitcoin has achieved a new record price, climbing past the $120,000 mark on Monday. This surge is largely attributed to substantial inflows into Bitcoin exchange-traded funds (ETFs), with one recent day logging over $1.18 billion in new investments. The rally is also supported by increasing institutional adoption and anticipation of new U.S. crypto legislation, which aims to provide a clearer regulatory framework for the digital asset industry. Analysts suggest this momentum could continue, driven by institutional buyers and growing policy clarity. (not investment advice)</p>

          <div class="timestamp">2025-07-14 01:55:14 EDT</div>
        </div>
        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>China reported a 5.8% year-over-year increase in exports for June, exceeding economists' forecasts. This growth was bolstered by strong demand from non-U.S. markets, particularly Southeast Asia and the European Union, which helped offset a smaller decline in shipments to the United States following a temporary tariff truce. While imports also saw their first yearly increase in 2025, the overall trade surplus expanded significantly. Economists caution that future export momentum may be uncertain due to potential U.S. tariff policies. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>Nvidia CEO Jensen Huang has downplayed U.S. government fears that the company's advanced chips could be utilized by China's military. In a recent interview, Huang argued that China already possesses significant computing capacity and cannot rely on U.S. technology that could be restricted at any moment. He reiterated his criticism of U.S. export controls, stating they hinder the goal of making American technology a global standard by limiting access to major markets like China. Huang's comments come as he navigates the complex relationship between Washington and Beijing.</p>

          <p>The 1,000-year-old Pannonhalma Archabbey in Hungary is undertaking a massive preservation effort to save about 100,000 books from a severe drugstore beetle infestation. These pests are attracted to the starch-based adhesives in the centuries-old volumes and have burrowed through numerous books in the historic library, a UNESCO World Heritage site. To eradicate the beetles, the books are being placed in an oxygen-free nitrogen environment for six weeks before being individually inspected and cleaned. Restorers believe climate change may have contributed to the infestation by allowing the beetles more development cycles.</p>

          <p>Chinese electric vehicle (EV) manufacturers are making substantial inroads in Norway, which is considered a key market due to its high EV adoption rate and lack of tariffs on Chinese imports. Brands like BYD, XPeng, and MG have captured a combined market share of approximately 10%, challenging established players like Tesla. Analysts view Norway as a "laboratory for EVs" in Europe, where Chinese brands can test the market with competitive pricing and advanced technology. The trend highlights a significant shift in the European automotive landscape and a growing challenge for Western carmakers.</p>

          <p>The Indian government is planning to mandate that new air conditioners be manufactured with a minimum temperature setting of 20°C (68°F) to curb rising electricity consumption. With 10-15 million AC units sold annually, officials estimate that every degree the temperature is raised saves about 6% on energy. This measure aims to reduce strain on the power grid, which is heavily reliant on fossil fuels and faces potential shortages. While some citizens support the energy-saving initiative, others are concerned about comfort in a country where summer temperatures can exceed 50°C (124°F).</p>

          <p>Singapore's economy grew by 1.4% in the second quarter of 2025, narrowly avoiding a technical recession after contracting in the previous quarter. The growth, which surpassed expectations, was driven by strong performance in the manufacturing and construction sectors. Analysts suggest that businesses front-loading exports ahead of potential U.S. tariff extensions contributed to the positive figures. Despite the better-than-expected GDP, Singapore's Ministry of Trade and Industry warned that significant uncertainty and downside risks remain for the global economy in the second half of the year.
