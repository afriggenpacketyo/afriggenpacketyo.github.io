This event occurs against the backdrop of the Trump administration's intensified screening and potential visa revocations for Chinese nationals, particularly those with ties to the Chinese Communist Party or studying in critical fields.

          <p>Researchers in China have developed an infrared contact lens that allows humans to see in the dark by converting infrared light into visible light. The lens combines conventional soft contact lenses with nanoparticles made of gold, sodium gadolinium fluoride, ytterbium, and erbium ions. While the resulting images are somewhat blurred, the lenses enable users to recognize patterns, letters, and flashing infrared signals in the dark. The technology could potentially be used in surgical procedures, cryptography, and rescue operations, though some critics argue that existing night vision devices are more effective. </p>
