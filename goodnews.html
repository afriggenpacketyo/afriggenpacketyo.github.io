          <p>Shares in China's BYD experienced a significant drop after the electric vehicle manufacturer announced price cuts on 22 electric and plug-in hybrid models. The price reductions, some as steep as 34%, are aimed at boosting sales amid increasing competition in the EV sector. Analysts from Citi anticipate a substantial increase in dealership foot traffic due to these price adjustments, and while other Chinese automakers also saw declines, Citi remains optimistic about the sales growth of new energy vehicle companies with prices below 200,000 Chinese yuan.</p>

          <p>Japan has initiated direct contract sales of government rice stockpiles to reduce soaring prices, aiming to bring them down to approximately 2,000 yen per 5 kilograms by early June. Farm Minister Shinjiro Koizumi established a special response team to address high rice prices and prevent consumers from turning away from rice products. The government intends to release about 300,000 tons of rice via contracts with major retailers, bypassing the auction system to exert more influence over prices. A recent poll indicates that nearly 60% of respondents believe Koizumi can effectively lower rice prices.</p>

          <p>Businesses are using a decades-old piece of legislation known as the "first sale rule" to minimize the impact of tariffs. This rule allows U.S. importers to calculate customs duties based on the price of the first sale in a series of transactions, potentially saving money. The first sale rule has gained renewed attention under U.S. President Donald Trump's tariff regime, and while it involves complexities, the potential cost savings can be worthwhile for companies, especially in higher-value consumer goods and luxury products.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>A Chinese study has found that sleep allows the brain to flush out harmful oxygen-derived free radicals that accumulate during wakefulness. The research, published in Cell Metabolism, discovered that hydrogen peroxide (H‚ÇÇO‚ÇÇ) acts as a molecular signal to trigger sleep and restore balance in the brain. When H‚ÇÇO‚ÇÇ levels rise in sleep-regulating neurons, the brain switches to "repair mode," prompting restorative slumber. This breakthrough solves a long-standing mystery of why sleep is biologically essential and opens pathways for therapies targeting oxidative stress to combat sleep disorders.</p>
