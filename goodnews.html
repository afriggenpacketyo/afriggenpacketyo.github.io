          <p>Warren Buffett's Berkshire Hathaway has revealed a new stake in UnitedHealth, purchasing over 5 million shares valued at approximately $1.6 billion. This investment comes as a surprise given the insurer's recent challenges, including a Justice Department investigation and a lowered earnings outlook, which had caused its stock to decline significantly. The move, potentially orchestrated by Buffett's investment lieutenants, aligns with his history of value investing in embattled companies and prompted a notable surge in UnitedHealth's stock price following the disclosure. The article also notes other smaller Berkshire investments and a reduction in its Apple and Bank of America stakes. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>AstraZeneca has launched an at-home delivery service for its FluMist nasal spray flu vaccine, making it more convenient for eligible individuals to get vaccinated. Previously only available in clinical settings, the needle-free option can now be ordered online and shipped directly to consumers for self-administration by adults or caregiver administration for children ages 2-17. The move follows FDA approval for self-administration in September 2024. The company hopes this increased accessibility will help boost vaccination rates, especially after last year saw the highest number of pediatric flu-related deaths in a non-pandemic year since 2009.</p>

AI-powered systems are now handling tasks such as managing work orders, processing lease renewals, conducting virtual tours, and even assisting with investor due diligence. Companies like Funnel are using agentic AI to create centralized, portfolio-wide automations that streamline interactions with prospective and current tenants. While this technology offers greater efficiency for large multifamily operators, its high cost and the fragmented nature of the rental market, which is dominated by small landlords, present significant headwinds to widespread adoption.</p>

          <p>A federal building in Lower Manhattan, which houses offices for the Department of Homeland Security and ICE, was evacuated after an unknown white powder was reported in the mailroom. The FDNY and hazmat units responded quickly, and officials later confirmed that five separate letters contained the substance, which was determined to be non-hazardous. At least two people were exposed, but no injuries were reported, and authorities stated that there was no remaining threat to the public. The incident occurred at a location that has been a focal point for protests regarding the treatment of immigrants and a recent subject of a federal judge's order to improve detainee conditions.</p>

          <h2>Fast-Fashion Giant Shein Reports 32% Sales Growth in the UK</h2>

          <p>Chinese fast-fashion retailer Shein saw its UK sales surge by over 32% to £2.05 billion in 2024, resulting in a 57% increase in pre-tax profits to £38.3 million. Despite this strong performance, the company acknowledged that future consumer spending could be affected by inflation and the rising cost of living. Shein's business model, which has benefited from a UK tax exemption on imported packages worth less than £135, may face challenges as the government is now reviewing this rule. The company, which has filed for a potential listing on the London Stock Exchange, continues to face scrutiny over its labor practices and environmental impact.</p>

          <h2>Former Chinese Economic Official Urges Removal of Purchase Restrictions to Boost Spending</h2>

          <p>A former senior Chinese economic official has advised the government to stimulate consumption by removing purchase restrictions on items like property and vehicles. Yin Yanlin, previously a deputy director at a key party economic office, argued that encouraging affluent groups to spend would drive market demand and create a positive economic cycle. He emphasized that income levels are not the primary barrier to spending, pointing to the significant increase in national savings this year. The suggestion comes as policymakers seek ways to invigorate domestic demand and sustain economic growth amid various challenges. (not investment advice)</p>

          <h2>Family Offices Significantly Increase Allocations to Private Market Investments</h2>
          <div class="timestamp">2025-08-15 07:00:01 EDT</div>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Investment firms for the world's wealthiest families have dramatically increased their exposure to private markets, with the number of family offices allocating to these assets growing over 500% since 2016. This surge, outpacing that of other institutional investors, is driven by the ability of family offices to make long-term, illiquid investments in areas like private credit and infrastructure. With less need for immediate cash, these firms are drawn to the stable growth potential of private markets compared to more volatile public equities. Recent surveys indicate a continued trend, with many planning to further increase their private debt and infrastructure holdings. (not investment advice)</p>

          <h2>Declining Mortgage Rates Present Refinancing Opportunities for Recent Homebuyers</h2>
          <div class="timestamp">2025-08-15 06:30:01 EDT</div>
        </div>
        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Mortgage rates have continued their downward trend, with the average 30-year fixed rate falling to 6.58%, a significant drop from the nearly 8% peak seen in late 2023. This decline is prompting an increase in refinance applications, particularly from homeowners who purchased their properties when rates were higher. Experts suggest that homeowners with mortgage rates above 6% or 7% should consider refinancing, provided they plan to stay in their homes long enough to offset the closing costs. The trend is attributed to weakening economic data, which has pushed down the 10-year Treasury yields that mortgage rates typically follow. (not investment advice)</p>
