          <p>Pharmaceutical giant Novo Nordisk is intensifying its direct-to-consumer sales strategy for weight-loss drugs like Wegovy to counter competition and address U.S. demands for lower prices. The company's cash channel, which offers the drug at a significantly reduced price, has become key to regaining market share from copycat compounders. This move comes as the company navigates an ultimatum from the Trump administration to cut prescription drug costs, while also dealing with weaker sales growth forecasts. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>Despite recent news of cost-cutting, Manchester United is able to fund a potential £74 million move for striker Benjamin Sesko through clever financial management. The club is structuring payments for its summer transfers over the length of player contracts, a strategy that spreads out the immediate cost. This approach, combined with offloading Marcus Rashford's full salary on loan and income from sell-on clauses, demonstrates the club's sustained commercial power despite on-pitch struggles.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>A lawsuit with the potential to fundamentally alter the football industry has been launched against FIFA by the Justice for Players (JFP) foundation. The claim argues that FIFA's transfer system illegally impedes the free movement of professional footballers within the EU, diminishing their negotiating power and earnings. If successful, the multi-billion euro compensation claim could force a restructuring of the transfer market, significantly shifting power from clubs to players, similar to the landmark Bosman ruling in 1995.</p>

          <p>In an effort to boost its tourism industry and improve diplomatic relations, South Korea will implement a temporary visa waiver for Chinese tour groups. The program, running from September 29 of this year until June 30 of the next, is expected to revitalize regional economies and increase domestic consumption. This policy follows a period of rapid recovery in South Korea's inbound tourism market, with Chinese nationals already constituting the largest group of overseas visitors.</p>

          <p>McDonald's reported second-quarter financial results that exceeded Wall Street's expectations, driven by a significant rebound in its U.S. sales. The fast-food giant's domestic same-store sales grew 2.5%, reversing two quarters of decline, which executives attribute to successful marketing and new menu items like the McCrispy Chicken Strips. This recovery suggests the company's value-focused promotions are successfully attracting low- and middle-income consumers who had previously been visiting less frequently.</p>

          <p>In a direct response to security concerns, Nvidia's chief security officer published a blog post asserting that the company's chips are built without any hidden vulnerabilities. The statement explicitly denied the existence of "back doors," "kill switches," or "spyware" in its graphics processing units (GPUs). The company emphasized that intentionally creating such vulnerabilities would be a gift to hackers and that established law requires fixing security flaws, not creating them, to maintain trustworthy systems.</p>

          <p>Newly released FBI statistics for 2024 reveal a significant nationwide decrease in crime, contradicting the political narrative of a surge during the previous administration. The annual report shows a 4.5% drop in all violent crime, with murders falling by 14.5% and the overall violent crime rate reaching its lowest level since the 1960s. These figures, compiled from over 16,000 law enforcement agencies, challenge the assertions made during the 2024 election campaign about an out-of-control crime wave.</p>
