          <p>Following the lowered recommended screening age for colorectal cancer from 50 to 45, new research shows a significant increase in early-stage diagnoses for people in the 45-49 age group. This promising development is attributed to a sharp rise in screenings, suggesting that the updated guidelines are successfully helping to detect cancers sooner. However, researchers caution that screening rates among this younger demographic remain suboptimal and are not increasing equitably across all education and insurance levels, indicating more work is needed to ensure broad access to these preventative measures.</p>

          <p>John Edward Bruce, a pioneering Black journalist and Pan-Africanist of the late 19th and early 20th centuries, will finally receive a headstone for his unmarked grave in Yonkers, New York. Despite his international renown as a reporter, founder of multiple newspapers, and associate of Marcus Garvey, Bruce was buried without a marker in 1924. A new effort funded by private and public sources will install a black granite headstone, ensuring his final resting place properly honors his significant contributions to journalism and Black history, correcting a long-standing historical oversight.</p>

          <p>U.S. border agents have been instructed to stop summary deportations under a sweeping asylum ban enacted by the Trump administration. The directive follows a federal appeals court ruling that, while the government can pause access to the asylum system, it cannot ignore laws protecting migrants from being returned to places where they face torture or persecution. This decision effectively reopens pathways for humanitarian claims and halts a policy credited with a steep drop in illegal border crossings, shifting migrant processing back toward established immigration laws that include the right to request refuge.</p>

          <p>Joshua Taylor, a Michigan man who experiences incontinence due to a genetic condition, is leading an advocacy effort to make adult-sized changing tables a standard feature in public spaces. He highlights that for many teenagers and adults with disabilities, the lack of these facilities forces them into unsanitary or undignified situations, such as using car backseats or public floors, or simply staying home. Working with the organization Changing Spaces USA, Taylor is collaborating with officials to install more accessible changing tables, framing it as a fundamental need for community inclusion.</p>

He argues that despite a weaker-than-expected labor report, the impressive performance across segments like cloud infrastructure, AI, and advertising from giants like Microsoft, Alphabet, and Apple is propping up the market. These cash-rich, diversified companies, which he calls 'nation states,' are proving to be a formidable force that investors are relying on for stability. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>The United Kingdom is strengthening its gun control laws, a change championed by Emma Ambler, whose twin sister and two nieces were murdered with a legally held firearm. The new rules, effective August 5, will require two character referees for shotgun applications instead of one and mandate that police investigate an applicant's domestic life for signs of abuse or other risk factors. The changes are a direct response to recent tragedies and are seen as a significant step toward preventing unsuitable individuals from legally accessing firearms, giving hope to campaigners that such violence can be prevented.</p>
