          <div class="timestamp">2025-10-04 09:42:46 EDT</div>
        </div>
        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>A new film from A24, "The Smashing Machine," features a nearly unrecognizable Dwayne Johnson in the role of pioneering UFC fighter Mark Kerr. The gritty biopic, directed by Benny Safdie, chronicles Kerr's career in the late 90s and his intense struggle with a near-fatal opioid addiction, supported by his then-girlfriend played by Emily Blunt. While the article praises Johnson's powerful and serious performance as a significant departure from his usual roles, potentially earning him Oscar consideration, it finds the overall film lacking in emotional investment. Johnson's portrayal is described as the movie's undeniable heartbeat, though the narrative itself may not be as compelling.</p>

          <p>Lyft CEO David Risher shared the story of his decision to leave a management role at Microsoft in 1996 to join a small online bookstore called Amazon. At the time, Bill Gates reportedly called it one of the stupidest decisions he had ever heard, as Microsoft was a tech giant and Amazon was a fledgling startup. Risher was convinced by founder Jeff Bezos's powerful vision and obsession with the customer experience. Bezos confidently predicted that Amazon would become a billion-dollar business by the year 2000, a milestone the company actually achieved a year ahead of schedule in 1999.</p>

          <p>A child life specialist and therapist advocates for a simple yet profound practice for parents: creating a dedicated email address for each of their children at birth. This inbox serves as a digital time capsule where parents can send messages, stories, and photos on birthdays, during special moments, or even during difficult times. The expert notes that this practice preserves memories and creates a legacy of love and guidance that the children can access when they are older. It provides a way to capture the ordinary magic of childhood and ensure children have a lasting record of their parents' thoughts and affection.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Following the release of Taylor Swift's new album, "The Life of A Showgirl," fans are speculating that the track "Actually Romantic" is a diss track aimed at fellow pop star Charli XCX. The song references another singer who calls Swift a "boring Barbie," which fans believe is a response to Charli XCX's song "Sympathy is a Knife." In an accompanying film, Swift described her new song as "a love letter to someone who hates you," adding that she finds the amount of attention, even if negative, to be flattering. Neither artist has confirmed the speculation, leaving fans to continue decoding the lyrics.</p>

Irenic is publicly calling for significant changes, including a review of strategic alternatives such as a potential sale of the company. The firm is also demanding improved operational efficiency and major corporate governance reforms, specifically the collapse of Workiva's dual-class share structure that gives its founders outsized voting control. Irenic has proposed adding two new members to the board and has not ruled out a proxy fight if its demands are not met. (not investment advice)</p>

          <h2>Sole US Uranium Enrichment Plant Expands to Meet Surging Demand from AI and Nuclear Revival</h2>

          <p>Urenco USA, the operator of the only commercial uranium enrichment facility in the United States, is racing to expand its capacity in New Mexico. The expansion is driven by a projected surge in electricity demand from AI data centers and a renewed interest in nuclear power, alongside a looming ban on Russian uranium imports that will take full effect by 2028. The plant currently supplies about a third of U.S. demand and is increasing its capacity by 15% through 2027. However, industry experts warn that bottlenecks in other parts of the nuclear fuel supply chain, such as uranium conversion, must also be addressed to meet future needs. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>Hamas has announced its agreement to parts of a ceasefire deal proposed by U.S. President Donald Trump, including the crucial demand for the release of all hostages. While the group accepted key provisions, it also suggested that other elements of the deal would require further negotiation within a broader Palestinian framework. In response to the statement, Israel's government said it is preparing to immediately implement the first phase of the plan. U.S. officials view Hamas's response as a positive step, raising hopes for a potential breakthrough in ending the long-running conflict in the Gaza Strip.</p>

          <p>Michaela Del Barrio, a 37-year-old mother with a family history of breast cancer, was diagnosed with the disease after persistently advocating for early screening. Despite initially being told she was too young for concern, she secured a mammogram and a breast MRI, which revealed two suspicious masses. The diagnosis of early-stage invasive ductal carcinoma was made before she had any symptoms, highlighting the critical importance of self-advocacy for individuals at high risk. Her oncologist stated that the early detection significantly improved her prognosis, and Del Barrio is now undergoing treatment while sharing her story to encourage others.</p>

          <p>The late conservationist Jane Goodall, who passed away at 91, adopted a plant-based diet approximately 50 years ago, a decision central to her ethical and environmental advocacy. She famously recounted looking at a pork chop on her plate and realizing it represented "fear, pain, death," which prompted her to instantly stop eating meat. Goodall cited her opposition to factory farming and the environmental damage caused by meat production as her primary motivations. She often spoke about how she felt better and lighter after making the change, aligning her personal choices with her lifelong dedication to the health of the planet.</p>

          <p>An opinion piece reflects on the profound legacy of primatologist Jane Goodall, who passed away at 91, arguing that her work fundamentally changed how humans perceive their place in the world. The article recalls the pivotal moment in 1960 when she observed a chimpanzee, whom she named David Greybeard, using a twig as a tool to eat termites. This discovery shattered the long-held belief that tool-making was exclusive to humans, forcing a redefinition of the species. Her ability to connect with chimpanzees without words demonstrated a shared language of gesture and reassurance, bridging the gap between humans and the animal kingdom.</p>

          <p>The long-held belief that a prestigious college brand guarantees value is weakening, as families increasingly prioritize practical considerations like cost, career outcomes, and hands-on learning opportunities. With tuition prices soaring and a tough job market, parents are questioning the worth of a high-priced degree from a top-ranked school. This shift is reflected in changing application patterns, with students casting a wider net beyond traditional elite institutions. Schools that have adapted by emphasizing distinctive programs, like Northeastern's co-op model, have seen their own rankings and desirability rise, indicating a market that now values tangible results over historical reputation.</p>

Experts also highlight the importance of creating a budget for the upcoming holiday season to prevent starting the new year with financial stress and debt.

          <p>Chinese academics and writers are increasingly exploring speculative and science fiction as a tool for soft power, aiming to challenge the dominance of Western, often dystopian, narratives about the future. According to scholars at a recent conference, this genre allows China to project alternative future scenarios that critique present-day neoliberal ideologies and offer different visions for society. By creating their own futuristic narratives, they aim to move beyond the traditionally bleak outlooks prevalent in Euro-American sci-fi. This represents a conscious effort to shape global conversations about the future through a cultural and ideological lens.</p>
