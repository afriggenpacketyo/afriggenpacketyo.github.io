          <p>German politicians are pushing to establish an inquiry commission to investigate the government's handling of the COVID-19 pandemic. The inquiry would scrutinize actions such as the large-scale procurement of overpriced face masks by former Health Minister Jens Spahn and the impact of lockdowns on the economy and society. Proponents, including virologist and parliamentarian Hendrik Streeck, argue a review is necessary to regain public trust, learn lessons for future crises, and understand how scientific advice influenced political decisions. The commission could begin its work as early as September 2025.</p>

          <p>A 70-year-old Egyptian man pleaded guilty to harming a law enforcement animal after he kicked a Customs and Border Protection (CBP) beagle at Washington Dulles International Airport. The incident occurred when the 5-year-old detector dog, Freddie, alerted to the man's suitcase during a baggage inspection. The man kicked the 25-pound dog with enough force to lift it off the ground, causing contusions. Authorities discovered over 100 pounds of undeclared and prohibited agricultural products in his luggage. The man was ordered to pay the dog's vet bill and will be deported to Egypt.</p>

The massive haul, valued at approximately ¬£96 million ($132 million), was discovered hidden beneath shipping containers on a vessel that had arrived from Panama. The UK Border Force stated the operation was intelligence-led and represents a significant blow to the criminal organizations that use container ships to smuggle drugs into the country.

          <p>A real estate agent with a decade of experience suggests that homebuyers use the '80-10-10 Rule' to determine if a house is the right fit. This guideline posits that the ideal property will have 80% of the features a buyer loves and cannot change, like location and layout. Another 10% should consist of things that can be improved over time, such as paint or fixtures. The final 10% represents elements that are not ideal but are ultimately livable, like a neighbor's fence. The rule serves as a practical framework to manage expectations and avoid getting stuck searching for a nonexistent 'perfect' home.</p>

          <p>Gas prices are expected to be the cheapest they have been since 2021 this summer, according to a petroleum analyst. The national average price could fall below $3 a gallon as early as September. While a recent spike was driven by the Israel-Iran conflict, the subsequent ceasefire is expected to allow prices to resume a slow decline. Factors contributing to the drop include increased refinery production and softening consumer demand after early summer travel peaks. Adjusted for inflation, gas prices are already near a 20-year low. (not investment advice)</p>
