          <p>Broadcom's stock experienced a significant increase after the company reported better-than-expected fiscal third-quarter earnings and provided a strong revenue forecast. The chipmaker announced it had secured $10 billion in orders for its custom AI chips, known as XPUs, from a fourth major, unnamed cloud customer. This new business has boosted the company's projected AI revenue, which is expected to reach $6.2 billion in the current quarter. Investors are optimistic that Broadcom's custom processors could challenge Nvidia's dominance in the rapidly growing AI chip market. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>ESPN host Laura Rutledge revealed on a podcast that she once created a "burner" social media account to defend her husband, former MLB player Josh Rutledge, from online critics. During his playing career from 2012 to 2017, she operated under the alias "BillyHalo76," posting positive comments and statistics to counter negative commentary about his performance. Rutledge admitted the act was wrong and a one-time occurrence, humorously noting she would occasionally tweet about superstar Mike Trout to make the account seem more authentic. She also recalled the personal difficulty of hearing fans boo her husband during games while he played for the Boston Red Sox.</p>

        </div>
        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>The Los Angeles City Council is considering a new measure that would require landlords to ensure their rental units can be maintained at or below 82 degrees Fahrenheit. This proposal follows a similar law recently passed for unincorporated areas of L.A. County and aims to address the severe health risks posed by extreme heat, which disproportionately affects vulnerable populations. Proponents argue it is a critical public health issue, similar to existing heating requirements, as climate change intensifies heat waves. However, landlord associations oppose the measure, citing concerns about increased costs for electrical upgrades and higher utility bills for tenants, which could drive up rents.</p>

In a rare public appearance, she spoke at a White House AI education task force, emphasizing the need to prepare children for an AI-driven future. This initiative builds on her previous "Be Best" campaign and follows her instrumental role in the passage of the "Take It Down Act," which criminalized the non-consensual sharing of intimate images. Though she maintains a relatively private profile, analysts note she is selectively and effectively using her platform to address emerging technological and legislative issues concerning young people.</p>

          <div class="timestamp">2025-09-04 18:02:24 EDT</div>
        </div>
        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>With home equity at record highs and a potential Federal Reserve interest rate cut on the horizon, homeowners may be considering tapping into their home's value. However, before taking out a home equity loan, it is crucial to assess several factors to avoid financial risk, including potential foreclosure. Key questions to answer include determining the actual amount of equity available to borrow and evaluating if the financial need is truly urgent enough to justify the loan's cost. Homeowners should also weigh the benefits of securing a rate now against the possibility of lower rates in the future following anticipated Fed actions. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>Northern Ireland defeated Luxembourg 3-1 in a World Cup qualifier, a result manager Michael O'Neill attributed to a stern half-time talk. After an early lead from Jamie Reid, the team's performance dipped, allowing Luxembourg to equalize before the break. O'Neill stated he "had to get into them" during the interval, and his team responded immediately, with Shea Charles scoring just 25 seconds into the second half. A red card for Luxembourg's Seid Korac helped solidify the visitors' position, and Justin Devenny added a third goal to secure the crucial win for their qualifying campaign.</p>

          <h2>Savers Advised to Act Quickly on CD Accounts Before Anticipated September Fed Rate Cut</h2>
          <div class="timestamp">2025-09-04 17:48:51 EDT</div>
        </div>
        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>With a Federal Reserve interest rate cut widely expected in September, savers are being advised to make strategic moves with their funds, particularly for larger amounts like a $10,000 certificate of deposit (CD). As a rate cut will likely lead to lower returns on savings products, now is a critical time to lock in the current higher rates. Financial experts suggest savers should consider depositing more funds if possible, shop directly with online banks which typically offer better rates, and act quickly before banks preemptively lower their CD rates. Waiting too long could mean missing the current window of opportunity for higher yields. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>Daniel Levy, the Premier League's longest-serving chairman, has stepped down from his role at Tottenham Hotspur after nearly 25 years. The decision was reportedly made by the club's ownership, who believe new leadership is needed to achieve greater success on the pitch. During his tenure, Levy oversaw the development of a world-class stadium and training facility but faced persistent criticism from fans over a lack of trophies, with the club winning only the League Cup in 2008 and the Europa League in 2025. Peter Charrington, a director of the club's ownership group ENIC, will become the non-executive chairman in a move intended to usher in a new era for the club.</p>

          <p>Alphabet's autonomous vehicle unit, Waymo, will begin testing its driverless robotaxis at San Jose Mineta International Airport this fall, with plans to offer paid rides to the public later in the year. This marks the company's first airport expansion in California and its second international airport service overall, following a successful launch at Phoenix Sky Harbor. The vehicles will provide transportation from the airport's terminals to locations within Waymo's San Francisco Bay service area. This expansion represents another step in Waymo's ongoing efforts to integrate its autonomous ride-hailing services into major transportation hubs across the United States.</p>

          <p>After being largely relegated to reconnaissance roles due to vulnerability to Russian air defenses, Ukraine's famed Bayraktar TB-2 drones are once again being used for strike missions. Recent videos show the drones successfully attacking Russian boats and troops along the Black Sea coast, marking a notable resurgence for the platform. This return to offensive operations has reportedly been enabled by a systematic Ukrainian campaign to suppress and destroy Russian air defense and radar systems in Crimea and the Kherson region. The renewed use of these drones highlights Ukraine's tactical adaptability and suggests that cracks may be appearing in Russia's air defense network in certain areas.</p>

          <p>After reaching two-decade highs, mortgage rates have been on a slow but steady decline throughout 2025, offering a glimmer of hope for potential homebuyers and those looking to refinance. For example, the average rate for a 30-year fixed mortgage has fallen by more than half a percentage point since January, representing significant potential savings. With the Federal Reserve expected to cut interest rates soon, there is a possibility that mortgage rates could fall further in the coming months. However, the decline is expected to be gradual, contingent on broader economic factors like inflation and Treasury yields. (not investment advice)</p>

The San Francisco 49ers topped the league with $176.5 million in net ticket receipts, significantly outpacing the second-place Dallas Cowboys and the league average. At the other end of the spectrum, the Tennessee Titans ranked last with $81.2 million.
