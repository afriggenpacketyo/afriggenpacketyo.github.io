          <p>A Japanese nutritionist living in the U.S. details her recent shopping experience at a Costco in Kyoto, Japan, noting significant differences from American stores. The Japanese location offered an extensive variety of traditional and healthy foods, including a wide selection of seaweed, diverse soy-based products like tofu, and unique seasonal produce. The article also highlights the availability of ready-to-eat Japanese meals, traditional rice crackers, and numerous green tea options, many of which are harder to find or more expensive in the United States.</p>

          <p>Christopher Kennedy, a 75-year-old dog trainer, is recovering after a successful double-lung transplant, a procedure he received after a terminal disease was discovered by chance. Diagnosed with idiopathic pulmonary fibrosis (IPF) during a pre-surgery X-ray, Kennedy was given less than a year to live before becoming a candidate for the transplant. Despite initial resistance and post-surgery complications, his lung capacity is now at 98%, allowing him to return to his life and train a new therapy dog he named Encore to celebrate his second chance.</p>

          <p>Amid changes to federal student loan programs, a provision in the new One Big Beautiful Bill Act is encouraging more employers to offer student loan reimbursement benefits. The act makes employer contributions up to $5,250 annually toward an employee's student loans tax-free on a permanent basis, removing a key barrier for companies. This benefit is seen as a crucial tool for attracting and retaining talent, as millions of workers struggle with significant student loan debt, and federal repayment options become more limited.

          <p>China has unveiled a global action plan for artificial intelligence, advocating for international cooperation just days after the U.S. announced its own strategy.

          <p>Justin Bieber's surprise new album, "Swag," is being hailed as a potential source for the song of the summer, offering a departure from his previous pop sound. The album features a more subtle, R&B-influenced style with aqueous, muffled production, exemplified by the hit single "Daisies." This downtempo yet intricate musical approach is seen as aligning with a broader cultural mood that favors soothing, reflective music over high-energy party anthems. The article suggests this trend reflects a collective sense of malaise or hangover from previous, more hedonistic times.</p>

          <p>Brazil is undertaking a massive public health initiative by releasing millions of mosquitoes engineered with Wolbachia bacteria to combat dengue and other viruses. The Wolbachia bacteria prevents viruses like dengue from replicating inside the Aedes aegypti mosquito, effectively stopping its transmission to humans. A pilot program in the city of Niterói led to a roughly 90% drop in dengue cases, prompting the government to build a massive new factory to produce billions of these "Wolbitos" for deployment across the country.</p>

          <p>Prime Minister Keir Starmer announced that the United Kingdom is collaborating with Jordan to facilitate airdrops of humanitarian aid into Gaza. The move comes after Israel agreed to allow foreign countries to deliver supplies by air amid a worsening humanitarian crisis. While the UN and aid groups argue airdrops are insufficient and potentially dangerous, the UK is urgently working to get its aid onto Jordanian planes. The decision follows growing pressure on the UK government, including from over 200 MPs, to take stronger action, such as recognizing a Palestinian state.</p>

          <p>Tennis star Venus Williams joked that she returned to competition after a year-long break to regain her health insurance, highlighting a common challenge in the U.S. system. Because most Americans receive health coverage through their jobs, leaving employment often means losing benefits or paying high premiums through COBRA. Williams, who has an autoimmune condition, illustrates how even wealthy individuals must navigate this system. The article notes that while the Affordable Care Act provides more options than in the past, the fundamental link between work and insurance remains a defining feature of American healthcare.</p>

          <p>In a significant recall election, Taiwanese voters rejected an effort to remove 24 lawmakers from the opposition Nationalist Party (KMT). The result is a setback for the ruling Democratic Progressive Party (DPP), which had hoped to shift the balance of power in the legislature where an opposition bloc currently holds the majority. The outcome suggests President Lai Ching-te's administration will continue to face strong legislative resistance, making it difficult to advance its agenda ahead of local elections next year.
