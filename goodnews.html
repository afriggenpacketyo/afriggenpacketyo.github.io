          <p>BBC presenter Lucy Owen has shared the moving story of her 86-year-old mother's decision to donate her body to medical science. Initially shocked, Owen created a documentary at Cardiff University to better understand the process and discovered the profound impact that donors have as "silent teachers" for future doctors. The journey not only brought her peace with her mother's wishes but also inspired her to register as a body donor herself, viewing it as a meaningful final act of service.</p>

          <p>Health experts in the United Kingdom are attributing the current prevalence of respiratory illnesses to normal seasonal patterns for autumn. As children return to school and people spend more time indoors, viruses such as Rhinovirus, which causes the common cold, circulate more easily. Data from the UK Health Security Agency shows that while illness levels are not unusually high, Covid and flu are also contributing to the seasonal spike, prompting officials to recommend vaccinations for at-risk groups.</p>

          <p>The use of AI chatbots for travel planning is on the rise, yielding a mix of successes and failures for holidaymakers. One user successfully used ChatGPT to discover a charming, little-known Spanish town that became the highlight of his trip. However, another traveler was given false information about a UK-to-Norway ferry route that has not operated in over a decade. Experts caution that while AI can be a powerful tool for generating ideas, all information should be independently verified to avoid disappointment.</p>

While infrastructure spending is expected to remain a priority, future projects will likely focus more on technology-driven and people-centric initiatives to foster sustainable growth and mitigate the financial risks associated with past investment models.
