        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Honda is recalling approximately 260,000 vehicles in the U.S. due to a potential defect in the brake pedal pivot pin, which may not have been properly secured during production. The affected models include Acura TLX (2021-2025), Acura MDX (2023-2025), and Honda Pilot (2023-2025). The National Highway Traffic Safety Administration (NHTSA) warns that if the brake pedal moves side to side, drivers may experience difficulty slowing or stopping the vehicle, increasing the risk of a crash or injury. Owners of affected vehicles will be contacted by mail and instructed to take their vehicles to a dealer for a free brake pedal replacement, and those who have already paid for repairs are eligible for reimbursement. The issue stemmed from insufficient training during a production transition from a U.S. to a Mexico facility. The optimism score is based on the fact that no injuries have been reported yet and the issue can be resolved. </p>

          <p>Juneteenth, a federal holiday observed on June 19th, commemorates the end of slavery in the United States. The name "Juneteenth" is a portmanteau combining "June" and "nineteenth," referencing the date in 1865 when enslaved people in Texas were informed of their freedom under the Emancipation Proclamation. Although President Lincoln signed the Proclamation in 1863, it wasn't until Union soldiers arrived in Galveston, Texas, that the news reached the westernmost Confederate state. Juneteenth is celebrated with parades, parties, concerts, and educational events, memorializing the anniversary of independence and reflecting on the country's history. </p>

Former CBS News legal analyst Rikki Klieman stated that the case was "riddled with reasonable doubt," emphasizing the conflicting expert testimonies and the role of the lead investigator.

          <p>The Premiership rugby league is relaunching with a new name ('the Prem'), logo, and branding to expand its appeal and reach wider audiences. Chief Growth Officer Rob Calder aims to reposition rugby as an entertainment product, drawing inspiration from sports like UFC. The new branding emphasizes physicality, athleticism, and confrontations on the pitch. The target is to convert indifferent individuals into fans. </p>
