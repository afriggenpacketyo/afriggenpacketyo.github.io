          <p>A federal judge issued a temporary restraining order, blocking the Trump administration's attempt to deploy the Oregon National Guard to Portland. The judge, a Trump appointee, ruled that the protests were not disruptive enough to justify federalizing troops without the state governor's consent. This decision emphasized the constitutional line between civil and military power, stating the president's justification was "untethered to the facts" and infringed on Oregon's sovereignty, a ruling celebrated by state officials.</p>

          <p>Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu expressed hope for the release of all hostages from Gaza within days after Hamas agreed to key parts of a U.S.-brokered peace plan. The proposal involves Hamas releasing hostages in exchange for Palestinian prisoners, with Israel preparing to implement the first phase, which includes a redeployment of its forces but not a full withdrawal. U.S. officials view Hamas's response positively, and negotiations involving American, Israeli, and Egyptian delegations are expected to finalize the technical details of the agreement shortly.</p>

The demonstration called for an end to ICE raids, which organizers say have created a climate of fear that is harming local communities and businesses. Speakers, including local elected officials, condemned the administration's tactics as cruel and politically motivated, vowing to resist federal immigration enforcement in schools, hospitals, and local neighborhoods.</p>

Rather than being seen as an inconvenience, many participants view it as an exciting social event and a way to build camaraderie with like-minded people. Brands are capitalizing on this trend through "experiential marketing," offering free products, exclusive access, and social media-worthy moments to create a buzz. This strategy turns the queue into a community-building event, driven by the anticipation of a reward and the desire for exclusivity.</p>

          <p>The Evangelical Lutheran Church in America (ELCA), a predominantly white denomination, has installed Reverend Yehiel Curry as its first-ever Black presiding bishop. The historic installation took place in Minneapolis, with Curry succeeding the church's first female leader. Curry, who grew up Catholic on Chicago's south side, hopes his presence will encourage more leaders of color within the ELCA. The appointment is seen as a significant moment for the denomination as it navigates declining membership and seeks to reflect the growing diversity of Lutheranism globally.</p>

          <p>Thousands of demonstrators participated in a Pride march in the Hungarian city of Pecs, defying a police ban on the event. The march protested the restrictive LGBTQ+ policies of Prime Minister Viktor Orban's government, which passed a law enabling such bans under the pretext of "protecting children." Protesters, including some Members of the European Parliament, waved rainbow and EU flags, condemning the government's actions as a restriction of fundamental human rights. This follows a similar large-scale defiance of a ban in Budapest earlier in the year.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>"Freshers' flu" is a common term for the wave of cold-like illnesses that spreads rapidly among new university students at the start of the academic year. Immunologists explain it's not a single virus but a result of thousands of students from different regions gathering in close quarters, exposing each other to unfamiliar pathogens. The effect is amplified by lifestyle factors common in the first few weeks of university, such as stress, lack of sleep, poor diet, and alcohol consumption, all of which can suppress the immune system's ability to fight off infections.</p>

          <p>A federal judge has issued a temporary restraining order to stop the Trump administration from transferring immigrant youths to adult ICE detention centers when they turn 18. The ruling states that this new policy violates a 2021 court order requiring these individuals to be released to the "least restrictive setting available" unless they pose a flight or safety risk. This legal challenge arose amid reports that ICE was instructing shelters to halt the release of 18-year-olds, even those with approved plans to join family or sponsors.</p>
