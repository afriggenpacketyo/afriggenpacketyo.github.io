        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>The Thai government has lifted a decades-long ban on working rights for long-term refugees from Myanmar residing in nine camps near the border. This decision comes as the United States has cut humanitarian aid programs, previously being the largest funder of food aid for these displaced individuals. Charities managing foreign food aid were compelled to cancel rations for most refugees due to these cuts, exacerbated by an influx of new refugees from the civil war in Myanmar. The Thai government's move aims to enable refugees to support themselves and their families, with the UN Refugee Agency welcoming it as a potential regional benchmark. The policy shift is viewed as a turning point that will stimulate the local economy.</p>

          <p>Erika Kirk, widow of Charlie Kirk, co-founder of Turning Point USA, has spent much of her adult life in the public eye. She was Miss Arizona USA, then a ministry leader and entrepreneur, and finally a wife and mother who shared her husband’s Christian faith. Erika met Charlie in 2018, and both spoke openly about the importance of dating with intention. After her husband's assassination, Erika wrote that the world is evil, but God is good. She emphasized that the movement her husband started would not die with him.</p>

While the Taliban released photos from the talks, the White House has not commented on the meeting or the claimed agreement. The Taliban statement indicated that the U.S. confirmed both sides would undertake an exchange of detainees, but details on the number of individuals, their identities, and reasons for imprisonment were not provided. The meeting follows the Taliban's release of a U.S. citizen and criticism of the Trump administration's travel ban affecting Afghans.</p>

          <p>Following the assassination of Charlie Kirk, discussions have emerged regarding the online reaction and its implications for political discourse in America. Panelists on Washington Week With The Atlantic discussed the sense of regret and calls for de-escalation after acts of political violence. They noted that while many expressed these sentiments, it remains uncertain whether they will lead to lasting change. The discussion explores the broader context of political violence and its impact on American society, featuring insights from prominent journalists and commentators.</p>

          <p>California lawmakers have passed several bills aimed at impacting students' experiences, focusing on areas like anti-discrimination, reading skills, and nutrition. Assembly Bill 715 seeks to combat discrimination by creating a state Office for Civil Rights, while AB 1454 mandates phonics-based reading instruction. AB 1264 aims to improve school meals by reducing ultra-processed foods. These bills now await approval from Governor Gavin Newsom. The legislation addresses various aspects of student well-being, including mental health, physical health, and academic support, and the results were not without controversy.</p>

          <p>Federal Reserve Governor Lisa Cook referred to a condominium she purchased as a "vacation home" in a loan estimate, potentially undermining claims that she committed mortgage fraud. President Donald Trump has sought to fire Cook, alleging that she claimed both the condo and another property as her primary residence simultaneously. Cook has sued the Trump administration to block her firing, securing an injunction that allows her to remain as a Fed governor. Tax records indicate Cook has never claimed a homestead exemption on the condo.</p>
