          <p>New York Yankees third baseman Ryan McMahon made a spectacular defensive play, flipping over the dugout railing to catch a foul ball and help preserve a historic postseason performance by rookie pitcher Cam Schlittler. Schlittler pitched eight scoreless innings with 12 strikeouts and no walks, a first in MLB postseason history. The Yankees defeated their rivals, the Boston Red Sox, in the winner-take-all game, advancing to the American League Division Series. The team's offense was highlighted by a four-run fourth inning that secured their victory.</p>

          <h2>Taylor Swift's New Album Highlights How Vinyl Records Avoid US Tariffs</h2>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>As fans rush to buy Taylor Swift's new album, "The Life of a Showgirl," on vinyl, an old piece of legislation is protecting them from higher prices. A Cold War-era law known as the Berman Amendment exempts "informational materials," including physical music, from presidential tariffs. This has shielded the booming vinyl record industry from recent trade disputes, which is welcome news for record labels and consumers but a point of contention for some U.S.-based manufacturers who argue it hurts domestic business. The vinyl market's resurgence, largely driven by younger consumers, continues to be a significant revenue source for artists like Swift.</p>

          <p>CNBC's Jim Cramer has urged individual investors to "own it, don't trade it" regarding Apple stock, advising them to ignore a recent downgrade from Jefferies. The analyst cut Apple to an "underperform" rating, citing concerns that demand for new iPhones is already priced in and expectations for future models are too high. Cramer argued that while frequent trading might suit hedge funds, it's a losing strategy for retail investors due to timing difficulties and taxes. He reiterated his confidence in Apple's long-term value, citing its market dominance and high customer satisfaction. (not investment advice)</p>

The surge followed news of new purchase orders for Rigetti's systems and a major European investment in a quantum venture fund. Tech giants like Nvidia have also recently highlighted their work in the field, boosting investor confidence. While proponents believe quantum computing can solve highly complex problems, some experts caution that the technology is still several years away from a major market breakout.

          <p>Despite objections from the state attorney general and consumer advocates, Minnesota regulators have unanimously approved the $6.2 billion acquisition of Minnesota Power's parent company, Allete, by an investment group. The buyers include a subsidiary of BlackRock and the Canada Pension Plan Investment Board. Opponents warned that the private equity deal is designed to extract profits at the expense of ratepayers. However, the Public Utilities Commission concluded that the conditions imposed on the deal, which include additional financial and regulatory safeguards, are sufficient to protect the public interest and prevent rate hikes.

          <p>Nottingham Forest manager Ange Postecoglou reportedly still has the support of the club's hierarchy despite a difficult start, having failed to win any of his first six matches. However, the upcoming Premier League game against Newcastle is seen as a crucial fixture that could influence his future. The club's board is said to believe mitigating circumstances, including poor refereeing decisions, have contributed to the poor results. Postecoglou remains confident in his process, pointing to his previous success in winning a trophy with Tottenham even when he knew his job was under threat.</p>

          <p>England's cricket team delivered a commanding 10-wicket victory over South Africa in their opening match of the Women's World Cup, providing a much-needed statement win. Left-arm spinner Linsey Smith was instrumental, dismantling South Africa's powerful top-order batters and setting the tone for a dominant performance. The result offers a strong response to criticism the team faced after a poor showing in the last T20 World Cup and the Ashes. The emphatic nature of the win positions England favorably for the upcoming matches in the tournament.</p>

          <p>Bitcoin's price rallied to within 1% of its all-time high as the U.S. government shutdown continued, suggesting investors are increasingly treating the cryptocurrency as a safe-haven asset. The digital currency has gained 12% this week alone, with analysts noting that its recent performance correlates with rising concerns over U.S. government risks and stability. This trend marks a shift from previous shutdowns, during which Bitcoin's market was in a different phase and did not react as strongly. Some analysts are now predicting the cryptocurrency could soon surpass its previous record and reach new heights. (not investment advice)</p>

          <h2>Financial Experts Outline Three Key Steps to Take Before Paying a Debt Collector</h2>
          <div class="timestamp">2025-10-03 12:38:31 EDT</div>
        </div>
        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Before paying a debt collector, it is crucial to take several protective steps to avoid potential pitfalls. First, consumers should always validate that the debt is legitimate and that the collector has the legal right to pursue it by requesting written proof. Second, it is important to weigh all options, such as negotiating a settlement for a lower amount or exploring formal debt relief programs, especially if the debt is old. Finally, one must get any payment or settlement agreement in writing before sending any money to ensure the terms are clear and the matter is fully resolved.</p>
