          <div class="timestamp">2025-06-26 14:09:35 EDT</div>
        </div>
        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Shares of backup-generator manufacturer Generac are experiencing a significant rally, marking their best week since last November. This surge is attributed to a combination of an oppressive heat wave across the central and eastern U.S., which has caused power outages, and forecasts for an above-normal Atlantic hurricane season. The increased demand and strain on the nation's aging power grid are seen as major drivers for the company's positive performance, as consumers and investors anticipate a greater need for backup power solutions.

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>The White House has indicated that President Trump's self-imposed July deadlines for finalizing trade deals and imposing new tariffs are not rigid. Press Secretary Karoline Leavitt stated the dates are "not critical" and could potentially be extended, a decision that rests with the president. This flexibility applies to a delayed 50% tariff threat on the European Union and the expiration of a pause on broader "reciprocal" tariffs. The remarks provided some relief to markets, suggesting a less confrontational immediate path on trade policy.</p>

          <p>Illinois Governor JB Pritzker has officially announced his campaign for a third term, highlighting his administration's record of balanced budgets, credit upgrades, and legislative achievements like raising the minimum wage and capping insulin costs.

Despite speculation about a potential 2028 presidential run, Pritzker focused on his commitment to governing Illinois, though he did not commit to serving a full term if re-elected.</p>
