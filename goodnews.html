          <p>During a crucial moment in the Yankees' game against the Red Sox, outfielder Jasson Dominguez's inattentiveness on second base led to a costly error.

Despite Dominguez's strong individual performance, this mistake ultimately contributed to the Yankees' 4-3 loss. The Yankees will aim to win the next game.</p>
