          <p>McLaren's Oscar Piastri narrowly claimed pole position at the Dutch Grand Prix, outperforming his teammate Lando Norris by a mere 0.012 seconds in a tense qualifying session. This victory marks a significant moment in their close championship battle, where Piastri holds a slight lead. Red Bull's Max Verstappen qualified in third, while Racing Bulls' rookie Isack Hadjar delivered a standout performance to secure fourth place. Both McLaren drivers acknowledged the tight competition, with Piastri calling it "peaking at the right time" and Norris expressing mild disappointment but recognizing the closeness of the race.</p>

          <p>The Powerball jackpot has surged to an estimated $1 billion after 39 consecutive drawings failed to produce a grand prize winner, making it the sixth-largest prize in the game's history. Winners face a choice between an annuity paid over 30 years or a lump-sum cash option, both of which are subject to significant taxation. A mandatory 24% federal tax is withheld immediately, with the remainder likely taxed at the highest federal rate. State taxes also apply in most jurisdictions, though eight states, including Florida and Texas, do not tax lottery winnings. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>Receding water levels in Iraq's largest reservoir, the Mosul Dam, have revealed approximately 40 ancient tombs believed to be over 2,300 years old. The discovery in the Khanke region of Duhok province was made possible by a severe drought that has plagued the country for five consecutive years. Archaeologists state the tombs likely date back to the Hellenistic or Hellenistic-Seleucid period. While the drought has had devastating effects on agriculture and electricity, it has created unique opportunities for archaeological excavation, allowing teams to unearth and preserve historical sites before they are submerged again by rising water levels.</p>

        </div>
        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>In a significant blow to Donald Trump's trade policies, a federal appeals court ruled that he exceeded his presidential authority by imposing widespread tariffs based on a declared national emergency. The 7-4 decision found that the International Emergency Economic Powers Act (IEEPA) does not grant the president the power to implement such taxes. The ruling voids the tariffs but has delayed its effect until October 14, giving the administration time to appeal to the Supreme Court, which will likely make the final determination. The decision creates uncertainty for Trump's trade agenda and could force the U.S. Treasury to refund billions in collected tariff revenue.</p>

          <p>A 78-year-old retired education professor and prolific author attributes his "razor sharp" memory to five intentional daily practices. He emphasizes the importance of regular social interaction to combat stress, and lifelong learning by reading widely outside one's expertise to stay curious and engaged. He also utilizes a color-coded sticky note system for organization, maintains daily physical activity like swimming and walking to increase blood flow to the brain, and follows a healthy diet with proper hydration and at least seven hours of sleep. He advocates for approaching memory maintenance with the dedication of a full-time job.</p>

They traveled over 9,000 miles from Peru to Cairns, Australia, becoming the first team to complete the full crossing non-stop. The journey involved overcoming significant challenges, including storms and injuries, while raising over £700,000 for clean water projects in Madagascar. Their arrival was celebrated by family and supporters, marking a historic achievement in endurance and philanthropy, breaking the previous record of 160 days.</p>

          <p>E-commerce giant Alibaba Group is experiencing a revival in its growth momentum, which executives attribute to successfully capturing "consumer mindshare" in China's competitive domestic market. The company's Taobao Instant Commerce initiative, launched in April, has reportedly exceeded expectations by meeting consumer demand for on-demand delivery of a wide range of products. Following a strong earnings report for the June quarter, Alibaba's CEO Eddie Wu expressed confidence in achieving long-term, industry-leading efficiency. The positive results led to a 13% jump in the company's New York-listed shares, signaling renewed investor confidence. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>A new ranking from The Princeton Review identifies Princeton University as the private college offering the best return on investment (ROI) in the United States. Despite a high sticker price, Princeton's generous financial aid brings the average annual cost down to just over $10,000 for aid recipients, who go on to earn a median income of over $110,000 a decade after attendance. The list, which also includes Caltech, MIT, and Stanford, highlights how elite private institutions with large endowments and "no-loan" policies can provide significant value. These schools often enable graduates to earn higher incomes than their public university counterparts. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>Activist investment firm Elliott Investment Management has announced a significant stake in Rexford Industrial Realty, a REIT focused on the Southern California market. Rexford's stock has underperformed recently, trading at a discount to its net asset value, which Elliott likely attributes to issues like bloated expenses, poor corporate governance, and misaligned management interests. Elliott has a history of pushing for changes at such companies, which could include advocating for better capital allocation, governance reforms, or even a strategic sale of the company. The move puts Rexford "in play," potentially attracting acquisition interest from other strategic investors or private equity firms. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>Las Vegas experienced a 12% year-over-year drop in visitors in July, marking the sixth straight month of decline, yet the city's top tourism official insists it has not become overpriced for average travelers. Steve Hill, CEO of the Las Vegas Convention and Visitors Authority, acknowledged the downturn but argued that the destination remains a good value, with resorts now offering promotions to combat a negative narrative on social media. Despite fewer visitors, Nevada's gaming revenue remains strong, indicating that those who do come are spending more. Officials are optimistic that a packed fall events calendar will help reverse the downward trend in tourism.</p>

His doctors successfully advocated for him to receive a dual heart and kidney transplant, a procedure he underwent in February 2024.

          <p>Indian cuisine in the United States is undergoing a significant transformation, moving beyond "cheap food and curry houses" to a burgeoning upscale and fine-dining scene. Renowned chefs like Vikas Khanna are leading a new wave of restaurants that explore hyper-regional and sophisticated Indian flavors, earning Michelin stars and attracting massive waitlists. This trend is driven by a growing consumer appetite for unique dining experiences and global flavors, particularly among younger generations. The boom has also captured the attention of investors, with private equity firms now backing popular Indian restaurant chains as they plan U.S. expansion.</p>

        </div>
        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>This legal analysis argues that President Donald Trump's executive order to prosecute flag-burners is likely to backfire. The Supreme Court has twice ruled that flag-burning is a form of protected speech under the First Amendment. While the order directs officials to use general "content-neutral" laws against public burning, the order's explicit focus on the message of flag-burning could provide defendants with a strong "selective prosecution" defense. The article, written by an attorney who argued the original Supreme Court cases, concludes that the order is an empty threat that will likely encourage more flag-burning protests while failing to expand the government's power to punish them.</p>

          <p>Celebrity chef Gordon Ramsay, 58, announced that he recently received treatment to remove a basal cell carcinoma, a common type of non-melanoma skin cancer. In an Instagram post, he thanked his medical team for their quick work and shared a photo showing a plaster on the side of his face. Ramsay used the announcement as an opportunity to raise public awareness about sun safety. He urged his followers to use sunscreen, especially during the weekend, and reassured them that the procedure was not a facelift. The NHS identifies this type of cancer as highly treatable, often caused by exposure to ultraviolet light.</p>
