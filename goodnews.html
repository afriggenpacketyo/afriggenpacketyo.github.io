          <h2>India Considers Zero Tariffs on U.S. Imports in Potential Trade Deal</h2>

          <p>India is reportedly considering eliminating tariffs on certain U.S. imports like steel, auto components, and pharmaceuticals, signaling a major shift from its protectionist policies. This comes after President Trump announced tariffs on Indian exports, which are now suspended. Experts suggest India aims to boost foreign investment and global market access, while ensuring domestic businesses are not harmed. A trade deal could benefit sectors like financials, materials, and healthcare, but the absence of a deal could compromise their earnings.</p>

          <p>President Trump announced the broad terms of a trade deal with Britain, which could lower the burden of his sweeping tariffs. The deal aims to increase U.S. access to the U.K. market, including for American agricultural products, and reduce non-tariff barriers. However, the 10% tariff on U.K. imports will remain in place, with exemptions for the first 100,000 vehicles imported by British automakers. The deal is seen as a political victory for Prime Minister Keir Starmer.</p>
