          <p>Shares of the buy-now, pay-later company Affirm increased by 15% in extended trading following a strong fiscal fourth-quarter earnings report that surpassed analyst expectations. The company announced earnings per share of 20 cents against an estimated 11 cents, with revenue reaching $876 million, exceeding the projected $837 million. This performance marks a significant milestone as Affirm achieved operating income profitability, a goal it had committed to a year prior. Despite facing increased competition, particularly from Klarna's recent partnership with Walmart, the company provided a positive outlook for the upcoming quarter. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>Colorado Buffaloes head coach Deion Sanders has proposed a new model for compensating college football players, suggesting they be paid directly for participating in the College Football Playoff. Sanders argues that instead of conferences receiving millions for their teams' appearances, the money should go to the athletes, with additional payments for advancing in the tournament. This idea was discussed in an interview alongside former coach Nick Saban, who also expressed concerns about the current state of Name, Image, and Likeness (NIL) deals. Sanders believes his proposal would create more equality, mirroring the NFL's system of playoff bonuses for players.</p>

In an exclusive interview, Zhao noted the Hong Kong government's clear intent to embrace Web3 technologies but suggested that its current crypto trading options are too limited.

Despite a slight dip in its stock after a strong earnings report, Cramer highlighted Nvidia's dominant position in the artificial intelligence sector, which he believes is far from reaching its full potential. He argued that the chipmaker's technology is poised to revolutionize various industries and that investors who trade in and out of such stocks risk missing significant gains. Cramer expressed confidence that Nvidia's unique products will continue to drive its success and reshape the concept of work. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>Naomi Osaka has reached the third round of the US Open with a decisive 6-3, 6-1 victory over Hailey Baptiste, continuing her strong performance on the court.

Despite this, Osaka has won eight of her last nine matches and appears to be regaining the form that saw her win two previous US Open titles. She also commented on a recent controversy involving Jelena Ostapenko, noting the historical weight of certain comments in a majority-white sport.</p>

A $7,500 federal tax credit for new EV leases is set to expire on September 30, along with a $4,000 credit for used EVs. With EV prices already declining due to softer demand, leasing has become the most popular way to acquire an electric car, accounting for 70% of transactions in July.

          <p>A federal judge has ruled that Trump administration official Kari Lake cannot unilaterally fire Michael Abramowitz, the director of Voice of America (VOA). The decision states that such an action requires the backing of a congressionally-mandated advisory panel, which currently lacks the members to form a quorum after President Trump dismissed most of them. The ruling is part of two lawsuits against Lake and her agency's efforts to dismantle VOA, which has seen its workforce and original content drastically reduced. The judge found the attempted termination to be unlawful and rejected the administration's broad claims of executive power in this case.</p>

With millions of hectares of illegal plantations under review, there is an opportunity to address the devastating impact on wildlife and ecosystems. The piece suggests that major consumer nations have the leverage to influence more sustainable practices and help rewrite the narrative of an industry often linked to environmental ruin.</p>
