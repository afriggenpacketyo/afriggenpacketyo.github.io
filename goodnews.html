          <p>Japanese conglomerate SoftBank has announced a significant $2 billion investment in Intel, acquiring shares at $23 each and becoming the fifth-largest shareholder. This move is seen as a major vote of confidence for the American chipmaker, which has faced challenges in capitalizing on the artificial intelligence boom and has been heavily investing in its manufacturing business. The investment supports Intel's critical role in expanding advanced semiconductor manufacturing within the United States. The deal highlights SoftBank's increasing influence in the global chip and AI markets, following its successful acquisition of Arm and other key investments. (not investment advice)</p>

However, European leaders pushed back against Trump's suggestion that a ceasefire was not necessary before negotiations, urging continued pressure on Russia. The talks also touched upon crucial security guarantees for Ukraine, with Trump promising U.S. involvement, though specific details remain undefined.</p>

          <p>The Apalachee High School football team in Winder, Georgia, achieved its first victory since 2021, ending a long and challenging losing streak. The win holds deep significance for the community, which is still healing from a school shooting 11 months ago that claimed the lives of two students and two teachers, including the team's defensive coordinator. Under the guidance of a new head coach and a mental performance coach, the team has worked to overcome trauma and change its culture. This victory serves as a powerful symbol of resilience and a reason for the community to rally together.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Major League Baseball Commissioner Rob Manfred has indicated that future league expansion could serve as an opportunity for a significant geographic realignment of the sport. He suggested that restructuring the league into Eastern and Western conferences, similar to the NBA, could reduce travel wear and tear on players and enhance broadcast appeal. While such a change would likely face resistance from traditionalists, it could create more regional rivalries and scheduling efficiencies. Manfred hopes to have the expansion process approved by 2029, with Nashville and Salt Lake City reported as leading candidate cities.</p>

          <p>Leeds United celebrated their return to the Premier League with a 1-0 victory over Everton, secured by a controversial late penalty converted by Lukas Nmecha. The match at Elland Road was defined by a fervent and hostile atmosphere, which fueled the home side's energetic performance, particularly in the first half. Despite their dominance, Leeds struggled to score from open play against a passive Everton team. The decisive moment came when a shot struck defender James Tarkowski's arm, leading to a penalty decision that left Everton players and their manager incensed but sealed the crucial win for Leeds.</p>

          <p>Kentucky Governor Andy Beshear has signed an emergency regulation to immediately ban the sale and possession of bromazolam, a potent synthetic drug often referred to as “designer Xanax.” This action classifies the substance as a Schedule 1 controlled substance, empowering law enforcement to combat its distribution. The move was prompted by a request from Kentucky's attorney general, Russell Coleman, who is also leading a coalition of 21 attorneys general urging the federal DEA to take similar emergency action. The drug has been linked to a rising number of overdose deaths in Kentucky and across the nation.</p>

          <h2>California Passes Bill Granting Homeowners Interest on Insurance Payouts</h2>
          <div class="timestamp">2025-08-18 18:11:19 EDT</div>
        </div>
        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>The California state legislature has passed a bill ensuring that homeowners, rather than mortgage lenders, receive interest earned on insurance payouts for properties damaged or destroyed by natural disasters. Previously, lenders could deposit these funds into an escrow account and keep the accrued interest while homeowners waited for rebuilding to be completed. The new legislation mandates that homeowners will be guaranteed at least 2% simple interest per year on these funds. This measure aims to close a legal loophole and provide additional financial support to residents during the difficult recovery process.</p>
