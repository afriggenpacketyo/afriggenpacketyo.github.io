          <p>Elon Musk initially declared that SpaceX would immediately decommission its Dragon spacecraft following President Trump's threat to cancel government contracts. This announcement came amidst a public dispute over Republican tax policies, with Musk criticizing Trump's "One Big, Beautiful Bill." However, Musk quickly reversed his decision after receiving advice from an X user, stating that Dragon would not be decommissioned. The Dragon spacecraft is the only U.S. option for delivering crew to and from the International Space Station, and NASA reaffirmed its commitment to space objectives despite the initial threat. Optimism score: The quick reversal and NASA's continued commitment suggest a relatively stable situation, although the initial threat introduces some uncertainty.</p>

          <p>A federal judge has issued a temporary restraining order against President Trump's proclamation that sought to bar international students from attending Harvard University. Judge Allison Burroughs stated the policy risked causing "immediate and irreparable injury." Harvard had refiled a lawsuit, arguing the proclamation violated the First Amendment and was retaliatory. The ruling temporarily prevents the government from enforcing the ban, marking a setback for the Trump administration's ongoing feud with the university.</p>

          <p>Lambda Legal, a nonprofit advocating for LGBTQ+ rights, has raised $285 million, exceeding its original fundraising goal by $105 million.

This fundraising effort comes at a time when LGBTQ+ rights are facing renewed challenges, including legislative attacks and administrative actions.</p>

        </div>
        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>A debate is growing around the trend of eating food products with fewer ingredients, driven by concerns about ultra-processed foods (UPF). While some consumers seek simpler ingredient lists, nutritionists caution against sacrificing essential nutrients. Experts argue that the term UPF is not always a reliable indicator of health, as processing can enhance food safety and extend shelf life. The trend is also expected to drive marketing efforts to promote and justify the higher prices of less processed food products.</p>
