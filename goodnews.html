          <p>A significant ceasefire and hostage deal has been announced between Israel and Hamas, following intense negotiations in Egypt, largely influenced by President Donald Trump's personal involvement. This agreement outlines the release of remaining hostages, the return of deceased captives' remains, the release of hundreds of Palestinian prisoners, Israeli troop withdrawal from parts of Gaza, and an increase in humanitarian aid. While celebrated as a major diplomatic victory and a moment of hope, particularly for Trump, crucial details such as Hamas's disarmament, the extent of Israeli withdrawal, and plans for Gaza's future governance still need to be resolved. This article underscores that while a breakthrough, a strong, durable, and everlasting peace is not yet certain.</p>

        </div>
        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>A growing trend among Gen Z consumers shows a strong preference for secondhand furniture, driven by environmental awareness and a desire to reduce the massive carbon footprint of the furniture industry. This article highlights that over 95% of the estimated 51 million tons of furniture consumed annually is discarded, largely due to "fast furniture" – cheap, mass-produced items designed for short lifecycles and difficult recycling. Younger consumers are actively seeking durable, unique pieces from platforms like Facebook Marketplace and Pinterest, investing in their restoration, and forming emotional connections with items. This shift represents a significant push towards sustainability, counteracting the environmental toll of disposable home decor.</p>

This lower-cost plan, initially launched in India and Indonesia, offers extended access to features like image generation, file uploads, and advanced data analysis, alongside higher usage limits compared to the free version. The expansion addresses a key user request for affordability, particularly as AI chatbot adoption growth rates in lower-income countries have significantly outpaced those in higher-income regions, reflecting OpenAI's strategic move to broaden its global reach and ensure wider participation in AI technology.</p>

          <p>China has activated a world-first thermal power station in the Gobi Desert, built by the China Three Gorges Corporation in Guazhou county. This innovative plant utilizes two towers to feed a single turbine system, a design unprecedented in concentrated solar power technology. Nearly 27,000 mirrors focus sunlight onto the 200-meter towers, generating concentrated heat that melts and stores salt at high temperatures to create steam, ensuring continuous power even after sunset or on cloudy days. The dual-tower approach significantly enhances efficiency by optimizing morning and afternoon sun capture, making the plant approximately 25% more effective than single-tower designs.</p>
