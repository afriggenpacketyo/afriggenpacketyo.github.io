          <p>San Diego FC has issued indefinite bans to 33 fans involved in a violent brawl after their match against the LA Galaxy at Snapdragon Stadium. The club is working with law enforcement and MLS to enforce these bans, and further action is possible. The club stated that the behavior of these individuals is unacceptable and does not reflect the club's values of creating a safe and respectful environment. This incident adds to previous issues this season, including fights at a match against Los Angeles FC and homophobic chants during the inaugural home match, despite the team's successful season on the field. The club aims to foster a passionate, inclusive, and secure atmosphere for all fans, emphasizing that violence has no place in the sport.</p>

          <p>President Trump lauded Nippon Steel Corp. as a "great partner" for U.S. Steel, signaling support for the Japanese company's $14 billion investment in the American producer. Speaking at a U.S. Steel plant in Pennsylvania, Trump emphasized that U.S. Steel would remain under American control, and that the deal would ensure all U.S. Steel workers keep their jobs and all facilities remain open. Trump also announced plans to increase tariffs on steel imports to 50%, citing national security concerns. The deal, initially proposed in December 2023, faced scrutiny over national security implications, but Trump has indicated a positive outlook following a review.</p>

          <p>UC Irvine's baseball team lost to Arizona State 4-2 in the Los Angeles Regional of the NCAA tournament, despite multiple chances to score. Jacob McCombs' sacrifice bunt in the fifth inning put runners in scoring position, but the Anteaters failed to capitalize. Trevor Hansen pitched well, but gave up two solo home runs, while Ricky Ojeda's availability for the next game is uncertain after pitching through the ninth. UC Irvine will now face Fresno State in the losers bracket and must win four consecutive games to reach the super regionals.</p>

          <p>Despite a recent court decision overturning many of Donald Trump‚Äôs tariffs, British officials are proceeding with trade talks with the U.S., aiming for deals covering cars, metals, and airplane parts. The UK team spent last week in Washington discussing implementation of the deal signed earlier this month, anticipating that the court ruling will eventually be overturned. The US president announced the US-UK trade deal earlier this month from the Oval Office, calling it ‚Äúvery special for the UK and special for the United States‚Äù. Officials hope car tariffs will be dropped soon, followed by steel and aluminum tariffs, while discussions on pharmaceutical products continue.</p>

          <p>Chinese tourists are driving a recent surge in inbound travel to Japan, exceeding pre-pandemic levels, with a noticeable shift in travel habits. Instead of large group tours and shopping sprees, more travelers now seek immersive experiences related to Japanese cuisine, culture, and scenery. The shift is partly driven by Chinese travelers in their 30s and 40s, many of whom have visited Japan before, now choosing family trips over group tours. The JNTO is working to better target this market, including opening an account on a popular Chinese social media platform last fall.</p>

Akazawa emphasized Japan's demand for the U.S. to remove all additional tariffs on Japanese imports, but noted that another round of negotiations is planned before the G7 summit. The discussions include boosting Japan-U.S. cooperation on strategic sectors like semiconductors and rare earths, in addition to addressing trade and nontariff barriers. Japanese Prime Minister Shigeru Ishiba spoke with President Trump, highlighting the need for a win-win relationship through increased Japanese investment in the U.S., rather than tariffs.</p>
