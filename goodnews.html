Popovich holds the NBA record for regular-season victories with 1,422 wins and led the Spurs to five NBA championships, the last being in 2014. Popovich expressed gratitude to the players, coaches, staff, and fans, with Mitch Johnson stepping in as the new head coach.

          <p>Prince Harry stated in a BBC interview that he desires reconciliation with his family in Britain, expressing concern over his father King Charles's health.

He acknowledged that his memoir "Spare" has caused division but hopes to resolve the conflict, as he has only been able to attend funerals and court hearings in the UK since stepping down from his royal duties.</p>

          <p>Wall Street has rebounded from April's sharp sell-off, driven by hopes for trade talks, although concerns about the economic impact of President Trump's policies persist. The S&P 500 has recovered to pre-tariff levels, boosted by a positive jobs report. However, the index remains below its February high, and questions linger about the potential for Trump's tariffs to slow economic growth. Despite the recent recovery, volatility underscores the market's sensitivity to the administration's trade policies, with the 90-day pause on tariffs set to expire in July.</p>
