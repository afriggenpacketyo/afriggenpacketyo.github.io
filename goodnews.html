          <p>China is preparing to host a global summit focused on women's rights, expected to take place in October, while simultaneously promoting President Xi Jinping's views on gender equality and traditional family values. The government asserts that significant progress has been made in advancing women's rights over the past decades, positioning itself as both an advocate and an active participant in global gender equality efforts. However, sources indicate that domestic grassroots NGOs are unlikely to be invited unless they are sponsored by overseas entities. This context raises questions about the scope and inclusivity of the upcoming event, as official narratives appear to contrast with the experiences of local activists.</p>

          <p>A specialized UK Ministry of Defence unit, nicknamed the "war detectives," has successfully identified the remains of two Scottish soldiers more than 100 years after they went missing during the Battle of Loos in World War One. The investigation began after construction workers in France discovered over 100 bodies, with artifacts like regimental badges and unique tramway buttons providing crucial clues. Through meticulous genealogical research and DNA matching with living relatives, the team confirmed the identities of Lance Corporal Gordon McPherson and Lieutenant James Grant Allan. The soldiers were recently laid to rest with full military honors, bringing long-awaited closure to their families.</p>

          <p>One year after Hurricane Helene caused catastrophic flooding and landslides in Western North Carolina, volunteer pilots are reflecting on their critical role in the immediate aftermath. With roads washed out and communication lines down, these pilots were among the first to witness the scale of the devastation, conducting rescue missions and delivering essential supplies. Groups like Total Flight Solutions and the Carolina Aviators Network coordinated dozens of helicopter and plane flights, rescuing over 100 people and dropping off necessities like medicine and food. Their efforts, supported by organizations like the United Cajun Navy, were vital in reaching stranded residents before larger-scale relief could arrive.</p>

          <p>Startup founders are sharing their experiences of navigating the emotional and professional challenges of business failure and finding new paths forward. The high-pressure "hustle culture" of entrepreneurship often leads to a crisis of identity when a venture shuts down, forcing founders to confront disappointing investors and laying off employees. Some who return to corporate life face a stigma, though many argue that their entrepreneurial experience makes them highly capable employees with a broad understanding of business operations. Ultimately, many founders find that reframing success around purpose and mission, rather than purely financial outcomes, is key to building resilience and bouncing back from setbacks.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>To attract more foreign visitors and stimulate its tourism sector, China is continuing to relax its entry requirements, offering several ways to visit the mainland without a visa. Passport holders from 55 countries can now stay for up to 10 days without a visa while transiting through major Chinese cities and international airports. Beijing has also been expanding its list of countries whose citizens can stay for up to 30 days visa-free, with Russia being the latest addition to this policy. These measures are designed to lower the bureaucratic and financial hurdles that have traditionally been associated with obtaining a Chinese visa, making short-term travel more accessible.</p>

          <h2>Financial Disparity Defines Women's Rugby World Cup Final Between England and Canada</h2>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Saturday's Women's Rugby World Cup final between England and Canada highlights a stark contrast in resources and professionalism that could shape the future of the sport. England, the world's best-funded team, provides its 32 players with full-time contracts and state-of-the-art support, backed by a robust domestic league. In contrast, Canada's players earn a fraction of that amount and the national team relied on a million-dollar fundraising campaign to finance their World Cup preparations. Despite this financial gap, Canada has performed exceptionally, demonstrating that clever, targeted preparation and leveraging players' experience in England's league can challenge a financial powerhouse.</p>

          <p>As England prepares for the Women's Rugby World Cup final, the diverse professional backgrounds of its players highlight the sport's rapid evolution. While the team is now fully professional, many stars began their careers balancing rugby with day jobs, including as plumbers, teachers, and painters. Hooker Amy Cokayne continues to serve as a police officer in the Royal Air Force alongside her rugby career, utilizing the military's Elite Athlete Scheme. The journey from the amateur era, when the 2014 World Cup-winning team had to take unpaid leave from their jobs, to today's professional landscape underscores the significant growth and investment in women's rugby in England.</p>

          <p>UK Chancellor Rachel Reeves is advocating for an ambitious youth migration deal with the European Union, aiming to bolster the economy ahead of the autumn Budget. The proposed scheme would allow individuals aged 18 to 30 to work in the UK for up to two years, which Reeves argues would be beneficial for growth and business. She is urging the Office for Budget Responsibility (OBR) to factor the potential positive economic impact of this visa program into its forecasts. This move could help reduce the need for spending cuts or tax hikes to close a potential multi-billion pound gap in the public finances. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>Director Emerald Fennell aims to capture the "primal, sexual" feeling she experienced when first reading 'Wuthering Heights' as a teenager in her upcoming film adaptation. Speaking at a festival in author Emily Brontë's hometown, the Oscar-winning director of 'Saltburn' described her profound connection to the novel's complicated and devastating romance. The film, starring Margot Robbie and Jacob Elordi, has already generated buzz with an erotically charged trailer that hints at a highly stylized gothic interpretation. Fennell explained that adapting a book that means so much to her has been a huge responsibility and an intense, almost masochistic, creative exercise.</p>
