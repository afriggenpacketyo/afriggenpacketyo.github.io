          <p>A paraglider in China miraculously survived after being unexpectedly pulled to an altitude of 28,208 feet without oxygen due to a powerful updraft. Peng Yujiang, an experienced paraglider, was conducting a routine equipment test when he became trapped inside a cumulonimbus cloud system, a phenomenon known as "cloud suck". Footage from his 360-degree camera captured the harrowing experience as ice formed around his face and equipment while he flew through thick clouds. Following the incident, Peng received a six-month flight suspension, as the flight site and airspace had not been approved in advance. This incident highlights the unpredictable dangers inherent in paragliding and the importance of adhering to safety regulations. </p>

Director Ryan Coogler and his wife, Zinzi Coogler, whose family has roots in Mississippi, attended the screening and expressed their pride in sharing the film with the community. The event also included panels, music performances, and celebrations of Clarksdale's cultural heritage. </p>

        </div>
        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>A new study published in Jama Health Forum estimates that removing fluoride from public drinking water supplies in the US could result in an additional 25.4 million cavities in children over five years. This would represent a 7.5% increase in cavities, costing $9.8 billion and resulting in the loss of 2.9 million quality-adjusted life years, disproportionately affecting children on public health insurance or without insurance. The study contradicts claims made by Robert F. Kennedy Jr., who has advocated for ending water fluoridation, and underscores the effectiveness of fluoride in preventing tooth decay. The research highlights the significant public health benefits of water fluoridation. </p>

          <p>The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) has updated its guidance on COVID-19 vaccines, stating that children with no underlying health conditions "may receive" the vaccine, replacing a broad recommendation for all children. This change follows an announcement by Health and Human Services Secretary Robert F. Kennedy Jr. that the agency would stop recommending COVID-19 vaccines for healthy children and pregnant women. The CDC still broadly recommends COVID-19 vaccines for immunocompromised children and most adults, and continues to recommend that pregnant women get vaccinated because of their higher risk of severe disease. The agency's changes reflect a shift towards shared clinical decision-making. </p>
