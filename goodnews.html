          <p>Following recent U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE) raids in Los Angeles County, local organizations are mobilizing to support affected families and immigrant communities. The raids have impacted communities including Los Angeles, Paramount, Culver City, and Boyle Heights, with federal agents arresting 330 immigrants in Southern California and the Central Coast. Organizations like the YMCA, √ìrale, Esperanza Immigrant Rights Project, and Not Us Without You are providing resources such as food, legal assistance, and mental health support. The YMCA is accepting nonperishable food items, personal hygiene products, and baby supplies at various locations, while √ìrale is seeking reinvestment in the Long Beach Justice Fund to offer pro bono legal representation.</p>

          <p>A federal judge has ruled that the Trump administration can no longer detain Mahmoud Khalil, a Columbia University graduate and Palestinian activist, based on claims that he is a threat to U.S. foreign policy. Judge Michael E Farbiarz stated that Khalil's career and reputation were being damaged, chilling his speech, which constitutes irreparable harm. Khalil has been detained in Louisiana since March, missing the birth of his first child. The ruling does not affect the Department of Homeland Security's efforts to remove Khalil based on alleged inaccuracies in his green card application.</p>

          <p>Elon Musk has stated that he regrets some of the posts he made about President Donald Trump during their recent social media exchange, admitting that "they went too far." This follows Trump's statement that he was open to reconciliation with Musk, despite their previous fallout. The conflict began after Musk criticized Trump's tax bill, calling it a "disgusting abomination," and made unverified claims about Trump's connection to Jeffrey Epstein. In response, Trump threatened to cancel Musk's government contracts. Musk has since deleted many of his posts, including one calling for Trump's impeachment.</p>
