          <p>Emperor Naruhito and Empress Masako of Japan visited Hiroshima Prefecture to pay respects to atomic bomb victims ahead of the 80th anniversary of the end of World War II. The imperial couple offered flowers and silent prayer at the cenotaph in Hiroshima Peace Memorial Park, reflecting on the horrors of the 1945 bombing. This marks their first trip to the city since Emperor Naruhito's accession in 2019, following visits by his grandfather and parents, who showed deep concern for the survivors. The couple also plans to visit Nagasaki in September as part of memorial visits to mark the 80th anniversary of the war's end.</p>

          <p>The Buss family has reportedly agreed to sell a controlling interest in the Los Angeles Lakers to Mark Walter, CEO of Guggenheim Partners, valuing the franchise at $10 billion, making it the most valuable sports franchise globally.

Jerry Buss purchased the Lakers in 1979 for $67.5 million, transforming it into a globally recognized sports franchise with 11 NBA titles since the acquisition, and the Dodgers have also entered a number of high-dollar deals under Walter's tenure.</p>

          <p>The Los Angeles Dodgers announced their plans to assist immigrant communities impacted by recent federal immigration raids in the city. This announcement marks the team's first public statement regarding the unrest, which had led to increasing calls for the team to address the situation. Manager Dave Roberts expressed hope that the team could be a positive distraction, while utilityman Kik√© Hern√°ndez voiced his opposition to the treatment of the community. The Dodgers became embroiled in controversy when a singer sang a Spanish version of the national anthem at a game as a protest against the raids.</p>

          <p>Astrophysicists have discovered that the supermassive black hole at the center of the Milky Way galaxy, Sagittarius A* (Sgr A*), is spinning almost as fast as its maximum rotation rate. Using a new method developed with high-throughput computing and neural networks, researchers analyzed Event Horizon Telescope (EHT) data to determine the black hole's properties. The study also revealed that Sgr A*'s rotational axis points towards Earth and that its magnetic field behaves differently than predicted by theory. The findings, detailed in three papers, may lead to a better understanding of black hole physics and the general theory of relativity.</p>

        </div>
        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>With increasing U.S. tariffs, businesses are resorting to "tariff engineering," legally modifying products to fit into lower-tariff categories. This involves altering materials, dimensions, or compositions to justify different harmonized system codes. Customs lawyer John Foote notes there is nothing illegal about strategic design choices that result in different tariff classifications and duty rates. Examples include bundling steel and aluminum elements, using cotton instead of synthetic materials, or adding cubic zirconia to lapel pins. This practice allows companies to reduce their duty liability by cleverly navigating the U.S. tariff classification system.</p>

Nippon Steel finalized a $14.1 billion deal to make U.S. Steel a wholly owned subsidiary after securing a National Security Agreement with the U.S. government, committing to invest around $11 billion by 2028 and maintain the company's headquarters in Pittsburgh.</p>
