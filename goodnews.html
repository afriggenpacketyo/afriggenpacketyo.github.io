          <p>JetBlue Airways is implementing additional cost-cutting measures due to lower-than-expected travel demand, making it unlikely to achieve break-even operating margins this year. CEO Joanna Geraghty informed staff that the airline will reduce off-peak flights, trim unprofitable routes, and pause the retrofit of some older Airbus A320 jets. The carrier is also reevaluating hiring plans and considering combining leadership roles to reduce travel spending. This announcement follows the blocked acquisition of Spirit Airlines and a previous blocked alliance with American Airlines, pushing JetBlue to seek new strategies to increase revenue and cut costs. </p>

          <p>Senators Elizabeth Warren and Representative Jan Schakowsky are challenging five major pharmaceutical companies, including Pfizer and Johnson & Johnson, regarding their low tax bills and lobbying efforts. They accuse these companies of exploiting a loophole in President Trump's 2017 Tax Cuts and Jobs Act by shifting profits to offshore subsidiaries. The lawmakers are questioning whether the companies' lobbying efforts are aimed at maintaining this tax loophole in the proposed "One Big Beautiful Bill Act." The bill is currently in the Senate, where Democrats face an uphill battle to eliminate the offshore tax loophole due to Republican control. </p>

          <p>During the 250th anniversary parade in Washington, the US Army showcased robot dogs, highlighting the pursuit of technological superiority in autonomous combat. The US Marine Corps also utilizes robot dogs for patrol and reconnaissance, particularly for dangerous missions. China has invested heavily in similar technology, with the People‚Äôs Liberation Army deploying quadruped unmanned ground vehicles (Q-UGVs) in various operations. Unmanned autonomous systems, including Q-UGVs, offer unique advantages in urban combat settings compared to unmanned aerial vehicles and wheeled unmanned ground vehicles. </p>
