          <p>A federal judge has ordered the Trump administration to resume distributing funds for EV chargers to 14 states, challenging the administration's pause on the National Electric Vehicle Infrastructure (NEVI) program. The judge granted a preliminary injunction, stating that the administration's actions disrupted projects already underway and hindered states' ability to meet carbon emission targets. The Department of Transportation stated they will assess legal options, arguing the Biden-Buttigieg NEVI program guidance was a disaster. The ruling highlights the separation of powers, as the funds were allocated by Congress and should be administered by the executive branch, not withheld based on policy preferences.</p>
