          <p>A Kenyan student accepted to Harvard University is worried that his family's sacrifices to fund his education may be wasted due to the Trump administration's restrictions on international students. Magaga Enos's grandmother sold her land and cattle to help him pursue a master's degree, but his future in Cambridge is uncertain as he awaits clarity on his visa status. Enos, who has spent a decade educating young girls, fears that his dream being taken away will impact his community and those who believe in his potential.

However, many stock market terms are simpler than they initially appear, including "volatility," which refers to how much a stock's price fluctuates, and "diversification," which means spreading investments across multiple asset classes. Understanding the "investment horizon," which is the period one expects to keep money invested, is also crucial for aligning investment strategies with financial goals.
