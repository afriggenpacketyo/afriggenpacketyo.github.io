          <p>House Speaker Mike Johnson expressed his hope that Elon Musk and Donald Trump can resolve their differences following a recent public fallout over a multitrillion-dollar spending bill. Johnson emphasized the importance of collaboration for the country's benefit, stating that he did not craft the legislation to specifically please Musk, but rather to assist hardworking Americans. Musk had criticized the bill as a "disgusting abomination" that would lead to exploding federal deficits, while Johnson brushed aside these concerns. The Speaker has not spoken to Musk since last Monday regarding the GOP-led bill, but is hopeful that they will reconcile in the future. The Louisiana Republican believes that it is in the country's best interest for everyone to work together, despite the emotions involved.</p>

          <p>Science and Technology Secretary Peter Kyle has called on the police to "do their bit" and embrace change as the Home Office and Treasury negotiate the upcoming Spending Review. Kyle highlighted the financial pressures faced by all sectors and emphasized the need for modernization and technological advancements within public services. Shadow Home Secretary Chris Philp voiced concerns about potential cuts to police numbers and urged the government to protect their budget. Chancellor Rachel Reeves is set to outline departmental spending allocations for the next three to four years, having already warned that not all departments will receive their desired funding levels. The government has already provided an additional ¬£1bn to the police, but expects them to start embracing the change they need to do to do their bit for change as well.</p>

          <p>A US marshal was briefly detained by Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE) agents in Arizona after being misidentified as a suspect. The deputy marshal matched the general description of an individual sought by ICE and was detained at a federal building in Tucson. Officials confirmed the marshal's identity was quickly verified by other law enforcement officers, leading to his immediate release. The incident occurred amid increasing pressure from the White House on ICE agents to increase arrests. The Trump administration appears to be shifting away from arresting suspected gang members or those with criminal histories and moving to a more generalized detention of undocumented immigrants.</p>

          <p>England captain Harry Kane admitted his team "got away with it" in their narrow 1-0 victory against Andorra, acknowledging that their performance was "wasn't good enough." The match, played in Barcelona, saw England secure three points thanks to Kane's solitary goal, but the team faced boos from some fans at halftime and full-time. Manager Thomas Tuchel criticized the team for lacking seriousness and urgency in the World Cup qualifier. Kane noted that the team lacked quality and appeared fatigued, both physically and mentally, leading to a performance that did not meet their standards. England's next game is a friendly against Senegal.</p>

Yusuf's initial resignation came shortly after he criticized Sarah Pochin, Reform's newest MP, for asking if the government would ban the burka. Tice insisted that the party knows "exactly what it is doing" and that Yusuf will now focus on the party's unit tasked with identifying spending cuts at councils.</p>

Sethi explained that he had talked to many people and planned what he was going to say, but was still very nervous about it. Although Cassandra was open to the idea of a prenup, their negotiations became contentious due to differing expectations and understandings of money. They eventually sought help from a therapist, who helped them understand their different views on money. The therapist asked how they each view money, which opened up conversations that they hadn't been able to have before.</p>

          <p>The US National Guard is part of the US Armed Forces Reserve and is deployed for disaster relief, internal security, and support of military operations abroad. The governor of a state typically commands reservists when deployed within the state, while the US president is the commander-in-chief when deployed nationwide. President Trump recently decided to override the authority of California Governor Gavin Newsom when deploying the National Guard in Los Angeles during protests against ICE immigration raids. The National Guard consists of the Army National Guard and the Air National Guard, and it was formed in 1903 by the Militia Act.</p>

          <p>A state-backed think tank in China has put forward China‚Äôs ‚Äúfour core principles‚Äù as a constructive framework for addressing disputes in the South China Sea. These principles are: resolving disputes through consultation on an equal footing, managing differences through rules-based co-management, achieving positive outcomes through mutually beneficial cooperation, and opposing interference from external forces while encouraging them to play a constructive role. The report blames regional tensions on external actors who fuel rival claimants‚Äô actions and weaken the ‚Äúwillingness for maritime cooperation‚Äù. China formally presented its blueprint for cooperation in the South China Sea in 2002 through an agreement with Asean.</p>
