        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>The United States has secured new trade deals with Indonesia and the Philippines, a move analysts interpret as an indirect strategy to counter China's influence in Southeast Asia. The agreements, which eliminate duties on American exports to the two nations while imposing a 19% tariff on their imports to the U.S., aim to reshape regional supply chains and provide access to critical resources. While not explicitly targeting Beijing, the policy reflects a U.S. effort to contain China's economic power through strategic partnerships. However, experts note that Chinese firms are already deeply integrated in the region, increasingly localizing production rather than relying on transshipments. (not investment advice)</p>

University officials announced that the procedure was necessary following a glaucoma diagnosis that was causing the dog discomfort.

While she will need time to recuperate from her duties, her veterinary team expects her to make a full recovery and be back to her usual activities, such as attending classes and cheering on the Aggies, by the fall.</p>

          <p>South Korean chipmaker SK Hynix announced record-breaking operating profit and revenue for the second quarter, significantly beating market expectations. The surge was driven by powerful and sustained demand for its high-bandwidth memory (HBM) chips, which are essential components in the hardware used for generative AI. The company, a key supplier to Nvidia, saw its operating profit jump nearly 69% year-on-year, solidifying its leadership position in the critical HBM market. SK Hynix expects strong demand to continue for the rest of the year, fueled by ongoing investments in AI by major tech companies. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>A federal appeals court has declared President Trump's executive order aimed at limiting birthright citizenship to be unconstitutional. In a significant ruling, a panel of judges on the 9th U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals stated that the president's order is invalid because it directly contradicts the clear language of the Fourteenth Amendment. The amendment grants citizenship to "all persons born in the United States and subject to the jurisdiction thereof." This decision marks a major legal challenge to one of the administration's key immigration policies, which has been on hold pending legal battles.</p>

          <p>Columbia University has finalized a deal with the Trump administration, agreeing to pay over $220 million to resolve federal investigations. The settlement includes $200 million to the government and $21 million for EEOC probes, made in exchange for the reinstatement of $400 million in federal research funding that was withheld over allegations of failing to curb antisemitism. As part of the agreement, Columbia will codify reforms such as overhauling its disciplinary process and adopting a new definition of antisemitism, with compliance overseen by an independent monitor. The university stated the deal marks an important step forward, though it does not admit to any wrongdoing.</p>

          <p>The U.S. housing market continues to favor sellers, but a potential shift may be on the horizon as the number of homes for sale increases. According to real estate data, there were significantly more sellers than buyers in May, yet median home prices still hit a record high in June, driven by low inventory from homeowners locked into low interest rates. Experts suggest that while the market remains competitive, especially for updated, turnkey homes, buyers may find more negotiating power with properties that have been on the market longer. Regional variations are significant, with markets in Texas and Florida becoming more buyer-friendly than those in the Northeast. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>Spanish midfielder Aitana Bonmati scored the winning goal in extra time against Germany, sending Spain to its first-ever Women's Euro final. Her heroic performance is particularly remarkable given that she was discharged from a hospital just days before the tournament began after suffering from viral meningitis. The two-time Ballon d'Or winner had to wait for her chance, coming off the bench in Spain's first two games, but now appears to be back at her world-class best. Her crucial goal secured a final matchup against England and capped a dramatic personal journey from a hospital bed to national hero status.</p>

          <p>The International Court of Justice, the UN's highest court, has issued a landmark advisory opinion stating that countries have a legal duty to prevent harm from greenhouse gas emissions and can be held accountable for climate-related damages. The unanimous opinion came in response to a campaign led by the Pacific island nation of Vanuatu, which suffers disproportionately from climate change impacts like rising sea levels. While not legally binding, the ruling sets a powerful legal precedent that could influence thousands of climate litigation cases worldwide and strengthen the position of vulnerable nations in demanding reparations and climate finance from major polluters.</p>

The growth figure surpassed economists' expectations and marked a positive reversal from the first quarter's 0.2% contraction. The expansion was supported by a rise in total consumption and strong export growth, particularly in semiconductors and petroleum products. This positive economic news comes as South Korea faces pressure to finalize a trade deal with the U.S. to avoid significant tariffs on its exports, a critical component of its GDP.

          <p>The Los Angeles Rams are beginning their training camp with high expectations as a Super Bowl contender, but they face several significant concerns. Quarterback Matthew Stafford is starting camp with limited participation due to back soreness, a worrying sign for the team's most crucial player. The offensive line is also a question mark, with left tackle Alaric Jackson dealing with recurring blood-clot issues and right tackle Rob Havenstein recovering from double shoulder surgery. Additionally, the team is relying on an unproven cornerback group and must resolve a contract extension for star running back Kyren Williams to avoid potential distractions.</p>

The implosion wasted a stellar seven-inning, 12-strikeout performance from starter Tyler Glasnow. While the victory was celebrated, the game highlighted the team's most pressing issue: a struggling and overworked bullpen, which has posted a high ERA over the last month and threatens the team's championship aspirations.</p>
