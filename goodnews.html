          <h2>California Crab Season Threatened by Whale Migration, Innovative Fishing Tech Offers Hope</h2>
          <div class="timestamp">2025-05-15 22:51:33 EDT</div>
        </div>
        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Northern California's Dungeness crab season faces disruption due to migrating humpback whales becoming entangled in traditional fishing ropes. Fisherman Brand Little utilizes a U.S. military-developed pop-up system, costing $50 per cage, to minimize rope usage and prevent whale injuries, allowing him to continue fishing. The California Department of Fish and Wildlife shortened the season to protect whales, but Little's investment of $25,000 allows him to fish while avoiding harm to the whales. The technology is an experiment sponsored by the California Department of Fish and Wildlife, which is tasked with regulating the crab fishing season. </p>

          <p>NBA legend Shaquille O'Neal has voiced skepticism regarding the recent Blue Origin space flight, suggesting that the trip may not have actually occurred. O'Neal's theory centers on his belief that Jeff Bezos would not risk sending his fianc√©e, Lauren Sanchez, into space, pointing to discrepancies within a video released by Blue Origin. He noted that the hair of those on board, including Katy Perry and Lauren Sanchez, did not appear to move in zero gravity. The mission, which lasted 10 minutes and 21 seconds, was attended by several celebrities, including Oprah.</p>

          <p>NJ Transit rail engineers are poised to strike if a deal isn't reached by the midnight deadline, potentially impacting over 300,000 commuters. The Brotherhood of Locomotive Engineers and Trainmen (BLET) is in conflict with NJ Transit over pay raises, citing a five-year wage freeze. NJ Transit CEO Kris Kolluri emphasizes the need for a fair wage that is also reasonable for fare payers and taxpayers, and Gov. Phil Murphy may declare a state of emergency if the strike proceeds. The agency has a contingency plan to accommodate 20% of daily riders, urging people to work from home if possible.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>A new study reveals that ancient horses repeatedly migrated between North America and Eurasia during the late Pleistocene era, facilitated by a land bridge formed due to lower sea levels. Fossils of Dalianensis horses, discovered in northeastern China, show a mixed ancestry from both Eurasian and American populations. These horses, which lived 17,000 years ago and were slightly larger than modern wild horses, undertook multiple migrations across the Bering land bridge between 50,000 and 13,000 years ago, resulting in genetic exchanges between the two continents.</p>

          <p>New requirements for clinical testing of vaccines may delay the availability of updated COVID shots this fall, potentially limiting them to older Americans and those with chronic health problems. The Department of Health and Human Services stated that substantial updates to existing vaccines, such as those related to seasonal strain changes, may require additional clinical evaluation. The FDA has already requested more clinical data from Novavax before approving its COVID vaccine, and officials are questioning the necessity of the vaccine for children under 12. Some experts fear these changes could undermine the vaccine infrastructure.</p>
