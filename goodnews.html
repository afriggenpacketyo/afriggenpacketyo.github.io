        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>The UK economy experienced a 0.7% expansion in the first three months of the year, surpassing analyst expectations of 0.6%, according to recent data from the Office for National Statistics. The services sector was the primary driver of this growth, with significant contributions from production as well. While Chancellor Rachel Reeves highlighted the UK's economic performance relative to other major economies, some analysts cautioned that this growth rate may not be sustainable due to upcoming US tariffs and increased UK employer taxes, with some economists feeling 'quite cheered' by the figures. Businesses are adopting varied strategies to cope with the changing economic landscape, including absorbing tariffs to maintain stable pricing in the US market.</p>

          <p>The Indian government has given the green light to a $433 million chip joint venture involving Apple supplier Foxconn and HCL Group, aiming to bolster India's semiconductor industry. The plant, located in Uttar Pradesh, is slated to begin operations by 2027 and will manufacture display driver chips for various electronic devices, with a capacity of 20,000 wafers per month. This move aligns with the trend of Apple suppliers diversifying their manufacturing bases from China to India amidst ongoing trade tensions. India's 'Semiconductor Mission' seeks to establish a robust chip and display ecosystem within the country, with this joint venture marking the sixth semiconductor unit under the plan.</p>

          <p>Germany's foreign minister has announced that Berlin is prepared to support the United States' call for NATO member states to increase their defense spending to 5% of GDP. This commitment comes as NATO members are currently obligated to spend at least 2% of GDP on defense, a target that many countries have yet to meet. While some nations view the 5% target as unrealistic, NATO Secretary General Mark Rutte suggested a compromise involving increased military spending alongside investments in defense-related infrastructure. German Chancellor Friedrich Merz has also declared intentions to reinvest in Germany's armed forces to create the strongest army in Europe.</p>

          <p>Nottingham Forest striker Taiwo Awoniyi suffered an injury that teammate Ola Aina believes could have been avoided if the assistant referee had flagged an offside earlier in the play. Awoniyi, who collided with a post during a Premier League match against Leicester City, underwent surgery for a serious abdominal injury and was briefly in an induced coma. Aina contends that Anthony Elanga was "miles offside" during the play's build-up, but the flag was not raised until after the incident due to a protocol introduced in 2020.</p>

          <p>The Japanese government is contemplating doubling the release of its rice stockpile to roughly 600,000 tons in an effort to control rising rice prices amid a supply shortfall. This potential release, which includes 300,000 tons over three months, would supplement the 321,000 tons already auctioned between March and April. The government's stockpile would then decrease to around 300,000 tons, which is about a third of the appropriate reserve level, raising concerns about future responses to poor harvests. The Farm Ministry suspects wholesalers and farmers are hoarding rice in anticipation of price hikes.</p>

          <p>Three MƒÅori MPs in New Zealand are facing potential suspension from parliament for performing a haka in protest during a legislative session last year. The parliamentary committee deemed the haka, which was performed in response to a controversial bill redefining the country's founding treaty, as potentially "intimidating" to other lawmakers. The MƒÅori Party has criticized the proposed suspensions as a "warning shot" against dissent, while Deputy Prime Minister Winston Peters condemned the MPs for flouting rules and intimidating others.

          <p>A medieval manuscript held in Harvard Law School's library for 80 years has been discovered to be an original 1300 version of Magna Carta, not a copy as previously believed. Two British academics made the finding, noting that it is one of only seven such documents from that date still in existence. The manuscript, purchased for $27.50 after World War II, has been authenticated through ultraviolet photography and spectral imaging. The document's rediscovery is considered timely, given current pressures on academic institutions and the ongoing importance of the legal principles enshrined in Magna Carta.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Denmark's economic growth, propelled by a surge in pharmaceutical exports, is projected to moderate in the coming years, although potential U.S. tariffs on the pharma industry are not expected to be a major contributing factor. The IMF notes that most Danish drug products are not produced in the country nor cross its borders, limiting the direct impact of U.S. tariffs. Danish drugmakers rely on a "merchanting and processing" system, where intellectual property drives the value of medicines manufactured in other countries. The Danish pharmaceutical giant Novo Nordisk's increased demand for its diabetes and weight loss medications has been a significant growth driver.</p>

Previously believed to be a copy, the document is now recognized as one of only seven surviving originals issued by King Edward I.

          <h2>Ford Recalls SUVs Due to Brake Issues</h2>

          <p>Ford is recalling nearly 274,000 Expedition and Lincoln Navigator SUVs in the U.S. due to a potential installation defect that may cause a loss of brake function. The front brake lines in the affected vehicles may come into contact with the engine air cleaner outlet pipe, potentially leading to a brake fluid leak and increased crash risks. Ford is unaware of any accidents or injuries related to this recall, and dealers will inspect and replace the brake line or air cleaner outlet pipe as needed, free of charge.</p>
