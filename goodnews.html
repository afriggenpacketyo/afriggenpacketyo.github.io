          <h2>June Retail Sales Rise in UK, Driven by Weather but Overall Growth Slows</h2>
          <div class="timestamp">2025-07-25 03:28:32 EDT</div>
        </div>
        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>UK retail sales saw a 0.9% increase in June, largely attributed to hot weather driving up fuel and supermarket sales, especially for beverages, as consumers ventured out. This rebound followed a larger 2.8% fall in May, making the June rise smaller than many economists had anticipated. Despite the monthly gain, the Office for National Statistics reported a broader loss of momentum, with sales up only 0.2% between April and June compared to the previous three months. This trend, coupled with weakened consumer confidence, supports economists' views that economic growth in the second quarter will be lacklustre, highlighting ongoing challenges despite seasonal boosts.</p>

          <h2>UK-India Free Trade Agreement Poised to Significantly Boost Bilateral Trade</h2>
          <div class="timestamp">2025-07-25 03:04:00 EDT</div>
        </div>
        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>The UK and India have finalized a "historic" free trade agreement, expected to boost their bilateral trade by over $34 billion annually by 2040, or 25.5 billion pounds. The pact, signed after three years of intense negotiations, slashes duties on a wide range of goods including textiles, alcohol, and automobiles. This strategic win for India's trade diplomacy will reduce tariffs for 99% of Indian goods entering Britain and 92% of UK exports to India, including significant cuts on Scotch whisky and auto tariffs. Both nations anticipate the deal will raise living standards, boost wages, and lower consumer prices, while also strengthening their positions in other ongoing trade negotiations.

          <h2>India Faces Pressure to Finalize US Trade Deal Amid Looming Tariff Deadline</h2>

          <p>India is under intensified pressure to finalize a trade deal with the U.S. before an August 1 deadline, which would see tariffs increase to 26%. This urgency is heightened by a recent U.S.-Japan trade agreement and India's efforts to protect sensitive agricultural sectors, as seen in its recent UK deal, which safeguarded these interests. Analysts suggest the U.S. views India as a strategic partner to counter China's global manufacturing dominance, potentially shifting supply chains to India and complementing U.S. efforts. India's multi-alignment strategy, including its role in BRICS, provides leverage in negotiations, allowing it to diversify trade partners and potentially soften the blow of higher U.S. tariffs.

          <p>A new species of ancient shark, named Macadens olsoni, has been discovered at Mammoth Cave National Park in Kentucky, enriching the understanding of prehistoric marine ecosystems. The fossils, found in the Ste. Genevieve Formation, date back approximately 340 to 335 million years, when the area was submerged in a warm, shallow sea teeming with diverse life. This small shark, growing to less than a foot long, likely fed on mollusks and worms and is notable for its unique curved row of crushing teeth. This remarkable discovery underscores the importance of preserving and studying natural history, with over 40 different fossil shark species identified in the park recently.</p>

          <p>UFC fighter Robert Whittaker is set to return to the octagon against Reinier de Ridder in Abu Dhabi, nine months after suffering a severe jaw injury during a fight that dislodged his bottom teeth. Whittaker, who had previously weakened his teeth at 19, underwent surgery to have them removed and implants installed, a procedure he humorously notes has significantly improved his life, allowing him to bite into an apple for the first time in nearly 15 years. The former middleweight champion, currently ranked fifth, states that while regaining the title remains a goal, his primary motivation now is to lead by example for his children, demonstrating remarkable resilience.</p>

          <p>French President Emmanuel Macron announced that France will recognize Palestine as a state at the UN General Assembly in September, a move Israel strongly condemned as rewarding terror. This symbolic decision places significant diplomatic pressure on Israel amid the ongoing war and humanitarian crisis in Gaza. France becomes the largest Western power to recognize Palestine, potentially paving the way for other nations to follow suit. Macron emphasized that the urgent priority is to stop the war in Gaza and protect civilians, while the Palestinian Authority welcomed the decision as a commitment to international law and self-determination.</p>

          <p>During President Donald Trump's visit to Scotland, the UK aims to further cement ties and address "unfinished business" regarding a recent US-UK trade deal. The discussions will focus on removing the 25% tariff on UK steel and aluminum, contingent on British origin, and resolving Washington's concerns about the UK's digital services tax on tech companies. While the initial deal provided a 10% baseline tariff on British goods, these remaining points are crucial for a more comprehensive agreement. This visit provides an opportunity for the UK to secure more favorable trade terms, especially given the looming August 1 deadline for EU tariffs. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>Wales is set to introduce a UK-first initiative providing debit-style cards preloaded with funds to help individuals with conditions like coeliac disease purchase gluten-free food. This new system, beginning later this year, offers an alternative to the current prescription model, aiming to "de-medicalise the supply of gluten-free foods." A pilot scheme participant received £14 a month, which she noted only "scratches the surface" of the added 35% cost of a gluten-free diet, as gluten-free products are significantly more expensive. The cards will be accepted at various retailers, including supermarkets and online stores, providing greater flexibility and choice for those who cannot consume gluten, and are expected to be cost-neutral for the NHS.</p>

          <p>President Trump signed an executive order aiming to reshape college sports by empowering federal agencies to enforce new provisions on athletic scholarships and Name, Image, and Likeness (NIL) deals. The order seeks to protect non-revenue sports, particularly women's and Olympic sports, by requiring top athletic departments to maintain scholarship numbers. It also targets "pay-for-play" NIL deals, asserting they should not be permitted by universities. This move, following a class action settlement allowing direct player payments, signals increased federal intervention in college athletics. While aligning with NCAA priorities, legal experts question the order's enforceability and potential for partisan divides.</p>

This move reinforces AUKUS as a crucial defense partnership, with the UK emphasizing the indivisibility of security in the Indo-Pacific and Euro-Atlantic regions.

          <p>A majority of UK Members of Parliament on the Commons foreign affairs committee have urged the government to immediately recognize the state of Palestine, arguing it is an "inalienable right" that should not be conditional. This call comes amidst warnings of mass starvation in Gaza and follows France's announcement of its intention to recognize Palestine at the UN in September. While Prime Minister Sir Keir Starmer has stated that recognition should occur when it has the "greatest impact," the committee's report emphasizes the urgency to act "while there is still a state to recognise." This reflects growing international pressure on Israel and the evolving diplomatic landscape surrounding the Israeli-Palestinian conflict.</p>
