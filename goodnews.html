          <p>In a new memoir, former Supreme Court Justice Anthony Kennedy discusses how his Western upbringing shaped his legal philosophy centered on liberty and freedom. He reflects on his pivotal role as the court's 'swing justice,' casting deciding votes on major issues like abortion rights and same-sex marriage. Now retired, Kennedy expresses concern that the current court has become overly personal and confrontational, warning that a lack of civility and respectful disagreement puts democracy itself in danger.</p>

          <h2>Study Finds AI-Generated 'Workslop' Is Harming Productivity, but Blame May Lie with Employers</h2>

        </div>
        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>A Harvard Business Review study reveals that over 40% of U.S. employees have received AI-generated content that appears complete but lacks real substance, a phenomenon now termed "workslop." This low-quality output is reportedly damaging workplace productivity. The article argues that the root cause of this issue is not the AI technology itself, but rather the failure of employers to implement it effectively through proper training, clear policies, and strategic planning, ultimately leaving employees to figure it out on their own.</p>
