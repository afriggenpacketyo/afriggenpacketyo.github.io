          <p>A SpaceX Falcon 9 rocket successfully launched an upgraded Northrop Grumman Cygnus spacecraft to the International Space Station, delivering over five tons of essential supplies, research materials, and special holiday treats for the crew. This mission marks the third of at least four SpaceX flights purchased by Northrop Grumman, featuring the new Cygnus XL model, which is significantly longer and offers about 2,600 additional pounds of cargo capacity. The Falcon 9's first stage executed a spectacular and successful return landing at Cape Canaveral Space Force Station, marking SpaceX's 67th Florida touchdown and 505th overall booster recovery. This critical resupply ensures the ISS maintains vital reserves, including components for the urine processor and diverse food items like clams, oysters, and roast turkey, while contributing to ongoing space exploration efforts.</p>

          <p>The UK and US have unveiled five new commercial deals in nuclear power, heralding a "golden age" for the sector just before President Trump's state visit. Key initiatives include plans for a new 960MW advanced modular reactor (AMR) plant in Hartlepool, a collaboration between US firm X-Energy and British Gas-owner Centrica, projected to generate 2,500 construction jobs. Separately, EDF and US nuclear firm Holtec are exploring an £11bn project for SMR-powered data centers in Nottinghamshire. The newly formed Atlantic Partnership for Advanced Nuclear Energy aims to accelerate these projects by cutting red tape and standardizing safety protocols. Both governments are heavily investing in nuclear to satisfy escalating electricity demand, particularly from the AI industry, and to bolster energy security while achieving climate targets.</p>

          <p>Jim Edgar, a highly regarded two-term Republican governor of Illinois, has passed away at the age of 79 due to complications from pancreatic cancer. Serving from 1990 to 1998, Edgar is widely recognized for steering the state toward greater financial stability during a challenging 1990s recession. His tenure involved advocating for significant budget cuts and successfully making a temporary income tax surcharge permanent, which provided a stable funding source for public education. A moderate figure within the Republican party, Edgar later expressed discomfort with its rightward shift, notably endorsing Kamala Harris for president last year. He leaves behind a legacy of integrity and effective governance during a pivotal period in Illinois state history.</p>

          <p>East Los Angeles hosted its 79th annual Mexican Independence Day parade, imbued with a heightened sense of defiance and pride, despite widespread fears ignited by the Trump administration's intensified immigration crackdown. A recent Supreme Court decision, authorizing federal agents to conduct "roving patrols" based on minimal suspicion, has amplified anxieties within the Latino community. Although the parade's attendance seemed reduced compared to previous years, participants actively expressed their resolve to fight for their rights, prominently displaying anti-Trump and anti-ICE signage. The event, a vibrant celebration of Latino joy and cultural heritage, also featured public figures like Mayor Karen Bass, who reiterated strong support for immigrant communities and condemned the ongoing raids, which many leaders argue are discriminatory and detrimental to the region's economy.</p>

          <p>Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskiy has announced that Ukrainian forces have achieved progress in the border districts of the northern Sumy region, an area where Russian troops have persistently attempted to establish a presence. Citing top commander Oleksandr Syrskyi, Zelenskiy also reported that Moscow's forces have sustained considerable losses in the Donetsk and Kharkiv regions, spanning the extensive 1,000-km frontline. This update contrasts with recent Russian statements highlighting their own gains in the central Dnipropetrovsk region and their slow advance across eastern Ukraine. Zelenskiy underscored that Ukrainian units are continuing their push towards the state border, effectively repelling Russian assaults, particularly in strategic areas near Kupiansk and Dobropillia, maintaining pressure against the invading forces.</p>

          <p>Scholar Zheng Yongnian is urging China to cultivate its own indigenous knowledge system, especially in the field of artificial intelligence, to effectively counter what he terms "intellectual colonialism" originating from the West. He posits that existing Western social science theories, which are rooted in Western practices and experiences, are inherently insufficient for accurately interpreting diverse civilizations such as Confucian, Islamic, or Indian societies. Zheng stresses the critical role of the humanities and social sciences in shaping a nation's understanding of society and technology. He firmly believes that China should fully embrace its unique secular civilization to assert its appropriate position within the international order, thereby moving beyond its historical reliance on Western conceptual frameworks for both technological and broader societal advancement.</p>

Guillermo del Toro’s “Frankenstein” and Rian Johnson’s “Wake Up Dead Man: A Knives Out Mystery” were recognized as runners-up. Additional festival honors included "The Road Between Us: The Ultimate Rescue" for the documentary category and Park Chan-wook's "No Other Choice" for the International People's Choice Award, celebrating a diverse range of cinematic achievements.</p>

          <p>Texas Republican Rep. Michael McCaul, a distinguished foreign policy leader who previously chaired the House Homeland Security and Foreign Affairs Committees, has announced his decision not to seek reelection in 2026 after serving 11 terms. McCaul articulated a desire for a "new challenge" within the national security and foreign policy spheres, emphasizing his commitment to continuing efforts to strengthen America and enhance global safety. He notably disagreed with former President Trump's recent assessment of Russian drone incursions over Poland, viewing them as a test of NATO's resolve. McCaul's retirement contributes to a period of transition for Texas Republicans and marks the end of a career that included leading a multi-year investigation into the US withdrawal from Afghanistan and receiving sanctions from the Chinese Communist Party for a visit to Taiwan.</p>

Inside sources indicate that Barron chose to remain close to his parents, enrolling in the NYU D.C. program, which uniquely integrates coursework with internships and professional opportunities directly tied to the government. Although he was previously studying at the NYU Stern School of Business, his enrollment in the D.C. campus, which predominantly caters to students pursuing politics, public policy, or journalism, strongly suggests a possible pivot towards political interests. This move further fuels speculation, especially considering his past involvement in assisting his father's presidential campaigns.</p>
