        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>The U.S. Senate has advanced a significant Republican-backed spending bill, dubbed the "One Big Beautiful Bill," following intense negotiations to secure votes from conservative holdouts. Senators Ron Johnson, Rick Scott, Mike Lee, and Cynthia Lummis initially opposed the legislation but flipped their votes after securing promises for amendments related to deficit reduction and Medicaid. Despite the procedural victory, the final passage of the nearly 1,000-page bill remains uncertain, as several key senators have not committed to a final "yes" vote. The process was marked by lengthy delays and high-level discussions involving party leadership.</p>

          <p>Reality television stars Todd and Julie Chrisley have given their first interview since being released from federal prison after receiving a presidential pardon from Donald Trump. The couple, convicted of bank and tax fraud, described difficult prison conditions and their daughter Savannah's efforts to secure their freedom. They were originally sentenced to 12 and 7 years respectively but served just over two years. Critics have questioned the pardon, which the Chrisleys defended, and the couple now plans to focus on prison reform while preparing for a new television show.</p>

          <p>Following their victory at the Euro 2025 tournament, members of England's Under-21 soccer team are now being considered for the senior squad ahead of next year's World Cup. Players like Tino Livramento and Harvey Elliott, who was named player of the tournament, delivered standout performances that could earn them a place in Thomas Tuchel's plans. The success of the U21s, who have now won consecutive European titles, is seen as a testament to the FA's development programs since 2012. However, history shows that progression to the senior team is not guaranteed for all young champions.</p>

          <h2>1925 Santa Barbara Earthquake Offers Lessons for Modern Seismic Preparedness</h2>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>On the 100th anniversary of the devastating 1925 Santa Barbara earthquake, experts reflect on the lessons it provides for California's ongoing seismic risks. The quake exposed deadly vulnerabilities in brick buildings, a danger that took decades for many cities to address with mandatory retrofitting laws. Seismologists note that even a century later, many structures, including soft-story apartment buildings, remain at risk. The historical event also highlights a recurring reluctance to enforce stricter building codes due to property rights concerns. The 1925 quake ultimately reshaped Santa Barbara's architecture, mandating the Spanish Colonial Revival style that defines its downtown area today.</p>

After losing everything in the blaze, she relocated to Santa Cruz County to live with her daughter, embracing new activities like swing dancing and pottery.

          <p>The financial education startup Dow Janes is seeing a surge in popularity, particularly among Gen Z and millennial women seeking to improve their financial literacy. Founded by Harvard Business School graduate Britt Baker, the company addresses a documented gap in financial education, as many women report not being taught about money management by their parents. Amid economic uncertainty and a volatile stock market, Dow Janes uses social media and a structured course to make topics like budgeting and investing more accessible. The platform focuses on both practical skills and the psychological aspects of personal finance.</p>

        </div>
        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>The muted reactions from China and Russia to the recent Israeli and U.S. strikes on Iran suggest that the so-called anti-American axis is weaker than it appears. Despite shared antagonism toward the U.S., neither Beijing nor Moscow offered significant military or diplomatic support to Tehran during the crisis. This indicates that when global stability is threatened, preserving economic ties with the West outweighs their commitment to a partner like Iran. This cautious approach reveals the pragmatic limits of their alliance, which is based more on convenience and shared grievances than on deep-rooted values or mutual defense obligations.</p>

          <p>B√§rbel Bas has been elected as the new co-leader of Germany's center-left Social Democratic Party (SPD), where she will serve alongside Lars Klingbeil. Coming from a working-class background in Duisburg, Bas's rise through the political ranks is seen as a source of hope for the ailing party, which suffered a historic defeat in the last election. As a member of the SPD's left wing, she is expected to provide a counterbalance to the more conservative Klingbeil. In her new dual role as party co-chair and Germany's labor minister, she faces the daunting tasks of reforming social benefits and rebuilding the party's support.</p>

          <p>British and Irish Lions winger James Lowe has humorously dismissed attempts by a Perth stadium announcer to troll players born in the southern hemisphere. Before a match against Western Force, the announcer singled out several Lions players, including the New Zealand-born Lowe, for their origins, a tactic echoing comments from Australia's coach. Lowe, who previously played for the Maori All Blacks against the Lions, took the jests in stride, suggesting the gag could continue if it leads to more victories. The incident is part of the verbal sparring that has characterized the tour's buildup.</p>

They praise the continued funding for the Ryan White CARE Act and the End the HIV Epidemic initiative but express alarm over proposals to cut funding for HIV surveillance, testing, and community-based support. The authors also highlight the critical role of Medicaid, which covers care for over 40% of people with HIV, and advocate for expanding access to preventative medications like PrEP to finally end the epidemic.</p>

          <p>Influencer-turned-boxer Jake Paul defeated former world champion Julio C√©sar Ch√°vez Jr. by a unanimous decision in a cruiserweight bout in California. Paul controlled the fight from the outset, as Ch√°vez Jr. appeared reluctant to engage, throwing very few punches through the early rounds. Despite his clear improvement in technique, Paul's victory has raised familiar questions about the quality of his opponents, as Ch√°vez Jr. looked like a shadow of his former self. After the win, Paul called out current champions Gilberto Ramirez and Badou Jack, signaling his ambition to pursue a legitimate title shot.</p>
