          <p>A team from China's Nankai University has reportedly completed the world's first human trial of a brain-computer interface (BCI) implanted through blood vessels, a less invasive alternative to open-skull surgery. The procedure involved guiding a stent electrode through a neck vein to a blood vessel near the brain's motor cortex. This innovative technique successfully allowed a paralyzed patient to regain some control over their limb movements. The approach aims to reduce the risks and recovery time associated with BCI technologies like those being developed by Elon Musk's Neuralink.</p>

          <p>The Los Angeles Dodgers defeated the Kansas City Royals 5-4, securing their position as the team with the most wins in Major League Baseball, despite what their manager described as an incomplete performance. The game featured defensive errors and a struggling start from pitcher Dustin May, but the Dodgers' offense did just enough to clinch the victory. Key moments included a two-run homer by Max Muncy and a go-ahead RBI single from Mookie Betts. The win highlights a recent trend for the team of finding ways to win even when not playing at their best.</p>

          <p>Chelsea manager Enzo Maresca has publicly stated that the club has no intention of selling 19-year-old defender Josh Acheampong this summer, despite interest from other clubs. Maresca emphasized his belief that Acheampong has the potential to become a top player for Chelsea and that the best plan for his development is to remain with the team. Sources close to the player have also refuted suggestions that he is frustrated at the club. Acheampong, a product of Chelsea's academy, signed a new five-year contract last year and had a breakthrough season under Maresca.</p>

The departure of 24-year-old Rauhin and her three offspring leaves only two giant pandas remaining in Japan, both at Tokyo's Ueno Zoo, who are also scheduled to return next year. The Wakayama zoo held a farewell ceremony attended by thousands of visitors, marking the end of a successful joint breeding program with China that began in 1994 and produced 17 cubs. The zoo expressed willingness to accept new pandas in the future.</p>

        </div>
        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>A recent study in Japan has found a lower rate of depressive symptoms among working-age individuals who regularly consume a traditional Japanese-style diet. The research assessed diets rich in rice, miso soup, fish, soy products, and vegetables. The Japan Institute for Health Security, which conducted the study, noted that certain foods in the diet, such as those containing folic acid and omega-3 fatty acids, may contribute to improved mental well-being by assisting neurotransmitter release and reducing inflammation. While further research is needed, the findings suggest a potential link between this dietary pattern and the prevention of depression.</p>

Massey was arrested peacefully at a residence in New Orleans and will be transferred to a secure state correctional facility. The May 16 escape, which authorities have criticized as a result of mismanagement and poor infrastructure, prompted an extensive manhunt involving multiple law enforcement agencies.

          <p>A BBC reporter explores the century-old medical concept of phage therapy, which uses naturally occurring viruses called bacteriophages to treat bacterial infections. As antibiotic resistance grows into a global health crisis, researchers are reviving interest in this alternative approach. The article details the process of finding these 'bacteria-eaters' in the environment, with the reporter successfully isolating a phage from his toilet that could kill a patient's drug-resistant infection in a lab setting. While challenges remain in bringing phage therapy into mainstream medicine, it represents a promising frontier in the fight against superbugs.</p>

This groundbreaking technology will allow scientists to accurately measure the amount of carbon stored in forest trunks and create a global 3D map of the world's forests. The data is considered vital for understanding the role these ecosystems play in mitigating climate change.</p>
