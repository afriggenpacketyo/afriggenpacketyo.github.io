          <p>Shopify's stock experienced a decline in early trading after the company announced its first-quarter results, which were a mix of meeting expectations and falling slightly short. The company's revenue was reported at $2.36 billion, exceeding the anticipated $2.33 billion, while projecting gross profit growth in the high-teens for the second quarter. Executives acknowledged the uncertainty surrounding potential impacts from tariffs on Chinese imports, particularly after the expiration of a duty-free trade loophole affecting online businesses. Despite these concerns, Shopify maintains a positive outlook, noting that its customer base is less price-sensitive due to higher incomes.</p>

          <p>Experts suggest that using an inheritance to pay off high-interest credit card debt can be a wise financial move, especially with interest rates currently elevated. However, the decision depends on individual circumstances, including the size of the debt, interest rates, and financial goals. If balances are low or on a 0% promotional rate, investing or saving the inheritance might be a better option. It's important to address the root cause of the debt to avoid accumulating balances again in the future.</p>
