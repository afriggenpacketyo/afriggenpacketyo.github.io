          <p>Treasury Secretary Scott Bessent addressed global investors at the Milken Institute Global Conference, outlining President Donald Trump's "America First Vision" for the U.S. economy. Bessent emphasized tariffs, tax cuts, and deregulation as core components of Trump's economic agenda, aiming to stimulate private investment and reduce government waste. He highlighted the administration's goal to make the U.S. more appealing for investors, focusing on policies that benefit ultra-wealthy individuals and entrepreneurs. The speech at the Milken conference served as an explicit appeal to this select group, contrasting with the emphasis on Main Street in Bessent's Wall Street Journal op-ed.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Berkshire Hathaway shares experienced a decline after Warren Buffett's unexpected announcement to step down as CEO, marking the end of his 60-year leadership. Buffett, 94, has chosen Greg Abel as his successor, with the board voting unanimously for Abel to assume the role on January 1, 2026, while Buffett will remain chairman. The transition marks the end of an era for Berkshire, which has grown into a $1.2 trillion conglomerate under Buffett's guidance, encompassing insurance, railroad, retail, manufacturing, and energy. Despite the transparent transition, shareholders express confidence that Buffett will continue to mentor Abel and provide intellectual capacity for future capital allocation decisions.</p>

          <p>The Metropolitan Museum of Art's Costume Institute is hosting its annual gala, opening the exhibition ‚ÄúSuperfine: Tailoring Black Style,‚Äù which focuses on the history of Black male fashion.

With Anna Wintour and celebrity co-chairs like ASAP Rocky and Lewis Hamilton, the gala is expected to showcase more Black designers and stylists than ever before. While some companies sponsoring the event are also courting the Trump administration, the Met's commitment to recognizing Black contributions to fashion is seen as a significant statement in the current climate.</p>

          <p>Zhao Xintong is on the verge of becoming the first player from China to win the World Snooker Championship after extending his lead to 17-8 over Mark Williams in the final.

A victory would earn him the ¬£500,000 top prize and elevate him to 11th in the world rankings upon his return to the main professional tour next season.</p>

          <p>WNBA legend Lisa Leslie praised Caitlin Clark's impact on the league as she prepares for her second season with the Indiana Fever. Leslie noted Clark's ability to make an immediate impact after her college season and acknowledged the heightened expectations and pressure on the Fever with their new roster and coach. While Clark did not make the U.S. women‚Äôs national basketball team for the 2024 Paris Olympics, it appeared to be a blessing in disguise as she appeared to be more in sync with her Fever teammates after the Olympics break than she was at the beginning of the regular season. Leslie also highlighted the increased fan interest and sold-out games due to the "Caitlin Clark effect."</p>

The REAL ID Act, passed in 2005 in response to the 9/11 Commission's recommendations, aims to standardize state ID requirements and improve security features. However, the deadline has been extended repeatedly due to various concerns, including privacy issues and practical challenges. Despite these delays, states have been working to comply with the requirements, though the full enforcement of the law may be phased in.</p>
