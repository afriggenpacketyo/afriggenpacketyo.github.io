          <h2>US Mortgage Rates Remain High, Impacting Home Affordability</h2>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>The average 30-year mortgage rate in the United States has remained steady at 6.76%, close to the year's highest levels but lower than the previous year. Mortgage rates are influenced by various factors, including global demand for U.S. Treasury bonds, Federal Reserve interest rate policies, and investor expectations regarding the economy and inflation. Elevated mortgage rates and rising home prices continue to pose affordability challenges for potential homebuyers, contributing to a sluggish spring home-buying season. This article highlights the challenges in the housing market, where affordability remains a significant barrier for many.</p>

        </div>
        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Saudi Aramco's net profit for the first quarter of 2025 decreased by 5% compared to the same period last year, primarily due to lower crude oil prices and reduced production. The company reported a net income of $26 billion, slightly above analyst expectations, but free cash flow also declined. This signals ongoing financial strain for the Saudi state oil giant, as crude prices remain subdued and global demand slows. Aramco has reduced its performance-linked dividend payout while increasing its base dividend, reflecting efforts to balance shareholder returns with financial realities.</p>

          <p>This guest essay emphasizes that being a perfect mother is harmful, as it sets unrealistic expectations for both the mother and the child. The author, a psychiatrist, argues that flaws are essential for children to learn acceptance and that mothers often face undue blame for their children's problems. The essay encourages mothers to embrace their imperfections and to stop striving for an unattainable ideal, as their children are better off learning that give and take is important in all close relationships.
