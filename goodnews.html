          <p>The U.S. government is scaling up a program to combat the New World screwworm, a flesh-eating parasite that poses a significant threat to livestock, wildlife, and pets. The plan involves breeding billions of male screwworm flies, sterilizing them with radiation, and releasing them from airplanes over Mexico and southern Texas. These sterile males then mate with wild females, whose eggs subsequently fail to hatch, causing the pest population to collapse over time. This sterile insect technique has been successfully used to eradicate the pest in the past and is considered more effective and environmentally friendly than widespread pesticide use.</p>

          <p>On the first day of the second Test at Edgbaston, India reached 310-5 against England, anchored by a patient century from captain Shubman Gill. Despite England's captain Ben Stokes choosing to bowl first on a flat pitch, India built a solid foundation, with opener Yashasvi Jaiswal also contributing an elegant 87. England's bowlers fought hard, with Chris Woakes taking two key wickets, including Nitish Kumar Reddy, which briefly put India in a precarious position at 211-5. However, Gill's unbeaten 100, combined with a strong partnership with Ravindra Jadeja, ensured India ended the day in a content position.</p>

        </div>
        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>With the economic landscape shifting, savers with a significant sum like $10,000 may consider a certificate of deposit (CD) for its safety and growth potential. However, before committing funds, it's crucial to ask several questions. Investors should determine whether a short-term or long-term CD is more beneficial, as current rate trends have inverted historical norms. It is also vital to assess if one can afford to have a large amount of money inaccessible for the entire term to avoid early withdrawal penalties. Finally, one should compare CDs to other high-rate alternatives like high-yield savings accounts to ensure it's the most suitable option. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>The price of ether (ETH) and stocks of companies with exposure to the cryptocurrency saw gains, driven by renewed interest in the tokenization of real-world assets. Companies like BitMine Immersion Technologies and Bit Digital, which are focusing on ETH as a treasury asset, experienced significant stock jumps. The trend is fueled by the Ethereum network's capability for smart contracts, which underpins the creation of stablecoins and digital representations of traditional assets, like BlackRock's tokenized money market fund. This renewed enthusiasm comes after a period of uncertainty for Ethereum, which has faced competition and market volatility. (not investment advice)</p>

The study's findings indicate that individuals who drink their coffee black have a 14% lower risk of all-cause mortality when compared to those who do not drink coffee at all. This research adds to a growing body of evidence suggesting potential health benefits associated with coffee consumption, particularly when it is consumed without high-calorie additions.

Parchman and his wife endured five IVF cycles and multiple miscarriages before having their son, a process he found emotionally challenging.

          <p>Amid recent air traffic control (ATC) outages and a surge in summer travel, this article explains the redundant systems and pilot training used to maintain safety. Pilots are trained from their earliest days to handle lost communications, with protocols including switching to backup radio frequencies and using a specific transponder code (7600) to signal an issue. All airliners are also equipped with a Traffic Collision Avoidance System (TCAS) that autonomously directs aircraft to climb or descend to avoid other planes. While these outages can cause significant delays, experts assert that multiple layers of safety protocols prevent them from making flying less safe.</p>

Additionally, the deal includes a 40% tariff on any goods trans-shipped through Vietnam from other countries to circumvent duties. The pact follows a surge in U.S. trade with Vietnam since tariffs were imposed on China, as importers sought alternative manufacturing hubs.</p>

          <p>As a tangible asset in an unpredictable economy, physical gold in the form of bars and coins presents a compelling investment case for portfolio diversification and hedging against inflation. This month, there are several reasons to consider this investment. Gold offers stability when other markets are volatile, and it is now easier than ever to buy and sell through various retailers and specialized companies. Furthermore, investors can enter the market at a lower price point by purchasing fractional gold, which weighs less than a full troy ounce, making it accessible without a massive capital outlay.
