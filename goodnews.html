This inclusion appears to have triggered a significant short squeeze, as investors who had bet against the stock were forced to cover their positions.

          <p>A high court in Bogota has acquitted former Colombian President Álvaro Uribe on charges of bribery and witness tampering, overturning a previous conviction. The court ruled that the charges had not been proven "beyond reasonable doubt," citing methodological errors and biased evaluation of evidence in the initial sentence. Uribe, who served as president from 2002 to 2010, is the first former Colombian leader to be convicted of criminal charges, though an appeal against a separate procedural fraud charge is still pending.</p>

          <p>A family-medicine clinic in Aurora, Colorado, called Mango House, has developed a successful and financially self-sustaining model serving a refugee and immigrant community almost exclusively through Medicaid. By eliminating scheduled appointments in favor of a walk-in system and streamlining operations to maximize efficiency, the clinic provides accessible care while remaining profitable. This innovative approach challenges the conventional wisdom that relying on Medicaid is a losing proposition, offering a potential blueprint for serving vulnerable populations.</p>
