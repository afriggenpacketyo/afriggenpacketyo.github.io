          <h2>India Becomes Top Smartphone Exporter to the U.S., Surpassing China</h2>
          <div class="timestamp">2025-07-29 04:34:10 EDT</div>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>India has overtaken China as the leading exporter of smartphones to the United States, with its share of U.S. imports jumping to 44% in the second quarter. This significant shift, representing a 240% increase in volume from the previous year, is largely driven by Apple's strategy to move manufacturing away from China amid ongoing trade uncertainties. While global manufacturers like Samsung and Motorola are also increasing production in India, Apple's move is the most substantial, though the company still relies on China for its premium models. This trend highlights a broader realignment of global supply chains.</p>

          <p>South Korean AI chip startup Rebellions has secured a new investment from Samsung as it pursues a funding round of up to $200 million before a planned initial public offering. The company, formed from a merger with rival Sapeon, is being positioned as a major domestic competitor to Nvidia. Rebellions is collaborating with Samsung's foundry business to produce its next-generation AI chip, named Rebel, using advanced 4-nanometer process technology. This strategic partnership could bolster Samsung's chip manufacturing division while providing Rebellions with critical production capabilities and funding for product development.</p>

          <p>China has developed a new AI-powered weather warning system named Mazu, designed to help developing nations better prepare for natural disasters. The China Meteorological Administration (CMA) stated that the system is built for global reach and aims to create an early warning partnership network to combat extreme weather events worldwide. Named after a revered Chinese sea goddess, the Mazu system leverages China's Fengyun satellites, which already provide data to 133 countries. The initiative is part of China's effort to enhance international cooperation on climate challenges, with joint development projects already underway with countries like Ethiopia and Pakistan.</p>

          <p>Automotive giant Stellantis has reinstated its financial guidance for the second half of the year, anticipating a gradual recovery despite reporting a first-half net loss of €2.3 billion. The owner of brands like Jeep, Fiat, and Peugeot expressed confidence in improving revenues and profitability, though CEO Antonio Filosa acknowledged that 2025 is a tough year requiring difficult decisions. The company updated its full-year tariff impact to approximately €1.5 billion, a significant factor in its performance. The guidance is based on the assumption that the current U.S.-EU trade framework, which includes a 15% tariff on most EU goods, remains unchanged.</p>

          <p>Amid the current craze for collectible toys like Labubu, this article explores the history of a similar vintage doll, the Monchhichi. Created in Japan in 1974, the monkey-like doll became a global phenomenon in the 1980s, especially in Europe. Interestingly, due to Cold War restrictions, capitalist West Germany's popular Monchhichi was not available in communist East Germany. Instead, a state-owned enterprise in the toy-making town of Sonneberg produced a nearly identical version called the Tiemi, which became popular throughout the Eastern Bloc. Today, both original Monchhichis and the rarer Tiemi dolls are sought-after collector's items for nostalgic adults.</p>

          <p>British bank Barclays reported a second-quarter pre-tax profit of £2.5 billion, surpassing analyst expectations, and announced a £1 billion share buyback. The strong performance was largely driven by its investment banking division, where income rose 10% year-on-year to £3.3 billion due to heightened market volatility. Like other major banks, Barclays benefited from increased trading in currency and fixed income markets, which helped offset a decline in advisory fees. The results come as the bank continues its three-year strategic plan focused on cost reduction and delivering more stable returns for investors. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>Manchester United has identified Aston Villa's Ollie Watkins and RB Leipzig's Benjamin Sesko as top targets to reinforce its striking options. However, the club acknowledges that it must first offload some current players to fund any new acquisitions, a process that may extend until the transfer deadline. Securing either player presents challenges, as Aston Villa is reluctant to sell the 29-year-old Watkins, and Newcastle is also competing for the 22-year-old Slovenian, Sesko. United reportedly considers Villa's potential £60 million asking price for Watkins to be excessively high.</p>

          <p>Chinese experts are urging Beijing to adopt a more proactive strategy in shaping its global image and to engage more with scholars across Asia to counter what they see as dominant Western narratives. They argue that China must leverage its cultural symbols and promote Asian values rooted in "harmony and diversity" to project its voice on the international stage. This call for a new approach comes as global power dynamics shift, with emerging economies seeking a greater role in global governance. The experts suggest that China should take the lead in shaping international norms in new fields to align its soft power with its economic growth.</p>

          <p>This article addresses several key topics in Formula 1, including the recent Belgian Grand Prix. Experts debate whether the FIA was overly cautious with wet race conditions, balancing driver safety against the desire to see all-weather driving skills, especially given past tragedies at the Spa circuit. The analysis also touches on Lewis Hamilton's recent dip in performance, attributing it to specific car setup issues rather than a larger decline. Finally, it explores the uncertainty surrounding Red Bull's new engine for the 2026 season and the potential implications for Max Verstappen's future with the team.</p>

          <p>Qatar's bid to host the 2036 Olympic Games is presented as a logical next step after hosting numerous major sporting events, but it faces significant challenges. The extreme summer heat would necessitate a move to November, disrupting the global sports calendar, similar to the 2022 FIFA World Cup. An Olympic scholar notes that while Qatar has the facilities, it must also demonstrate popular support and overcome its negative image concerning human rights and labor practices. The bid also creates potential geopolitical friction with neighboring Saudi Arabia, which is also vying for future major events. The IOC's final decision is expected in 2027.</p>

After relocating to Bengal, his raw talent was recognized, and with coaching to build his self-belief, he rose through domestic cricket and the IPL to earn a spot on the national team.
