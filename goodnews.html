          <p>Ohio State University President Ted Carter addressed the Trump administration's investigation into the university for alleged antisemitic practices and its diversity policies. Carter stated he is not under significant pressure, believing the inclusion on the list is a holdover from a previous administration, and expressed confidence in the university's actions during campus protests. He highlighted that Ohio State has avoided major encampments and that federal research funding, a significant source of revenue, has seen only minor impacts compared to other institutions. Carter emphasized the university's commitment to academic freedom and its vital role in workforce development for the state of Ohio.</p>

          <p>German soccer champions Bayern Munich have reached an agreement with Liverpool to sign Colombian forward Luis Diaz in a deal valued at approximately £65.5 million, including add-ons. The 28-year-old player was left out of a recent pre-season friendly due to the transfer speculation and has been granted permission to complete his medical. Diaz joined Liverpool in January 2022 and has been a key player, scoring 41 goals in 148 appearances and contributing significantly to their Premier League title win last season. His departure comes as Liverpool looks to refresh its forward line with new summer signings.</p>

          <p>Warner Bros. Discovery is celebrating a significant box office success as two of its major films, "Superman" and "F1," have each grossed over $500 million worldwide. The achievement is particularly notable for "Superman," as it marks the first major release under the new leadership of DC Studios, which is implementing a long-term plan to revitalize its cinematic universe. For Apple, which produced "F1," the film's success represents its highest-grossing theatrical release to date, underscoring the value of its strategic partnership with IMAX. This dual success provides a major boost to both studios amidst a competitive market.</p>

          <p>U.S. President Donald Trump met with European Commission President Ursula von der Leyen at his Turnberry resort in Scotland for critical trade discussions. Trump expressed a 50-50 chance of striking what he termed the "biggest deal" ever between the U.S. and the EU, a sentiment echoed by von der Leyen. The talks are occurring under the shadow of a potential trade war, with Trump threatening 30% tariffs on EU goods if an agreement is not reached. The meeting took place amid a significant security presence and some local protests against his visit. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>Disney and Marvel's "Fantastic Four: First Steps" achieved a successful box office opening, earning an estimated $118 million in North America and $218 million globally. This strong debut is seen as a positive sign for Marvel, which has faced inconsistent box office results and critical reception for its post-"Endgame" films. The movie's success, alongside the recent strong opening for DC's "Superman," suggests that well-made superhero films can still draw large audiences, countering narratives of "superhero fatigue." The film's positive reception reinforces Disney's strategy of focusing on quality over quantity.</p>

          <p>Sources indicate that the United States and China are poised to extend their current tariff truce for an additional 90 days during trade negotiations in Stockholm. The original 90-day suspension of most tariffs was set to expire in August. While the extension will prevent an immediate escalation of the trade war, insiders do not expect major breakthroughs on key sticking points, such as U.S. concerns over China's industrial overcapacity. The Chinese delegation is also expected to press the U.S. for more clarity on the conditions required to ease tariffs related to fentanyl trafficking. (not investment advice)</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>A new savings vehicle, dubbed the 'Trump IRA,' has been established to encourage saving for children under 18, allowing for annual contributions of up to $5,000. This article analyzes the plan, noting that while a one-time $1,000 government contribution for newborns is a nice bonus, other existing strategies may be more effective for long-term savings. The author suggests that 529 education savings plans and custodial Roth IRAs offer greater flexibility and tax advantages for goals like education and retirement. Furthermore, the article recommends considering whole life insurance policies for children as a way to lock in low premiums and build cash value over time. (not investment advice)</p>

          <h2>Study Reveals Four-Day Workweek Boosts Happiness by Increasing Effectiveness</h2>
          <div class="timestamp">2025-07-27 09:35:01 EDT</div>
        </div>
        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Research into the four-day workweek reveals that the resulting boost in employee happiness stems from more than just having an extra day off. According to lead researcher Juliet Schor, a key factor is that employees feel more effective and productive at their jobs. By condensing their work into fewer hours, teams are motivated to eliminate busywork, streamline processes, and focus on high-impact tasks, leading to a greater sense of accomplishment. This feeling of being on top of their work reduces stress and improves overall well-being, demonstrating that the benefits of a shorter week are experienced both in and out of the office.</p>
