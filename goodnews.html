          <p>Operation Guardian Angel, launched by U.S. Attorney Bill Essayli, seeks to force sanctuary cities to comply with federal immigration laws. The program targets illegal aliens with prior deportations by obtaining federal criminal warrants for felony re-entry. This allows ICE to take custody of these individuals despite sanctuary policies that limit cooperation with federal authorities. The operation has already resulted in arrests, and it is expected to continue removing criminal illegal aliens. The strategy aims to restore enforcement power wrongfully taken by sanctuary states.</p>

          <p>The architects of Pride celebrations across the United States met six-figure challenges this year, owing to a corporate exodus in the spring that diminished their sponsorship funds, which they said would jeopardize future programming. Organizers are contending with serious budget shortfalls as Pride Month begins, and several reported 20% to 30% less corporate support than in past years. The show will go on this summer, they said, but what happens next is less certain. Several brands that stepped back from Pride partnerships in San Francisco have done the same in other cities.</p>

          <p>President Trump threatened to end government subsidies and contracts for Elon Musk's companies amid a public feud, raising questions about the future of SpaceX and Tesla. SpaceX is crucial to the U.S. space program and national security, making it difficult to cancel contracts. Tesla, a major electric vehicle company, has also benefited from federal support, which could change under Trump's policies. Experts believe that ending federal programs would not severely damage Tesla but could affect Musk's wealth. Despite the feud, some analysts believe Musk will continue to thrive.</p>

          <p>Chinese scientists have developed a new radar technology that enables aircraft to detect moving targets without emitting radar signals. The innovation, called ‚Äúspace-time decoupling two-channel clutter cancellation method,‚Äù allows a silent aircraft to passively gather echoes. This technology overcomes the challenge of detecting moving targets amidst clutter from land, sea, or buildings. The new system promises crystal clear detection of moving vehicles in complex environments, potentially enhancing surveillance and reconnaissance capabilities.</p>

          <p>Energy Secretary Ed Miliband announced that most new build homes in England will be required to have solar panels fitted. The regulations, part of the Future Homes Standard, aim to improve energy efficiency and reduce carbon emissions. The Home Builders Federation supports the move but cautions against burdensome paperwork. The government aims to reduce carbon emissions and meet its net-zero target by 2050. The regulations will save the typical household ¬£500 a year on their energy bills.</p>

          <p>Builders will be required to fit solar panels to the "vast majority" of new build homes in England under changes to be published this year, Energy Secretary Ed Miliband has said. The regulations will require developers to add panels unless the buildings fall under certain exemptions such as being covered by shade. Speaking to the BBC, Miliband said the move was "just common sense" adding that solar panels would save the typical household ¬£500 a year on their energy bills. The rules will be included in the Future Homes Standard, which will detail a wider plan for improving energy efficiency and reducing carbon emissions.</p>

          <p>India's central bank delivered a 50-point cut to its benchmark policy rate, bringing it to 5.5%, the lowest since August 2022. RBI Governor Sanjay Malhotra cited softened inflation and lower-than-expected growth amidst global uncertainty as reasons for the move. The decision followed better-than-expected GDP growth in the fiscal fourth quarter. The central bank revised its inflation outlook to 3.7% for the current financial year. The RBI will shift its monetary policy stance to "neutral" from "accommodative."</p>

          <p>The government has banned six water companies from paying bonuses to senior executives due to failure to meet environmental and consumer standards. The measures apply to companies that do not meet standards, are not financially resilient, or have been convicted of a criminal offense. The regulator, Ofwat, can force firms to claw back bonuses or face enforcement action. Environment Secretary Steve Reed stated that the public is furious over bonuses for water firm bosses despite sewage spills and rising bills. The ban is part of new measures in the Water Act.</p>
