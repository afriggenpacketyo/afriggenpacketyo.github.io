        </div>
        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>The Montana Supreme Court upheld a lower court's decision that several state laws restricting abortion access are unconstitutional, including a ban after 20 weeks of gestation. The ruling cited the state constitution's "right to be left alone" and access to abortions, unaffected by the U.S. Supreme Court's decision overturning Roe v. Wade. The challenged laws also included restrictions on telehealth prescriptions for abortion medication and a 24-hour waiting period. An anti-abortion group has filed a lawsuit challenging the voter-approved initiative that enshrined abortion rights in the Montana Constitution, claiming voters were not given ample time to review the full text of the initiative.</p>

          <p>China is increasing its support for the private sector, as the head of the National Development and Reform Commission (NDRC) met with tech industry representatives to gather input for Beijing‚Äôs next five-year development plan. The NDRC emphasized the crucial role private enterprises can play in technological innovation and developing new quality productive forces. Since the beginning of the year, the Chinese government has adopted a more private-sector-friendly approach, including a high-level meeting between President Xi Jinping and business leaders, and a new private sector law promising fairer market competition and stronger legal protections.</p>

          <p>New guidelines from the Chinese government could allow Hong Kong-listed companies to seek secondary share listings in Shenzhen, potentially expanding their reach on the mainland and encouraging more Hong Kong share offerings. The guidelines permit mainland companies with Hong Kong-listed shares to issue yuan-denominated shares on the Shenzhen Stock Exchange, reversing the existing A + H pathway. This opportunity would diversify fundraising options for businesses within the Greater Bay Area and could also tempt more businesses to list in Hong Kong, as a single application could allow them to offer shares in both markets.</p>

          <p>South Korea's military has suspended its loudspeaker propaganda broadcasts across the border to North Korea in an effort to "restore trust" between the two countries. This move comes after the election of new president Lee Jae-myung, who campaigned on improving inter-Korean relations. Pyongyang views the broadcasts as an act of war and has previously threatened to destroy the loudspeakers. While organizations advocating for North Korean human rights have criticized the suspension, residents along the border have welcomed the move, complaining about the noise from both sides.</p>

          <p>Japanese Prime Minister Shigeru Ishiba plans to call on G7 nations to collaborate in tackling North Korea's cryptocurrency thefts at their upcoming summit in Canada. This decision arises from allegations that North Korea is using illicitly obtained virtual assets to fund its weapons development. Japan also seeks to strengthen collaboration with European nations supporting Ukraine, given Pyongyang's strengthening ties with Moscow in the military domain. Additionally, the G7 countries are considering establishing a task force to review tax exemptions on cross-border e-commerce involving small parcels, aiming to address the strain on customs processing and provide protection to domestic businesses.</p>
