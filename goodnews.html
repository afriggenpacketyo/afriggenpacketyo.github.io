          <p>Disney is raising prices for its streaming packages, including Disney+, Hulu, and ESPN bundles, effective October 21. The ad-supported Disney+ plan will increase to $11.99 monthly, while the premium ad-free option will rise to $18.99. This move follows a similar price hike in October 2024 and comes as the company faces public scrutiny over its handling of "Jimmy Kimmel Live!" after the host's controversial comments. Disney anticipates a modest increase in subscribers despite the price adjustments and recent backlash.</p>

          <p>Following President Trump's warnings against using acetaminophen during pregnancy, this article examines the scientific evidence regarding its potential link to autism. While some studies have suggested an association, larger and more controlled research, including a major Swedish study analyzing siblings, found no causal link, attributing the correlation to other factors like genetics or infections. Medical groups emphasize that untreated fever and pain during pregnancy pose known risks to both mother and child, making acetaminophen one of the few safe options available. Experts advise parents to consult their physicians rather than making decisions based on political statements or inconclusive research.</p>

        </div>
        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Following the Federal Reserve's recent interest rate cut, the monthly payments for home equity loans have slightly decreased, making them a more affordable borrowing option for homeowners. For a $40,000 loan, a 10-year term now costs approximately $494 per month, while a 15-year term is around $389, both lower than costs earlier in the year. The article contrasts these fixed-rate loans with variable-rate Home Equity Lines of Credit (HELOCs), which currently offer slightly lower initial payments but carry the risk of future rate increases. Homeowners are advised to weigh the benefits of current rates against the possibility of further cuts. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>At the United Nations General Assembly, Brazilian President Luiz Inácio Lula da Silva delivered a speech criticizing Washington's trade tariffs and military actions while advocating for closer ties with China. Despite the sharp rebuke, U.S. President Donald Trump extended an olive branch moments later, proposing a meeting for the following week. Trump told reporters that he and Lula had "excellent chemistry" during a brief encounter after the speech. The exchange marks a surprising diplomatic opening amid ongoing tensions between the two nations.</p>

          <p>President Donald Trump stated his belief that Ukraine has the potential to win back all territory seized by Russia since the invasion began. In a social media post following a meeting with Ukraine's leader at the United Nations, Trump suggested that with continued support from Europe and NATO, Ukraine could restore its original borders. He criticized Russia's military strategy as "aimless" and argued that Moscow's economic troubles present an opportune moment for Ukraine to act. Trump also affirmed that the U.S. will continue supplying weapons to NATO for the alliance to use as it sees fit.</p>

          <p>Fifty years after her song "Lovin' You" topped the charts, the legacy of singer Minnie Riperton is being honored with a tribute concert at the Hollywood Bowl featuring artists like Stevie Wonder. Riperton, known for her five-octave vocal range and famous "whistle register," died of breast cancer in 1979 at age 31, cutting short a promising career. Despite her brief time in the spotlight, her influence persists, with her music being sampled by hip-hop artists and covered by contemporary singers. Colleagues and family, including her husband Richard Rudolph and friend Stevie Wonder, reflect on her unique talent for blending sweetness and earthiness in her music.</p>

The final contenders include past winner Kiran Desai, previous nominees Andrew Miller and David Szalay, and a trio of American authors: Susan Choi, Katie Kitamura, and Ben Markovits. Parker described the process of eliminating books as "real agony" but also a "privilege," highlighting the excitement of reading highly anticipated novels before their public release.

          <p>A bull moose was successfully rescued after falling into a 9-foot-deep abandoned well on a family's property in Pembroke, Maine. The family discovered the animal when they saw its antlers sticking out of the ground and alerted the state's wildlife department. In a five-hour operation, a biologist sedated the moose, and wardens used straps and an excavator provided by the family to carefully lift it to safety. After the sedative wore off, the moose ran off into the woods, seemingly unharmed. The family, who was unaware of the well's existence, has since capped it to prevent future accidents.</p>

Officials from the U.K. and Australia also issued statements advising the public to disregard Trump's medical claims.

          <p>England's squad for the upcoming Ashes series in Australia features what is being described as its most hostile group of fast bowlers in decades, signaling a clear strategic shift for the tour. The attack, led by Mark Wood and Jofra Archer, aims to counter Australia's traditional pace advantage on home soil. Key concerns remain over the fitness of several bowlers and captain Ben Stokes, whose presence is considered crucial for any chance of success. The batting lineup is seen as a strength, with Joe Root, unburdened by captaincy, expected to play a pivotal role in a series that could define the "Bazball" era.</p>

          <p>Major League Baseball's competition committee has approved the implementation of an Automated Ball/Strike (ABS) system, commonly known as "robot umpires," starting in the 2026 season. The system will function as a challenge mechanism, with human umpires still calling balls and strikes on the field. Each team will receive two challenges per game, which they can use to have a call reviewed by the Hawk-Eye camera technology, with the result displayed on stadium videoboards. The move aims to improve accuracy and is expected to reduce ejections, as over 60% of them in recent seasons were related to disputes over ball and strike calls.</p>

          <p>This article explains the "Medigap birthday rule," a state-specific provision that allows Medicare beneficiaries an annual window to switch their supplemental insurance plans without medical underwriting. Typically, after the initial open enrollment period, seniors with pre-existing conditions can be denied new coverage or charged higher premiums. In the roughly 18 states with a birthday rule, individuals can switch to a Medigap plan with equal or lesser benefits around their birthday each year, regardless of their health status. This rule provides financial flexibility and allows seniors to find more affordable or suitable coverage as their needs and the market change.</p>

          <p>With recent interest rate cuts by the Federal Reserve, the cost of borrowing through a Home Equity Line of Credit (HELOC) has become more affordable for homeowners. A $60,000 HELOC with a 10-year repayment period now has an approximate monthly payment of $730, based on current average rates. The article highlights that HELOCs have a variable interest rate, which is advantageous in a declining rate environment as payments can decrease without refinancing. This flexibility, combined with the fact that borrowers only pay interest on the amount they use, makes HELOCs an attractive option. (not investment advice)</p>
