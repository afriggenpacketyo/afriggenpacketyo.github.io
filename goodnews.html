          <p>Cambodia has called on Thailand to release 20 of its soldiers who were captured hours after a ceasefire was declared, intended to halt deadly border clashes. The truce, which appears to be holding, followed five days of fighting that killed at least 43 people and was brokered after pressure from the United States. The Thai government stated the detained soldiers are being treated humanely and will be returned once the border situation stabilizes. The conflict stems from a long-standing dispute over ancient temples along the shared border, with both nations now navigating a fragile peace.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>This opinion article from Fox News argues that President Donald Trump has successfully weakened established liberal media outlets. The author cites recent developments such as the defunding of NPR and PBS, the departure of Stephen Colbert from late-night television, and staff buyouts at The Washington Post as evidence of Trump's victory over his media adversaries. The piece contends that unlike previous Republican presidents, Trump has been willing to directly confront and fight back against what he perceives as biased coverage. The article also credits Trump's use of alternative media and his administration's policy successes for diminishing the influence of traditional news organizations.</p>

          <p>Writer Suleika Jaouad's new book, "The Book of Alchemy," explores how keeping a daily journal can be a transformative practice. Jaouad, who started the online community The Isolation Journals, explains that journaling helped her navigate her battle with leukemia and the subsequent pandemic. She advocates for a process of alchemy, where one transforms the raw material of daily life into new perspectives and self-understanding through writing. To overcome writer's block, she suggests reading passages from other writers' diaries and using structured prompts, emphasizing consistency and a low barrier to entry to build a meaningful practice.</p>

          <p>British and Irish Lions coach Andy Farrell has made two changes to the starting lineup for the final Test against Australia in Sydney. Blair Kinghorn will replace James Lowe on the wing, and James Ryan comes in for Ollie Chessum at lock, joining a squad aiming for a historic 3-0 series sweep. Farrell emphasized the team's cohesion and desire, noting that a series whitewash "would mean the world." The Wallabies will be without key players Rob Valetini and Allan Alaalatoa due to injuries, while scrum-half Nic White will start in his final international match.</p>

The company also confirmed it will continue its shareholder return program with another $3.5 billion in share buybacks over the next three months. CEO Wael Sawan expressed satisfaction with the performance amid a challenging macroeconomic environment. The strong results follow Shell's strategic update in March, which prioritized shareholder returns, cost savings, and a focus on its liquefied natural gas (LNG) business to create value.

          <p>Jamie Cureton, who made his Premier League debut in 1994, is preparing for his 32nd consecutive season as a footballer as he approaches his 50th birthday. Currently the player-manager for eighth-tier club Cambridge City, Cureton has played for 22 different clubs across nine levels of English football and has made over 1,000 official appearances. He says football is all he has ever known and that being involved in the game keeps him happy and sane. Cureton, who is just a few goals shy of 400 in his career, hopes to make at least one appearance after turning 50 in August.</p>

          <p>This article profiles American cyclist Matteo Jorgenson and his crucial role as a domestique, or support rider, for his team at the Tour de France. Despite battling bronchitis, Jorgenson repeatedly exhausted himself in selfless efforts to support his team leader, Jonas Vingegaard, against the dominant Tadej Pogačar. While Vingegaard's bid for the overall victory was unsuccessful, Jorgenson's persistent attacks on the final stage in Paris were instrumental in setting up his teammate Wout van Aert for a prestigious stage win. The piece highlights the unglamorous but vital sacrifices made by support riders in professional cycling.</p>

          <p>OpenAI is partnering on a new Stargate-branded AI data center in northern Norway, its first such project in Europe. The facility, a joint venture between British firm Nscale and Norwegian energy company Aker, will run entirely on renewable hydropower. OpenAI will be an "off-taker," buying capacity from the data center, which aims to house 100,000 Nvidia GPUs by the end of 2026, making it one of Europe's largest. The project aligns with Europe's push for "sovereign AI," which requires data to be processed on European soil, and aims to address the continent's shortage of large-scale computing infrastructure.</p>

          <p>The United States and Pakistan have struck a trade agreement that includes a partnership to develop Pakistan's oil reserves and will result in lower tariffs on its exports to the US. The deal was announced by US President Donald Trump, who said an American oil company would be chosen to lead the development effort. This agreement averts a potential 29% tariff that Pakistan was facing from the US. The development comes as Washington imposes a 25% tariff on India, with Trump criticizing India's own high tariffs and its trade with Russia.</p>

          <p>Malaysian airlines, including budget carrier AirAsia and the new airline Air Borneo, are expressing interest in China's domestically produced C919 passenger jet. According to Malaysia's transport minister, the growing demand for air travel in Southeast Asia, combined with long delivery backlogs from Airbus and Boeing, is driving this interest. China is actively promoting its Comac-built aircraft as a more readily available and cheaper alternative to the dominant Western manufacturers. This move reflects a broader trend of airlines in the region seeking to diversify their fleets and secure aircraft more quickly.</p>

          <p>Canada and Malta have announced they will formally recognize the state of Palestine in September, joining a growing number of Western nations applying pressure for a two-state solution to the Israeli-Palestinian conflict. The announcements were made at a UN General Assembly meeting, following similar pledges from France and the United Kingdom. Canadian Prime Minister Mark Carney stated the intention is predicated on the Palestinian Authority holding elections in which Hamas plays no part. Israel and the U.S. boycotted the meeting, with Israel's ambassador criticizing the move as legitimizing terrorism.</p>

          <p>Australia's plan for a national ban on social media for users under 16 is generating debate over its potential to address youth mental health issues. The government argues the ban is a necessary response to a crisis fueled by platforms like TikTok and Instagram, but some experts are skeptical. Critics point to a lack of research proving a direct causal link between social media use and poor mental health, suggesting the ban is an overly simple solution to a complex problem. They also note that social media can provide valuable community for some young people and that prohibition may not be the best way to prepare them for a technologically saturated world.</p>

          <p>Auction house Sotheby's has returned a set of sacred jewels, believed to be linked to the Buddha's remains, to India following intense pressure from the Indian government and global Buddhist leaders. The Piprahwa Gems, unearthed in 1898, were scheduled for auction but the sale was canceled after diplomatic intervention. The Mumbai-based Godrej Industries Group acquired the relics, facilitating their return for permanent public display in India. The planned auction had sparked a significant ethical debate over whether sacred objects, particularly those associated with human remains, should be treated as commercial commodities.</p>

          <p>Shares of South Korean shipbuilder Hanwha Ocean surged over 16% following the announcement of a trade deal between the U.S. and South Korea. The deal establishes a blanket 15% tariff on South Korean exports, a more favorable outcome than many feared. Hanwha Group's vice chairman was part of the delegation lobbying in Washington, and the company is expected to expand its operations at the Philly Shipyard in the U.S. The stock surge was also supported by the company's strong second-quarter operating profits and new order announcements, positioning it competitively against global rivals.
