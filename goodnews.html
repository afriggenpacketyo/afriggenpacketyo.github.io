          <p>Marine biologists with the Tennessee Valley Authority are surveying fish populations in Douglas Lake for the first time since Hurricane Helene caused debris to cover East Tennessee waterways. The study aims to determine the hurricane's impact on sport fish populations by comparing current data with surveys from the last 30 years. Scientists are examining fish for defects, measuring, and weighing them after shocking the water to temporarily stun them. The findings will help assess any disruptions in shoreline habitat, which is crucial for fish spawning and feeding, and the cleanup on Douglas Lake is about 90% complete.</p>

Without mentioning President Trump, Koch made oblique references to his tariffs and other policies, which are at odds with libertarian values. Koch's political group has announced a $20 million campaign to encourage the renewal of Trump's 2017 tax cuts, but he has previously expressed disagreements with the president. Koch emphasized the importance of principles amid change, chaos, and conflict, warning that freedoms are lost when principles are abandoned.</p>

          <p>Japan's average unemployment rate in fiscal 2024 fell to 2.5 percent, marking the first improvement in two years amid a labor shortage. The number of unemployed people decreased, while the number of those with jobs grew to the highest level since 1953. The job availability ratio decreased slightly but remained above 1.00, indicating a tight labor market. An economist at the Daiwa Institute of Research noted that the labor shortage persists and is likely to continue.

          <p>Amazon reported slower than expected growth in its North American retail business, contributing to overall sales growth that was the slowest since the pandemic.

Amazon added "tariff and trade policies" to the list of factors that could make its forecasts uncertain. CEO Andy Jassy said the company is focused on keeping prices down by purchasing extra inventory in advance of tariffs and helping sellers on Amazon's marketplace do the same.

          <p>The article argues that the US focus on "beating China" is misguided and that the US needs to stop "beating itself." It emphasizes the importance of aligning purpose, goal, and means in strategy, coupled with a deep understanding of the adversary. The author criticizes the lack of coherent purpose, goal, or strategy in Washington's approach to the trade conflict with China. The piece suggests that the US should focus on its own strengths and address its internal weaknesses rather than solely focusing on competition with China.</p>
