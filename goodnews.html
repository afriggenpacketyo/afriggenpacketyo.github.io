          <p>Following a procedural failure in the House, former President Trump met with Republican holdouts, successfully persuading them to support a package of cryptocurrency-related bills. The legislation, including the GENIUS Act for stablecoin regulation, had initially been blocked by 13 Republicans. This reversal highlights Trump's significant influence over the party, as the bills are now expected to pass. The initial failure caused a temporary dip in the stock prices of crypto-related companies like Coinbase and Circle. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>At a summit in Pittsburgh, former President Trump announced that 20 leading technology and energy companies will invest over $90 billion in Pennsylvania. The initiative aims to develop a new artificial intelligence economy by leveraging the state's energy resources to power data centers and establish an innovation hub for worker training. The announcement, which included plans for new nuclear reactors and a partnership between Nippon Steel and U.S. Steel, was met with protests concerning its focus on corporate interests and fossil fuels.</p>

          <p>The Pentagon has announced the release of 2,000 California National Guard members from their federal deployment in Los Angeles, which began over a month ago amid protests. President Trump had federalized the troops against the wishes of Governor Gavin Newsom to address unrest related to immigration enforcement. While the administration claims the move is due to subsiding "lawlessness," Newsom criticized the deployment as political and called for the remaining 2,000 troops to also be sent home.</p>

          <p>The House is considering the Genius Act, a bipartisan bill that aims to establish a regulatory framework for stablecoins, a type of cryptocurrency pegged to stable assets like the U.S. dollar. This legislation could enable banks and credit unions to issue their own stablecoins, potentially making them a more mainstream payment method. Proponents argue that regulated stablecoins offer faster and cheaper transactions, while critics point to risks such as the potential for "depegging" from their underlying asset, as seen during the 2023 banking turmoil.

          <p>In an article published in a leading Communist Party journal, Chinese President Xi Jinping reiterated his country's commitment to economic globalization and free trade. He spoke out against unilateral sanctions and the construction of trade barriers, positioning China as a defender of open markets in contrast to rising protectionist sentiments globally. Xi emphasized China's adherence to promoting trade and investment liberalization while rejecting what he termed "maximum pressure" tactics, advocating instead for an inclusive and multilateral economic system.</p>

          <p>An article in the People's Daily, the Communist Party's official newspaper, has urged China's local governments to utilize their legislative powers to stimulate economic and social development. Since 2015, more Chinese cities have been empowered to draft their own laws on issues like urban development and environmental protection. The state media piece argues that tailored local legislation creates a stable and predictable legal framework, which is crucial for fostering a healthy business environment and shifting governance from direct orders to rule-of-law principles.</p>

          <p>In a pioneering effort, marine scientists are crossbreeding Elkhorn coral from Honduras with Florida's native populations to help restore the state's struggling reef system. Over 95% of Florida's Elkhorn coral has been lost due to warming oceans and disease, threatening coastal protection. By introducing genetic diversity from the more resilient Honduran corals, which thrive in tougher conditions, researchers hope the new "Flonduran" hybrid will be better equipped to survive future marine heatwaves. This marks the first time an international cross of corals has been permitted for outplanting on wild reefs.</p>

          <p>The Los Angeles Chargers have revealed two new alternate uniforms for the upcoming NFL season: an all-gold "Charger Power" look and a navy blue "Super Chargers" throwback. The gold uniform, a first for the team on the field, has generated mixed reactions online, with comparisons ranging from the Minions to mustard bottles. The navy blue set is a modern take on the uniforms worn during the team's only Super Bowl appearance in the 1990s. The team will also have the option to pair their regular jerseys with powder blue pants.</p>

As part of the deal, Indonesia has committed to significant purchases from the U.S., including $15 billion in energy, $4.5 billion in agricultural products, and 50 Boeing aircraft. The pact was finalized after a call between Trump and Indonesian President Prabowo Subianto. This deal is one of several the administration has pursued to renegotiate trade relationships and address perceived unfair practices. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>A growing number of central banks, particularly in Africa and Latin America, are buying gold directly from local mines instead of on the international market, according to the World Gold Council. This strategy allows them to bolster their reserves using local currency, thereby preserving foreign exchange assets like the U.S. dollar. The practice is also seen as a way to support domestic mining industries and acquire gold at a potential discount, though it can present challenges if the country lacks certified refining capabilities.

His conviction was overturned in 2021 after a review by the D.A.'s Conviction Integrity Unit, and he was declared factually innocent in 2022.

          <p>An independent review of the UK's National Health Service has recommended that physician associates (PAs) and anaesthesia associates (AAs) should have their titles changed to "assistants." The recommendation aims to reduce patient confusion and clarify the distinction between these roles and fully qualified doctors. The review also suggests that associates should wear standardized uniforms and not be responsible for diagnosing patients. This follows concerns raised by doctors' unions and the families of patients who died after being treated by PAs they believed were doctors.</p>

The 175-year-old Victorian glasshouse, which houses a tropical rainforest collection, has suffered from the hot, humid conditions inside. The ambitious renovation will involve replacing 16,000 panes of glass, repairing the ironwork, and moving 1,300 plants, including a 250-year-old cycad. A key goal of the project is to upgrade the heating system to make the building net-zero in emissions.</p>

The advert for the magnesium-infused drink also referenced other "calming" ingredients like L-theanine and ashwagandha. The watchdog ruled that these claims, which implied the drink could alleviate anxiety, were not on the approved register of health claims for food products and must not appear again.
