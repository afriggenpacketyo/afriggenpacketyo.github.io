          <p>OpenAI has launched an "Instant Checkout" feature within ChatGPT, allowing users to make direct purchases of products recommended by the AI bot without navigating outside the application. This new tool currently facilitates transactions with U.S. Etsy sellers and will soon expand to include over one million Shopify merchants, such as Glossier and SKIMS, through a partnership. This development marks ChatGPT's significant entry into "agentic commerce," positioning the AI as a personal shopping agent that streamlines the buying process and generates a small fee for OpenAI from completed transactions. The technology, co-developed with payment processor Stripe, currently supports single-item purchases and is designed to adapt to how consumers discover products in AI conversations.</p>

          <p>OpenAI has rolled out new parental control features for ChatGPT, enabling parents to link their accounts with those of their teenagers to ensure a safer and more age-appropriate experience. These controls automatically restrict various types of content, including graphic material, viral challenges, and sexual or violent role-play, while also providing parents with notifications if their child exhibits potential signs of self-harm. This implementation follows mounting public pressure and a wrongful death lawsuit involving a teenager. The article notes that while these guardrails are not entirely foolproof, they signify OpenAI's continuous commitment to enhancing safety for younger users.</p>

          <p>Europe secured a Ryder Cup victory, with a final score of 15-13, despite a strong Sunday comeback from the U.S. team. The article argues that Europe's win exposed significant shortcomings in the U.S. team's culture, planning, and strategy, which are deemed vastly inferior to their European counterparts. Captain Luke Donald's collective approach and a stacked European backroom team, including statistical wizards, were credited for their dominance in the initial days. In contrast, U.S. Captain Keegan Bradley admitted mistakes in course setup and faced criticism for a self-centered approach, highlighting a fundamental difference in team dynamics.</p>

The legislation mandates reporting incidents like cyberattacks or unsafe autonomous AI behavior to the state's Office of Emergency Services, with potential civil penalties of up to $1 million for violations.

          <p>A year after Hurricane Helene caused devastating and deadly flooding in eastern Tennessee, a group of former whitewater raft guides has transitioned to "professional trash ladies" and cleanup crews on the Nolichucky River. The river, a popular rafting destination, remains closed due to extensive debris and damage, forcing outfitters to reinvent their businesses. State-funded relief grants now enable these guides to clear railroad tracks, house chunks, and hazardous materials from the riverbanks. Despite the challenges, the community sees this destruction as an opportunity for rebirth and reconnection, with hopes for the river to reopen for the 2026 season.</p>
