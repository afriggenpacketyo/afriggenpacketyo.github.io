          <p>Kosmos-482, a Soviet spacecraft intended for Venus in 1972 but stranded in Earth's orbit due to a rocket booster malfunction, has re-entered the atmosphere and splashed down in the Indian Ocean. The event serves as a reminder of the Cold War era's ambitious space exploration efforts, particularly the Soviet Union's Venera program, which aimed to study Venus. While the US focused on Mars, the Soviets achieved significant milestones with Venus, including the first probes to enter its atmosphere and transmit data from its surface. Although space law dictates ownership of crashed objects remains with the launching country, the Soviets did not claim debris found in New Zealand shortly after the failed launch. Today, space debris and re-entries are increasingly common due to increased space activity.</p>

          <p>A 4.1-magnitude earthquake in Tennessee was felt across several southern states, including Georgia and North Carolina, on Saturday morning. The quake's epicenter was located near Greenback, Tennessee, about 30 miles south of Knoxville. While no injuries or major damage were immediately reported, the USGS received over 23,000 reports from the public within the first hour after the event. The southeastern US is known to have earthquake risk, particularly in the New Madrid and Eastern Tennessee seismic zones. Residents as far away as Atlanta reported feeling tremors, and officials noted that earthquakes in the eastern US are typically felt over a larger distance due to the region's geology.</p>

          <p>General Motors is recalling 597,630 of its full-size trucks and SUVs in the U.S. because of manufacturing defects in the connecting rod and/or crankshaft engine components, which can lead to unexpected engine failure and increase the risk of a crash. The recall, which includes models from 2021-2024 like Cadillac Escalade, Chevrolet Silverado 1500, and GMC Sierra 1500, comes amid an investigation by auto safety regulators following complaints of engine failure in GM vehicles. Dealers will inspect and repair or replace the engine free of charge, with owner notification letters scheduled to be mailed on June 9, 2025. This recall follows a previous one in November where GM recalled nearly 462,000 diesel-engine SUVs and pickup trucks due to a faulty transmission control valve.</p>

Their dominance was evident in their perfect record against other top-four teams, securing six wins out of six matches. The team's ability to find ways to win even when performances weren't at their best underscores their achievement in a highly competitive league.</p>

          <p>The German government will no longer publish details of its military aid to Ukraine, according to Chancellor Friedrich Merz, citing the need for "strategic ambiguity" to prevent Russia from gaining strategic advantages. This decision follows initial sporadic reporting on military aid, which later became a regularly updated list due to pressure from parliamentarians and media. Merz, who recently assumed office, emphasized that Germany's commitment to supporting Ukraine against Russia's invasion remains unchanged, with continued financial support promised. This shift aims to remove discussions about specific weapons systems from the public domain.</p>

          <p>In an excerpt from his memoir "Who Knew," media executive Barry Diller emphasizes the importance of instinct over data in making creative and business decisions. He argues that relying solely on research and data can stifle creativity and narrow perspectives, while simple human instinct can be a better predictor of success. Diller recounts his experiences with ABC's "Movie of the Week," where gut feelings about titles and stories led to successful projects like "Brian's Song" and "The Night Stalker." He warns against overtraining on data, suggesting that it can hinder the ability to recognize a good idea and make common sense judgments.</p>
