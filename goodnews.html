        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>A late goal from Gabriel Martinelli allowed Arsenal to salvage a 1-1 draw against Manchester City, dealing a blow to both teams' Premier League title ambitions. After Erling Haaland gave City an early lead, manager Pep Guardiola adopted an unusually defensive 5-5-0 formation in the second half to protect the advantage. This tactic, which resulted in City's lowest-ever possession statistic under Guardiola, nearly succeeded until Martinelli's equalizer in stoppage time. The result leaves league leaders Liverpool as the primary beneficiaries, extending their lead at the top of the table.</p>

          <p>The UK's Transport Secretary has officially approved a £2.2 billion plan for a second runway at London Gatwick Airport, a move the government says will foster economic growth. The project involves converting the airport's existing northern runway for regular use, which could increase annual flights from 280,000 to nearly 389,000. While the airport projects a significant boost in jobs and passenger capacity, the expansion faces strong opposition. Climate campaigners and local groups have raised serious concerns about the environmental impact, including increased noise and carbon emissions from the additional air traffic.</p>

          <p>Citizens across Brazil participated in widespread protests against legislative measures that could pardon former President Jair Bolsonaro and his allies convicted for a 2023 coup attempt. The demonstrations were fueled by the lower house fast-tracking a bill that could grant amnesty for the uprising, which included plots against his successor and a Supreme Court judge. Prominent cultural figures, including music legends Caetano Veloso and Chico Buarque, joined the protests to voice their opposition. The events highlight the deep political divisions that persist in Brazil following Bolsonaro's presidency and subsequent conviction.</p>

Trump also mentioned that Oracle's Larry Ellison and Dell's Michael Dell are likely participants in the American-led consortium.

          <p>England secured a 2-0 series victory over Ireland in their first-ever T20 series, winning the final match by six wickets. After Ireland set a target of 155, England's chase was anchored by Jordan Cox, who scored a crucial 55 runs despite a minor knee injury sustained while fielding. The English spinners, led by Adil Rashid's three wickets, were effective in restricting the Irish batting lineup on a slow pitch. The comfortable win in Malahide capped a successful series for the visiting English side, with Tom Banton hitting the winning runs with 17 balls to spare.</p>

          <p>London Mayor Sadiq Khan initiated a one-day trial to ban vehicle traffic from a major section of Oxford Street, expressing his hope to permanently pedestrianize the famous shopping destination. The event, which closed a half-mile stretch of the road to vehicles, is part of a plan to revitalize the area, increase foot traffic, and create a safer, more pleasant environment for shoppers and visitors. While many pedestrians welcomed the change, some local groups and councillors have raised concerns about the potential for traffic congestion on side streets and accessibility issues for people with mobility challenges.</p>

          <p>Conservation group The Big Cat Project has shared remarkable footage showing the raw power of two Amur tigers as they were released back into the wild in Russia. The video shows the massive brother and sister tigers snarling, swatting, and biting at their cage doors just before being set free, a display of their untamed nature. Amur tigers, also known as Siberian tigers, are the largest tiger subspecies and are endangered due to poaching and habitat loss. The footage serves as a powerful reminder of both the majesty and ferocity of these predators.</p>

          <p>U.S. athlete Cole Hocker claimed the gold medal in the men's 5,000-meter final at the World Championships in Tokyo with a stunning final-lap performance. Hocker was in 11th place at the bell but unleashed a devastating kick to surge past the field and win in 12 minutes and 58.30 seconds. The victory provided a sense of vindication for Hocker, who was controversially disqualified from the 1500m semifinals earlier in the competition. He expressed that he felt "robbed" in the earlier race and was determined to end the championships on his own terms.</p>

          <p>European Ryder Cup captain Luke Donald has suggested that the American team could face pressure from its own home crowd at Bethpage due to a controversial decision to pay U.S. players. Each member of the American side will receive a $500,000 payment, while the European team continues to play for free. Donald theorized that if the highly-paid U.S. team underperforms, the New York audience, who are paying high ticket prices, might turn on their own players. He emphasized that the European players are motivated by purpose and tradition, not monetary rewards.</p>

          <p>In an effort to ensure manufacturing quality and avoid high-profile production errors seen elsewhere in the aviation industry, China has developed a futuristic assembly line for its C919 passenger jet. The facility integrates 5G wireless connectivity and advanced networking to create a unified smart system connecting robots, tools, and workers. This "sensing-transmission-control integration" aims to create an intelligent feedback loop that can prevent oversights like missing bolts or tools left inside aircraft. The advanced factory represents a significant step in China's ambitions to become a major player in the global commercial aviation market.</p>

          <p>Nēv Schulman, longtime host of the MTV series "Catfish: The TV Show," is embarking on a new career as a licensed real estate agent in New York City. He says the most valuable skill he's bringing from his television work is the ability to truly listen to people and ask the right questions to help them discover what they really want. Schulman, who grew up in a real estate family, believes this skill is just as applicable to helping someone find a home as it is to uncovering an online relationship. He also notes that his persistence in hitting dead ends on the show has prepared him for the challenges of the competitive real estate market.</p>
