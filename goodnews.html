          <p>India's economy demonstrated resilience by growing at a faster-than-expected annual rate of 7.4% in the March quarter, despite global economic uncertainties. This growth exceeded economists' forecasts and marked the strongest quarterly growth in the fiscal year 2025, contributing to an overall expansion of 6.5% for the entire fiscal year. Strong domestic consumption and a relatively lower dependence on exports have helped insulate India from the impact of U.S. trade policies. While the U.S. has imposed tariffs on Indian goods, negotiations are underway for a potential trade deal, potentially signaling continued economic cooperation between the two nations (not investment advice).</p>

          <p>Amelie Mauresmo, the French Open director, is addressing criticism regarding the scheduling of night sessions, which have predominantly featured men's singles matches. She justifies the choices by suggesting that women's matches tend to be shorter, potentially resulting in a less engaging primetime slot. Mauresmo also cites concerns about late finishes if two matches were scheduled for the night session, as seen in other Grand Slam tournaments. The goal is to balance promoting both men's and women's games while ensuring a satisfactory experience for the audience.</p>

          <p>The Republican nominee for Virginia governor, Winsome Earle-Sears, is attempting to distance herself from her past hardline anti-abortion stance, declining to state whether she would support abortion restrictions if elected. Her record reveals a history of staunch opposition to abortion, including support for a 15-week ban and statements suggesting women consenting to sex are consenting to pregnancy. With Virginians broadly supporting abortion rights, Earle-Sears' shift in tone may be an attempt to appeal to a wider electorate. The election will be closely watched as a barometer of public sentiment on abortion rights.</p>

          <p>Adam Riess, who won the Nobel Prize in Physics for his role in discovering dark energy, is now questioning the standard model of cosmology, the prevailing theory of the universe's origin, evolution, and fate. Riess's work measuring the expansion rate of the universe has revealed a discrepancy, known as the Hubble tension, between local measurements and those extrapolated from the early universe. This tension suggests that the standard model may be incomplete or incorrect, potentially requiring a revision of our understanding of dark energy and the universe's ultimate destiny. While some cosmologists remain skeptical, Riess's challenge has sparked debate and renewed interest in alternative cosmological models.</p>
