          <p>Mark Zuckerberg is aggressively investing in artificial intelligence, demonstrated by Meta's $14.3 billion investment in Scale AI and the hiring of its founder, Alexandr Wang, along with former GitHub CEO Nat Friedman and Daniel Gross. Meta's increased capital expenditures, now between $64 billion and $72 billion, reflect a strategic focus on AI data centers and hardware. The company aims to embed AI across its operations, from online advertising to the metaverse, but recognizes the need to improve its fundamental AI models to compete with industry leaders like Google and OpenAI. Meta's recruitment efforts include offering substantial signing bonuses to attract AI talent, highlighting the competitive landscape for AI expertise.</p>

The two leaders are expected to agree on India's adoption of Japan's next-generation shinkansen bullet train for the Ahmedabad-Mumbai high-speed rail line. The visit will be Modi's first since May 2023, and they intend to strengthen communication before a Quad summit with the United States and Australia.

          <p>The NHS in England is planning to offer DNA testing to all newborn babies to assess their risk of developing hundreds of diseases. This initiative is part of a broader government effort to predict and prevent illness, with ¬£650 million being invested in DNA research for all patients by 2030. The testing will involve sequencing the complete DNA of newborns using umbilical cord blood samples. While the initiative aims to revolutionize prevention and provide faster diagnoses, concerns have been raised about the need for qualified professionals to interpret the data and provide appropriate counseling to patients.</p>

          <p>A military robotics company based in Estonia, Milrem Robotics, has gained valuable insights from the use of its ground robots in Ukraine, leading to changes in its technology. The company's THeMIS model is being used for tasks such as clearing mines, carrying cargo, and evacuating injured soldiers. The experiences in Ukraine have highlighted the need for simpler user interfaces and improved electronic warfare countermeasures. Milrem Robotics is using this feedback to enhance its products and help prepare Europe for potential conflicts with Russia.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Japan's proactive approach to supply chain resilience offers lessons for Western nations facing China's dominance in critical minerals. Following a rare earth export ban by China in 2010, Japan invested heavily in non-China rare-earth projects and implemented strategies such as stockpiling and recycling. As a result, Japan has reduced its dependence on Chinese rare earths to below 60%. The country's experience highlights the importance of diversifying supply chains and investing in alternative technologies to mitigate risks associated with reliance on a single supplier.</p>
