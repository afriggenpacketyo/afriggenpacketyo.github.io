          <h2>FIFA President Pushes for Larger and More Frequent Club World Cup</h2>
          <div class="timestamp">2025-07-15 03:00:50 EDT</div>
        </div>
        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Following the recent Club World Cup, FIFA President Gianni Infantino remains committed to expanding the tournament, despite criticism from players' unions and domestic leagues. The event, which generated significant revenue and saw Chelsea earn a substantial prize, has prompted discussions about increasing the format to 48 teams by 2029. Some clubs, like Real Madrid, have even proposed holding the tournament every two years to maximize commercial opportunities, though FIFA has no immediate plans to do so. While concerns about player welfare and an oversaturated calendar persist, Infantino's vision for a bigger, more lucrative global club competition appears to be gaining momentum among top teams.</p>

          <div class="timestamp">2025-07-15 02:41:23 EDT</div>
        </div>
        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>The UK government is updating its relationships, sex, and health education (RSHE) guidance for schools in England to include lessons on misogyny, consent, and the dangers of online content like "deepfakes." The new curriculum aims to help students identify positive male role models and recognize unhealthy attitudes, including those promoted by online influencers. Unlike a previous draft, the final guidance will not impose strict age limits for topics but will outline what should be taught by the end of primary and secondary school. The changes, which will be fully implemented by September 2026, emphasize proactive engagement with parents, who will have the right to view all curriculum materials.</p>

          <p>Bronny James delivered a strong performance for the Los Angeles Lakers in a Summer League game against the LA Clippers, drawing significant attention from a crowd that included his father, LeBron James, and other sports figures. James scored 17 points on efficient shooting, adding five rebounds and five assists, demonstrating growing confidence on the court. Despite his notable effort, the Clippers ultimately secured a 67-58 victory, led by forward Jordan Miller's 19 points. While the Lakers struggled with shooting and turnovers, coaches praised James for his energy and smart play, highlighting his readiness to contribute whenever he gets minutes on the floor during his rookie season.</p>

          <p>The UK government is introducing a new grant scheme to encourage the adoption of electric vehicles (EVs), offering discounts of up to £3,750 on eligible cars. The £650 million program will apply to vehicles costing up to £37,000 and is part of the government's plan to ban the sale of new petrol and diesel cars by 2030. While the automotive industry has welcomed the move, critics and some consumers argue that the primary barrier to EV adoption is the lack of sufficient public charging infrastructure, not just the initial purchase price. The government has also pledged funds to expand the charging network to address these concerns.</p>

          <p>World number one golfer Scottie Scheffler's remarkable success over the past year is being credited to his work with renowned putting coach Phil Kenyon. After struggling significantly on the greens despite being the best from tee to green, Scheffler sought Kenyon's help in late 2023. Kenyon helped with green reading, changed Scheffler's grip, and recommended a switch to a mallet putter, which sparked a dramatic turnaround. Within a year, Scheffler won seven PGA Tour events, including his second Masters and an Olympic gold medal, transforming from one of the worst putters on tour to one of the best, solidifying his dominance in the sport.</p>

          <p>A U.S. appeals court has issued a temporary stay, preventing the expiration of protections for nearly 12,000 Afghans under Temporary Protected Status (TPS). The Department of Homeland Security had moved to end the status, which allows them to work legally and shields them from deportation, arguing that conditions in Afghanistan had improved. Immigrant advocacy groups sued the administration, and the court's intervention keeps the protections in place for at least another week while the case is reviewed. The move to revoke TPS for Afghans has drawn criticism, as many of those affected had assisted the U.S. during its two-decade presence in the country.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Norway has become a global leader in the adoption of electric vehicles (EVs), with nearly 90% of new car sales being electric last year, a stark contrast to less than 1% in 2010. This success is attributed to a long-term strategy of robust government incentives, including VAT exemptions, reduced road and parking taxes, and access to bus lanes. The government has also invested heavily in public charging infrastructure and progressively increased taxes on polluting internal combustion engine cars. This comprehensive approach has made EVs a common sight, improving air quality and reducing noise in cities like Oslo, offering a model for other nations.</p>

          <p>Construction has begun on Stockholm Wood City, a massive urban development project in the Sickla district that aims to be the world's largest city built primarily from wood. The developer, Atrium Ljungberg, is investing over a billion dollars to construct homes, offices, and schools using cross-laminated timber, a sustainable alternative to steel and concrete. The project is a key part of the company's goal to nearly eliminate its construction emissions by 2030, as mass timber buildings produce significantly lower emissions. The development highlights a growing trend in sustainable architecture and leverages Sweden's vast forest resources and cultural connection to wood construction.</p>

          <p>Nvidia has announced it expects to soon resume sales of its H20 artificial intelligence chips to China, following assurances from the U.S. government that export licenses will be granted. The sales were effectively halted in April when the U.S. required a license for the chips, which had been specifically designed to comply with earlier export controls targeting Beijing. This reversal is a major victory for Nvidia, whose CEO Jensen Huang has been actively lobbying against the restrictions, arguing they undermine American tech leadership. The decision follows high-level talks and a preliminary trade framework agreement between Washington and Beijing to ease certain trade curbs.</p>

          <p>This opinion article argues that women who grew up in East Germany are bringing a unique and critical perspective to influential roles in the art and political worlds. Having lived between two different social systems, figures like curator Kathleen Reinhardt and provenance researcher Lynn Rother are challenging established narratives and institutional structures. The author suggests their experiences with "otherness" and societal transformation have equipped them with a skepticism of grand narratives and a focus on uncovering complex, often uncomfortable, histories. After years of being overlooked, these women are now in positions to exercise power more critically, offering clarity and resisting simplification in their respective fields.</p>

          <p>Chinese private space company Space Pioneer has successfully completed a critical ground-based structural test on its Tianlong-3 rocket. The test simulated the immense stress the rocket's first stage would endure during launch, flight, and recovery, confirming its structural integrity. This milestone is particularly significant as it comes a year after a previous static-fire test ended in a dramatic explosion when the rocket unexpectedly lifted off and crashed. The Tianlong-3 is designed to be a reusable rocket, and ensuring its tail section can withstand the enormous forces of its nine engines is a crucial step toward its eventual maiden flight.</p>

          <p>Meta founder Mark Zuckerberg has announced that the company will invest hundreds of billions of dollars to build massive artificial intelligence data centers in the United States. The goal is to develop "superintelligence," a form of AI that could surpass human intellect. The first of these multi-gigawatt facilities, named Prometheus, is set to be operational in Ohio by 2026, with another, Hyperion, planned for Louisiana. Zuckerberg stated that one of the data center clusters could eventually cover an area nearly the size of Manhattan, signaling an enormous financial and infrastructural commitment to leading the global AI race.</p>

          <h2>Study Finds Animals React to Ultrasonic Sounds Made by Stressed Plants</h2>
          <div class="timestamp">2025-07-14 23:02:01 EDT</div>
        </div>
        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>New research from Tel Aviv University provides the first evidence that animals respond to sounds produced by plants. The study found that female moths avoided laying eggs on tomato plants that were emitting ultrasonic noises, which the plants make when they are unhealthy or dehydrated. While the sounds are outside the range of human hearing, they can be perceived by many insects and some mammals. This discovery suggests the existence of a previously unknown acoustic ecosystem where animals may use plant sounds to make decisions about pollination, feeding, or shelter, opening a vast new field of scientific inquiry into plant-animal communication.</p>
