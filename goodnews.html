          <p>The Chinese navy has successfully integrated artificial intelligence (AI) into a combat-readiness exercise for warship degaussing, or magnetic immunisation. The integration of AI increased the efficiency of the degaussing process by 60%, potentially boosting the stealth capacity and survivability of China's expanding submarine fleet, according to state media reports. The simulated emergency drill marked the first operational deployment of an AI-assisted decision-making system, enhancing performance far beyond traditional manual methods.

          <p>Amidst fluctuating tariff policies, consumers can take steps to mitigate the impact on their budgets by looking for sales events like Memorial Day and Father's Day, and by checking the origin of products to identify items less affected by tariffs. Shoppers should also consider purchasing domestic products, particularly produce, to avoid potential price hikes on imports from countries like Mexico. Electronics and toys are expected to be hit hardest by tariffs, so consumers should strategically plan purchases of these items, but avoid panic buying. These are some of the tips to consider to navigate the current trade landscape.</p>
