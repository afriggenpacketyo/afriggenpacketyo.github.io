          <p>Elon Musk stated that he regrets some of his social media posts about President Donald Trump, acknowledging they "went too far." This comes after a public dispute with his former ally, which had caused market concerns over Tesla and SpaceX. The conflict was triggered by Musk's opposition to the Trump-backed "One Big Beautiful Bill Act" tax and spending bill, which Musk claimed would undermine the work of the Department of Government Efficiency (DOGE) and increase the U.S. budget deficit, a point the Trump administration disputes. Over the weekend, Trump warned of consequences if Musk supported Democratic candidates challenging the bill, though he later indicated he would be open to speaking with Musk. The article highlights the dissolving of a tight partnership and its immediate impact on Tesla's stock, which has since recovered. </p>
