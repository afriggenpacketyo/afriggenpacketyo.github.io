          <p>An opinion article highlights how China's industrial policy, "Made in China 2025," is successfully transforming the nation into a high-tech powerhouse. Launched a decade ago, the plan strategically targeted key sectors like information technology, where China was previously a follower rather than an innovator. Through coordinated central leadership, flexible local implementation, and significant state funding, the policy has systematically addressed structural weaknesses. This institutionalized approach has been pivotal in elevating China's capacity for hi-tech innovation and moving its manufacturing focus away from low-tech products, paving the way for global tech leadership.</p>

          <p>Following Representative Jerry Nadler's announcement of his retirement, speculation has arisen about who will seek his influential New York congressional seat. A spokesperson for Chelsea Clinton confirmed she will not run, dismissing rumors of her candidacy. In contrast, John F. Kennedy's grandson, Jack Schlossberg, has indicated that a campaign is "certainly a possibility," signaling potential political ambitions. Nadler's departure after over three decades opens up a key Democratic stronghold, potentially setting the stage for a high-profile primary race as a new generation of political figures considers entering the field.</p>

          <p>Shares for fashion retailer American Eagle Outfitters saw a significant 25% jump after the company reported better-than-expected performance, driven by viral marketing campaigns. The company credited collaborations with actress Sydney Sweeney and athlete Travis Kelce for boosting customer engagement and sales, leading to an optimistic forecast for the coming months. Despite a controversial ad featuring Sweeney that sparked public debate, the campaign proved highly successful, selling out her signature jeans within a week. The company expects the positive momentum to continue with future celebrity partnerships. (not investment advice)</p>

Anisimova revealed she rewatched the painful Wimbledon match to learn from her mistakes, a testament to her improved mental resilience since taking a break from the sport. Her fearless performance sets up a semifinal clash with four-time major champion Naomi Osaka, marking a significant comeback.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>A federal judge has voided the Trump administration's freeze on $2.2 billion in grant funding for Harvard University, ruling the action was illegal and retaliatory. The court found the administration imposed the freeze after Harvard refused to comply with demands that violated First Amendment rights, such as ending diversity programs and screening students for ideological bias. Judge Allison Burroughs described the move as a "targeted, ideologically-motivated assault" and stated the administration used antisemitism as a pretext for its actions. The ruling lifts the freeze on numerous critical research projects, though the White House has announced its intention to appeal.</p>

          <p>The United Kingdom's defense secretary, John Healey, stated that allied nations are prepared to provide long-term security guarantees to Ukraine, both during and after any potential peace negotiations with Russia. Speaking ahead of a meeting in Paris, Healey confirmed allies would help secure Ukraine's skies, seas, and land once a deal is reached. This commitment comes as Russian President Vladimir Putin remains defiant, suggesting the conflict could continue militarily if his demands are not met. The proposed security deal reportedly includes continued training, supplies, and a potential deployment of European troops to deter future Russian aggression.</p>

          <p>DeKalb County has made history in Georgia by becoming the first county to allocate public funds specifically for reproductive healthcare services. The Board of Commissioners approved $200,000 for two local organizations, the Feminist Women’s Health Center and ARC-Southeast, to enhance access to care. The funding will support services such as STI testing, family planning, and emergency contraception. This local initiative aims to address the state's high maternal mortality rate and the increasing difficulty many women face in accessing essential health services, particularly within marginalized communities.</p>

Tencent recently open-sourced its Youtu-Agent framework, following similar moves by ByteDance and Alibaba earlier in the year.

          <p>Argentine authorities have recovered "Portrait of a Lady," an 18th-century painting by Giuseppe Ghislandi that was looted by the Nazis during World War II. The artwork was rediscovered after it unexpectedly appeared in an online real estate listing posted by the daughter of the fugitive Nazi officer accused of stealing it. The painting, which had not been seen publicly for 80 years, originally belonged to Dutch-Jewish art collector Jacques Goudstikker. Following a police raid and investigation prompted by journalists, the family's lawyer turned the valuable portrait over to federal prosecutors in Mar del Plata.</p>

The positive momentum came despite underlying economic fears that continue to weigh on global equities. Investor focus remains on global bond markets, particularly after the U.S. 30-year Treasury yield briefly surpassed 5% following a court ruling against the legality of many Trump administration tariffs, raising questions about future government revenue.

        </div>
        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>A federal appeals court has ruled against the Trump administration's use of the Alien Enemies Act of 1798 to deport Venezuelan migrants accused of being gang members. The court found that the current situation does not constitute an "invasion or predatory incursion," the legal standard required by the wartime statute. This decision marks a significant setback for the administration's strategy of using the obscure law for rapid deportations without extensive due process. The ruling grants a preliminary injunction for the plaintiffs in the case, though the government can still seek to remove the migrants under other immigration laws.</p>

          <p>The municipal government of Shaoxing, China, has introduced a novel stimulus measure to encourage consumer spending: offering subsidies for large banquets. Under the new policy, individuals hosting events with five or more tables and spending over 10,000 yuan (US$700) will be eligible for subsidies up to 5,000 yuan. This initiative is part of a broader local government effort to invigorate the economy by boosting consumption in sectors like catering, retail, and housing. The move highlights the creative, and sometimes unusual, methods local officials are employing to stimulate economic growth amid national pressures to both encourage spending and curb extravagance.</p>

          <p>Ranchers in Montana's Blackfoot Valley are challenging the conventional food system to ensure their long-term survival against threats from corporate agriculture and climate change. The Mannix family, along with other local ranchers in the Old Salt Co-op, are implementing regenerative ranching techniques, which involve rotating cattle to allow land to rest and recover, improving soil health and grass production. They are also bypassing large meatpackers by processing a portion of their livestock locally and selling directly to consumers through their own butcher shop and restaurants. This model aims to create a more resilient and economically viable system for local producers.</p>

          <p>An agreement has been reached in North Carolina to prevent approximately 98,000 registered voters from being disenfranchised. The settlement resolves a lawsuit filed by the Trump administration's Department of Justice, which had demanded the state deny ballots to voters who registered without providing a driver's license or partial social security number. The Democratic National Committee intervened, arguing the demand violated federal law. Under the new agreement, these voters will be allowed to cast a provisional ballot and provide the necessary information at the polling place, thus ensuring their vote can be counted.</p>
