          <p>A grassroots campaign called "Adopt a Corner" has emerged in Southern California, with local residents monitoring areas like Home Depot parking lots to protect day laborers from U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE) agents. Volunteers provide information and document ICE operations, reflecting a shift in activism from large downtown protests to smaller, community-based actions in the suburbs. The movement is supported by the National Day Laborer Organizing Network and comes amid growing public disapproval of the administration's deportation policies.</p>

          <p>Despite their significant political differences, U.S. Vice President JD Vance and UK Foreign Secretary David Lammy have formed a notable friendship. The bond is reportedly rooted in shared experiences, including difficult upbringings and their Christian faith. This personal relationship is considered potentially valuable for US-UK diplomacy, especially within a Trump administration that is known to place a high value on personal connections with world leaders. Vance recently stayed with Lammy and his family at the foreign secretary's country residence.</p>

          <p>Director Antonio Negret's new horror film, "Shaman," offers a unique take on demonic possession by exploring it through an Andean cultural lens. Set in a remote region of Ecuador, the story follows Anglo-Saxon missionaries whose son appears to be possessed, leading to a confrontation with local spiritual authorities and their beliefs. Negret, who has deep ties to Latin America, collaborated closely with the local Kichwa-speaking indigenous community to ensure the film's cultural authenticity and raw feel, shooting on location at 12,000 feet.</p>

          <h2>Fact Check Debunks Claim of Trump's Plane Flying to Epstein's Island</h2>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>A viral social media claim alleging that Donald Trump's private plane flew to Jeffrey Epstein's island 37 times has been found to be without evidence. The claim, made by a Facebook user posing as a retired pilot, is discredited by the fact that Epstein's Little St. James island did not have an airstrip capable of landing a large jet. Visitors to the island typically arrived via helicopter or boat from a nearby airport, making the specific claim of 37 plane landings highly improbable and unsubstantiated.</p>

          <p>In an effort to combat a growing crisis of loneliness, the city of Seoul has launched "warm-hearted convenience stores." These centers provide a welcoming, cafe-like atmosphere where socially isolated individuals, both young and old, can receive free instant noodles, use amenities, and connect with social workers and other visitors. The initiative was created to be an accessible, low-stigma resource and has seen far greater demand than anticipated, highlighting the depth of social isolation in the South Korean capital.</p>

          <p>In a major diplomatic achievement, the leaders of Armenia and Azerbaijan signed a historic peace agreement at the White House, officially brokered by the United States under President Donald Trump. The deal aims to end nearly four decades of conflict over the Nagorno-Karabakh region. A central feature of the agreement is the creation of a trade and transit corridor through the South Caucasus, to be named after Trump, which will grant the U.S. exclusive development rights and is expected to boost regional exports.</p>

It reflects on their historic achievements and what became of them after their NASA careers, while also looking ahead to the new generation of lunar exploration with NASA's Artemis program and China's ambitious space missions.</p>

          <p>An Independent Member of Parliament, Rupert Lowe, admitted he mistakenly identified a charity rowing team off the Norfolk coast as "illegal migrants" in a social media post where he called for their deportation. After he alerted authorities, the vessel was confirmed to be a crew rowing from Land's End to John O'Groats to raise money for motor neurone disease. Lowe later apologized for the false alarm and donated £1,000 to their cause, though he maintained his vigilance on immigration is necessary.</p>
