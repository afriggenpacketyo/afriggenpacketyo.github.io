          <p>A recent episode of NPR's Short Wave podcast delves into the scientific and philosophical challenges of defining life. Developmental biologist Crystal Rogers discusses the standard criteria used in biology, such as growth, reproduction, and response to stimuli, to distinguish living from non-living things. The conversation explores ambiguous cases like viruses, which exist on the border of these definitions, and speculates on future challenges posed by advanced artificial intelligence and robotics.</p>

          <p>According to Carlsberg's CEO, consumers under financial pressure are increasingly choosing either premium or economy beers, squeezing sales of mid-range "core" brands. This trend of "bifurcation" is affecting brewers globally, who are already contending with declining sales volumes as drinkers push back against higher prices. The shift also sees more consumption happening at home rather than in bars and restaurants, reflecting broader changes in consumer spending habits amid economic headwinds.</p>

          <p>For those struggling with insomnia, especially during hot summer nights, several evidence-based strategies can improve sleep. Daily exercise, for instance, has been shown to increase sleep duration and quality by boosting melatonin production and reducing stress. Other effective habits include avoiding caffeine in the afternoon and evening, and reducing screen time before bed, as the mental stimulation can disrupt sleep patterns. Simple techniques like deep breathing exercises can also help calm the nervous system and make it easier to fall asleep.</p>

Rooney suggests that it will be very difficult for Isak to stay at the club, given the "huge opportunity" to join Premier League champions Liverpool, who have reportedly made a substantial offer. He also noted that due to financial regulations, selling the player might paradoxically benefit Newcastle by freeing up funds to strengthen the overall squad, even at the cost of losing their top talent.</p>

          <p>Surrey Police have launched the "Jog On" campaign to combat the catcalling and harassment of female joggers. The initiative involves female police officers running in plain clothes in targeted areas, with uniformed colleagues nearby to intervene and educate perpetrators. The campaign was prompted by a local survey where 94% of female residents reported experiencing harassment, yet nearly half never reported it. The operation aims to gather better data on this under-reported issue and make public spaces safer for women.</p>
