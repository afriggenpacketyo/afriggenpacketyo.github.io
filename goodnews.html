          <p>The Walt Disney Company will pay $10 million to resolve Federal Trade Commission allegations concerning the illegal collection of children's personal data on YouTube. The FTC contended that Disney breached the Children's Online Privacy Protection Rule by not properly designating some child-oriented videos as "made for kids," thereby enabling data collection from underage viewers for targeted advertising. This settlement requires Disney to pay the civil penalty, adhere to children's data protection regulations, and establish a program to review its YouTube content designations. Disney emphasized that the agreement pertains solely to its content distributed on YouTube and reiterated its dedication to upholding high standards for children's privacy.</p>

The Mercosur deal, which awaits ratification by at least 15 EU member states, mandates Mercosur members to gradually eliminate tariffs on 91% of EU imports, including vehicles and pharmaceuticals, in exchange for increased access for their agricultural products to the EU market. Despite concerns from EU agricultural sectors about competition, the Commission highlighted the substantial economic benefits and robust safeguards for sensitive products. The Mexico agreement further solidifies trade with a long-standing partner.</p>

Indian Foreign Minister Jaishankar explicitly sought Germany's support to expedite these negotiations, which are currently bogged down by disagreements on import duties, climate and labor standards, and protections for Indian farmers. Both India and the EU are motivated to finalize an agreement following recent U.S. tariff adjustments impacting their trade. Beyond economic discussions, Wadephul engaged in cultural and business events, even as domestic political pressure in Germany urged him to address the Afghan refugee situation in Pakistan.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Phantom energy, often termed vampire energy, describes the electricity continuously drawn by electronic devices when they are plugged in but not actively operating. This silent energy drain can constitute 5% to 10% of a household's total energy consumption, stemming from common items such as phone chargers, microwaves, and smart televisions with constant connectivity. The wasted electricity exacerbates climate change by heightening demand for power generated from fossil fuels. Experts advise simple measures like unplugging devices when not in use or deactivating unnecessary smart features to significantly reduce both utility bills and carbon emissions, underscoring the collective impact of individual sustainable actions.</p>

          <p>Amazon is phasing out its "Prime Invitee" program, which previously enabled Prime members to extend free shipping benefits to individuals beyond their immediate household. The company is now actively encouraging these non-household users to acquire their own Prime subscriptions, offering a promotional one-year membership at a reduced price of $14.99. This alteration, set to take effect on October 1, is part of Amazon's broader strategy to increase individual Prime memberships, particularly following a significant fee hike in 2022. The "Prime Invitee" program will be superseded by "Amazon Family," which restricts shared benefits to a single additional adult residing in the same household, along with designated profiles for teens and children.</p>

          <p>A comprehensive fact-check analysis refutes President Trump's persistent assertions that Democrat-governed cities inherently exhibit higher crime rates. While most large U.S. cities are indeed led by Democrats and urban centers typically report more crime than rural areas, the article stresses that this overlap does not establish causation. FBI data, which explicitly advises against ranking cities by crime, reveals that many Democrat-run cities have crime rates comparable to those with Republican-affiliated mayors of similar size. Decades of research from institutions like Harvard and MIT further conclude that a mayor's political affiliation has no discernible impact on crime or policing, despite public opinion often perceiving the opposite.</p>

          <p>For homeowners seeking affordable financing, tapping into their substantial home equity, currently averaging $213,000, presents viable options with HELOCs and home equity loans both around 8% interest. This article thoroughly compares the affordability of these products for September, analyzing interest rates, diverse repayment structures, and associated fees. While HELOCs may offer slightly lower, variable rates, home equity loans provide the stability of fixed rates and predictable payments. Experts highlight that HELOCs could seem more appealing with potential Federal Reserve rate cuts, but fixed-rate loans offer greater long-term security. Borrowers must carefully assess flexibility versus payment predictability, alongside additional costs and the inherent risk of foreclosure. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>Hawaii's Kilauea volcano has experienced another eruption, projecting lava 500 feet into the sky from its summit crater, marking the 32nd such event in its current eruptive phase since December. This 13-hour eruption generated an estimated 337 million cubic feet of molten rock, which remained safely contained within the Halemaumau Crater of Hawaii Volcanoes National State Park. Although no injuries occurred, the U.S. Geological Survey issued warnings about elevated levels of sulfur dioxide gas, which forms volcanic smog and poses respiratory risks downwind.

Roberts stressed the importance of Hernández rediscovering his "edge" and "fight," asserting that the mechanical aspects of his swing struggles are secondary to his intensity.

          <p>Alphabet shares experienced a 9% surge following a federal antitrust ruling that largely spared Google from a proposed breakup, a decision widely seen as favorable by investors. Despite Google being found to possess an illegal monopoly in its core internet search market, U.S. District Judge Amit Mehta dismissed the Justice Department's more drastic proposals, such as divesting its Chrome browser and Android operating system. Google will also retain the right to compensate companies like Apple for default search engine status, although exclusive contracts are now forbidden. This outcome significantly alleviates a major market uncertainty, boosting investor confidence in Google's Search division and its burgeoning AI endeavors, including Gemini.
