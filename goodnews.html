          <p>A 3.0 magnitude earthquake struck Bergen County, New Jersey, causing tremors felt in New York City and surrounding areas. This is the second seismic event in the state in under two weeks, following a larger 4.8 magnitude quake in April 2024. While no immediate damage was reported from the recent tremor, officials have warned of potential aftershocks and advised residents to check for any structural issues. The event highlights the activity of the Ramapo Fault line, which traverses the region and is responsible for minor but regular quakes.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>The FIRE (Financial Independence, Retire Early) movement is gaining traction, inspiring individuals to achieve financial freedom through aggressive saving and frugal living. The article profiles Nik and Adinah Johnson, who retired in their forties, and explores the philosophy popularized by bloggers like Mr. Money Mustache. The core principle involves saving 25 times one's annual expenses to live off a 4% annual withdrawal, fundamentally changing one's relationship with money and work. This lifestyle prioritizes personal freedom and experiences over material consumption.</p>

          <p>Despite being one of the highest-paid athletes, NBA star Stephen Curry stated he does not know his exact net worth and focuses instead on building a meaningful portfolio and pursuing aspirational goals. Financial experts cited in the article praise this approach, suggesting that focusing on cash flow and tangible goals, rather than a single net worth number, can lead to better financial health and personal satisfaction. The article encourages readers to align financial decisions with personal values rather than obsessing over accumulating maximum wealth.</p>

          <p>Researchers in China have successfully developed a new material, CHSN01, a high-strength, low-temperature steel designed for use in nuclear fusion reactors. This breakthrough addresses a critical challenge faced by the International Thermonuclear Experimental Reactor (ITER) project, where existing materials became brittle under extreme cold and magnetic stress. The new "super steel" can withstand both the cryogenic temperatures of liquid helium and the immense forces generated by the reactor's superconducting magnets, placing China in a leading position in advanced materials science.</p>

          <p>Dylan Field, the 33-year-old CEO of design software company Figma, has become a tech billionaire following his company's successful IPO. A former Thiel Fellow who dropped out of Brown University, Field co-founded Figma to create simple, browser-based creative tools, directly competing with Adobe. After a planned $20 billion acquisition by Adobe was scrapped due to regulatory hurdles, Figma went public with its market cap soaring, making it a standout success in a slow IPO market. Field's journey highlights the persistent potential for disruptive innovation in the tech industry.</p>

This trend highlights a growing recognition that global challenges like disease and conflict require international cooperation, even as populist and isolationist sentiments rise elsewhere.</p>
