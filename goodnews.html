          <p>Berlin-Mitte has officially renamed Mohrenstrasse to Anton Wilhelm Amo Strasse, concluding a years-long struggle centered on racial sensitivity and inclusion. The change honors Anton Wilhelm Amo, the first well-known Black philosopher and legal scholar at a German university, born in what is now Ghana in 1703. Local politicians, including Green Party's Tuba Bozkurt, celebrated the removal of the term "Mohr," historically used in a derogatory context for people of African descent. This decision, which followed a turbulent three days involving a court injunction and subsequent reversal, marks a clear sign in favor of respect, diversity, and acknowledging racist historical legacies in public spaces, reflecting a broader societal shift.</p>

          <p>Tennis legend Venus Williams, at 45, is set to make her record-extending 25th US Open singles appearance, two years after her last Grand Slam match and following surgery for uterine fibroids. Ranked No. 610, she faces a formidable opponent in Karolína Muchová, the Czech 11th seed, yet her determination remains undiminished, echoing her sentiment, "It's in my DNA." Williams, a seven-time Grand Slam singles champion and former world No. 1, recently confirmed her engagement to Italian actor-producer Andrea Preti, crediting him with encouraging her return to the sport. Her enduring presence continues to inspire, challenging conventional notions of athletic longevity and cultural impact in tennis.</p>

          <p>Major brands like American Eagle, Swatch, and Colgate-Palmolive are facing increasing consumer scrutiny and backlash for recent marketing blunders deemed tone-deaf or offensive. Incidents include problematic wordplay in a jeans campaign, an offensive gesture in a watch advertisement, and problematic suggestions about skin tones, alongside allegations of cultural appropriation by Adidas and Prada. Brand specialists attribute these failures to an "empathy failure," where companies use outdated boardroom thinking to navigate cultural complexities rather than understanding them deeply. This trend highlights the significant challenge for brands to genuinely connect with diverse consumers in an age of social media and divided public opinion, where authenticity is paramount to avoid widespread criticism.</p>

          <p>A Chinese team from the Shanghai Museum will collaborate with Egyptian counterparts to excavate the ruins of the Sekhmet Temple, part of the ancient Memphis archaeological site in Egypt. This initiative, described as a milestone in cultural heritage collaboration, focuses on a site over 5,100 years old that was once the capital of ancient Egypt and home to the god Ptah. The joint excavation team, led by Shanghai Museum deputy director Chen Jie, selected the temple after surveying ten sites during a research trip to Egypt in September last year. This partnership underscores growing international cooperation in archaeological research and cultural preservation, promising new insights into ancient Egyptian history.</p>

          <p>The 2025 US Open begins with Jannik Sinner and Carlos Alcaraz dominating predictions for the men's title, having split the last seven Grand Slams. Despite their strong form, the tournament's slightly slower hard courts and humid conditions have historically led to diverse champions, with Novak Djokovic being the only male repeat winner in seven years. On the women's side, defending champion Aryna Sabalenka seeks to regain top form after an unconvincing lead-up, while Jessica Pegula, Madison Keys, and Amanda Anisimova lead a formidable American challenge. The article highlights the intense competition and the quest for glory among both established stars and rising talents in the year's final Grand Slam.</p>

          <h2>Estonians Boost Self-Defense and NATO Ties Amid Rising Russian Threat</h2>

          <p>Estonians are actively preparing for a potential Russian invasion, strengthening their self-defense capabilities and community cohesion, as exemplified by citizens like Ave Ungro, who trains with the Women's Voluntary Defense Organization. Estonia, a NATO member, significantly invests 3.4% of its GDP in defense, projected to rise to 5.4% by 2029, a record among NATO states, and relies heavily on Article 5 collective defense. While analysts doubt a full-scale invasion comparable to Crimea, Russian sabotage acts like repeated damage to undersea cables and GPS jamming, suspected from Kaliningrad, are a more acute and increasing concern. This proactive approach reflects a deeply rooted culture of self-defense and strong regional alliances.</p>

          <h2>Chinese Envoy Dismisses US Farmland Ownership as National Security Threat</h2>
          <div class="timestamp">2025-08-24 00:26:16 EDT</div>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>China's top envoy in Washington, Xie Feng, has rejected claims that Chinese ownership of US farmland poses a national security threat, calling such suggestions "completely unfounded." Addressing a soybean industry event, Ambassador Xie stated that Chinese investors own less than 0.03% of total US farmland, arguing that restricting these purchases is purely political manipulation. He emphasized that such actions, taken under the pretext of national security, are aimed at hijacking China-US agricultural cooperation for specific agendas, rather than addressing a genuine threat to food security. This statement highlights ongoing tensions and differing perspectives on economic engagement and national security between the two global powers.</p>

          <p>The Los Angeles Chargers' preseason finale against the San Francisco 49ers, a 30-23 loss, revealed both standout performances and significant sloppiness, with a combined 23 penalties.

However, the team struggled with numerous penalties and turnovers, prompting coach Jim Harbaugh to emphasize the need for improvement. Quarterback Trey Lance showed potential but also faced pressure, while running back Nyheim Miller-Hines demonstrated explosiveness despite a fumble.

          <p>Pierce Brosnan, starring as Ron in the film adaptation of Richard Osman's bestselling "Thursday Murder Club" series, expressed immense responsibility towards the book's millions of fans. Joining Dame Helen Mirren, Celia Imrie, and Sir Ben Kingsley, Brosnan, at 72, admitted he initially thought another actor, like Ray Winstone, would play his role but embraced the challenge. Directed by Chris Columbus and produced by Steven Spielberg's Amblin, the movie has received mixed critical reviews, with some praising its "humane comedy" and "ballast" of sadness, while others called it "flimsy." Despite a limited cinematic release, the cast enjoyed their camaraderie and are enthusiastic about future installments.</p>

          <p>The Los Angeles Dodgers suffered a 5-1 loss to the San Diego Padres, managing only two hits and consequently falling out of first place in the National League West. Manager Dave Roberts acknowledged the team's offensive funk, stating their intent might be misplaced, with players prioritizing individual mechanics over team-first approaches. The Dodgers failed to adjust against crafty pitchers, taking big swings instead of focusing on contact and moving runners. This recent skid, including only two runs and five hits in two games against the Padres, puts significant pressure on the team to recalibrate their strategy and generate more consistent offense as they enter the critical stretch run of the season.</p>

          <p>Taiwan AI Cloud, a subsidiary of laptop maker Asus, is building a new supercomputer aimed at significantly boosting the island's total computing capacity by at least 50%. The initial phase of the infrastructure, with a capacity of 80 petaflops (one petaflop equals 1 trillion calculations per second), is expected to launch in December, eventually reaching a total capacity of 250 petaflops. This collaboration with the National Centre for High-Performance Computing, located in Tainan, is part of Taiwan's ambitious goal to become a "top three computing power in Asia" by expanding its overall capacity to around 1,200 petaflops by 2029. This strategic investment underscores Taiwan's commitment to advancing its technological infrastructure and global standing.</p>
