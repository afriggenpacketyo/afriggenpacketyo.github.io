          <p>China's military is training soldiers in an ancient mental calculation technique to serve as 'human abacuses' in combat situations where modern technology might fail. A recent state media broadcast showcased a drill where a soldier, using these mental math skills, accurately predicted the trajectories of multiple targets in seconds after a simulated radar failure. This training highlights a strategy to build resilience and operational continuity by ensuring personnel can perform critical tasks without relying solely on advanced digital or electronic systems. The promotion of such skills aligns with a broader national push to bolster military confidence and capability.</p>

          <p>Maine Governor Janet Mills, a Democrat, has officially launched her campaign for the U.S. Senate in 2026, setting up a potential challenge against long-serving Republican moderate Susan Collins. Mills, who was reelected as governor by a significant margin, is seen by national Democrats as a strong contender in a critical race. However, her entry also sets the stage for a contentious primary, as progressive figures like Senator Bernie Sanders are backing a younger, first-time candidate. The race is expected to highlight internal party tensions over generational change and strategic direction following the Democrats' difficult 2024 election cycle.</p>

          <p>California Governor Gavin Newsom has signed a package of bills aimed at increasing online safety for children, imposing new regulations on artificial intelligence and social media platforms. One landmark law requires AI chatbots to disclose their nature and periodically remind minor users to take breaks, while also implementing safeguards against harmful content. Other legislation mandates social media apps to display mental health warnings and increases penalties for the distribution of deepfake pornography. These laws position California at the forefront of tech regulation, forcing companies like Apple, Google, and Meta to adapt their business models to prioritize youth protection.</p>

          <p>Economic historian Joel Mokyr has been co-awarded the 2025 Nobel Prize in economics for his extensive research explaining the drivers of the Industrial Revolution and sustained economic growth. Mokyr's work highlights that Britain's success around 1800 stemmed from its ability to operationalize Enlightenment-era scientific breakthroughs into practical, economy-boosting inventions. He argues that a skilled class of entrepreneurs and artisans, combined with political institutions open to disruptive change, was the crucial ingredient that translated macro-inventions into widespread productivity gains. This historical perspective offers context for contemporary debates surrounding the economic impact of disruptive technologies like artificial intelligence.</p>

          <p>A new drug named lenacapavir, administered as an injection just twice a year, has demonstrated nearly 100% effectiveness in preventing HIV infection in clinical trials, marking a major advancement in public health. Unlike daily PrEP pills, the long-acting injectable removes challenges related to adherence and stigma, offering a discreet and highly effective prevention method. The Trump administration plans to make the drug central to its global health strategy, aiming to roll it out in several low-income countries by 2026. However, its real-world impact will depend on overcoming political hurdles and ensuring equitable distribution beyond initial target groups.</p>

          <p>The U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) has officially adopted new recommendations for the updated COVID-19 vaccine, providing clarity for patients and providers. Under the new guidance, individuals aged 6 months and older can receive the shot after consulting with a healthcare provider, a process known as shared clinical decision-making. This effectively removes the need for a formal prescription, which some states had required following earlier, more restrictive FDA approval. The updated guidance also includes pregnant women, reversing a previous decision that had removed them from the immunization schedule for healthy individuals.</p>

          <p>The UK government is advising businesses to prepare for potential cyber-attacks by maintaining physical, paper-based copies of their operational contingency plans. In a letter to chief executives, the National Cyber-Security Centre (NCSC) stressed the importance of resilience engineering, which focuses on a system's ability to function and recover without IT. The advice comes as the NCSC reports a significant increase in 'nationally significant' cyber incidents this year, which have disrupted major companies and supply chains. Organizations are urged to have offline plans detailing communication methods and analogue workarounds to ensure continuity during a digital shutdown.</p>

As China dominates nearly 90% of the global rare earth processing market, any disruption creates volatility and potential opportunities for domestic producers.

          <p>A West Palm Beach psychiatrist is emphasizing the profound connection between female hormones, breast health, and mental well-being, particularly for women undergoing breast cancer treatment. Dr. Kristi Wragg explains that hormones like estrogen and progesterone directly influence brain neurotransmitters that control mood and anxiety. Treatments such as tamoxifen, which block estrogen to fight cancer, can induce a sudden, intense menopause, leading to side effects like cognitive fog, irritability, and depression. She urges women to understand these changes as biological reactions, not personal failings, and to advocate for their mental health with the same vigilance as their physical screenings.</p>
