          <h2>Exploring the Rising Rates of Autism Diagnoses: A Comprehensive Analysis</h2>
          <div class="timestamp">2025-05-02 21:19:44 EDT</div>
        </div>
        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>This article examines the exponential increase in autism diagnoses over the past two decades, particularly in Anglophone and European countries. It highlights that the rise in diagnoses does not necessarily equate to an increase in the number of autistic individuals, but rather reflects changes in diagnostic criteria, including the addition of Asperger's syndrome and PDD-NOS to the autism spectrum. The article further explores the increasing recognition of autism in women and adults, who were historically underdiagnosed, and addresses concerns about the potential for glamorizing autism while overlooking the needs of those with higher support requirements. The piece emphasizes the importance of understanding the diversity within the autistic community and addressing the challenges faced by those who spent much of their lives undiagnosed and unsupported.</p>

          <p>Health and Human Services Secretary Robert F. Kennedy Jr. plans to require placebo-controlled trials for new vaccines, a policy change described as "radical" by a department spokesperson. The policy's scope remains unclear, particularly regarding annual updates to flu and COVID vaccines. Kennedy has long questioned vaccine safety, advocating for placebo trials to ensure vaccines do more good than harm. The article explains that while placebo-controlled trials are standard for initial vaccine approvals, subsequent updates are typically tested against existing vaccines to assess immune response.</p>

          <p>The Trump administration has agreed to halt its efforts to freeze funds to Maine schools, resolving a dispute over the state's support of transgender rights. The USDA had suspended funds for a child nutrition program after Maine officials refused to comply with demands to bar trans girls from participating in girls' sports. Governor Janet Mills sued the USDA and secured a settlement restoring the funds. The settlement ensures that Maine will continue to receive funds to feed children and vulnerable adults.</p>
