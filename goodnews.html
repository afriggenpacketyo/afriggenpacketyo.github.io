        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Major League Baseball Commissioner Rob Manfred has changed the league's policy on permanent ineligibility, allowing bans to expire upon death, leading to the reinstatement of Pete Rose, "Shoeless" Joe Jackson, and 15 other players. Rose was banned for betting on baseball, while Jackson was implicated in the 1919 Black Sox scandal. The Hall of Fame will now consider these players, though induction is not guaranteed due to character clause considerations. This decision comes after years of debate and petitions, potentially opening the door for posthumous recognition of their contributions to the sport.</p>

          <p>The Federal Aviation Administration (FAA) acknowledged that as few as three radar controllers were monitoring Newark's airspace on a recent Monday night, despite a target of 14, due to an ongoing national shortage of air traffic controllers. This staffing issue has contributed to flight cancellations and delays at Newark Liberty International Airport. Transportation Secretary Sean Duffy emphasized that safety is the priority, even if it means reducing the number of flights. The FAA is working to address these challenges, including technological upgrades and initiatives to improve staffing levels, although some experts believe the system is still operating safely.</p>

          <p>Ross Douthat's article explores the concept of successful right-wing art, questioning whether art can be inherently political or if the artist's role is simply to present truth. He references Christopher Scalia's book, which encourages conservatives to appreciate literary culture for its philosophical insights. Douthat argues that both right-wing and left-wing perspectives can capture aspects of reality in a non-propagandistic way, citing V.S. Naipaul's novels and the "Star Wars" series "Andor" as examples. He concludes that politically themed art succeeds when it unsettles viewers and conveys unexpected truths, fostering sympathy for different worldviews.</p>
