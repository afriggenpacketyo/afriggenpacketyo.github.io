          <p>A federal judge has ruled against the Trump administration, voiding a freeze on $2.2 billion in grant funds for Harvard University. The court found the administration's actions were likely retaliatory and pretextual, after the university refused to alter its diversity and inclusion programs. The ruling bars the administration from enforcing the freeze, which it had justified by citing concerns over antisemitism on campus. This decision marks a significant development in the ongoing conflict between the administration and prominent academic institutions over free speech and institutional autonomy.</p>

The report also detailed Figma's recent acquisitions and its strategy for integrating artificial intelligence into its products, which has yet to be fully monetized.

          <p>Veteran all-rounder Ravi Bopara scored a remarkable 45-ball century to lead Northamptonshire to a seven-run victory over Surrey in a rain-affected T20 Blast quarter-final. The 40-year-old's unbeaten 105 guided his team to a total of 154-4 in their shortened 14-over innings. Despite a strong effort from Surrey's captain Sam Curran, who scored 69 not out, his team fell just short in the chase. The win secures Northamptonshire's first appearance at Finals Day since 2016, the year they last won the tournament.</p>

          <h2>Bipartisan Bill to Ban Congressional Stock Trading Gains Momentum in the House</h2>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>A bipartisan group of House members has introduced a new bill aimed at banning members of Congress, their spouses, and dependent children from owning or trading individual stocks. The "Restore Trust in Congress Act" consolidates several previous proposals and is supported by a diverse coalition of lawmakers, from conservative Republicans to progressive Democrats. The bill would mandate the sale of existing stocks and impose a 10% penalty on the value of any prohibited investment for violations. Supporters argue the ban is essential to eliminate potential conflicts of interest and restore public trust in government.</p>

          <p>The Democratic National Committee and voting rights groups have successfully negotiated an agreement to prevent approximately 98,000 North Carolina voters from being purged from the rolls. The Department of Justice, under the Trump administration, had sued the state to remove voters who had not provided a driver's license or partial Social Security number upon registration. The new consent order allows these voters to provide the necessary information via a provisional ballot at the polling place, effectively curing the issue. The agreement, which still requires a judge's approval, is being seen as a victory for voting rights advocates.</p>

          <p>With the price of gold surging to a new all-time high of around $3,549 per ounce, the value of gold bars sold by retailers like Costco has increased significantly. An ounce of gold purchased a year ago for about $2,500 has seen a substantial unrealized gain. The article notes that investors are flocking to gold as a "fear hedge" amid economic uncertainty and global conflicts. However, anyone looking to sell would see profits reduced by dealer fees and taxes, as the IRS classifies physical gold as a collectible with a high capital gains tax rate.
