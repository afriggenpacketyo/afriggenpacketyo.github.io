          <p>Millions of AT&T customers affected by two major data breaches in 2024 can now file claims as part of a proposed $177 million class-action settlement. The breaches exposed sensitive personal information, including Social Security numbers, for approximately 73 million current and former account holders. Eligible individuals could receive up to $7,500 in compensation for documented losses, though payments are contingent on the court's final approval of the settlement in December 2025.

          <p>In their first head-to-head 100-meter race since the Paris Olympics, Jamaican sprinter Kishane Thompson defeated American Olympic champion Noah Lyles at the Silesia Diamond League meet. Thompson clocked a time of 9.87 seconds, matching the meet record and securing a clear victory over Lyles, who finished second at 9.90 seconds. The race was a significant rematch after Lyles narrowly won Olympic gold over Thompson by just five-thousandths of a second a year ago.

          <p>A 46-year-old man was successfully rescued by a helicopter crew after being trapped for two days behind a powerful waterfall in a remote area of California. The man, Ryan Wardwell, was rappelling down a series of waterfalls known as the Seven Teacups when the force of the water pushed him off his lines, trapping him. After he was reported missing, a search and rescue team located him using a drone. He was then hoisted to safety and treated for only minor injuries and dehydration before being reunited with his family.</p>

          <p>A leading academic from the Chinese Academy of Sciences has called for China to intensify its efforts in developing space-based solar power technology to compete with the United States. This technology involves building orbital stations that collect solar energy and transmit it to Earth via microwaves, offering a continuous power source unaffected by weather or nighttime. The proposal highlights the need for a top-down national strategy, as current research is fragmented across universities and lacks the resources for such a large-scale project. The goal is to close the technological gap with the U.S., which has been experimenting with this concept for decades.</p>

        </div>
        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>A collection of articles explores the concept of the "Lighthouse Parent," a model that encourages guiding children without controlling their every move, as a healthier alternative to intensive parenting. This approach suggests that while parents are biologically driven to prevent their children's struggles, constantly intervening can be detrimental to a child's development of confidence and independence. The articles argue that being a steady, reliable guide who illuminates the way when needed, rather than hovering constantly, fosters more resilient children. This mindset also helps parents avoid burnout and the isolation that can accompany micromanagement.</p>

          <p>Devon and Cornwall Police have seized a £180,000 deposit that controversial influencer Andrew Tate placed on an Aston Martin Valhalla supercar in 2021. A court order granted the forfeiture after the force argued the funds were proceeds from tax evasion and money laundering, claims which Tate and his brother did not contest. This seizure adds to the £2.7 million previously confiscated from the brothers in December 2024 for failing to pay taxes on business revenues. Authorities stated the money will be reinvested into crime prevention and victim support programs within the community.</p>

          <p>A program named Dec My Dorm is providing essential supplies to students from the foster care system as they begin their college journey, addressing a critical need often overlooked. Many of these students arrive on campus with minimal belongings, unaware that dorm rooms are typically unfurnished beyond basic furniture. The organization, which supported 142 students this year, allows them to select their own bedding and decor to personalize their new living space. By providing everything from pillows and towels to toolboxes and school supplies, the program aims to level the playing field and help these students feel more at home.</p>

          <h2>Therapist Advocates for Waking Up Early as a Key Morning Ritual for Success</h2>
          <div class="timestamp">2025-08-16 10:00:01 EDT</div>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Sadie Salazar, a therapist and COO of Sage Therapy, emphasizes that the most crucial part of her morning routine is simply waking up early when her alarm goes off, no matter what. This practice creates protected time for herself before the day's demands begin, reducing feelings of being rushed and chaotic. Instead of adhering to a rigid schedule of activities, she uses this extra hour flexibly for things she enjoys, such as reading, listening to a podcast, or taking a longer walk with her dog. This approach allows for creativity and rejuvenation without the pressure of a strict routine.</p>

          <p>The Prince and Princess of Wales, William and Catherine, are planning to move to a new residence, the eight-bedroom Forest Lodge, located in Windsor Great Park. This move will place them in a larger home but still in close proximity to their children's school and their current residence, Adelaide Cottage. The family moved from Kensington Palace to Windsor in 2022 to seek a more private life. Forest Lodge, nestled within the expansive park, aligns with Princess Catherine's advocacy for the healing benefits of nature, a theme she has emphasized during her ongoing cancer treatment.</p>

          <p>Samsung is gaining ground on Apple in the U.S. smartphone market, with its market share increasing from 23% to 31% in the second quarter while Apple's declined from 56% to 49%. This shift is partly attributed to Samsung's innovative foldable phones, like the Z Fold and Z Flip, which offer a new form factor compared to the standard design of the iPhone. Samsung's broader range of products at various price points also contributes to its success. Analysts suggest Apple may respond by releasing its own foldable iPhone by 2026 to compete in this growing high-end segment. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>A selfie taken by fugitive Jamie Rothwell on an encrypted EncroChat phone inadvertently led to his capture and a 43-year sentence for running a massive drugs and firearms operation from Spain. When law enforcement agencies hacked the EncroChat network in 2020, they gained access to thousands of messages where Rothwell orchestrated his criminal enterprise, including trafficking AK-47s and ordering a shooting. The photo, showing his reflection and apartment view, allowed police to identify and locate him in Barcelona. The case highlights the critical intelligence gained from the EncroChat breach, which has led to over 2,200 criminal convictions.</p>

        </div>
        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>According to Columbia-trained psychologist Becky Kennedy, building emotional endurance—the ability to withstand stress without being overwhelmed—can be achieved through three key steps. First, she suggests using a visual aid to remind yourself that the struggle between not knowing and knowing is a natural part of the learning process. Second, engaging in positive self-talk can reframe difficult feelings and build mental strength. Finally, she recommends taking on small, manageable experiments that push you out of your comfort zone, which trains your body to tolerate discomfort and builds resilience over time.</p>

          <p>German Chancellor Friedrich Merz has expressed support for a potential trilateral meeting between the leaders of the United States, Russia, and Ukraine to negotiate an end to the war. Speaking after the Trump-Putin summit, Merz emphasized that a comprehensive peace agreement would be more valuable than a simple ceasefire, which he noted Russia was not ready for. He also confirmed that the U.S. is prepared to offer Ukraine significant security guarantees, a crucial element for any lasting peace deal.

          <p>A new Gallup survey indicates that the percentage of Americans who drink alcohol has fallen to 54%, the lowest level since the question was first asked in 1939. The data also shows that those who do drink are consuming less, with a majority now believing that even moderate drinking is unhealthy. This trend is complemented by a sharp decline in underage drinking over the past few decades. The shift is largely seen as positive public health news, as reduced alcohol consumption is linked to lower rates of cancer, violent crime, and drunk driving fatalities.</p>
