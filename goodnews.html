          <p>Bill Gates announced his intention to donate virtually all of his $108 billion fortune to the Gates Foundation within the next 20 years, inspired by Andrew Carnegie's philosophy that dying rich is a disgrace. This decision will accelerate the foundation's work, originally slated to continue until two decades after Gates' death, and now scheduled to close in 2045. The Gates Foundation aims to intensify its efforts to combat preventable childhood deaths, eradicate infectious diseases, and promote prosperity through education, with Gates expressing concern that recent foreign aid cuts could impede progress in these areas. He hopes to be around to see the impact of these efforts and believes that doubling down on these causes will have positive ripple effects beyond the foundation's closure.</p>

          <p>Bill Gates has announced his intention to donate 99% of his remaining tech fortune, estimated at $107 billion, to the Gates Foundation, which will now close in 2045, earlier than previously planned. This pledge will allow the foundation to spend an additional $200 billion over the next 20 years, focusing on global health and education. Gates stated that this move is to maximize the impact of his giving while he is still alive and able to oversee the work, which he considers his second and final career. The foundation's CEO, Mark Suzman, anticipates a narrower focus on top priorities in the coming years.</p>

          <p>The British government has reportedly secured a trade deal with the United States, potentially easing the impact of recent tariff increases imposed by the U.S. This agreement is expected to support sectors like Britain's auto industry, which was particularly vulnerable to high tariffs. The deal is also likely to improve consumer and business confidence, which have recently declined. While the United States is an important trading partner for Britain, the agreement is unlikely to be a full-blown free-trade agreement and may not significantly boost the overall British economy, which faces other challenges, including domestic factors and global trade uncertainty.</p>

          <p>A judge has ruled that Bryan Kohberger's immediate family members will be allowed to attend his upcoming quadruple-murder trial, even if they might be called to testify. The decision balances Kohberger's Sixth Amendment right to a public trial with the state's interest in obtaining forthright testimony from witnesses. The judge noted that the scope of the family's proposed testimony is narrow and that they have previously given recorded interviews, reducing the risk of them altering their statements based on trial observations. Kohberger is charged with the stabbing deaths of four University of Idaho students and faces the death penalty if convicted.</p>

          <p>Grandparents are increasingly playing a larger role in American children's lives due to demographic shifts, longer life expectancies, and the need for child care assistance. They offer benefits such as better educational and mental health outcomes, fresh perspectives, and a more relaxed approach to child care. However, they are also stepping in to fill gaps in America's crumbling child care system, a role that can be financially and emotionally taxing. Experts suggest that policymakers should implement reforms that allow grandparents to be involved in their grandchildren's lives because they want to, not because their families have no other choice.</p>
