          <p>Chinese astronomers have discovered that stars born more recently in the Milky Way spin faster than older stars, offering new insights into the galaxy's evolution. Researchers analyzed thousands of stars using data from Europe‚Äôs Gaia space telescope, finding that younger stars spin up to 10 times faster than their older counterparts. This increased spin causes gas clouds to break into smaller fragments, making it harder for massive stars to form. The study, published in The Astrophysical Journal, provides the first direct evidence that the galaxy's star-forming clouds have grown more turbulent over time, offering a new way to study how the galaxy has changed.</p>

          <p>Former college football coach Steve Spurrier expressed skepticism about the hype surrounding Texas Longhorns quarterback Arch Manning, despite Manning's highly touted potential. Spurrier questioned why coach Steve Sarkisian chose to start Quinn Ewers over Manning in previous seasons, considering Ewers was a seventh-round NFL Draft pick. Manning, who appeared in 10 games last season, is set to be the starting quarterback this year, with high expectations for the Longhorns' performance in the SEC. Spurrier's comments add intrigue to Manning's upcoming season and the team's prospects.</p>

          <p>Childhood vaccinations have prevented an estimated 154 million deaths over the past 50 years, showcasing the remarkable potential of immunization. However, a recent study in The Lancet reveals that efforts to boost vaccination rates have stalled or reversed in many places since 2010. Factors such as conflict, supply chain issues, and vaccine misinformation have contributed to this decline, with the COVID-19 pandemic further disrupting vaccination efforts. Despite these challenges, countries like India have shown success in reducing the number of zero-dose children through targeted immunization programs.</p>

          <p>The Natural History Museum in London will display a newly identified dinosaur species, Enigmacursor mollyborthwickae, for the first time since 2014. This labrador-sized dinosaur lived about 150 million years ago and was initially misclassified as a Nanosaurus. Scientists concluded it was a distinct species based on unique features in its leg bones and the lack of bones in the original Nanosaurus specimen. The discovery should help scientists understand the diversity of dinosaurs in the Late Jurassic period, filling gaps in knowledge about the evolution of bizarre, gigantic descendants.</p>

          <p>The prospect of lab-grown meat being served in restaurants raises questions about its environmental benefits and potential drawbacks. Lab-grown meat, officially known as cultivated meat, is biologically real meat grown from cow cells, offering a potential solution to the rising demand for meat and its associated greenhouse gas emissions. However, critics argue that the environmental benefits have been oversold, with some studies suggesting that the energy-intensive production process may not be as climate-friendly as initially claimed. As lab-grown meat becomes more available, the debate over its sustainability and ethical implications intensifies.</p>

          <p>Jim Cramer reports that AI stocks are rebounding as concerns about Chinese startup DeepSeek's potential to outpace leading tech companies diminish. The market's initial panic in January, triggered by DeepSeek's release of an advanced AI model, caused significant stock drops in companies like Nvidia and AMD. However, the recovery of these stocks indicates that fears about DeepSeek's dominance were short-lived, with the data center renaissance once again taking center stage. Cramer suggests this rally refutes the idea that China has surpassed the U.S. in the AI race. (not investment advice)</p>
