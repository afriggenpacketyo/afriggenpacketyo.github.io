          <p>Ronnie Rondell Jr., the veteran Hollywood stuntman best known for being set on fire for the iconic cover of Pink Floyd's 1975 album "Wish You Were Here," has passed away at the age of 88. His long and storied career included stunt work in numerous films such as "Blazing Saddles," "Lethal Weapon," and "Thelma & Louise." For the famous album cover, which represented a music industry deal, Rondell was set ablaze fifteen times, a particularly dangerous stunt as it required him to remain stationary. He founded the stunt company Stunts Unlimited in 1970 and is survived by his wife, a son, and three grandchildren.</p>

          <p>Labor Day, a federal holiday celebrating the achievements of American workers, will be observed this year on Monday, September 1. Originally established in 1894 to honor the labor movement's fight for better working conditions, the day now also serves as the unofficial end of summer for many. Most major retailers, including Target and Walmart, as well as grocery stores and fast-food chains, are expected to remain open, though some may have reduced hours. However, federal institutions such as government offices, banks, and the U.S. Postal Service will be closed in observance of the holiday, and Costco will also be closed.</p>

          <p>An opinion article argues that the dispute over China's proposed new, large-scale embassy at the former Royal Mint site in London is a microcosm of the complex UK-China relationship. The author posits that diplomatic buildings are potent symbols of national power and ambition, and China's plan signals its view of London as a critical global capital and a metaphor for its rise as a superpower. This long-term strategic investment is contrasted with the UK's recent sales of prime diplomatic properties for short-term financial gain. Despite some political and security concerns, the article suggests the project could ultimately benefit Britain by reinforcing London's global importance.</p>

          <p>The Oval Invincibles secured a dominant seven-wicket victory against the Southern Brave, strengthening their position at the top of the men's Hundred cricket tournament table. The team's bowlers were instrumental, dismissing the Brave for 133 runs, with notable performances from Jason Behrendorff and Rashid Khan. Chasing the total, the Invincibles recovered from an early setback thanks to a 101-run partnership between Jordan Cox, who scored 56, and Sam Curran. Curran, who also took three wickets, finished with an unbeaten 50 to guide his team to victory with 11 balls remaining, putting them in a strong position to qualify for the finals.</p>

          <h2>Exploring Debt Forgiveness Options for "Buy Now, Pay Later" Plans</h2>

          <p>With the rise of "Buy Now, Pay Later" (BNPL) services, many consumers are facing challenges with repayment, leading to questions about debt relief eligibility. As unsecured debts, BNPL balances can technically be included in debt forgiveness programs, similar to credit card debt. However, eligibility and success can vary, as BNPL is a newer form of credit and not all providers may be willing to negotiate settlements. The article suggests that direct negotiation with the BNPL provider, debt consolidation, or credit counseling may be more effective strategies for managing this type of debt before it is sent to collections.</p>

          <h2>BBC Analysis Highlights Ukrainian President's Strategic Approach in Latest White House Visit</h2>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>An analysis from the BBC notes that Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky appeared to take a more collegial and strategic approach during his recent White House meeting with President Donald Trump. Compared to a contentious visit in February, Zelensky adopted a more charming demeanor, even joking with a reporter about his choice of a suit over his typical military attire. This shift in tactics is seen as a deliberate effort to navigate the high-stakes diplomatic environment. The meeting, which also included European leaders, focused on the crucial topics of potential U.S. security guarantees for Ukraine and the prospect of a trilateral meeting with Russia's Vladimir Putin.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>A federal judge has issued an injunction to stop the Federal Trade Commission (FTC) from investigating the liberal watchdog group Media Matters for America. The probe was initiated after Media Matters published a report in November 2023 alleging that advertisements on the social media platform X were appearing alongside antisemitic content. U.S. District Judge Sparkle L. Sooknanan ruled that the FTC's investigation was a likely violation of the group's First Amendment rights, representing retaliation for engaging in constitutionally protected speech. Media Matters is also facing a separate lawsuit from X's owner, Elon Musk, over the same report.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Despite President Donald Trump's recent vows to issue an executive order changing how U.S. elections are run, constitutional law provides the president with little to no direct authority over their administration. The U.S. Constitution grants states the power to determine the "time, place and manner" of elections, while allowing Congress to alter rules for federal elections. The president is not mentioned as having a role in this process, a principle that courts have previously upheld by blocking parts of Trump's earlier election-related executive orders. His proposals to eliminate mail voting and voting machines would require congressional action, which is considered highly unlikely to succeed.</p>

          <p>The new musical "& Juliet," now playing at the Ahmanson Theatre, offers a euphoric and witty reimagining of Shakespeare's classic tragedy. The show's premise has Shakespeare's wife, Anne, intervening to propose a new ending where Juliet does not die but instead embarks on a journey of self-discovery in Paris. This updated narrative is powered by a catalog of hit songs from producer Max Martin, including anthems made famous by Britney Spears and the Backstreet Boys. The review praises the show's clever book, vibrant direction, and energetic choreography, calling it a feel-good dance party that successfully blends 21st-century female empowerment with a classic story.</p>

        </div>
        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>While there are no federal age limits for purchasing annuities, individual insurance companies often set their own caps, typically between 80 and 85 years old for immediate annuities. The article explains that these limits are based on risk assessment, as the buyer's age and life expectancy are key factors in pricing the guaranteed income products. The best age to buy an annuity depends on individual retirement strategy rather than a specific number. Purchasing in one's late 50s or 60s allows for potential growth in deferred annuities, while buying an immediate annuity closer to retirement can complement Social Security and provide a stable income stream.</p>

          <p>Beijing recently hosted the first "World Humanoid Robot Games," a three-day competition that attracted 280 teams from 16 countries. The event featured humanoid robots, primarily manufactured by Chinese companies like Unitree and UBTECH, competing in a variety of events including martial arts, soccer, and track and field. In addition to athletic contests, robots also demonstrated their capabilities in job-related tasks such as working as drug store clerks and hotel staff. The games are part of a broader Chinese government initiative to establish a world-class humanoid robotics industry by 2027 and promote technological advancement in the field.</p>

          <p>The recently discovered interstellar object, 3I/ATLAS, is generating new speculation from Harvard astronomer Avi Loeb, who has previously suggested such objects could be extraterrestrial artifacts. Observations from the Hubble Space Telescope show a glow of light ahead of the object but no corresponding cometary tail, leading Loeb to question if it is producing its own light. He proposes two possibilities: it is a rare radioactive fragment from a supernova, or it is a spacecraft powered by nuclear energy. While acknowledging the need for better evidence, Loeb has successfully encouraged NASA to use its Mars Reconnaissance Orbiter to observe the object when it passes nearby this fall.</p>
