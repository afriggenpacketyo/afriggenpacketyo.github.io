          <p>Carlos Alcaraz and Jannik Sinner are set to face each other in the US Open final, marking a significant moment in their burgeoning rivalry and in tennis history. This will be the first time in the Open era that two men have competed in three grand slam finals within a single season. Their dominance has been so pronounced that the final was widely anticipated, with the two players having already split the four major titles of 2024 between them. The match also carries high stakes for the world rankings, as an Alcaraz victory would see him reclaim the world No. 1 spot from Sinner.</p>

          <p>J.B. Pritzker, the governor of Illinois and an heir to the Hyatt Hotels fortune, is carving out a prominent role for himself within the Democratic Party. Known for his wealth, he has used his financial resources to support the party, notably bringing the Democratic National Convention to Chicago. He has also become a vocal critic of Donald Trump, whom he has publicly derided. While the article notes that Trump's recent ventures in cryptocurrency have made him wealthier than Pritzker, the governor's political influence and ambitions continue to grow.</p>

          <p>UK Prime Minister Sir Keir Starmer has initiated a significant reshuffle of his government, beginning with the move of Yvette Cooper from the Home Office to the Foreign Office. This change, prompted by the resignation of Deputy Prime Minister Angela Rayner, has led to a broader clearout at the Home Office, with new ministers appointed to work under the new Home Secretary, Shabana Mahmood. The shake-up aims to reset the government's agenda, particularly on tackling illegal immigration, and includes several other key appointments, such as bringing business executive Jason Stockwood into the House of Lords as a business minister.</p>

          <p>Red Bull's Max Verstappen claimed pole position for the Italian Grand Prix at Monza after setting the fastest lap in Formula 1 history. His time of one minute 18.792 seconds, achieved at an average speed of over 164 mph, narrowly beat McLaren's Lando Norris by just 0.077 seconds. The result was somewhat of a surprise, as Verstappen had struggled for pace during practice sessions. McLaren's Oscar Piastri qualified in third, while Lewis Hamilton will start in 10th place due to a five-place grid penalty, promoting his Mercedes teammate George Russell to fifth.</p>

          <p>Former President Joe Biden has chosen his home state of Delaware to be the location for his future presidential library and museum. A 13-person governance board, including former Secretary of State Antony Blinken and longtime adviser Steve Ricchetti, has been established to oversee the project's fundraising and development. The team faces the challenge of raising significant funds at a time when the Democratic party is somewhat fragmented. The cost of presidential libraries has escalated over the years, with the Obama Foundation setting a $1.6 billion goal for its center in Chicago.</p>

          <p>Barron Trump, son of President Donald Trump, has reportedly transferred from New York University's main campus to one of the university's other locations for the fall semester. While NYU officials confirmed the move, they did not specify the new campus or the reason for the transfer. This has led to speculation about his motivations, including the possibility of him attending the NYU program in Washington, D.C., to be closer to his parents in the White House. Barron had previously been enrolled in NYU's prestigious Stern School of Business for his freshman year.</p>

          <p>A large-scale conservation effort is underway at Point Reyes national seashore in California after a landmark deal resulted in the buyout of 12 organic dairy and cattle ranches. The agreement, mediated by The Nature Conservancy, frees up over 16,000 acres for a five-year restoration project aimed at healing the landscape and boosting biodiversity. The plan controversially includes using new herds of cattle for targeted grazing to remove invasive plants and allow native species to regrow. While the transition is seen as a hopeful step for conservation, it marks a painful end for multigenerational ranching families and raises concerns about the regional supply of organic dairy.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Hundreds of LGBTQ+ Catholics participated in a Holy Year pilgrimage to Rome, celebrating what they perceive as a new era of acceptance within the Catholic Church, largely credited to the late Pope Francis. A celebratory Mass for the pilgrims was led by a senior Italian bishop, who spoke of restoring dignity to those who have been denied it. This event, officially listed in the Vatican's Holy Year calendar, stands in stark contrast to 25 years ago when a similar pilgrimage resulted in participants being detained. Many attendees expressed that Pope Francis's message of welcome brought them back to a church where they had previously felt shunned.</p>

          <p>School districts across the United States are increasingly using Yondr pouches, a lockable magnetic case, to enforce classroom cellphone bans. With new regulations in at least 35 states, an estimated 2.5 million students are now required to place their phones in these pouches upon entering school, which they carry with them but can only unlock at designated magnetic stations. While some students and educators praise the system for reducing distractions and increasing engagement, others have criticized the cost, which can be up to $30 per student. Some students have also found ways to circumvent the pouches.</p>

Yadegari, who learned to code at age seven, developed the app to solve the tediousness of manual calorie tracking and is now balancing his CEO duties with his freshman year at the University of Miami.

          <p>China is intensifying its anti-corruption campaign within the financial sector, a move that analysts believe will ultimately boost long-term confidence and attract foreign investment by promoting cleaner governance. The latest high-profile figure to be investigated is from the country's stock market regulator, signaling a widening scope for the crackdown. While the immediate effect may be muted due to existing market uncertainties, the drive is seen as a necessary step to align with the expectations of international corporations and institutions. The campaign addresses the demand for a more transparent and predictable business environment in the country. (not investment advice)</p>

The remains, which include American, British, and Native American fighters, were found in shallow, hastily dug battlefield graves. Now, a team of forensic genealogists is attempting to identify them by building genetic profiles and searching for living descendants, calling it "the ultimate cold case." The team has already created profiles for two soldiers and is asking the public for help by encouraging potential relatives to submit DNA samples.</p>

          <p>The UK government will conduct its second nationwide test of the emergency alert system for mobile phones this Sunday at 3:00 PM BST. The system is designed to warn the public of life-threatening emergencies like extreme weather or terror attacks. During the test, compatible phones will emit a loud siren sound and vibrate for about 10 seconds. This follows a previous test in April 2023 that experienced technical glitches, including some users on the Three network not receiving the alert. While the government recommends keeping the alerts enabled, users can opt out in their phone's settings.</p>

          <p>Thousands of viewers tuned in for a rare live-streamed exploration of the depths of Lake Tahoe, one of the deepest lakes in the United States. A remotely operated vehicle (ROV) named "Emmy" descended over 1,500 feet to the lakebed, providing a unique view of the ancient ecosystem. The event, sponsored by environmental non-profits, aimed to raise awareness about the lake's unique biology and the importance of conservation efforts. Experts discussed the lake's 2-million-year history and its delicate underwater environment, while also dispelling popular urban legends about mob bodies being perfectly preserved in its cold depths.</p>
