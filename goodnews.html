          <p>France has refuted allegations made by Telegram founder Pavel Durov regarding interference in Romania's presidential election. Durov hinted that a Western European country, implied to be France, requested the platform to suppress conservative voices. The French Foreign Ministry called these allegations "completely unfounded" and emphasized France's support for Romanian democracy and its EU accession. They noted that the first round of elections was annulled due to electoral violations and Russian interference, suggesting the accusations are a diversion from real threats.</p>

The Phillies will explore closing options within their existing roster, including Jordan Romano and Orion Kerkering. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>Dermatologists advise against storing razors in the shower due to the moist environment promoting bacteria growth and corrosion. Dr. Hannah Kopelman recommends rinsing and drying razors thoroughly after use and storing them in a dry place outside the bathroom. Dr. Arjun Dupati suggests applying after-shave lotion and moisturizer to prevent skin infections. Both dermatologists recommend replacing razor blades after five to seven shaves or sooner if rust or irritation occurs.</p>

          <p>The Los Angeles Dodgers released Chris Taylor, their longest-tenured position player, to make room for Tommy Edman's return from the injured list. This move follows the release of Austin Barnes, signaling a shift towards younger, more productive players like Hyeseong Kim. Taylor, once a key player for the Dodgers, struggled to maintain his performance after elbow surgery, leading to his expendability. The decision marks the end of an era for Taylor, who played a significant role in the team's success in recent years.</p>

          <p>Seventy-five years ago, Lucille Ball and Desi Arnaz were looking for a way to save their careers and their marriage.

Desi Arnaz, a Cuban immigrant and self-taught showman, proposed an old-fashioned vaudeville tour to demonstrate their chemistry. The tour was a success, and CBS executives agreed to film a test episode, and Desi Arnaz rewrote the rules of stardom.</p>
