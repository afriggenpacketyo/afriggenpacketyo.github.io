        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Chinese customs authorities are intercepting smugglers of Pop Mart toys, particularly the Labubu and Molly series, due to soaring prices driven by the retailer's global expansion. Travelers are reportedly purchasing the toys overseas, where they are cheaper due to currency fluctuations or local discounts, and attempting to resell them in China. Pop Mart, founded in 2010, has rapidly expanded to over 500 stores in more than 30 countries and regions. Peng Peng, from the Guangdong Society of Reform think tank, attributes the high prices to both hype and international popularity, attracting interest from consumers and businesspeople alike.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Tesco is introducing AI technology with overhead cameras at some self-checkouts to reduce shoplifting, which has reached record highs in the UK. The system identifies when items are not scanned properly and shows a live-action replay to the customer, prompting some shoppers to joke about its resemblance to football's Video Assistant Referee (VAR). While some customers mocked the technology, others expressed concern over increased surveillance, with some stating they would avoid self-checkouts altogether. A Tesco worker expressed gratitude for the new technology, citing the challenges of monitoring multiple self-checkouts simultaneously amidst a high rate of customer theft.</p>

          <p>Tens of thousands of energy customers are set to receive compensation, potentially up to ¬£1,000 each, and may have debts written off following a scandal involving the forced installation of prepayment meters. Energy companies will pay over ¬£70 million in compensation and support to customers after a review by Ofgem revealed suppliers switched vulnerable customers to prepayment methods without their consent. The scandal emerged during the cost of living crisis, with energy firms switching struggling customers to prepayment, sometimes forcibly entering homes to install new meters. A new code of practice is now in place with stricter conditions for involuntary meter installations.</p>

          <p>Auto giant Stellantis has appointed Antonio Filosa, the North American chief operating officer, as its new chief executive officer, concluding a months-long search to fill the leadership position.

The company recently reported a 14% year-on-year decrease in first-quarter net revenues and withdrew its full-year financial guidance, citing uncertainties related to U.S. trade policy.</p>

          <p>The Japanese government is planning to distribute lower-priced stockpiled rice to consumers in rural areas in response to surging rice prices. After halting orders from major retailers to prioritize smaller businesses, the Ministry of Agriculture, Forestry and Fisheries will allocate 100,000 tons of reserve rice to smaller supermarkets and rice shops, with the government covering transport costs. The government aims to ease the financial burden on households as retail rice prices have doubled compared to the previous year. This initiative follows previous unsuccessful attempts to control prices through auctions.</p>
