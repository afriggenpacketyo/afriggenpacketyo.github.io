          <p>General Motors reported third-quarter earnings that surpassed Wall Street expectations, leading the company to raise its full-year financial forecast. The automaker's stock surged over 11% following the announcement, which also included a reduced estimate for the impact of tariffs. CEO Mary Barra expressed confidence in the company's trajectory, attributing the strong performance to the efforts of the GM team and a compelling vehicle portfolio. Despite a significant pullback in its all-electric vehicle strategy which impacted net income, the company is focusing on improving profitability in its North American and EV segments.

He credited Trump's policies, such as infrastructure and tax bills, for creating a positive environment for businesses, and noted the Federal Reserve's accommodative stance on interest rates. While initially concerned about Trump's tariff policies, Ackman stated that he now trusts the president's judgment and believes geopolitical risks for the market are declining.

          <p>Warner Bros. Discovery announced it is expanding its strategic review to include a potential sale of the company after receiving "unsolicited interest" from multiple parties. This news caused the company's shares to jump significantly in premarket trading. The media giant, which was already planning to separate into two entities, is now considering all options to unlock the full value of its assets. CEO David Zaslav stated that the interest from others validates the significant value of WBD's portfolio, which has been working to reduce over $40 billion in debt since the 2022 merger of WarnerMedia and Discovery.</p>

          <p>JPMorgan Chase CEO Jamie Dimon emphasized the importance of giving undivided attention during professional meetings, labeling the use of iPads or phones for emails as "disrespectful." He stated that proper meeting etiquette, including preparation and active listening, demonstrates passion and commitment to one's work. Dimon, who advocates for a five-day in-office policy, believes meetings should be purposeful, start and end on time, and always have a follow-up list. Experts suggest that taking notes with a pen and paper can improve focus and information retention compared to digital devices, which may lead to distractions.</p>

          <p>Japan's parliament has elected ultraconservative Sanae Takaichi as the nation's first female prime minister, following a period of political uncertainty after her party's poor election performance in July. Takaichi, a protege of the late Shinzo Abe, secured the position after her Liberal Democratic Party formed a new coalition with the right-wing Japan Innovation Party. Her government faces significant challenges, including public anger over rising prices, and will need to court other opposition groups to pass legislation. Takaichi is expected to pursue a hawkish agenda, including strengthening the military and revising the country's pacifist constitution.</p>

          <p>A new medical technology combining a tiny implantable chip with specialized eyeglasses is successfully restoring central vision for individuals with age-related macular degeneration (AMD). In a multi-country trial, over 80% of patients showed significant improvement, with many regaining the ability to read words and numbers. The "PRIMA" system works by using a camera on the glasses to send visual data to the chip implanted in the retina, which then converts it into electrical signals the brain can interpret. While the surgery is complex and requires extensive rehabilitation, the technology offers new hope for millions affected by this leading cause of sight loss.</p>

          <p>Despite bold predictions from tech CEOs that AI will soon write the vast majority of code, many software engineers remain skeptical about its current impact on productivity. While AI tools are useful for simple, repetitive tasks and creating quick prototypes, some developers report they can create messy, unworkable code that requires human engineers to fix. Experts argue that AI's true value is as a co-pilot for experienced programmers, not a replacement, as it lacks higher-level problem-solving skills. Studies on AI's productivity benefits have shown mixed results, and some engineers feel pressure from management to use AI even when it's not the best solution for the problem.</p>

          <p>An agreement has been reached to allow two British prisoners, Lindsay Sandiford and Shahab Shahabadi, to return to the UK from Indonesia, where they were serving sentences for drug smuggling. Sandiford, 69, has been on death row for over a decade, while Shahabadi, 35, was serving a life sentence. The transfer was granted on humanitarian grounds, as both prisoners are suffering from serious health issues, including poor physical health for Sandiford and mental health disorders for Shahabadi. The Indonesian minister for law and human rights confirmed the deal, and the pair are expected to be transferred in approximately two weeks.</p>

          <p>Certificates of deposit (CDs) currently offer returns that can outpace inflation, making them an attractive option for savers seeking to protect their money's buying power. While national average rates for one- to five-year CDs are below 2%, top rates from online banks are significantly higher, with some short-term CDs offering over 4% APY. Due to an inverted yield curve, short-term CDs of around six months to one year currently have higher interest rates than longer-term options. Financial experts suggest strategies like laddering CDs—buying several with staggered maturity dates—to take advantage of high short-term rates while maintaining a long-term savings plan.

          <p>In southwest Madagascar, where overfishing has devastated coral reefs and the livelihoods of coastal communities, a novel conservation project is underway to restore the fishery without restricting access. The initiative, led by the nonprofit Reef Doctor, involves building new, artificial reefs from limestone and seeding them with marine life to create new fishing grounds. This approach aims to address the root cause of the problem—poverty and food insecurity—which drives unsustainable fishing practices. By linking ecosystem health directly to human well-being, researchers hope to demonstrate that environmental interventions can also serve as effective public health solutions in one of the world's poorest nations.</p>

          <p>An American Airlines flight from Omaha to Los Angeles made an emergency return shortly after takeoff when pilots mistook static for an attempted cockpit invasion. The misunderstanding occurred because an intercom system used for communication between the cockpit and cabin had been accidentally left on. The resulting static noise led the pilots to believe a security threat was in progress, prompting them to turn the plane around. Passengers were left confused by the incident, which the Omaha Airport Authority later confirmed was not a security-related event. The flight was operated by SkyWest on behalf of American Airlines.</p>

The Blue Jays secured their spot after a dramatic Game 7 victory over Seattle in the American League Championship Series. With home-field advantage, Toronto represents an entire nation's hopes against a powerhouse Dodgers team featuring superstar Shohei Ohtani.

          <p>A potential tragedy was prevented at Hartsfield-Jackson Atlanta International Airport when police arrested a man whose family reported he was heading there to "shoot it up." The family alerted authorities after seeing Billy Joe Cagle, 49, livestreaming his intentions on social media. Police located Cagle inside the terminal and found an AR-15 rifle with 27 rounds of ammunition in his truck parked outside. Officials credited the family's decision to "see something and say something" for the successful intervention. Cagle faces multiple charges, including making terroristic threats and possession of a firearm by a convicted felon.</p>

          <p>UK Chancellor Rachel Reeves has announced a plan to boost business growth by cutting "needless form filling" and other red tape, a move the Treasury estimates could save firms nearly £6 billion annually. The proposed reforms include simplifying the company merger process and removing lengthy reporting requirements for over 100,000 small businesses. Speaking at an investment summit, Reeves stated the goal is to make the UK a more attractive destination for global capital. The announcement comes as the government faces criticism from some business groups over other policies, such as increased National Insurance contributions, that are seen as adding to their burdens.</p>
