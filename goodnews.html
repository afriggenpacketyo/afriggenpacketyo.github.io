          <p>As of Wednesday, May 7, U.S. travelers are required to present a Real ID for domestic air travel at airport checkpoints.

While Real IDs are now mandatory, individuals can still apply for them, and alternative forms of identification, such as passports, are accepted. Officials advise travelers to arrive at least three hours before their flights, especially if they lack a Real ID.</p>
