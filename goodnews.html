          <h2>Indian Batsmen Resist England After Ben Stokes Achieves Century Milestone</h2>
          <div class="timestamp">2025-07-26 13:56:13 EDT</div>
        </div>
        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>In the fourth Test at Old Trafford, India mounted a strong resistance, closing the fourth day at 165-2 in their second innings, still trailing England by 137 runs. This effort was led by an unbroken partnership between Shubman Gill (78*) and KL Rahul (87*), who defied an England attack missing its key player, Ben Stokes. Earlier, England's captain Ben Stokes scored his 14th Test century, a knock of 141 runs, propelling his team to a formidable total of 669. While England remains the favorite to win and clinch the series, India's determined batting has kept their hopes of a draw alive.</p>

          <p>A Japanese nutritionist visiting a Costco in Kyoto was impressed by the extensive selection of traditional and healthy Japanese foods not commonly found in U.S. stores. The article highlights six 'longevity foods' she recommends, including a wide variety of seaweeds like mozuku and nori, which are rich in essential nutrients. Other notable items included diverse soy-based products like freeze-dried tofu, seasonal Japanese produce, and convenient ready-to-eat healthy meals. The author noted the superior variety and availability of these items, suggesting they contribute to a healthier diet and wishing for more such options in American Costco locations.</p>

          <h2>Taiwanese Voters Reject Bid to Recall Opposition Lawmakers</h2>
          <div class="timestamp">2025-07-26 12:38:59 EDT</div>
        </div>
        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>In a significant recall election, Taiwanese voters have rejected the attempt to oust 24 lawmakers from the opposition Nationalist Party (KMT). The result is a setback for the ruling Democratic Progressive Party (DPP), which had hoped to flip the balance of power in the legislature where it currently lacks a majority. For a recall to pass, it required support from over a quarter of eligible voters in a district, a threshold that was not met. The outcome means President Lai Ching-te's administration will likely continue to face strong legislative resistance from the KMT and its allies, complicating his policy agenda.</p>

          <p>Slovenian cyclist Tadej Pogačar is set to claim his fourth Tour de France victory after maintaining his overall lead through the penultimate stage of the race. The final day into Paris is traditionally processional, meaning his lead is secure barring any unforeseen accidents. The 20th stage was won by Australian sprinter Kaden Groves, who secured his first-ever Tour stage win with a solo attack 16 kilometers from the finish. For Pogačar, this victory will cement his status as one of the dominant figures in modern cycling, adding another prestigious title to his already impressive career.</p>

          <p>The S&P 500 and Nasdaq both closed at record highs this past week, fueled by positive developments in international trade and a strong start to the second-quarter earnings season. A significant trade agreement with Japan and ongoing talks with China and the EU bolstered investor confidence. So far, a third of S&P 500 companies have reported earnings, with 80% exceeding expectations. Several major companies, including GE Vernova and Danaher, saw their stocks rise after reporting strong results, indicating healthy corporate performance despite broader economic uncertainties and steady interest rates from the Federal Reserve.

          <p>McLaren's Lando Norris has claimed pole position for the Belgian Grand Prix, narrowly outperforming his teammate Oscar Piastri in a competitive qualifying session. Norris set his fastest time on his first lap in the final session, while a small mistake cost Piastri the chance to beat him on his second attempt. The result sets up an intriguing race, with Norris now needing to defend his lead from championship rival Max Verstappen on the long straight after the start. With rain expected for Sunday's race, conditions could become chaotic, potentially playing a significant role in the final outcome.</p>

          <p>Christopher Kennedy, a 68-year-old dog trainer with no symptoms, was diagnosed with idiopathic pulmonary fibrosis (IPF) after a pre-surgery X-ray revealed scarring on his lungs. IPF is a progressive and fatal disease with no known cure, where scar tissue buildup prevents oxygen from entering the bloodstream. After medications failed and his lung function deteriorated, he was given less than a year to live. Kennedy ultimately received a successful double-lung transplant at the Cleveland Clinic, a procedure that has given him a second chance at life and a renewed perspective on training hospital therapy dogs.</p>

          <p>U.S. President Donald Trump is reportedly interested in visiting China this autumn, though a previously rumored September trip is no longer being considered, according to sources. Officials in both Washington and Beijing are said to be working on arranging a visit for October or November. One possibility is that Trump could visit China for bilateral talks either before or after attending the Asia-Pacific Economic Cooperation (APEC) summit in South Korea. Recent high-level diplomatic meetings between the two countries have been described as positive, laying the groundwork for a potential presidential summit later this year.</p>

          <p>As the Trump administration alters federal student loan programs, more employers are offering student loan reimbursement benefits to attract and retain talent. This trend is supported by a provision in the One Big Beautiful Bill Act, which permanently made employer contributions of up to $5,250 per year tax-free for employees. Companies like Nvidia and New York Life are among a growing number providing this benefit, recognizing the financial strain that debt places on their workforce. With federal options changing, these employer-provided programs are becoming an increasingly important lifeline for workers managing their student loans. (not investment advice)</p>

Her journey began after her own partner was captured while fighting for Russia, an experience that led her to oppose the war. In Ukraine, she founded "Our Way Out," an initiative that helps relatives contact captured Russian soldiers, provides proof of life, and delivers parcels. Krynina's work, which is supported by Ukraine's intelligence service, also aims to show Russians the reality of the conflict, though she faces condemnation from some in both countries for her actions.</p>

          <p>China has unveiled a global action plan for artificial intelligence, just days after a similar announcement from the United States, escalating the technological competition between the two nations. Speaking at the World Artificial Intelligence Conference in Shanghai, Premier Li Qiang called for international cooperation and proposed a global AI organization. The Chinese plan emphasizes integrating AI across industries and assisting developing nations in the Global South. This contrasts with the U.S. approach, which focuses on supporting American tech overseas and has involved restricting China's access to advanced semiconductors needed for AI development.</p>

          <p>Justin Bieber's surprise new album, "Swag," has delivered a potential song of the summer with its No. 2 hit, "Daisies." The article argues that the album's sound, a departure from Bieber's previous pop work, taps into the current cultural mood, favoring soothing, melancholic tones over high-energy anthems. Influenced by indie producers, the album features aqueous, R&B-inflected production that feels both comforting and complex. This downtempo yet engaging style reflects a broader trend in popular music, suggesting listeners are seeking more reserved and emotionally nuanced sounds for the summer season.</p>
