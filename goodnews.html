          <p>China's power grid has implemented a quantum-powered safeguard called the "diamond ring" to prevent catastrophic collapses. Designed by the University of Science and Technology of China in collaboration with the State Grid Corporation, this toroidal device uses nitrogen-vacancy quantum sensors to detect grid instability in real-time. This measure was prompted by recent outages in Spain, Portugal, and France, as well as instability in China's Xinjiang region due to renewable energy fluctuations. The "diamond ring" serves as a high-precision sentinel for power lines, addressing the challenges posed by the increasing reliance on weather-dependent renewable energy sources.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>New AI tools are enabling individuals without formal training to write software through a process known as "vibe coding." This involves using AI chatbots to generate code, significantly reducing the time and effort required for software development. This has allowed startups to rapidly prototype and launch products, opening up new possibilities for creators and disrupting the software engineering industry. While some experts predict that AI coding could eventually displace coders, others believe it will evolve their roles, with developers overseeing AI coding agents. This shift is lowering the barrier to entry for software development and fostering greater innovation.</p>

She was captured using a remote-controlled pen and was found to be in good health. Her owners express relief and joy at her return, while the rescue team highlights the importance of community and perseverance in reuniting lost pets with their families.</p>

          <p>Elon Musk is leaving his position as the guiding force behind the Department of Government Efficiency (DOGE) after 130 days, facing legal setbacks and clashes with Cabinet members. His departure is framed as the end of his "scheduled time" as a special government employee. Despite his exit, DOGE's work to shrink the federal bureaucracy and purge programs the president disagrees with is expected to continue. Musk's role had been confusing, with some lawyers downplaying his authority. He is set to return to his companies, including Tesla, which has faced financial setbacks.</p>

          <p>The Japanese government plans to boost rice exports in response to an expected long-term decline in domestic consumption. The Ministry of Agriculture, Forestry and Fisheries recommends exploring new overseas markets and supporting more efficient production. Target markets include China, Singapore, the United States, Hong Kong, and Taiwan. The government aims to increase rice exports nearly eightfold to 353,000 tons in 2030 from 2024 by increasing the acreage managed by export-focused farmers and reducing production costs to compete with foreign-grown rice.</p>

          <p>The German central bank, the Bundesbank, anticipates that inflation will remain on target at around 2%. In April, the annual inflation rate fell to 2.1%, the lowest rate since October, largely due to cheaper energy costs compared to the previous year. With oil prices remaining low, no significant change is expected for May's annual inflation rate. The Federal Statistical Office (Destatis) is expected to release its initial data on the May inflation rate, providing further insight into the country's economic stability.</p>

          <p>A Harris's hawk that had been terrorizing the village of Flamstead, Hertfordshire, has found a permanent home with a local falconer. The hawk, nicknamed "Bomber Harris," was responsible for dive-bombing attacks on about 50 people. The falconer, Wayne Housden, has been training the bird and has built an aviary for it. The hawk's behavior was likely hormonal or territorial, and Housden believes it was a captive-bred bird that had lost its falconer. The falconer plans to keep the hawk full-time and hopes to let it fly loose in the autumn.</p>

The memoir about their journey has now been made into a film, "The Salt Path," starring Gillian Anderson and Jason Isaacs.

He correctly spelled "eclaircissement" to win the bee, which celebrated its 100th anniversary this year. Faizan's win marks a return to success for Indian American spellers, who have dominated the competition for decades. His big splurge with his winnings last year was a $1,500 Rubik‚Äôs cube with 21 squares on each side, but this time, he said he‚Äôd donate a large portion of his winnings to charity.</p>
