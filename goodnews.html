          <p>University of Colorado head coach Deion Sanders commented on a surprising and consistent aspect of home games at Folsom Field: the strong smell of marijuana. In an interview, Sanders noted that the scent becomes particularly noticeable during a TV timeout in the second quarter of every game, which he humorously dubbed the "light-up quarter." The Pro Football Hall of Famer, who is entering his third season as coach, stated he has never been high and finds the recurring phenomenon new to him. Colorado is set to open its season at home against Georgia Tech.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>A growing trend sees multigenerational, high-value "trophy" ranches being listed for sale as heirs find it difficult to manage the properties or prefer to cash out their inheritance. Brokers report a significant increase in inventory of these legacy properties, some on the market for the first time in over a century, driven by family disagreements and a lack of interest from younger generations. Demand remains strong from wealthy buyers, partly fueled by the "Yellowstone" effect, seeking privacy and a connection to nature. However, the sales often represent a bittersweet end to a family's long history on the land.</p>

          <p>McLaren's Lando Norris set the fastest time in both Friday practice sessions for the Dutch Grand Prix at Zandvoort. Aston Martin's Fernando Alonso finished second, splitting Norris and his teammate Oscar Piastri, but dismissed the idea of competing with McLaren for a front-row start in qualifying. Despite his strong showing, Alonso believes Aston Martin's realistic competitors are Mercedes, Ferrari, and Red Bull. The sessions were eventful, with several drivers, including Lewis Hamilton and Max Verstappen, having off-track moments, and Lance Stroll crashing out early in the second practice.</p>

          <p>A U.S. federal appeals court has maintained a block on the Trump administration's plan to end Temporary Protected Status (TPS) for approximately 600,000 Venezuelans. The 9th Circuit Court of Appeals panel affirmed a lower court's ruling, stating that the Department of Homeland Security likely lacks the authority to terminate a prior TPS extension under the governing statute. The court emphasized that Congress designed the TPS system to be dependable and insulated from political shifts. This decision provides continued relief for Venezuelans who fled political and economic crisis in their home country.</p>

          <p>Republican Senator Joni Ernst of Iowa has reportedly informed confidantes that she does not plan to run for a third term in 2026, with a formal announcement expected next week. First elected in 2015, Ernst has risen to a leadership position within the Republican conference and has been a consistent supporter of President Trump's agenda. Sources indicate that she intended to serve only two terms before moving to the private sector. Her decision adds to a growing list of Senate Republicans who are not seeking reelection, creating an open seat in a state she recently predicted would remain solidly Republican.</p>

          <p>Governor Gavin Newsom and legislative leaders in California have reached a compromise with Uber and Lyft on legislation that will permit rideshare drivers to unionize. The deal allows drivers to engage in collective bargaining while maintaining their status as independent contractors, a classification established by the voter-approved Proposition 22. In return, a separate bill will be advanced that significantly lowers the insurance coverage companies are required to carry for their drivers. This agreement marks a major milestone in the long-standing conflict between gig economy companies and organized labor over worker classification and rights.</p>

          <p>South Korean President Lee Jae Myung's first summit with President Trump was marked by apparent personal chemistry, easing fears of a contentious meeting. Lee's preparations, which included studying "The Art of the Deal," seemed to pay off as key proposals, like a plan to revitalize U.S. shipbuilding, were received favorably. However, analysts caution that it is too early to declare the meeting a definitive success. Several major issues, including the formal details of a new trade agreement and the cost-sharing arrangement for U.S. troops stationed in South Korea, remain unresolved and could test the new relationship.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>With U.S. credit card debt surpassing $1.2 trillion, many consumers are seeking debt relief. Qualifying for these programs depends on the specific option and an individual's financial situation. For example, traditional debt consolidation loans typically require a good credit score and steady income, while debt forgiveness programs are designed for those facing severe financial hardship with significant unsecured debt. Other options include debt management plans offered by credit counseling agencies and forbearance programs from credit card issuers, each with its own set of requirements based on income, debt levels, and hardship status.

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>For savers seeking predictable returns with less volatility than the stock market, a certificate of deposit (CD) can be an attractive option. With a $30,000 deposit, current interest rates could yield significant earnings, ranging from over $300 for a 3-month term to more than $6,700 for a 5-year term. The main benefit of a CD is its fixed interest rate, which locks in a high return for the duration of the term, protecting savers from anticipated future rate cuts. However, this comes with a trade-off, as funds are inaccessible without penalty until the CD matures. (not investment advice)</p>
