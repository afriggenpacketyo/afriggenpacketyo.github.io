        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>The UK's Girlguiding organization has unveiled 72 new badges, marking only the second major update in its 116-year history to stay relevant to modern girls. The new awards were developed with input from over 20,000 girls and volunteers and cover contemporary topics like online fandoms, environmentalism, and activism. Younger members can earn badges for activities like "laughter" and "bee rescuer," while older girls can be recognized for interests in folklore, upcycling, and becoming a "booktivist." This initiative aims to build confidence and address current issues while maintaining the organization's core values.</p>

          <p>The UK government has confirmed a national inquiry will be held into the violent 1984 clash between police and miners at the Orgreave coking plant, a pivotal event during the year-long miners' strike. The confrontation, known as the "Battle of Orgreave," resulted in over 100 injuries and the arrest of 95 miners, though the subsequent court case collapsed amid allegations of falsified police evidence. Home Secretary Yvette Cooper stated the inquiry will address the "unanswered questions" held by affected communities for 40 years. Campaigners, who have long sought an investigation, expressed cautious optimism that the truth will finally be uncovered.</p>

          <h2>Mezcal Steps Into the Spotlight as Oaxacan Family Distilleries Expand Globally</h2>
          <div class="timestamp">2025-07-20 19:00:26 EDT</div>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Once overshadowed by tequila, artisanal mezcal is experiencing a global surge in popularity, transforming the fortunes of family-owned distilleries in Oaxaca, Mexico. The spirit, made from roasted agave, has evolved from a local tradition into a half-billion-dollar industry featured in high-end bars worldwide. This article highlights the story of the Hernandez brothers, who returned from the U.S. to expand their fourth-generation distillery, and their partnership with an American entrepreneur that helped elevate their brand. Their success reflects a broader trend of preserving traditional, handcrafted production methods while navigating international business, benefiting their local community.</p>

          <p>An AI-powered tutor named Khanmigo, developed by Khan Academy, is being piloted in over 200 U.S. school districts to provide personalized learning support for students and assist educators. The tool functions as a Socratic guide, prompting students to think critically rather than just providing answers, and helps teachers with time-consuming tasks like lesson planning. A unique feature allows teachers to monitor student conversations with the AI, which has raised both privacy concerns and safety benefits. The system can flag discussions about self-harm, creating a new layer of potential intervention for students in emotional distress.</p>

          <p>Following his victory at The Open, Scottie Scheffler is solidifying his position as the most dominant force in men's golf since Tiger Woods' peak era. The article details his remarkable run, including winning four major championships in the last four seasons and consistently outperforming his peers, who now view him as "the bar" for excellence. While Scheffler himself dismisses the comparisons as premature, his machine-like consistency and ability to close out tournaments have led many in the golf world to draw parallels. His success is attributed to a combination of elite tee-to-green play and a recently transformed putting game.</p>

          <h2>Coldplay's Chris Martin Issues Preemptive Warning to Fans Before 'Jumbotron Song' Segment</h2>

          <p>At a recent concert, Coldplay frontman Chris Martin humorously warned the audience to prepare themselves before the band's "Jumbotron Song," a segment where they feature crowd members on large video screens. The friendly notice comes after a viral incident at a previous show where a man and woman, later identified as executives from the same company, were caught on camera in an intimate moment and quickly separated. That incident led to professional consequences for the pair, with the male CEO resigning after an internal investigation was launched. Martin's new on-stage warning appears to be a lighthearted acknowledgment of the prior event.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>A parenting expert who has studied over 200 parent-child relationships emphasizes that teaching 'self-connection' is the single most important skill for a child's lifelong success. This skill involves the ability to recognize and trust one's own emotions, needs, and inner voice, which builds resilience, healthy boundaries, and authentic confidence. The article suggests that common parental responses, like dismissing a child's fears or upsets, can inadvertently teach them to distrust their feelings. The author provides practical tips for parents to foster this connection, such as validating emotions, modeling self-awareness, and celebrating a child's inherent qualities, not just their achievements.</p>
