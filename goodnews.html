          <p>Bernard Kerik, who served as the New York City Police Department commissioner during the 9/11 terror attacks and was an ally of President Trump, has died at the age of 69. Kerik's career was marked by both significant achievements and controversy, including a guilty plea to federal tax fraud and false statement charges, leading to a prison sentence. He was later pardoned by President Trump. Kerik's legacy includes his service during 9/11 and his efforts to rebuild the city, as well as his work in Iraq as the head of a provisional police force.</p>

Despite these issues, the White House maintains confidence in Kennedy and considers the report a transformative assessment of the chronic disease epidemic affecting the nation's children. The White House plans to update the report and has requested a $500 million funding boost from Congress for the MAHA initiative.</p>

          <p>China has reached an agreement to resume imports of Japanese seafood, ending a two-year ban imposed after the discharge of wastewater from the Fukushima Daiichi nuclear power plant. The agreement follows a meeting in Beijing, with exports set to begin once China completes necessary procedures. The agreement is based on China's participation in water sampling missions as part of the International Atomic Energy Agency. This move signals a potential improvement in relations between the two countries and a recognition of Japan's adherence to international safety standards.</p>

Emergency construction was approved after sections of the rail were deemed unstable, with crews placing thousands of tons of boulders and cubic yards of sand along the rail. The Orange County Transportation Authority (OCTA) estimates the total cost of the projects to be around $300 million.
