          <p>The Los Angeles Dodgers lost 4-2 to the Boston Red Sox, with starting pitcher Clayton Kershaw struggling and allowing four runs in just under five innings. Red Sox ace Garrett Crochet, a Cy Young candidate, effectively shut down the Dodgers' offense, striking out ten and stranding multiple runners despite giving up two early solo home runs to Shohei Ohtani and Teoscar Hernández. The Dodgers' comeback efforts were hampered by missed opportunities and baserunning errors, culminating in a frustrating loss. The defeat sets up a decisive rubber match for the series finale on Sunday.</p>

          <p>China's Ministry of Human Resources and Social Security has officially recognized "drone flight planner" as one of 17 new occupations, reflecting the rapid growth of the country's low-altitude economy. This emerging sector, which includes activities up to 1,000 meters, is being treated as a strategic industry by Beijing to drive innovation and economic growth. The new role involves planning flight paths for multiple drones, developing mission plans, and managing on-site operations. This designation is expected to attract tech-savvy young people and formalize a key job in the expanding drone industry.</p>

          <p>Emma Raducanu's run at the Washington Open has ended after she was defeated by Anna Kalinskaya in the semi-final with a score of 6-4, 6-3. Kalinskaya played an aggressive match, securing key breaks in both sets to advance to the final. She will now face Leylah Fernandez, who won a grueling three-hour marathon match against third seed Elena Rybakina. The result prevents a highly anticipated rematch of the 2021 US Open final between Raducanu and Fernandez, as Kalinskaya now vies for her first WTA 500 title.</p>

          <p>A research team in China is working to reconstruct the Houfeng Didong Yi, a legendary seismoscope invented nearly 2,000 years ago by the polymath Zhang Heng. According to historical texts, the ornate device could detect distant earthquakes and indicate the direction of their epicenter, a feat that has led some modern scholars to dismiss it as a myth. Using modern scientific principles and new clues, the scientists aim to restore the reputation of this ancient wonder.

          <p>New York Yankees captain Aaron Judge has been placed on the injured list with a flexor strain in his right elbow but has avoided a more serious ulnar collateral ligament injury that could have ended his season. An MRI confirmed the diagnosis after Judge experienced difficulty throwing, leading him to receive a platelet-rich plasma injection. While he will miss time, there is relief that the injury is not career-threatening, and he hopes to return in 10 to 14 days, initially as a designated hitter. The injury is a significant blow to the Yankees, as Judge leads the league in multiple offensive categories.</p>

          <p>In the wake of Ozzy Osbourne's passing, this article reflects on the cultural impact of the early 2000s reality show, "The Osbournes," which transformed the heavy metal singer into a beloved television father. The MTV series, which also starred his wife Sharon and children Kelly and Jack, pioneered the "reality sitcom" format by focusing on the mundane and chaotic domestic life of a famous family. Before the Kardashians, the show's blend of celebrity excess and relatable family dynamics captivated millions and won an Emmy. It set the stage for a new genre of celebrity-driven reality programming that continues to dominate television today.</p>

          <p>As England fans face the nerve-wracking Euro 2025 final, this article explores the science behind the intense physical and emotional reactions to watching sports. Psychologists explain that high-stakes matches trigger a stress response, releasing hormones like adrenaline and cortisol, which cause increased heart rate and other physical symptoms. This "fight or flight" response is a sign of deep emotional investment in the team. Experts advise fans to manage the stress by getting rest, eating well, and engaging in physical movement to release pent-up energy, reframing the nervous feelings as part of an enjoyable, communal experience.</p>

          <p>San Francisco is currently experiencing its coldest summer in 20 to 30 years, with average July temperatures running below normal and daytime highs struggling to leave the 60s. Meteorologists attribute the chilly, gray weather to a misplaced high-pressure system and increased coastal upwelling, which brings cold ocean water to the surface. While some residents are enjoying the temperate weather as a respite from extreme heat elsewhere, the pattern is unusual for this time of year. Forecasters warn that summer is not over, and hotter temperatures could still arrive in late August or September.</p>

          <p>The UK government is planning to reform licensing rules to protect pubs and live music venues from noise complaints, particularly from new residential developments. Under the proposed changes, developers building near existing venues would be responsible for soundproofing, and permissions for new businesses or outdoor areas could be fast-tracked. The government hopes these reforms will bring vibrancy back to town centers and support the struggling hospitality industry. The move follows several high-profile cases where beloved venues faced closure due to noise complaints from newly arrived neighbors.</p>
