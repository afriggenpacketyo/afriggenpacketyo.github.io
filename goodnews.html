          <p>A goods train from China arrived in Tehran via the new China-Iran rail corridor, marking a significant step in slashing delivery times between the two nations. This ambitious project, traversing several Central Asian countries, aims to enhance Iran's economic resilience and position it as a central transit hub, potentially connecting China and Central Asia with Europe. The corridor's launch occurs amidst rising tensions, including potential US interception of Iranian oil tankers and Israeli strikes, raising concerns about Iran's ability to evade sanctions and bolster its regional influence. The overland route enables Iran to continue its oil and mineral exports, reducing its reliance on vulnerable maritime channels, highlighting the deepening ties between China and Iran. This development is viewed with alarm by the US and Israel, who perceive it as enabling Iran's nuclear ambitions.</p>

          <p>Boeing's senior vice-president, Turbo Sjogren, emphasized the importance of Europe reducing its dependence on China for critical minerals, mirroring similar efforts in the United States. He highlighted that the aerospace supply chain is global, necessitating collaboration, and noted that programs developed in both the US and Europe will inevitably involve significant content from each other. Sjogren pointed out that US legislation since 1973 has aimed to prevent reliance on countries like China for materials deemed critical to the aerospace industry and defense as a whole. This reflects growing concerns about supply chain vulnerabilities and the need for diversification.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Faced with increasing tariffs, businesses are employing "tariff engineering" to reclassify products and reduce duty payments. This involves altering materials, dimensions, or compositions to fit into a different harmonized system code with lower tariff rates. While not inherently illegal, this practice allows companies to strategically design products to minimize duty liability, with examples ranging from adding cubic zirconia to lapel pins to altering clothing designs. Sectors like fast-moving consumer goods and garments find tariff engineering relatively easy, while highly regulated sectors like automotive and aerospace face greater challenges due to extensive validation requirements.

The new rules, approved by the country's health products regulator, are estimated to expand the donation pool by 625,000 people. Under the changes, all donors will be asked if they have had anal sex with new or multiple partners, and those who answer yes will need to wait three months to donate blood, but can still donate plasma. This move is seen as a significant milestone in reducing stigma and increasing the blood and plasma supply.</p>
