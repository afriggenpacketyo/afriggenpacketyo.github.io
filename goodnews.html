          <p>The BBC has launched an interactive tool, "Cooler Than Me?", which allows users to compare their local weather forecasts with those of cities across the globe. This innovative feature leverages Britain's national inclination to discuss and often complain about its climate, providing a playful yet insightful way to assess global weather patterns. The tool helps individuals determine if other regions truly experience more sunshine or if the UK's "green and pleasant land" perception holds true in comparison. By offering personalized meteorological data and comparisons, it aims to engage the public and potentially foster a deeper interest in global weather phenomena, all accessible through the BBC Weather website. This initiative provides a unique perspective on everyday atmospheric conditions.</p>

          <p>Scams targeting older Americans are surging, with federal officials reporting increasingly sophisticated tactics and substantial financial losses. The FBI indicates that seniors filed the highest number of scam complaints last year, experiencing average losses that escalated to $83,000. To counter this trend, AARP has launched "Senior Planet," a national program providing free fraud-awareness classes for individuals aged 60 and older. These classes educate participants on identifying red flags, recognizing fake communications, and resisting pressure to share sensitive information. The program, available online and in various states, aims to equip seniors with essential skills to protect themselves from evolving scam threats and enhance their digital literacy.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>The USA men's football team achieved a 2-1 victory over Australia in a friendly match held in Colorado, with striker Haji Wright netting both goals to overturn an early deficit. USA captain Christian Pulisic was unfortunately forced to leave the game in the 27th minute due to a lower leg complaint, following several heavy challenges. Despite Australia's physical approach and an opening goal from Jordy Bos, the USA maintained majority possession and generated more convincing attacking opportunities. This win contributes to manager Mauricio Pochettino's ongoing preparations for the young squad ahead of next year’s World Cup, while simultaneously denying Australia the chance to climb in the FIFA rankings.</p>

          <p>Yoshinobu Yamamoto delivered a masterful three-hitter, pitching the first postseason complete game in eight years, as the Los Angeles Dodgers defeated the Milwaukee Brewers 5-1. This dominant performance gives the Dodgers a commanding 2-0 lead in the National League Championship Series, shifting momentum to Los Angeles for Game 3. Teoscar Hernández and Max Muncy contributed crucial solo home runs, with Muncy's 14th career postseason homer breaking a Dodgers franchise record. Despite an early home run from Jackson Chourio on Yamamoto's very first pitch, the right-hander quickly settled, silencing the Brewers offense for the remainder of the game and placing the Dodgers in a formidable position to advance to the World Series.</p>

          <p>A television advertisement by Red Tractor, the UK's largest certifier of farm products found on supermarket shelves, has been banned by the Advertising Standards Authority (ASA) for exaggerating its environmental benefits. The ASA concluded that Red Tractor failed to provide "sufficient evidence" to support claims that its certified farms ensured a high degree of environmental protection. Environmental group River Action, which initiated the complaint in 2023, applauded the decision as exposing "greenwashing" and called on supermarkets to cease using the scheme. Red Tractor, conversely, criticized the ruling as "fundamentally flawed," asserting that its core purpose centers on food safety, animal welfare, and traceability, rather than comprehensive environmental standards.</p>

          <p>The Department of Justice has achieved its largest forfeiture action in history, seizing approximately $15 billion worth of Bitcoin from cryptocurrency wallets connected to a massive "pig butchering" fraud operation based in Cambodia. Chen Zhi, the alleged mastermind and founder of the multinational Prince Holding Group, has been indicted for wire fraud and money laundering conspiracy, though he remains at large. Prosecutors assert that Prince Group, also sanctioned by the Treasury Department, operated at least ten scam compounds where hundreds of trafficked individuals were forced to carry out elaborate cryptocurrency investment scams, defrauding victims globally of billions of dollars. This significant international crackdown aims to dismantle a vast criminal enterprise built on human suffering and widespread financial exploitation.</p>

          <p>California Governor Gavin Newsom has signed several key bills aimed at making artificial intelligence and social media safer for minors. Senate Bill 243 mandates AI companies incorporate safeguards against chatbots discussing self-harm and require regular alerts for minors that chatbots are not human. Assembly Bill 316 removes a civil legal defense for AI developers, holding them more accountable for harm. Additionally, AB 621 increases penalties for nonconsensual AI pornography, and AB 56 requires social media platforms to display mental health warning labels for minors. These laws reflect a concerted effort to protect children from technology's negative impacts.</p>

          <p>A driver in Central California was recently cited by the California Highway Patrol (CHP) for operating a Nissan Sentra equipped with a homemade license plate. The driver's creative handiwork, which featured hand-drawn "California" lettering, the DMV website, and a registration sticker, was ultimately deemed unlawful by authorities. While the CHP acknowledged the individual's "creativity" in a social media post, a fine of $197 was issued for violating state law, which strictly mandates the use of proper state-issued license plates on all vehicles. This unusual incident serves as a lighthearted yet firm reminder of the importance of adhering to vehicle registration and identification requirements.</p>

          <p>A man suspected of copper wire theft was criminally charged after being discovered inside a manhole in a West Los Angeles neighborhood over the weekend. Elliaz Natividad, 25, was arrested and subsequently charged with one count of attempted grand theft of copper materials exceeding $950 and one count of possession of burglary tools. This incident occurs amidst widespread havoc caused by copper wire thefts across Los Angeles, which have led to significant internet outages, darkened streets, and disruptions to emergency services.

Colonel Josh Wiitala, commanding the 509th Bomb Wing, emphasized the B-2's unique combination of long-range, high payload, and stealth capabilities, essential for undetected entry into enemy airspace. Major General Jason Armagost, who ordered the strikes, confirmed the mission's success, with F-22 and F-35 fighters escorting the bombers to deliver Massive Ordnance Penetrator bombs on deep underground targets.</p>

          <p>Instagram-parent Meta has introduced new content restrictions for users under 18, aligning content visibility with PG-13 movie ratings. These automatic protections, rolling out by year-end, will place teen accounts under a 13+ setting by default, requiring parental permission to opt out. The new rules block search results for terms like "alcohol" or "gore" and prevent teens from following accounts that regularly post age-inappropriate content. Instagram's integrated AI technology will also adhere to these standards, ensuring responses are age-appropriate. A "Limited Content" setting offers even stricter parental controls, reinforcing Meta's commitment to creating a safer online environment for minors.</p>
