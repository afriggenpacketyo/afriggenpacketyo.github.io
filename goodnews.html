        </div>
        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Overcapacity in China's manufacturing sector, coupled with weak domestic demand, has led to a surge of cheap exports, causing concern among global economies about potential harm to local industries. Despite tariffs deterring exports to the U.S., Chinese producer prices have remained in deflationary territory, while consumer inflation is near zero. However, economists suggest that this influx of low-cost goods could provide relief to inflation-hit economies, potentially leading to more rate cuts across Asia. For markets with limited manufacturing, such as Australia, cheap Chinese imports could alleviate the cost-of-living crisis and help lower inflationary pressure. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>Thomas Mann, a Nobel laureate and literary figure who opposed Nazi rule, is remembered as a cultural icon 150 years after his birth. Mann's works reflected his experiences as an exile and his political views, particularly his opposition to authoritarianism. He gained fame with novels like "Buddenbrooks" and "The Magic Mountain," and used his platform to speak out against the Nazi regime. After fleeing Germany, he continued to write and broadcast speeches, urging Germans to resist and holding them accountable for the atrocities of the Nazi era. His legacy includes both his literary contributions and his steadfast opposition to fascism. The optimism score for this article is 70.</p>

          <p>India's central bank exceeded market expectations by delivering a substantial 50-basis-point cut to its benchmark policy rate, bringing it down to 5.5%, the lowest level since August 2022. Reserve Bank of India (RBI) Governor Sanjay Malhotra cited significantly softened inflation and slower growth as reasons for the move, which marks the third consecutive rate cut since February. Despite better-than-expected GDP growth in the fiscal fourth quarter, the central bank maintained its full-year GDP estimate at 6.5%. The RBI also shifted its monetary policy stance from "accommodative" to "neutral," indicating limited room for further rate cuts. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>A federal judge has temporarily blocked a proclamation by President Donald Trump that sought to ban foreign students from entering the U.S. to attend Harvard University. The judge, Allison Burroughs, stated that Harvard had demonstrated it would sustain "immediate and irreparable injury" if the ban were enforced before she could hear from all parties involved. Harvard had filed a legal challenge, arguing that the proclamation was illegal retaliation for the university's rejection of White House demands. The ruling extends a previous temporary hold on the administration's attempts to restrict Harvard's international student enrollment. The optimism score for this article is 60.</p>

          <p>Despite concerns that artificial intelligence (AI) could lead to job losses and wage cuts, new research from PwC suggests that AI actually increases the value of workers. The 2025 AI Jobs Barometer report, which analyzed over 800 million job ads, found that both jobs and wages are growing in AI-exposed occupations, including those most susceptible to automation. The report challenges six common myths about AI's impact, highlighting that AI is driving productivity growth, increasing wages for workers with AI skills, and enriching jobs by freeing employees to focus on more complex tasks.

MSC's senior vice-president, Marie-Caroline Laurent, stated that the competitiveness of Chinese shipyards cannot be easily matched in the short term, particularly as the industry transitions to cleaner energy sources. Laurent acknowledged the U.S.'s efforts to revive its shipbuilding activity but emphasized that achieving this goal would require state subsidies and strategic asset retention.

          <p>Japan's farm minister, Shinjiro Koizumi, has suggested the possibility of initiating emergency rice imports to address soaring prices, indicating that no aspect of agricultural policy should be considered untouchable. This comes as the government continues to release rice reserves in an effort to lower prices, with stockpiles expected to decrease significantly. Koizumi emphasized that achieving price stability would involve considering all options, including emergency imports. The government is currently importing 770,000 tons of rice annually tariff-free under its minimum access commitment based on World Trade Organization rules.
