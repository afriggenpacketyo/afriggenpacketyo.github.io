          <p>China's Institute of Atomic Energy recently announced a successful test of a new passive heat removal system for its next-generation fast nuclear reactors, marking a significant breakthrough. This innovation is crucial for developing meltdown-proof, fourth-generation nuclear power plants designed for a closed-loop fuel cycle, enabling the recycling of radioactive waste. Integral fast reactors, which use liquid metal coolants, are more fuel-efficient than conventional thermal reactors and can even act as breeders. This advancement aims to enhance the safety and sustainability of nuclear energy production, supporting China's long-term energy strategy and contributing to global nuclear safety research.</p>

        </div>
        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>China's industrial profits saw a narrowed decline of 1.5% in July, a notable recovery from steeper drops in prior months, signaling the initial success of Beijing's efforts against damaging price wars. While the mining sector experienced a sharp profit plunge, manufacturing and utilities showed improved profitability. State-backed industrial firms still faced declines, but businesses with foreign investments and private enterprises recorded profit increases. Analysts suggest that the "anti-involution" campaign, aimed at curbing excessive competition, is beginning to yield positive results, though deflationary pressures are anticipated to persist until further industry consolidation occurs.

          <p>British tennis player Jacob Fearnley achieved his inaugural US Open main-draw victory, overcoming Spanish veteran Roberto Bautista Agut in a challenging four-set battle. The 24-year-old grappled with significant nerves, evident in his high number of double faults during tense moments, and was also impacted by a disruptive spectator. This win marks a notable milestone in Fearnley's rapidly ascending career, despite his relative inexperience at the highest echelons of the sport, having only recently cracked the top 50. He now prepares for a challenging second-round match against German third seed Alexander Zverev, who has previously defeated him twice this year.</p>

The 123-meter vehicle deployed eight dummy Starlink satellites using a new "Pez"-style dispenser, demonstrating a key capability for future operational flights. Additionally, upgraded heat shield tiles were successfully tested during reentry before the spacecraft splashed down in the Indian Ocean. While significant progress was made, challenges such as developing a fully reusable heat shield and achieving orbital refueling with super-cooled propellant remain critical milestones for Elon Musk's vision of making humanity multiplanetary.</p>

Among the items, chosen by competition-winning children, were a Kylie Minogue CD, a solar-powered calculator, a pocket TV, and a photograph of Princess Diana herself. Originally intended to remain sealed for "hundreds of years," the lead-encased wooden box was unearthed to make way for the construction of a new children's cancer center. This discovery offers a unique historical snapshot and a poignant connection to the late Princess's charitable work with the hospital.</p>

This stability also extends to Canadian business trips to the U.S., which held steady. Although the global business travel volume saw a modest year-on-year increase, the overall decline in leisure travel is largely attributed to normal seasonal patterns, rather than being directly linked to ongoing tariff policies and economic uncertainties.
