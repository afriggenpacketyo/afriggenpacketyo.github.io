          <p>The Oklahoma City Thunder defeated the Indiana Pacers 103-91 in Game 7 of the 2025 NBA Finals, securing their first championship since 1979, when the team was known as the Seattle SuperSonics. League MVP Shai Gilgeous-Alexander led the Thunder with 29 points. Pacers star guard Tyrese Haliburton sustained a right lower leg injury in the second quarter, later revealed by his father to be a possible Achilles tendon injury. The Thunder's victory marks a significant milestone for the franchise after its relocation. Optimism is present as this is a celebration of the sport and an important victory for the team and their fans.</p>

          <p>Kyoto experienced a record high of 10.88 million foreign visitors in 2024, with a total of 56.06 million visitors, the second highest on record after 2015. Despite the surge in tourists and related overtourism issues, a survey indicates high satisfaction levels among both foreign and Japanese visitors with their sightseeing experience. Temples, shrines, and historic sites remain popular destinations, although Japanese visitors are more bothered by the crowds. A lodging tax increase is planned for 2026 to address overtourism challenges. This survey shows the continuing appeal of Kyoto as a tourist destination.</p>

          <p>China's "panda diplomacy" is receiving renewed attention as Japan faces a potential zero giant panda moment, amidst escalating Sino-U.S. rivalry, which could motivate Beijing to stabilize relations with Tokyo. China's decisions on panda loans are typically revealed during high-level bilateral talks. Experts suggest a new loan may be announced during a possible visit by a Chinese leader to Japan later this year. Since 1972, pandas have symbolized friendship between the two countries, bringing economic benefits as tourist attractions. This gesture could signal improved relations. The panda has been used as a symbol of friendship for decades.</p>

          <h2>Parenting Expert Shares Phrases to Encourage Children to Listen</h2>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>A parenting expert who has studied over 200 parent-child relationships shares five phrases that parents should avoid using and suggests alternative phrases to encourage cooperation. Traditional parenting phrases can trigger a child's fight-or-flight response, while language that honors a child's autonomy can lead to better cooperation. The expert emphasizes the importance of creating conditions where cooperation feels natural by fostering respect, emotional safety, and involvement. These phrase shifts represent a deeper shift in how we view parenting itself. There are many things that parents can do to help their children.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Prescriptions for Mounjaro, a weight loss injection, will be available at GP surgeries in England from today, but only for those who meet strict criteria, including a BMI of 40 or over and specific health conditions. NHS England plans a staggered approach to reach those most in need, managing GPs' workload and NHS resources. Some GP practices warn patients who do not meet the criteria not to book appointments, and pharmacy trade organizations are concerned that demand will outstrip supply. Mounjaro makes people feel fuller, leading to weight loss, but requires monthly check-ups and is not suitable for everyone. Weight loss injections are becoming more and more available.</p>

          <p>China has become the world's leader in electric vehicles (EVs), with almost half of all cars sold last year being electric. This dominance is attributed to government planning, subsidies, and the development of a comprehensive EV ecosystem. China's BYD now leads the global EV market, surpassing Tesla. Government subsidies have made EVs financially attractive to consumers, and the country has built the world's largest public charging network. China is pushing forward with the transition to electric vehicles.</p>

          <p>An NHS Lothian psychiatrist hopes to set up a clinic offering ketamine as an alternative to electroconvulsive therapy (ECT) for severe depression. A private clinic in Lanarkshire already offers ketamine-assisted therapy to clients with treatment-resistant depression. Ketamine is a medical anaesthetic and while it is not licensed for the routine treatment for depression, it can be used 'off-label' by doctors and psychiatrists. There is growing interest in Scotland in its potential to treat severe depression. Ketamine could provide another alternative to patients.</p>
