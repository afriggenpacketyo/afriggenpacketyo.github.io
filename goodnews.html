          <p>Weaver Nut Company, Inc. has issued a recall for multiple batches of chocolate nonpareils sold across the U.S. due to potential undeclared milk allergens. The recall includes six lots of semi-sweet chocolate with "Christmas Seeds" colored nonpareils and fifteen lots of semi-sweet chocolate with white nonpareils. The FDA warns that individuals with a milk allergy or sensitivity could face serious or life-threatening allergic reactions if they consume the affected products. The issue was discovered following a complaint from a wholesale customer, and no illnesses have been reported to date. </p>

          <p>Jobe Bellingham scored on his first start for Borussia Dortmund, inevitably drawing comparisons to his brother Jude, who also scored on his first start for the club. The 19-year-old scored 45 minutes into his full debut in a 4-3 defeat of Mamelodi Sundowns in the Club World Cup. Jobe's goal showcased his anticipation, poise, agility, and ruthlessness, mirroring some of the qualities that made Jude a successful player for Dortmund before his move to Real Madrid. The goal capped a fine display on his full debut, and by his own admission, it's something the former Sunderland midfielder has been working on. </p>

          <p>The UK recorded its hottest day of the year so far, with temperatures surpassing 33C, as a Met Office warning for thunderstorms comes into force. An amber heat-health alert remains in place for England, with research suggesting nearly 600 people could die due to the heat. Passengers were evacuated from a train in south London due to a fault, and humidity has been increasing, making the heat more uncomfortable. While heatwave conditions are likely to continue, some relief is anticipated on Sunday, with cooler air gradually sweeping in from the west. </p>

          <p>Mahmoud Khalil, a Columbia University activist recently released from immigration detention, asserts that the Trump administration has failed to suppress pro-Palestinian voices. Speaking after his release, Khalil vowed to continue advocating for Palestinian rights and criticized the White House for attempting to dehumanize dissenters. New York Congresswoman Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez joined Khalil, stating his release indicates the Trump administration is losing its legal battle to deport migrants advocating for Palestinians. The Trump administration has vowed to appeal his release as it continues efforts to remove him from the US. </p>
