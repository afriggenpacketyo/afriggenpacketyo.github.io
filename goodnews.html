          <p>The Chinese city of Suzhou is making a concerted effort to transform itself into a world-class biopharmaceutical hub, with the ambitious goal of rivaling Boston. Already home to 3,800 biopharma companies, the city is offering significant subsidies to attract more top-tier international and domestic firms to establish regional headquarters there. By 2030, Suzhou's strategic plan aims to host over 10,000 companies and generate more than 1 trillion yuan in output value. This initiative is supported by academic partnerships, such as a new pharmacy academy co-founded by Xian Jiaotong-Liverpool University, to cultivate future leaders in drug innovation.</p>

          <p>NASA's James Webb Space Telescope has discovered a new, small moon orbiting Uranus, temporarily designated S/2025 U1. The satellite is estimated to be only about six miles in diameter, which likely explains why it was not detected by the Voyager 2 spacecraft during its 1986 flyby. This discovery brings the total number of known moons around the ice giant to 29. Researchers believe the complex system of small inner moons and faint rings around Uranus suggests a chaotic evolutionary history. The new moon will be officially named by the International Astronomical Union, following tradition.</p>

        </div>
        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>An opinion article argues that China's remembrance of its victory against Japanese aggression in World War II is not about inciting hatred, but about reflecting on historical truth and sacrifice. The author contends that it is possible for Chinese citizens to condemn the brutality of the wartime Japanese military while simultaneously embracing modern Japanese culture, such as anime and manga. The piece pushes back against overseas criticism that such commemorations are a form of hostile education. It posits that remembering the past is about understanding history and honoring resilience, not about fostering vengeance against the Japanese people of today.</p>

          <p>Federal authorities have charged Ethan Foltz, a 22-year-old from Oregon, with developing and operating a powerful botnet known as "Rapper Bot." This network of infected devices was allegedly used to conduct large-scale distributed denial-of-service (DDoS) attacks for paying customers, targeting victims in over 80 countries, including U.S. government and tech company networks. Prosecutors describe the botnet as one of the most sophisticated DDoS-for-hire services in existence, controlling up to 95,000 devices. Law enforcement officials disabled the botnet after executing a search warrant at Foltz's home as part of an international operation.</p>

The match, played in a festive atmosphere, was part of a new format designed to attract top singles stars with a significant prize pool. Draper and Pegula showcased superior doubles experience, winning 4-2, 4-2, and later advanced to the semi-finals. The event has polarized opinion, with some traditionalists and doubles specialists viewing it as a "glorified exhibition" that devalues the Grand Slam competition.</p>

          <p>Home Depot's stock increased by 3% after the retailer maintained its full-year sales outlook, projecting a 2.8% growth in total sales. This occurred even though the company's second-quarter earnings and revenue fell slightly short of Wall Street's expectations for the first time since 2014. The company noted that while homeowners still exhibit a "deferral mindset" regarding large projects due to economic uncertainty, it saw momentum build throughout the quarter, with big-ticket transactions rising. Home Depot is also expanding its focus on professional contractors through acquisitions like SRS Distribution to drive future growth. (not investment advice)</p>

          <h2>"Abundance Liberalism" Emerges as a New Vision for Democrats, but Faces Political Hurdles</h2>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>As the Democratic Party seeks a new, positive vision following recent electoral setbacks, a philosophy known as "abundance liberalism" is gaining traction among party elites. Championed by writers like Ezra Klein and Derek Thompson, this approach advocates for overcoming bureaucratic hurdles to build more of what society needs, such as clean energy, infrastructure, and especially affordable housing. However, the article suggests this pro-development stance can be politically treacherous. It points to high-powered suburbs as places where such policies often face strong local opposition, highlighting the challenge of translating the abundance vision into practice.</p>

          <p>Chinese electric vehicle giant BYD has registered a local unit in Argentina as a car manufacturer, fueling speculation that it may establish a production plant in the country. The filing authorizes BYD Auto Argentina not just to import and sell vehicles but also to manufacture them, along with batteries and parts. This move aligns with BYD's announced regional expansion into Latin American markets, including Brazil, where it is building its largest production base outside of China. If realized, the factory would be BYD's second in Latin America, significantly boosting its presence in the region's auto market.</p>

          <p>This opinion article argues that President Trump's recent diplomatic engagements, including a White House summit with Ukrainian and European leaders, have raised the prospects for ending the war in Ukraine. The author suggests that despite formidable obstacles, such as ongoing Russian aggression and complex negotiations over security guarantees, Trump has the ability to keep the peace process on track. To succeed, the article suggests Trump should amplify his willingness to back Ukraine's security, use strategic ambiguity to pressure Russia, and signal support for further military assistance to Kyiv if a deal is not reached.</p>

          <p>Major restaurant chains like McDonald's, Starbucks, and Dunkin' are heavily investing in new and customized beverage offerings to drive sales, particularly among Gen Z consumers. The number of drink options on menus has grown over 9%, with a strong emphasis on cold, flavorful, and unique items like "dirty sodas" and protein-infused cold foam. This strategy shift comes as data shows consumers are increasingly making trips specifically for a beverage "pick-me-up" rather than as a food add-on. As competition intensifies, chains are betting that buzzy and innovative drinks can reverse sales slumps in a challenging economic environment. (not investment advice)</p>
