        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>India is taking steps to develop its domestic rare earth element (REE) supplies in response to China's restrictions on REE exports, which have caused shortages in various industries. With the world's third-largest reserves of REEs and significant beach sand mineral deposits, India has the potential to become an alternative to China in the sector. However, India currently lacks advanced separation and refining technology, specialized technical expertise, and adequate infrastructure in mining regions, requiring significant public and private investment to realize its potential. </p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Coffee's global consumption is deeply rooted in culture, colonialism, and even rebellion, with traditions varying widely across different countries. From the Ethiopian coffee ceremony to Turkey's coffee ground readings and Vietnam's egg coffee, the beverage has played a ritualistic and social role throughout history. Rising global temperatures and erratic rainfall are impacting coffee farmers, but the beverage remains an integral part of world culture. Cafes have also served as incubators of ideas and revolution, fostering social and intellectual exchange. </p>

          <p>The Japanese government is launching a 100 billion yen policy package to attract foreign researchers, aiming to create a top-tier research environment. This initiative is partly motivated by the departure of researchers from the United States due to funding cuts and prioritization of American students. The policy will fund existing programs and aims to raise salaries and reduce administrative burdens for researchers. The goal is to enhance Japan's competitiveness in fields like AI and semiconductors and improve its ranking in scientific research. </p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Following the United States' imposition of tariffs on imports from China, Beijing is encouraging the use of domestic letters of credit (L/Cs) to help Chinese exporters shift their focus to the domestic market. Domestic L/Cs, similar to international ones, guarantee payment security and enhance credit for Chinese firms. Unlike international L/Cs, domestic versions can be used for both physical goods and services. </p>
