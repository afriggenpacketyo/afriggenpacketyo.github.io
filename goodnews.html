          <div class="timestamp">2025-08-22 17:20:31 EDT</div>
        </div>
        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Ether, a prominent cryptocurrency, achieved a new record high for the first time since 2021, directly influenced by Federal Reserve Chair Jerome Powell's speech hinting at potential interest rate cuts. Powell's remarks from Jackson Hole suggested a possible adjustment to the restrictive policy stance, causing a rapid market repositioning and significant short liquidations in Ether. This development signals a perceived alignment between the administration and the Fed on easing monetary policy, fueling renewed momentum in the crypto and tech sectors. The Ethereum blockchain's role in powering over half of all stablecoins, which account for 40% of blockchain fees, further underscores its market relevance. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>The U.S. government has acquired a 10% equity stake in chipmaker Intel through an $8.9 billion investment, primarily converting existing CHIPS Act grants and additional secure chip program awards into common stock. This action, championed by Commerce Secretary Howard Lutnick and President Trump, signifies a notable expansion of government influence in the private sector and a shift in U.S. industrial policy aimed at bolstering domestic advanced chip manufacturing. Despite the significant government ownership, Intel confirmed that the U.S. will not have a board seat or direct governance rights. This deal reflects ongoing efforts to enhance America's technological independence, even as Intel faces challenges in the competitive semiconductor market. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>The Dow Jones Industrial Average surged by 845 points, marking one of Wall Street's most significant gains in months, after Federal Reserve Chair Jerome Powell hinted at potential interest rate cuts during his annual address at Jackson Hole. Powell stated that current economic conditions "may warrant adjusting our policy stance," signaling a possible shift in monetary policy. This indication comes amidst ongoing pressure from President Trump and the Fed's careful assessment of inflation and the labor market, which Powell noted has "slowed considerably." The market reacted positively, with traders now assigning an 83% probability of a rate cut at the upcoming September Federal Open Market Committee meeting. (not investment advice)</p>

          <h2>Federal Reserve Signals Rate Cuts, But Long-Term Economic Outlook Remains Unstable Amidst Trump's Trade Policies</h2>
          <div class="timestamp">2025-08-22 16:48:46 EDT</div>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>The Federal Reserve is poised to cut interest rates, leading to a stock market rally, but Fed Chair Jerome Powell warned that long-term rates may remain higher than pre-pandemic levels, indicating a more unstable economic outlook. This article explains that while rate cuts offer short-term relief, borrowing costs like mortgages are unlikely to return to very low levels, impacting home affordability. President Trump's trade war and tariffs are cited as contributing to rising prices and a sluggish labor market, creating a "curious kind of balance" that the Fed struggles to stabilize. Powell's cautious tone suggests the Fed's capacity to mitigate executive policy-induced economic instability is limited. (not investment advice)</p>

The Canada-born jockey's illustrious career, which spanned nearly two decades, included two victories each in the Kentucky Derby, Preakness, and Belmont Stakes, most notably sweeping all three with the legendary Secretariat. Their 1973 Belmont Stakes record of 2:24, winning by an astounding 31 lengths, remains unbroken. Turcotte's career ended in 1978 after an accident left him paraplegic, yet he continued as an inspiration and advocate for injured jockeys, leaving an enduring legacy in the sport.</p>

          <p>Cloud security platform Netskope has officially filed for an Initial Public Offering (IPO) on the Nasdaq stock exchange, where it will trade under the ticker symbol "NTSK," contributing to a notable surge in technology IPO activity. The Santa Clara, California-based company reported a significant 33% growth in annual recurring revenue, reaching $707 million, with total revenues jumping 31% to approximately $328 million in the first half of the year. However, Netskope is not yet profitable, having recorded a $170 million net loss, which is an improvement from the $207 million loss a year prior. This offering aligns with a particularly active period for cybersecurity mergers and acquisitions. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>Tennis legend Serena Williams has publicly revealed her use of GLP-1 weight loss medications, expressing her intention to diminish the societal stigma surrounding such treatments, especially for women. The 43-year-old, who achieved immense athletic success, admitted to struggling with weight loss after childbirth despite rigorous training, ultimately losing 31 pounds over eight months with the aid of medication. While Williams is now a spokesperson for a company marketing GLP-1 brands, her candidness is viewed by some experts as a "breakthrough" that could challenge stereotypes regarding weight loss methods. However, concerns persist about potentially undermining hard work, the emphasis on appearance, and the drugs' possible side effects.</p>

          <p>Welsh Fire secured a crucial eight-wicket victory against Birmingham Phoenix, thereby preserving their diminishing prospects of advancing to The Hundred men's knockout stages.

Notable performances included opener Stephen Eskinazi's rapid 42 runs, Jonny Bairstow's impactful 35 off 21 balls, and Steve Smith's anchoring unbeaten 47 from 36 deliveries. Despite this win, both teams remain on eight points, making qualification unlikely but still mathematically possible with two games remaining.</p>

          <p>Canadian Prime Minister Mark Carney announced that Canada will lift some of its billions of dollars in retaliatory tariffs on U.S. goods, a decision made after recent discussions with President Donald Trump. This move, effective September 1, aims to re-establish free trade for the vast majority of goods exchanged between the two nations. However, Canada will maintain its levies on U.S. autos, steel, and aluminum, matching its existing tariffs on these key sectors. While the White House welcomed the partial removal, Conservative leader Pierre Poilievre criticized Carney's action as a "capitulation."

          <p>Federal Reserve Chair Jerome Powell indicated that conditions "may warrant" future interest rate cuts, emphasizing a careful approach amidst high economic uncertainty during his Jackson Hole speech. He cited "sweeping changes" in policy and shifting risks between full employment and stable prices. While acknowledging a resilient labor market, Powell noted rising downside dangers and the risk of inflation from tariffs. His remarks, while cautious, were enough to send stocks soaring and Treasury yields tumbling, aligning with market expectations and President Trump's demands for aggressive cuts. Powell also reaffirmed the Fed's independence and commitment to its 2% inflation target. (not investment advice)</p>
