          <p>In a move to combat noise and air pollution, residents of Zurich, Switzerland, have voted in favor of severely restricting the use of leaf blowers and leaf vacuums. The new rules, supported by over 61% of voters, will implement a complete ban on gas-powered models within the city. Electric devices will only be permitted for use during a three-month period from October to December, with special permission required for operation at other times. Proponents argued the devices are harmful to microorganisms and spread fine dust, while opponents criticized the measure as an example of an overly restrictive 'culture of prohibition.'</p>

          <p>The Zombies, a key band from the 1960s British Invasion, are reflecting on their unconventional path to rock immortality, which saw their most famous work achieve success long after the group initially disbanded. Their first hit, "She's Not There," brought them early fame, but financial struggles and creative stagnation led them to break up after recording their album "Odessey and Oracle." The album was initially ignored but gained a cult following, with the song "Time of the Season" becoming a major hit a full year after its release. Now, decades later, the surviving members have been inducted into the Rock & Roll Hall of Fame.</p>

          <p>China is implementing an industrial 'pull system' to mass-produce rockets and satellites with the efficiency and consistency of automobile manufacturing. This new model contrasts with the traditional 'push' system by having final assembly stages pull components from suppliers only when needed, reducing waste, delays, and inventory. The strategy aims to enhance quality, lower costs, and increase flexibility in space system production. As global space activity is projected to grow significantly, Chinese researchers believe mastering this scalable production method will be key to dominating the future space industry and meeting the demands of an expanding orbital economy.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>A communication expert and former world champion debater advises professionals to avoid three common 'minimizing' phrases that can weaken their credibility at work. Saying 'It'll just take a second' sets unrealistic expectations, while 'No worries if not' signals that a request is low priority, even when it is not. Additionally, prefacing a statement with 'I'm not an expert, but…' immediately diminishes one's authority and conveys uncertainty. The expert suggests that professionals, particularly women, should instead be direct, provide context for their requests, and embrace their unique expertise to communicate more effectively and avoid underestimating their own contributions.</p>

          <p>An increase in retail chain store failures is leading to higher vacancy rates in shopping centers, creating rare real estate opportunities for small and local businesses. As national vacancy rates climb, landlords are becoming more willing to negotiate flexible lease terms and lower rents to fill empty storefronts, allowing independent businesses like wellness practitioners and boutiques to secure prime locations previously beyond their financial reach. While rental rates are still rising, the pace has slowed, creating a more favorable environment for non-traditional tenants. This trend is helping to revitalize local commercial areas by replacing cookie-cutter chains with unique, community-focused enterprises.</p>

          <p>For neurodivergent individuals who may face challenges with executive functions like consistency and decision-making, automating financial tasks is the most effective money management strategy, according to a financial coach. By setting up automatic payments for bills, savings, and investments to coincide with paydays, individuals can reduce decision fatigue and preserve mental energy. This approach ensures that essential financial obligations and goals are met first, freeing up the remaining funds for discretionary spending without guilt or worry. The coach emphasizes that this method helps prioritize financial health while accommodating the unique needs and energy limitations often experienced by the neurodivergent community.</p>

The details of the settlement are confidential. Dominion sued the former Trump lawyer in 2021, accusing him of knowingly spreading conspiracy theories that its voting machines were rigged, which caused significant harm to the company's reputation and business. This marks the third major settlement for Dominion, following a $787.5 million agreement with Fox News and a $67 million payout from Newsmax over similar election-related falsehoods.
