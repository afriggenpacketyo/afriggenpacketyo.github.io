        </div>
        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>The Federal Reserve has lowered its benchmark interest rate by a quarter of a percentage point, marking the first rate reduction of President Trump's second term. The move, intended to support a slowing labor market, brings the federal funds rate to a range between 4% and 4.25%. Fed Chair Jerome Powell acknowledged the challenge of balancing a hiring slowdown with rising inflation, stating the central bank's focus has shifted toward addressing downside risks to employment. The decision follows a period of sustained public pressure from the White House for more aggressive rate reductions. (not investment advice)</p>

        </div>
        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>The Federal Reserve's latest decision to cut interest rates by a quarter-point was accompanied by projections indicating two more similar cuts may occur before the end of the year. The central bank's "dot plot" revealed a wide disparity among officials' expectations, with one member, likely new governor Stephen Miran, advocating for much more aggressive reductions. Fed Chair Jerome Powell characterized the cut as a risk management measure aimed at a weakening labor market, while noting there was not widespread support for a larger half-point reduction. This internal division highlights the complex economic conditions facing policymakers. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>President Trump's state banquet at Windsor Castle featured a guest list heavy on political figures and tech executives rather than celebrities. Notable attendees included Apple CEO Tim Cook, media executive Rupert Murdoch, and OpenAI CEO Sam Altman, seated alongside UK political leaders like Prime Minister Sir Keir Starmer and Chancellor Rachel Reeves. The formal dinner, hosted by King Charles, took place in St George's Hall with an elaborate table setting for prominent American and British guests. The musical selection reportedly included some of President Trump's favorite songs, such as "Nessun Dorma," adding a personal touch to the diplomatic event.</p>

          <p>A bipartisan bill aimed at preventing financial abuse against the elderly and vulnerable adults is gaining momentum in Congress. The Financial Exploitation Prevention Act would empower financial institutions, such as mutual funds, to temporarily delay transactions they suspect are part of a fraudulent scheme. This legislative effort addresses the growing problem of elder financial abuse, which costs older Americans an estimated $28.3 billion annually. The House version of the bill was unanimously approved by the Financial Services Committee, signaling strong cross-party support for creating new tools to protect seniors from exploitation.</p>

          <p>Live Nation CEO Michael Rapino asserted that despite public perception of high prices, concert tickets are still relatively underpriced compared to major sporting events. Speaking at a conference, Rapino highlighted the immense demand for live events in a post-pandemic world, noting that touring is now the primary revenue source for artists. He argued that the average concert ticket price of $72 is a value compared to attending a professional basketball game.

          <p>Lyft's stock surged over 10% after the company announced a commercial partnership with Waymo, Alphabet's autonomous vehicle unit, to launch a robotaxi service in Nashville next year. Under the agreement, Lyft will manage the fleet's maintenance and depot operations, and the Waymo vehicles will eventually be available to hail through the Lyft app. This deal marks Waymo's first commercial collaboration with Lyft, as it has previously partnered with rival Uber in other cities. The partnership is a significant step for Lyft as it aims to integrate autonomous vehicle technology and compete in the evolving ride-hailing market.</p>

          <h2>Federal Reserve Rate Cut Expected to Further Lower Mortgage Costs</h2>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>The Federal Reserve's quarter-point interest rate cut is poised to provide relief for the housing market, as mortgage rates have already fallen to a three-year low in anticipation of the move. While many lenders may have already factored the cut into their current rates, the overall trend points toward more affordable borrowing costs for homebuyers and those looking to refinance. The decline is also supported by falling 10-year Treasury yields, another key influencer of mortgage rates. Experts advise potential buyers to consider locking in a rate now to protect against future market volatility. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>Ngozi Okonjo-Iweala, Director-General of the World Trade Organization, offered a surprisingly optimistic view of the trade disruptions caused by President Trump's tariffs. She framed the challenges as an opportunity to rebalance supply chains, open new markets, and foster a new era of "reglobalisation." While acknowledging the system has been heavily disrupted, she asserted that the WTO remains relevant, with nearly three-quarters of global commerce still governed by its rules. Her comments suggest a belief that the current protectionist trends could ultimately lead to a more resilient and diversified global trading system.</p>

          <p>Frontier Airlines CEO Barry Biffle publicly refuted claims from United Airlines CEO Scott Kirby that the ultra-low-cost carrier model is dead. Biffle argued that the U.S. currently has a flight oversupply issue and that his airline's lower operating costs allow it to cater to a distinct market of budget-conscious travelers. The exchange follows Kirby's prediction that rival discounter Spirit Airlines would go out of business. This corporate sparring highlights the intense competition and strategic divergence within the airline industry as carriers navigate post-pandemic cost pressures and shifting consumer demands.</p>

          <h2>Savers Advised to Consider Long-Term CDs to Lock in Rates Amid Fed Cuts</h2>

        </div>
        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Following the Federal Reserve's recent interest rate cut, financial experts suggest that savers may want to secure a long-term certificate of deposit (CD) to lock in current rates before they decline further. With the possibility of additional rate cuts later this year, a long-term CD offers a guaranteed return and protects savings from the variable rates of standard savings accounts. Even with rates already lower than last year, a $10,000 investment in a multi-year CD can still yield over a thousand dollars in interest. This strategy provides stability and predictable earnings in an otherwise uncertain economic environment. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>Tropical Storm Gabrielle, the seventh named storm of the 2025 Atlantic hurricane season, has formed over the central Atlantic Ocean. Forecasters anticipate the storm will remain over open water for several days, posing no immediate threat to land. However, the system is expected to intensify and could potentially develop into a low-grade hurricane over the weekend as it tracks north of the Caribbean. While its long-term path remains uncertain, current models suggest it could approach Bermuda by next week, prompting meteorologists to monitor its development closely.</p>

        </div>
        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>New research has found that wild chimpanzees in Uganda and Côte d'Ivoire consume a daily amount of alcohol equivalent to nearly two human cocktails through their diet of fermented fruit. Scientists measured the ethanol content in fruits like figs and plums, finding that while the alcohol level is low, the large quantity consumed results in a steady intake. This study provides direct chemical evidence supporting the "drunken monkey" hypothesis, which suggests that the human attraction to alcohol may have evolutionary roots in our primate ancestors' fruit-eating habits. The findings indicate chimps are exposed to a consistent low dose rather than becoming intoxicated.</p>

          <p>A new survey by InterNations has ranked the best countries for expatriates, with Panama, Colombia, and Mexico taking the top three spots. The ranking was based on factors like quality of life, ease of settling in, and personal finance, where Latin American and Asian countries performed strongly. The United States ranked 36th, falling outside the top 20 due to low scores in healthcare affordability and quality, as well as concerns over political stability. The results highlight a trend where expats are prioritizing financial security and a welcoming culture, finding these qualities more readily available outside of Western nations.</p>

While the team has a chance to win the Supporters' Shield for the best regular-season record, the playoff-determined MLS Cup holds greater significance for the club and its fans. With Messi now 38, the urgency to secure the title is mounting, especially as the club prepares to open a new stadium next year. The team's path to the championship will require greater consistency and discipline to overcome strong conference rivals in the high-stakes playoff tournament.</p>
