          <p>President Trump is expected to sign a deal allowing TikTok to continue operating in the U.S., classifying it as a "qualified divestiture" under a bipartisan law. The agreement, brokered by his administration, involves ByteDance copying and retraining TikTok's content recommendation algorithm for U.S. user data only, with Oracle providing security and hosting. A consortium of American investors, including Oracle, will hold a stake in TikTok. While the White House expresses confidence in the deal's compliance with laws, some lawmakers remain concerned about potential ongoing Chinese Communist Party influence through the algorithm, despite the administration's assurances of a secure platform.</p>

          <p>Taylor Swift has successfully obtained a five-year restraining order against an alleged stalker, Brian Jason Wagner, who reportedly attempted to enter her Los Angeles home multiple times. Wagner allegedly made "untrue" and "disconnected from reality" claims, including living on her property, being in a relationship, and being the father of her child. A criminal-history report revealed he previously wrote infatuation letters to Swift while incarcerated and even changed his driver’s license address to hers. The order mandates Wagner stay away from her properties, vehicles, and workplaces, prohibits contact, and prevents him from owning firearms. This marks another instance of Swift needing legal protection against stalkers.</p>

          <p>The UK government is exploring options to provide financial support to companies in Jaguar Land Rover's (JLR) supply chain, following a cyberattack that halted JLR car production since late August. With factories suspended until next month, concerns are rising that smaller suppliers heavily reliant on JLR could face bankruptcy. Ideas being considered include the government purchasing component parts to sustain businesses or offering government-backed loans. While a COVID-style furlough scheme has been ruled out due to cost and a desire to keep people working, the Business and Trade Select Committee is set to discuss testimonies from affected businesses.

          <p>The NFL's finance committee has approved the sale of a 2.35% stake in the Chicago Bears to existing team owners, valuing the franchise at a record $8.9 billion. This valuation marks a significant increase from $6.4 billion just a year prior. The stake, previously held by the estate of Andrew McKenna, will be distributed between the McCaskey and Ryan families, increasing their respective ownerships. The deal reflects soaring NFL team valuations, with other teams like the New York Giants also seeking high valuations for minority stakes. The Bears are also exploring building a new domed stadium in Arlington Heights, which could further boost their revenue.</p>

          <h2>Lithium Americas Stock Soars as Trump Administration Pursues Equity Stake in Miner</h2>
          <div class="timestamp">2025-09-24 16:19:18 EDT</div>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Shares of Lithium Americas surged 95% after reports that the Trump administration is seeking an equity stake in the Canadian mining company. This move comes as Lithium Americas renegotiates terms for a $2.2 billion Department of Energy loan for its Thacker Pass mine in Nevada, a joint venture with General Motors. The White House proposal aims to create a cash buffer and reduce taxpayer risk by taking a small equity stake in exchange for pushing out loan repayments. This represents the first such stake proposed for a Canadian company, highlighting a broader White House strategy to secure critical mineral supply chains for U.S. interests.

          <p>As U.S. debt levels reach record highs, many borrowers struggle to manage increasing balances and high interest rates. This article outlines critical mistakes to avoid when paying off debt, such as only making minimum payments, which barely reduces principal and prolongs repayment. Taking on new debt while attempting to clear old balances is another pitfall, as it erases progress and keeps interest mounting. Additionally, draining emergency funds to pay debt can leave individuals vulnerable to new borrowing if unexpected expenses arise. The article also cautions against ignoring professional help and failing to adjust underlying spending habits, emphasizing that delaying action only exacerbates the problem.

          <p>Paul Thomas Anderson's "One Battle After Another" is reviewed as an invigorating political thriller, adapting Thomas Pynchon's "Vineland" with a fresh, rebellious spirit. The film chronicles a fictional revolutionary group, the French 75, led by the formidable Perfidia Beverly Hills, portrayed with powerful intensity by Teyana Taylor. Leonardo DiCaprio plays her "pathetic" lover, Bob, highlighting his talent for portraying flawed characters. The narrative explores themes of liberation, ideology, and the relentless nature of societal struggles, with the director reorienting the story to focus on race and the impersonal violence of state power. The review praises Anderson's distinct sensibility, Benicio del Toro's performance, and the film's refusal to offer easy answers, underlining that the fight for progress is a continuous, collective effort.</p>

          <h2>Effective Strategies for Managing and Paying Off Multiple Debts</h2>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>In today's challenging economic climate, managing multiple debts efficiently is crucial, as high interest rates and living costs strain household budgets. This article outlines several structured approaches to tackle various debts simultaneously, including the debt snowball and debt avalanche methods. The snowball method prioritizes paying off the smallest balance first for psychological motivation, while the avalanche method targets the highest interest rate debt to minimize overall cost. Other strategies involve using balance transfer credit cards for 0% APR periods, consolidating debts with a personal loan for a lower rate, or exploring debt management plans and settlement for more severe financial hardship.

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>A new report reveals that the average credit card balance in the U.S. climbed to $6,500 in August 2025, with credit utilization rates exceeding 30%, signaling increased reliance on credit for basic expenses. This trend, coupled with average APRs over 21%, makes debt repayment challenging due to daily compounding interest. The article suggests several strategies to tackle this burden, including debt consolidation loans for lower fixed rates, 0% APR balance transfer cards for interest-free repayment periods, and credit counseling for structured plans. For severe hardship, debt settlement is an option, though it carries credit score and tax implications. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>With homeowners holding significant equity, many are considering borrowing large sums, and this article compares the costs of a $100,000 home equity loan versus a Home Equity Line of Credit (HELOC) following recent Fed rate cuts. Both options now offer lower interest rates than personal loans or credit cards. A home equity loan provides a fixed interest rate, offering payment stability, while a HELOC features a variable rate, which could benefit from further rate cuts but also risks increases. The article advises homeowners to carefully calculate current and potential future costs, considering the pros and cons of each product before leveraging their home equity.

          <p>Ukraine is escalating its domestic drone production and long-range attack capabilities to target Russia's oil and gas industry, aiming to "starve the Russian war machine." Factories, like Fire Point, are rapidly developing advanced drones and missiles, reducing reliance on imports and enabling dozens of nightly strikes deep inside Russia. This strategy focuses on economic damage, as Ukrainian officials believe Russia is more sensitive to financial losses than casualties. The campaign has reportedly hit 16 of 38 Russian refineries since August, leading to fuel shortages in Russia and prompting European allies to support Ukraine's efforts and target Russia's "shadow fleet" of oil tankers.</p>

The stand, designed to accommodate 5,000 spectators, is expected to create a formidable environment, contrasting with the "claustrophobic" setup of previous years. While practice days saw good-natured heckling and a European charm offensive, players acknowledge nothing fully prepares them for the pressure of Friday morning.

          <p>Deputy Attorney General Todd Blanche has ordered Ed Martin Jr., who leads the Justice Department’s "weaponization working group," to drop an inquiry into a retired FBI agent's involvement in the Sandy Hook defamation lawsuit against Alex Jones. Martin had sent a letter seeking information about former FBI agent William Aldenberg, implying an investigation into whether he broke federal law by helping organize the lawsuit. This move, which Jones had publicly framed as a DOJ investigation into "illegal law-fare," caused internal frustrations within the Justice Department. The withdrawal of the inquiry is a win for the Sandy Hook families, who faced harassment from Jones' conspiracy theories.</p>

Altman dismisses "overkill" worries, asserting that such scale is necessary to maximize AI capabilities and address the current "compute crunch."
