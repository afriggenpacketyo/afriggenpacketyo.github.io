          <p>China's campaign to manage local government debt has achieved a notable success, with Inner Mongolia being the first of 12 high-risk jurisdictions to be removed from Beijing's watchlist. This development, revealed in a local budget review, signifies progress in the central government's efforts to control financial instability at the provincial level. The national strategy, initiated in September 2023, aims to restructure and rein in debt in heavily burdened areas. Inner Mongolia's successful exit provides a model for other regions grappling with similar fiscal pressures. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>Danish pharmaceutical giant Novo Nordisk announced a 13% year-on-year revenue increase in its second-quarter earnings, reaching 76.86 billion Danish kroner. This growth was largely propelled by a 67% surge in sales for its popular weight-loss drug, Wegovy, which generated 19.53 billion Danish kroner. While overall revenues slightly surpassed expectations, Wegovy's sales were just below analysts' forecasts. The strong financial performance comes just days after the company adjusted its full-year guidance and announced a new chief executive. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>Driven by a surge in domestic coffee consumption and a zero-tariff policy, China is actively strengthening its trade ties with major African coffee-producing nations like Rwanda, Ethiopia, and Uganda. This strategic move aims to secure new supply chains and lock in supply amid global market uncertainties. Chinese companies, such as the rapidly expanding Cotti Coffee, are leading the initiative by signing deals for large-scale bean procurement and investing in local processing infrastructure. The effort reflects China's broader strategy of diversifying its sources for key commodities while fostering economic partnerships across Africa.</p>

          <p>The Reserve Bank of India (RBI) has decided to keep its key policy rate unchanged at 5.5%, a move that was widely anticipated by economists. This decision comes as India navigates heightened trade tensions with the United States, following President Trump's recent threats of increased tariffs over India's trade relations with Russia. In its statement, the RBI noted that while domestic growth is resilient, the external demand outlook remains uncertain due to geopolitical issues. The bank maintained its GDP growth forecast for the fiscal year at 6.5% while lowering its inflation projection. (not investment advice)</p>

He anticipates they might "swap paint again" but is certain it will not be deliberate.

          <p>Nineteen-year-old Venezuelan player David Martínez scored twice to lead Los Angeles FC to a 2-1 victory over Tigres UANL in the 2025 Leagues Cup. Martínez converted a penalty in the first half and later scored a skillful individual goal to secure the win. The result leaves the Mexican club Tigres in a precarious position, with their advancement to the next round dependent on an unlikely combination of other match outcomes. Despite the victory, LAFC's chances of advancing are also slim, as they remain behind several other teams in the MLS standings for the tournament.</p>

          <p>Max Muncy made a powerful return to the Los Angeles Dodgers' lineup, driving in four runs and hitting two home runs in a 12-6 victory against the St. Louis Cardinals. His performance provided a much-needed spark for the team's offense, which had struggled significantly during his month-long absence due to a knee injury. Muncy's comeback is seen as a crucial boost for the Dodgers, who were relatively quiet at the trade deadline and are relying on returning players to bolster their postseason push. The game also saw positive offensive contributions from other slumping hitters on the team.</p>

          <p>The Los Angeles Sparks extended their winning streak, securing a 100-91 victory over an Indiana Fever team playing without its injured star, Caitlin Clark. The Sparks' offense was led by Kelsey Plum and Rickea Jackson, who both scored 25 points, as the now-healthy roster continues to build chemistry and push for a playoff spot. The game was briefly interrupted in the second quarter when a sex toy was thrown onto the court near Indiana's Sophie Cunningham, the latest in a series of similar fan-related incidents at WNBA games. Officials and players quickly dismissed the object and continued play.</p>

          <p>The California Department of Corrections and Rehabilitation has announced the planned closure of a medium-security state prison in Norco by fall 2026. The decision is driven by a significant decline in the state's inmate population and is expected to save the state $150 million annually. The facility, which currently houses nearly 2,800 inmates and employs 1,200 staff, will be the latest in a series of prison shutdowns. The closure reflects the impact of criminal justice reforms and falling crime rates, with advocacy groups hoping the savings will be reinvested into community-based safety and prevention programs.</p>

          <p>After an underwhelming start to his MLB career followed by a shoulder injury, Japanese rookie pitcher Roki Sasaki is showing signs of a potential comeback for the Los Angeles Dodgers. Sasaki has been progressing in his throwing program, with encouraging velocity and a newly added two-seam fastball. The Dodgers are hopeful that the 23-year-old phenom, once a major offseason acquisition, could return by late August and contribute to their World Series push, either as a starter or a reliever. His return would provide valuable pitching depth and a potential boost for the team's postseason roster.</p>

          <p>Meta has announced that its messaging platform, WhatsApp, has taken down over 6.8 million accounts linked to fraudulent activities in the first half of this year. Many of the accounts were tied to organized crime syndicates in Southeast Asia that run large-scale scam centers, often using forced labor. The crackdown targets criminals who hijack accounts or use group chats to promote fake investment schemes. In response, WhatsApp is introducing new security features to alert users of suspicious activity, such as being added to a group by an unknown contact.</p>
