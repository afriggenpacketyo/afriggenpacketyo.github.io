          <p>Jerry Mathers, who played 'Beaver' Cleaver, fondly recalls the wholesome environment on the set of the 1950s sitcom "Leave It to Beaver." He attributes the positive atmosphere to his on-screen father, Hugh Beaumont, who was also a Methodist minister and ensured the cast and crew maintained a professional and kind demeanor. Mathers shared that the set was a fun place for the child actors, largely because most of the crew were parents themselves. He also spoke about his enduring friendships with his co-stars, including the late Tony Dow and Ken Osmond, and his continued appreciation for the show's positive impact on audiences.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>The UK's Labour government has made significant concessions on its welfare reform bill to avert a large-scale rebellion from its own MPs. Health Secretary Wes Streeting admitted the government mishandled the rollout and is now in a "better position" after listening to concerns that the cuts would harm disabled people. Key changes include limiting cuts to Personal Independence Payment (Pip) to new claimants only and ensuring the health-related component of Universal Credit will rise with inflation for existing recipients. Rebel MPs expressed satisfaction with the changes, suggesting the bill will now pass, though the episode has raised questions about the Prime Minister's authority.</p>

          <p>Amid market uncertainties, top-performing Wall Street analysts are recommending several dividend-paying stocks as a strategy to enhance returns. Jefferies analyst Andy Barish gives McDonald's (MCD) a buy rating, citing its brand power and potential for sales acceleration. Stifel's Simon Yarmak upgraded EPR Properties (EPR), a real estate investment trust focused on experiential venues, to a buy, noting improvements in its cost of capital and potential for external growth. Finally, Goldman Sachs analyst Neil Mehta reaffirmed a buy on oilfield services company Halliburton (HAL), highlighting its resilient international revenue streams and idiosyncratic growth opportunities.

          <p>In an opinion piece, author V (formerly Eve Ensler) reflects on finding the strength to resist and act in a political climate she describes as authoritarian and suffocating. She argues that survival depends on holding dualities: feeling rage but channeling it into purpose, and acknowledging reality without succumbing to despair. The author points to the power of collective action, like mass demonstrations, not just as protests but as events that build community and resolve. Drawing inspiration from women in the Congo and community organizers in the U.S., she calls for building local networks of care and believing that creating a better world is possible even amidst crisis.</p>

          <p>Fifteen years after its initial public offering on June 29, 2010, Tesla has transformed from a niche electric sports car maker into a trillion-dollar behemoth, with its stock value increasing almost 300-fold. An initial $10,000 investment would now be worth nearly $3 million. However, the company faces new challenges, including sluggish 2025 sales, an aging vehicle lineup, and increased competition. CEO Elon Musk is now focusing investors' attention on future technologies like autonomous driving and humanoid robots as the next major growth drivers, even as his political activities have been correlated with a decline in the brand's reputation.

          <p>Following the England Under-21 team's victory at Euro 2025, this article analyzes which of the triumphant young players could make the leap to the senior squad for next year's World Cup. Standouts like Newcastle's Tino Livramento and Liverpool's Harvey Elliott, the tournament's best player, are seen as strong contenders. The piece also discusses the career paths of previous U21 winners, noting that while many graduate to the senior team, success at the youth level is no guarantee of a legendary international career. The victory reinforces the success of the FA's development pathway, building an expectation of winning for England's emerging talent.</p>
