          <p>Google has launched AI Mode, a new artificial intelligence feature designed to provide more detailed and tailored responses to user queries. This feature, unveiled at the annual Google I/O developer conference, builds upon the earlier AI Overviews and represents a significant reimagining of the search experience. AI Mode summarizes information from multiple sources and provides a sidebar with relevant links. Google is also testing a "Search Live" feature that responds to questions based on video content and voice searches, with plans to integrate its latest AI model, Gemini 2.5, into the search engine soon. Some experts have raised concerns about potential factual errors and the impact on website traffic.</p>

          <p>Columbia University's commencement ceremony was marked by both celebration and protest, as graduates booed acting president Claire Shipman during her remarks. The graduates had experienced campus lockdowns and pro-Palestinian protests, leading to a mix of emotions at the ceremony. Shipman addressed the controversy, advocating for the free speech rights of international students and acknowledging the detention of a graduate, Mahmoud Khalil, by immigration authorities. The celebrations were also punctuated by anger, with some students chanting "Free Mahmoud" and protesting outside the university gates. Some Jewish students expressed mixed feelings about the day, citing antisemitism they had experienced on campus.</p>

          <p>The United States has accepted a Boeing 747 jet as a gift from the government of Qatar for use as a new Air Force One, a move that has sparked concerns among members of Congress. The Air Force has been tasked with rapidly upgrading the plane to meet security requirements, including missile defense systems and protection against electromagnetic pulses. While President Trump and the White House support the plan, questions have been raised about potential influence from Qatar and the cost of retrofitting and maintaining a third Air Force One. Senator Chuck Schumer intends to introduce a bill to block the acceptance of the gift.</p>

          <p>Elephants Billy and Tina have been transferred from the Los Angeles Zoo to the Tulsa Zoo despite ongoing protests and objections. The move occurred overnight to ensure optimal temperatures and minimal traffic. The L.A. Zoo cited the deaths of other elephants and the need for at least three Asian elephants in an enclosure as reasons for the transfer. Advocates had pushed for the elephants to be sent to a sanctuary, but the Tulsa Zoo was selected based on its larger enclosure size and existing herd of Asian elephants. The move took place despite pending lawsuits and a motion to pause the transfer.</p>

          <p>News of former President Joseph Biden's advanced prostate cancer has renewed debate over the benefits and harms of PSA screening tests. Experts note that while PSA tests can detect aggressive cancers, they also lead to unnecessary treatment of slow-growing cancers. Conflicting public health guidelines have created confusion, with some advising against screening and others recommending discussion with healthcare providers. Oncologists emphasize targeting aggressive cancers while monitoring less threatening ones. A new approach involves using MRIs and active surveillance before resorting to biopsies, aiming to reduce overtreatment and improve outcomes. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>A federal court ruled that President Trump illegally fired members of the Privacy and Civil Liberties Oversight Board, ordering their reinstatement. Judge Reggie B.

The ruling underscores the importance of an independent civil liberties watchdog and limits presidential power.
