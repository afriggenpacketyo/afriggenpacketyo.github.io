          <p>A consortium of lenders has put forward a new rescue plan designed to prevent the collapse of Thames Water, the largest water company in the UK. The proposal includes writing off approximately one-third of the company's nearly £20 billion debt and injecting an initial £5.4 billion to stabilize its finances. This plan is presented as a way to rebuild the financially distressed utility without requiring taxpayer funding, addressing fears of a potential temporary nationalization that have loomed for over two years.</p>

          <p>Leading European defense companies, including Saab, BAE Systems, and Rheinmetall, have voiced their support for a European Union initiative to establish a "drone wall" along the region's eastern border. This proposed multi-layered defense system aims to counter increasing security threats, particularly from Russia, following several alleged airspace incursions by Russian drones. While defense giants stand ready to contribute, some experts worry that bureaucratic hurdles could delay the implementation of what they see as an urgent and necessary security measure.</p>

          <p>Thomas Wolf, co-founder of the influential AI startup Hugging Face, has expressed skepticism that current artificial intelligence models can produce Nobel Prize-level scientific discoveries. He argues that today's models are designed to predict the most probable outcome and align with user prompts, a function that is contrary to the contrarian thinking that often drives major breakthroughs. While Wolf sees AI as a powerful "co-pilot" for scientists in research, he believes its current architecture is not suited for generating truly novel, paradigm-shifting ideas.</p>

          <p>Bridget Phillipson, the UK's Education Secretary, has described the two-child benefit cap as having a "devastating impact" and signaled that the government feels "a real urgency" to reform the policy. The rule, introduced by a previous Conservative government, prevents families from claiming key benefits for a third or subsequent child born after April 2017. With reports that the Treasury is exploring replacement options, there is growing expectation that the cap will be addressed in the upcoming November budget to combat rising child poverty.</p>
