          <p>The California Department of Corrections and Rehabilitation has announced the planned closure of a medium-security state prison in Norco by fall 2026. The decision is attributed to a significant decline in the statewide inmate population and is expected to save the state $150 million annually. The facility, which currently houses nearly 2,800 inmates and employs 1,200 staff, will not release prisoners early but will transfer them to other institutions. The closure raises questions about the future of the property, which originally opened in 1928 as a luxury hotel before being converted into a hospital and then a prison.</p>

          <p>The U.S. Department of Justice has arrested and charged two Chinese nationals in California for allegedly orchestrating an illegal export scheme involving tens of millions of dollars in sensitive technology. The individuals are accused of shipping advanced artificial intelligence chips, including Nvidia's powerful H100 GPUs, to China without the required export licenses. These chips are subject to strict U.S. export controls designed to prevent China from accessing cutting-edge semiconductor technology for military or strategic advantage. The DOJ alleges the defendants used their company to route the shipments through third countries like Malaysia to conceal their final destination.</p>

          <p>Japan marked the 80th anniversary of the U.S. atomic bombing of Hiroshima with a solemn ceremony at the city's Peace Memorial Park. Prime Minister Shigeru Ishiba and other international officials attended the event, where a silent prayer was held to honor the more than 200,000 people killed by the blast and its aftereffects. In his speech, Hiroshima's mayor warned against the global trend of military buildup and the growing reliance on nuclear weapons for deterrence. Survivors of the bombing shared their harrowing memories, calling for the abolition of nuclear weapons amid current global conflicts that echo the destruction they witnessed.</p>

        </div>
        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>A debate is underway among Chinese economists and policy thinkers regarding whether to include measurable consumption targets in the country's next five-year plan. Proponents argue that setting a formal goal for the household consumption rate—the share of consumer spending in GDP—is a crucial national strategy to boost domestic demand. They point out that China's rate was a relatively low 39.6% in 2023. However, other influential voices contend that such metrics are not operationally feasible as policy goals, highlighting a key point of contention as Beijing formulates its future economic blueprint.

          <p>Advanced Micro Devices (AMD) reported second-quarter financial results that missed earnings-per-share expectations but exceeded revenue forecasts, causing its stock to slide in after-hours trading. The chipmaker's revenue grew 32% year-over-year to $7.69 billion, driven by strong performance in its data center and client segments. However, the company's AI business saw a decline, partly due to U.S. export restrictions that eliminated sales of its MI308 chip to China. CEO Lisa Su expressed confidence in the competitiveness of AMD's upcoming AI chips against rival Nvidia and projected strong year-over-year AI revenue growth. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>A federal judge in Boston has issued a temporary injunction preventing the Trump administration from reallocating over $4 billion in FEMA funds originally designated for disaster mitigation projects. The ruling responds to a lawsuit from 20 states arguing that the administration unlawfully terminated the Building Resilient Infrastructure and Communities (BRIC) program. The judge stated that the move could cause "irreparable harm" to flood-prone areas and that he was unconvinced Congress intended for the funds to be repurposed. The administration had previously called the program "wasteful," but the injunction now freezes the transfer of funds while the court considers the case further.</p>

          <p>A massive copper mining project in Afghanistan, backed by the state-owned China Metallurgical Group Corporation (MCC), is reportedly making significant progress toward beginning extraction this year. The Mes Aynak mine, which holds one of the world's largest untapped copper deposits, was awarded to MCC in 2008 but has been stalled for 17 years due to security issues and ancient archaeological sites. The Taliban government has announced a shift to more costly underground mining techniques to help preserve the historical relics. This development signals a potential economic advancement for Afghanistan and a key strategic investment for China in the region.</p>

          <p>According to annual data released by the FBI, the United States saw a decrease in crime across every reported category in 2024, including violent crimes and property crimes. The report, compiled from data covering over 95% of the U.S. population, showed a significant 14.9% drop in murder and a notable 18.6% decline in motor vehicle thefts. This marks the second consecutive year of falling murder rates, bringing them closer to pre-pandemic levels. While experts note the positive trend, they also point out that aggravated assaults remain elevated compared to 2019, and the data only reflects crimes reported to law enforcement.</p>

          <p>The Los Angeles County Board of Supervisors has passed a new law requiring landlords in unincorporated areas to ensure their rental units do not exceed 82 degrees. The ordinance, aimed at protecting vulnerable tenants from the health dangers of extreme heat, will take effect next month but will not be enforced until January 2027 to allow for compliance. Officials cited the increasing frequency and intensity of deadly heat waves as a public health emergency necessitating the new rule. While landlords are encouraged to use passive cooling methods, the law will be enforced based on tenant complaints, with an emphasis on education over fines.</p>

          <p>Following a federal appeals court order, U.S. border agents have been directed to stop deporting migrants under the Trump administration's sweeping asylum ban, according to Department of Homeland Security officials. The court ruled that while the government can pause access to the asylum system, it cannot ignore laws that protect migrants from being returned to countries where they would face torture or persecution. This move effectively reopens humanitarian pathways that had been closed, requiring officials to once again screen migrants for credible fear claims. The original ban was credited by the administration for a historic drop in illegal border crossings.</p>

          <p>New Jersey has reached a landmark $2 billion settlement with DuPont and its affiliated companies to resolve claims related to long-term pollution from "forever chemicals" (PFAS) and other contaminants. State officials called it the largest environmental settlement ever achieved by a single state. The agreement requires the companies to pay for natural resource damages and to fund the extensive cleanup of four industrial sites across New Jersey. It also establishes a substantial reserve fund to protect taxpayers if the companies fail to meet their obligations. The settlement stems from a 2019 lawsuit over decades of pollution.</p>
