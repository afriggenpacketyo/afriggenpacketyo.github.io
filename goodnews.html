          <p>Rachel Reeves, the UK Chancellor, has announced a Spending Review that includes an extra ¬£29bn per year for the NHS in England, along with funding boosts for defense and housing. The review also allocates more money for artificial intelligence and transport projects, aiming to "renew Britain." However, some departments, including the Foreign Office and the environment department, will face budget squeezes. The government hopes that increased spending in health and investment in longer-term projects will reassure voters, while many departments will have to manage with frugal day-to-day spending allocations. The review reflects a strategic focus on key areas while managing overall fiscal constraints.</p>
