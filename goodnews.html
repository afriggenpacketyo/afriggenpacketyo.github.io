          <p>Chinese technology firm Baidu has entered the competitive open-source AI field by making its Ernie 4.5 models publicly available on the platform Hugging Face. This marks a strategic shift for the company, whose founder previously argued that closed models like their own would remain superior to open-source alternatives. The release includes ten variants, ranging from small to extremely large parameter models, as Baidu aims to compete with emerging rivals like DeepSeek. The company claims its models show superior performance on various benchmarks, signaling a new phase in China's AI development race.</p>

          <p>Germany's annual inflation rate surprisingly decreased to 2% in June, aligning with the European Central Bank's target and fueling expectations of further rate cuts. The drop was more significant than analysts had forecast, providing positive evidence that inflationary pressures in the Eurozone may be sustainably easing. Despite this optimistic development, some economists caution that persistent service inflation and volatile external factors, such as energy prices, continue to pose risks. The ECB is expected to proceed cautiously with its monetary policy in the coming months. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>A new trade deal between the United Kingdom and the United States has officially commenced, reducing tariffs on key exports such as British cars and aerospace products. The agreement allows UK automakers to sell up to 100,000 vehicles annually to the US with a significantly lower tariff, while tariffs on aerospace exports are eliminated. However, the deal notably excludes steel and aluminum, which still face a 25% tariff that could double if a separate agreement is not reached by the July 9 deadline. This uncertainty is causing significant concern for the UK steel industry, which fears severe impacts on its trade with the US. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>A new historical analysis argues that the United States, currently facing its own democratic challenges, could learn from the political traditions of Latin America. The article reviews historian Greg Grandin's book, which posits that Latin American republics have a rich history of grounding their constitutions in collective social good, in contrast to the U.S. focus on individual rights. Many early Latin American independence movements were tied to abolishing slavery and guaranteeing social welfare, ideas that later influenced international human rights law. This perspective challenges the conventional narrative of U.S. superiority and suggests the region offers valuable lessons in building a more just society.</p>

In an interview, she explains that for dogs, smells are not just good or bad but are crucial pieces of information that create their entire perception of reality. Horowitz notes that dogs can even perceive the passage of time through the fading of scents, meaning a person's presence lingers in a room long after they've left. This fundamental difference in perception creates a delightful mystery in the human-canine bond, even as we share our lives so closely.</p>
