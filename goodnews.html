          <p>Utah Senator Mike Lee has preemptively removed a contentious provision from the "One Big Beautiful Bill Act" that would have permitted the sale of federal lands for development. The decision followed significant backlash from his conservative colleagues, including senators from other Western states, who threatened to vote against the entire package if the measure was included. Lee stated that he could not secure sufficient safeguards to prevent these lands from being sold to corporations or foreign entities like China. He maintained his belief that the federal government mismanages too much land but conceded to the opposition to ensure the larger bill could proceed.</p>

          <p>President Donald Trump announced in a Fox News interview that he has secured a buyer for the social media app TikTok, which faces a US ban over national security concerns. Trump stated a group of "very wealthy people" is prepared to acquire the platform from its Chinese parent company, ByteDance, and that he expects the Chinese government will approve the sale. This development comes as Trump has repeatedly used executive actions to delay the enforcement of a congressional law mandating the app's sale. The potential deal offers a path for TikTok to continue operating in the US, pending regulatory approvals.</p>

          <p>A report from the Financial Times has revealed that insiders at the AI chipmaker Nvidia, including CEO Jensen Huang, have sold more than $1 billion of the company's stock over the past year. Approximately half of these sales occurred in the last month as the company's stock value surged to record highs. The transactions were conducted under pre-arranged trading plans, a common practice for corporate executives to sell shares without being accused of insider trading. The sales coincide with Nvidia recently regaining its position as the world's most valuable company, surpassing Microsoft and Apple.</p>

          <p>Throughout June, communities across the globe have held Pride Month events, celebrating the LGBTQ community while continuing the fight for equality and inclusion. These parades and festivals trace their origins to the 1969 Stonewall Uprising in New York City, a pivotal moment that is widely considered the start of the modern LGBTQ rights movement. The events serve a dual purpose: they are a vibrant celebration of identity, wrapped in rainbow flags and festivity, and a powerful symbol of ongoing protest against discrimination. This year's celebrations continue that legacy, from Washington, D.C., to Kathmandu and beyond.</p>
