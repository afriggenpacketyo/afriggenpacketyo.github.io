        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>On a recent episode of her podcast, former First Lady Michelle Obama, alongside her husband Barack Obama, directly addressed and humorously dismissed persistent rumors about their divorce. She emphatically stated there has never been a moment she considered leaving him, reaffirming their commitment after 32 years of marriage. The former president's appearance marked his first on her new podcast, where they discussed the public's fascination with their relationship status, particularly when they make separate public appearances. Michelle Obama reiterated that marriage requires hard work but that she and Barack have built a strong partnership through both challenging and joyful times.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Morgan Stanley announced second-quarter financial results that surpassed Wall Street expectations, largely due to a significant increase in trading revenues. The bank reported earnings of $2.13 per share on $16.79 billion in revenue, outperforming forecasts of $1.96 per share and $16.07 billion in revenue. Net income saw a 15% rise to $3.54 billion, with the institutional securities and wealth management divisions showing particularly strong performance. CEO Ted Pick highlighted the consistent earnings as a reflection of the bank's robust performance across different market conditions, despite a slight dip in the company's stock following the announcement.

          <h2>New Research Suggests Choline-Rich Foods May Help Reduce Alzheimer's Risk</h2>
          <div class="timestamp">2025-07-16 14:26:44 EDT</div>
        </div>
        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>A recent study suggests that consuming foods high in choline, an essential micronutrient, could significantly lower the risk of developing Alzheimer's disease. Researchers found that a daily intake of about 350 milligrams of choline was associated with the lowest risk of a clinical Alzheimer's diagnosis in older adults. Choline is commonly found in foods such as poultry, eggs, dairy products, broccoli, and beans. Nutrition experts emphasize the importance of a brain-healthy diet, also recommending foods like walnuts, wild salmon, and leafy greens, which contain beneficial nutrients like omega-3 fatty acids alongside choline.</p>

          <p>The European Commission has proposed a seven-year budget of €2 trillion, featuring a significant fivefold increase in funding for defense and space initiatives. The plan allocates €131 billion to a new European Competitiveness Fund, reflecting a strategic shift towards rearmament amid geopolitical concerns. The budget also prioritizes climate and biodiversity projects, which will receive about 35% of the funds, and triples funding for migration management. To finance the plan without increasing member state contributions, the EU aims to generate new revenue from sources like e-waste rates and duties on tobacco products. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>A Martian meteorite, identified as NWA 16788 and recognized as the largest piece of Mars on Earth, has been sold for nearly $5.3 million at a Sotheby's auction in New York. The 54-pound rock, which represents about 6.5% of all known Martian material on our planet, traveled 140 million miles through space before landing in the Sahara Desert. It was discovered in Niger in 2023. Such meteorites are exceedingly rare, with only about 400 of the 77,000 officially recognized meteorites originating from the red planet, offering scientists a massive dataset to study our planetary neighbor.</p>

          <p>The 2025 MLB All-Star Game in Atlanta paid a memorable tribute to the late baseball legend Hank Aaron, who passed away in 2021. Using advanced technology, video, and audio clips, the event recreated the moment from 1974 when Aaron hit his record-breaking 715th home run, surpassing Babe Ruth. The tribute featured the original broadcast call from Vin Scully and traced Aaron's historic home run trot around the bases with lighted footprints on the field. The moment was especially significant as it celebrated a Black man breaking a major record in the Deep South, a point Scully highlighted in his original call.</p>

          <p>An experimental weight loss drug developed by Chinese and U.S. drugmakers has shown strong results in a late-stage trial, positioning it as a potential rival to blockbuster treatments from Eli Lilly and Novo Nordisk. The weekly injection, HRS9531, helped patients lose nearly 18% of their body weight on average after 48 weeks. The drug works similarly to Eli Lilly's Zepbound by targeting both GLP-1 and GIP hormones to suppress appetite. While it will take years to reach the U.S. market, the promising data from the Chinese trial signals growing global competition in the lucrative obesity drug market.</p>

          <p>Eighty years after he went missing in action, the family of U.S. Army Air Corps Staff Sgt. Michael Musashe has been reunited with his personal Zippo lighter. The inscribed lighter, which a relative spotted in a Facebook post by a Swiss collector, was located with the help of the Defense POW/MIA Accounting Agency. The collector willingly returned the artifact, which is believed to have been recovered from the wreckage of Musashe's aircraft after it was shot down over Denmark in 1944. The airman's 95-year-old sister was able to hold the lighter, a tangible connection to the brother she last saw as a child.</p>
