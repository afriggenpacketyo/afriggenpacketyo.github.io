          <p>Hamas has officially submitted what it terms a "positive response" to the latest U.S.-brokered proposal for a temporary ceasefire and hostage exchange, although the group emphasized that further negotiations on the specific implementation mechanisms are still required. The current proposal outlines a 60-day truce that would include the release of 10 living hostages and the return of the remains of 15 deceased hostages from Gaza. In response, Israeli Prime Minister Netanyahu's office characterized the changes requested by Hamas as "unacceptable." Despite this, Israel confirmed it will send a negotiating team to Qatar to continue the high-stakes discussions, signaling a fragile but ongoing diplomatic process.</p>

          <p>Pop superstar Sabrina Carpenter performed for a massive crowd of 65,000 at London's BST Festival, presenting a show that was notably more subdued and family-friendly compared to her usual, more risqué stage persona. The singer, who has built a brand around sexual confidence and racy lyrics, strategically adapted her setlist and choreography for the diverse festival audience, toning down some of her more sexually suggestive on-stage moments. Despite these adjustments, the article praises her as an impressive and highly accomplished performer who effortlessly charmed the crowd with her biggest hits. The successful performance showcased her professional versatility and ability to cater her distinct style to different audiences while maintaining her powerful star quality.</p>

          <h2>Jack Catterall Secures Technical Decision Victory Over Harlem Eubank After Head Clash</h2>
          <div class="timestamp">2025-07-05 19:16:10 EDT</div>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>An all-British welterweight boxing contest between Jack Catterall and Harlem Eubank came to a premature conclusion, with Catterall being awarded the victory by technical decision. The fight was officially stopped at the beginning of the seventh round because of a severe cut that Catterall had sustained above his eye from an accidental clash of heads during the sixth round. At the moment of the stoppage, Catterall was leading on all three of the judges' official scorecards, having effectively controlled the pace of the bout with a cautious yet more skillful performance. This result marks the first professional loss for Eubank, who voiced his frustration and immediately called for a rematch.</p>
