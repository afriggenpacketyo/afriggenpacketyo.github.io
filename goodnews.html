          <p>An organization named Black People Will Swim is working to close the racial gap in swimming ability, a disparity rooted in the historical segregation of aquatic spaces. Founder Paulana Lamonier aims to create a ripple effect, increasing the number of Black swimmers, instructors, and lifeguards to combat disproportionately high drowning rates in the community. The initiative provides lessons and scholarships, helping individuals overcome barriers and build life-saving skills, with participants describing the experience as empowering and life-changing. The effort is framed as a response to a public health crisis.</p>

          <p>Florida has unexpectedly surpassed California in the installation of new utility-scale solar capacity, driven primarily by major utility companies rather than rooftop panels. State rules that fast-track approvals for smaller projects and favorable economics have fueled this surge, making solar a cheaper option than natural gas for utilities. However, the state's momentum faces challenges from the rollback of federal tax credits and increasing strain on the existing power grid. The success of solar-powered communities like Babcock Ranch, which maintained power during Hurricane Ian, demonstrates the technology's potential resilience. (not investment advice)</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>An online discussion has popularized the use of hand sanitizer as a makeshift deodorant for emergency situations, based on the idea that its alcohol content kills odor-causing bacteria. A board-certified dermatologist confirms this can temporarily work by targeting the root cause of body odor, but she issues a strong caution. The high alcohol concentration can cause significant irritation, dryness, and discomfort, especially on the sensitive skin of the underarms or recently shaved areas. The expert suggests gently cleansing with antibacterial soap and water as a safer and more effective alternative.</p>

          <p>A recent study published in Frontiers in Psychology indicates that tailoring exercise routines to one's personality can lead to better fitness outcomes. The research linked the Big Five personality traits to preferences for certain activities; for example, extroverts tend to enjoy high-intensity group workouts, while conscientious individuals prefer goal-oriented training like preparing for a marathon. The findings suggest that people who struggle to stick with a fitness plan might benefit from exploring different types of exercise that better suit their innate character, rather than forcing themselves into an unenjoyable routine.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>A federal appeals court has partially limited the Trump administration's sweeping ban on asylum at the U.S.-Mexico border. The ruling states that the government cannot use the president's proclamation to ignore laws requiring officials to hear claims from migrants who would face persecution or torture if deported. While the court allowed the administration to continue denying access to the discretionary asylum system itself, it affirmed that mandatory protections, such as "withholding of removal," must still be processed. This decision curbs the administration's ability to summarily expel all migrants without considering their humanitarian protection claims.</p>
