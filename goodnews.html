          <p>Corey O‚ÄôConnor, son of a former Pittsburgh mayor, won the Democratic primary for mayor, defeating the incumbent Ed Gainey. The New York Times article suggests this outcome reflects voter dissatisfaction with Gainey's progressive leadership. O'Connor, who will face Republican Tony Moreno in the general election, had positioned himself as a pragmatic candidate focused on revitalizing the city's economy and adopting a conciliatory approach towards institutions. Gainey's administration had faced criticism for police leadership turnover, budget concerns, and basic service issues, overshadowing his efforts to address affordable housing. The sharp-elbowed campaign highlighted divisions among city and county political leaders.</p>

          <p>To commemorate the 60th anniversary of normalized diplomatic ties, Japan will offer fast-track entry for South Korean visitors at Tokyo's Haneda and Fukuoka airports throughout June. This marks the first time Japan has established lanes exclusively for a specific nationality, as reported by Kyodo News. South Korea will reciprocate with similar measures for Japanese travelers at Gimpo in Seoul and Gimhae in Busan. The initiative aims to boost mutual exchange between the two countries, which have become popular tourist destinations despite occasional historical and territorial disputes. Visitors who have traveled between Japan and South Korea within the past year and complete necessary procedures are eligible.</p>

          <p>Japan's Farm Minister, Taku Eto, resigned after facing backlash for stating he doesn't buy rice because he receives it from supporters, a comment deemed inappropriate amidst rising rice prices. Kyodo News reports that Prime Minister Shigeru Ishiba is expected to replace Eto with Shinjiro Koizumi. Ishiba acknowledged responsibility for appointing Eto and failing to address the objections promptly. The resignation occurs as Ishiba prepares for an upcoming House of Councillors election, a critical race for the ruling coalition. The scandal adds to public dissatisfaction with the government's handling of increasing rice prices.</p>

          <p>A new test has been developed that reduces the time to diagnose brain tumours from weeks to hours, according to the BBC. Surgeons describe the method as a "game changer" that could improve care and treatment. The method, developed by the University of Nottingham and Nottingham University Hospitals NHS Trust, has been used in 50 operations with a 100% success rate. The new technique returns results in as little as 90 minutes, enabling surgeons to perform more radical surgery during the initial procedure.
