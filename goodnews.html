          <p>Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy reported significantly improved relations with President Donald Trump following their recent UN meeting, citing more frequent communication and a stronger alignment on strategies for the ongoing conflict with Russia. Zelenskyy highlighted that Russian President Vladimir Putin's repeated dishonesty towards Trump played a crucial role in fostering this enhanced connection. He expressed considerable optimism about Trump's increasingly positive outlook on Ukraine's ability to reclaim all its territory and the prospect of sustained American support until the war's resolution. This article details a notable diplomatic shift, indicating a potentially more unified front between the United States and Ukraine against Russian aggression. The Ukrainian leader believes Washington will now actively push Russia towards peace.</p>

          <p>China's successive five-year plans have been instrumental in shaping its economic trajectory since 1953, serving as a core pillar of macroeconomic policymaking despite the country's move away from a traditional command economy. These 14 plans have transformed China from a nation with limited industrial capacity into the "world's factory" through massive scale production and strategic development. Beijing is now focused on moving higher in the global value chain, aiming to become a leading hub for innovation in advanced sectors. The upcoming 15th five-year plan is anticipated to be a critical blueprint for achieving these ambitious goals, reflecting the nation's long and complex economic history and its ongoing pursuit of global economic leadership.</p>

          <p>The Trump administration has significantly reduced federal grants for animal testing, cutting nearly $28 million, as major health agencies begin phasing out live animal research in favor of alternative methods. This policy shift is influenced by an unusual coalition of animal rights activists and bipartisan members of Congress, who are skeptical of federal spending on animal experiments. While animal testing has historically been vital for developing numerous vaccines and medications, new techniques such as AI-based computational modeling, lab testing on human organs, and advanced data analysis are now being championed. The article underscores the intense ethical and scientific debate surrounding this transition, balancing the welfare of animals with the urgent need for medical advancements.</p>

          <p>U.S. President Donald Trump announced a significant shift in his position on the Ukraine war, stating that Kyiv can "win all of Ukraine back in its original form" with support from Europe and NATO. This declaration, made after talks with Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy, suggests Ukraine could regain its 2022 borders and potentially more, citing economic pressures on Russia, which Trump labeled a "paper tiger." Zelenskyy welcomed this "big shift," expressing belief that the U.S. is committed to Ukraine's defense until the war's end, with potential security guarantees and increased weapon supplies. The article highlights Trump's previous stance often involved territorial concessions, making this a notable and encouraging reversal for Ukraine.</p>

          <p>Veteran pop star Lulu, 76, has publicly revealed her past struggle with alcoholism in her new memoir, "If You Only Knew," describing the experience as liberating. Now nearly 12 years sober, she characterizes herself as a "highly functioning alcoholic" who managed to conceal her drinking from many, even participating in "Strictly Come Dancing" while secretly drinking nightly. Lulu sought help in 2013 after confiding in her family, attributing her secrecy to a desire to protect her "squeaky clean" image and the trauma of growing up with an alcoholic father. She hopes sharing her story will not only help other individuals facing similar challenges but also break generational patterns within her own family.</p>

          <p>Oregon state police announced a potential breakthrough in an 80-year-old cold case, identifying the dismembered body parts found in the Willamette River in April 1946 as Oak Grove Jane Doe. The victim, a petite white woman aged 30-50, was killed by blunt force trauma to the head, and her remains were discovered wrapped in multiple burlap sacks. This article highlights that the case went cold in the 1950s after critical evidence went missing from law enforcement custody. Advanced forensic testing is now being employed to confirm the identity, offering significant hope to finally restore the victim's name and bring closure to one of Oregon's oldest unidentified victim cases after nearly eight decades.</p>

          <p>California is considering Senate Bill 576, which aims to prohibit streaming services from playing commercials louder than their accompanying programming, following widespread consumer complaints. The bill, inspired by a new parent disturbed by loud ads waking her baby, seeks to extend regulations similar to the federal CALM Act, which currently applies only to broadcast, satellite, and cable TV. While streaming industry groups initially opposed the bill, citing difficulties in controlling ad volume from various sources, they became neutral after an amendment removed provisions allowing individuals or private parties to sue. This article highlights the ongoing effort to address a common viewer frustration and the challenges of regulating content volume across diverse digital platforms.</p>

          <p>China has endorsed Brazil’s $125 billion Tropical Forests Forever Facility, a flagship fund designed to reward nations for preserving vital tropical forests. This significant backing lends fresh momentum to the initiative ahead of COP30 in November, highlighting international cooperation on climate change. The fund, developed by Brazil with World Bank support, will invest in low-risk assets and channel returns to tropical countries at up to $4 per hectare of standing forest, contingent on keeping annual deforestation below 0.5 percent. Brazil, the first contributor with $1 billion, emphasizes this is an investment in humanity and the planet, with at least one-fifth of resources dedicated to Indigenous peoples and local communities.

          <p>Sir Ed Davey's Liberal Democrat conference speech was a "punchy" call to action, heavily focusing on Reform UK leader Nigel Farage, far more than on the prime minister or the Conservatives. The Lib Dems perceive an opportunity to aggressively challenge Reform and figures like Donald Trump, strategically using their rise to galvanize activists for both funding and recruitment. They aim to extend their appeal towards recent Conservative voters who are unattracted by both Reform and the current Tory leadership. This article notes the party's strategy to carve out a distinct identity amidst a rapidly changing political landscape, despite facing accusations of scaremongering over issues like gun laws.</p>

          <p>Tether, the issuer of the largest stablecoin, is reportedly planning a significant capital raise of $15 billion to $20 billion, which could value the crypto company at an estimated $500 billion.

The transaction involves new equity in exchange for a roughly 3% stake, though the article notes that talks are in early stages and eventual details could change. This development comes as Tether furthers its plans to return to the U.S. market, including naming a U.S. CEO and launching a new regulated token, influenced by President Donald Trump's pro-crypto stance.
