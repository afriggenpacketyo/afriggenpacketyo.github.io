          <p>The Economic Community of West African States (ECOWAS) is pushing to launch its single currency, the ECO, by 2027, aiming to foster regional trade and economic integration. This ambitious plan, originally conceived for 2020, has encountered significant obstacles including economic disparities among member states, political disagreements, and the departure of three nations from the bloc. Experts highlight the critical need for shared political understanding and centralized monetary policy for the ECO's viability, suggesting larger economies like Nigeria and Ghana could spearhead the initial rollout. Success could bolster ECOWAS's influence in global finance and attract foreign investment. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>A mysterious glowing, pill-shaped object spotted over upstate New York sparked widespread UFO speculation and social media frenzy. Residents described the slow-moving orb as "otherworldly," fueling alien visitation theories. However, the phenomenon was later confirmed to be the planned launch of the Vulcan Centaur rocket by the United Launch Alliance from Cape Canaveral, Florida. A retired Rear Admiral emphasized the importance of data verification to distinguish between misidentifications and genuine Unidentified Anomalous Phenomena (UAP), advocating for more scientific transparency to reduce stigma and fear surrounding such sightings.</p>

          <p>Two years into the generative AI boom, Nvidia faces high expectations as its revenue and profits have surged, making it a $4 trillion market cap company. The chipmaker's upcoming second-quarter earnings report will highlight its shift from gaming to a central role in AI technology, with data center revenue now dominating sales. Despite substantial growth, the pace has slowed, and the company grapples with regaining access to the Chinese market for its H20 chip, which now requires a U.S. government license and a 15% revenue share. Analysts closely watch Blackwell chip performance and China sales for market indicators. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>America has transformed into a nation of exercise enthusiasts, a stark contrast to the post-WWII era when physical activity was discouraged, especially for women due to outdated beliefs. Journalist Danielle Friedman highlights how fitness evangelists on TV in the 1950s and 60s, alongside President JFK's call for a "physically fit" nation, began shifting perceptions. The 1970s marked a turning point with the women's movement, Title IX, and the birth of exercise science, popularizing activities like running, aerobic dancing, and yoga. Celebrities like Arnold Schwarzenegger and Jane Fonda further cemented fitness as aspirational, commercializing workouts and shaping a uniquely American culture of continuous physical striving.</p>

          <p>Northern Lights, a consortium led by Equinor, Shell, and TotalEnergies, has initiated the world's first commercial carbon storage service, injecting CO2 deep under the North Sea seabed off Norway's coast. This project aims to capture and bury industrial emissions, preventing their release and aiding climate change mitigation. While carbon capture and storage (CCS) is recognized by climate bodies, it remains complex, controversial, and costly, with critics questioning its efficacy and motives, arguing for a stronger focus on transitioning to clean energy sources. The facility's initial capacity is 1.7 million tons annually, with plans to expand.</p>

          <p>Ether, the second-largest cryptocurrency, experienced a significant pullback, falling 6% to $4,548.32 after reaching a fresh record high of $4,954.81 over the weekend. Bitcoin also saw a decline of over 1%, dropping to its lowest level since July 10. Both cryptocurrencies have erased gains from Friday, which were spurred by Federal Reserve Chair Jerome Powell's hints at upcoming rate cuts. This market movement triggered substantial forced selling of long positions in both ETH and Bitcoin. Despite the recent dip, Ether has shown leadership in the crypto market due to regulatory tailwinds and increased institutional interest. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>The U.S. government has acquired a 10% stake in chipmaker Intel, investing $8.9 billion in common stock, signaling a significant shift in American industrial policy under the Trump administration. This investment, partially funded by CHIPS Act grants, aims to ensure advanced chip manufacturing remains on U.S. soil, as Intel is the only domestic company capable of producing them. While Intel's shares rose, the government will not have a board seat.

          <p>The debate over cellphones in schools is intensifying, with a majority of U.S. states now implementing or recommending bans to curb distractions and improve student well-being. Parents often desire phone access for emergencies, but experts argue that constant digital connection hinders learning, increases social anxiety, and suppresses emotional growth. Studies from Australia, which implemented a country-wide ban, show reduced distractions, improved learning, and decreased behavioral problems. While teachers struggle with phone use for school-related tasks, the inherent dopamine-driven urge to check devices makes "just say no" policies ineffective, highlighting the need for comprehensive restrictions to foster genuine in-person interaction and resilience.</p>

          <p>Challenging the perception of fish as "simple-minded animals," new research suggests they may feel pleasure and actively seek it. Neuroscientists Caio Maximino and Marta Soares studied bluestreak cleaner wrasse and threadfin butterflyfish, observing that butterflyfish preferred areas where they had been "cleaned." Experiments with opioid mimics increased this preference, while opioid blockers diminished it, indicating pleasure mediated by natural brain opioids. Further tests distinguished between "liking" and "wanting," suggesting a dopamine-driven desire. These findings could prompt a rethinking of how fish are treated in aquariums and aquaculture, highlighting a more complex emotional life in aquatic species.</p>

In California, Democrats are hoping Latino voters will approve maps targeting Republican members. Despite politicians' assumptions, Latino voters have a history of political independence, often rejecting party narratives. Their skepticism towards both parties, driven by economic concerns rather than ideological ones, makes their influence unpredictable and pivotal in these redistricting efforts.</p>
