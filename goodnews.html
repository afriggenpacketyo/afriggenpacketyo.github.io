The winner has 180 days to claim the prize and can choose to remain anonymous. The National Lottery operator, Allwyn, has urged players to check their tickets from the Friday night draw. While a substantial amount, this win does not place the holder among the top ten largest EuroMillions jackpots ever won in the UK.</p>

          <p>This opinion article posits that President Trump utilized a consistent three-pronged negotiating strategy to achieve a deal with Pfizer to lower drug costs for Americans and to broker a 21-point peace plan for Gaza. The author argues that Trump's approach involves ignoring conventional wisdom, aligning the interests of opposing sides, and tenaciously pursuing long-term goals while remaining flexible. The piece credits these tactics for securing a deal to reduce prescription drug prices and for bringing both Israel and Gulf Arab states to agree on a potential ceasefire framework.</p>

          <p>Certified financial planners recommend using the fourth quarter to conduct a thorough review of personal finances, as actual income and spending data are available, which aids in effective tax strategy. With recent tax law changes, such as a temporary increase in the state and local tax deduction cap, proactive planning is particularly crucial this year. Experts also advise creating a holiday season budget now to avoid starting the new year with financial stress, noting that a significant percentage of Americans incurred debt during the previous holiday season.

        </div>
        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Chinese academics and writers are increasingly positioning speculative and science fiction as a tool for cultural influence and a way to offer alternative future visions to those dominated by Western narratives. At a recent conference, scholars noted that the genre provides a platform to explore "what if" scenarios that critique present-day issues while imagining different societal paths. This contrasts with what some describe as the often pessimistic and dystopian futures projected by Western writers, suggesting China is staking a claim on shaping global conversations about the future through its own distinct literary and cultural perspectives.</p>

          <p>This opinion article highlights a recent ruling by U.S. District Judge William Young, who condemned the Trump administration for violating the First Amendment rights of non-citizen residents. The judge found that the administration unlawfully targeted pro-Palestinian foreign scholars for detention and deportation based on their political speech, asserting that the Constitution's free speech protections are not limited to citizens. The author praises the judge's unusually direct and personal rebuke of the president's actions, framing the decision as a crucial defense of constitutional values against what the judge termed presidential "bullying" and disregard for the law.</p>

          <p>Starship Technologies, a company co-founded by Skype's Ahti Heinla, is scaling its autonomous robot delivery service, which is already operating in cities across the UK, Finland, and Estonia. The company claims its six-wheeled robots can deliver food and groceries more cheaply than human drivers, making the service viable even in less-populated areas. Heinla believes this technology will soon become mainstream but notes that expansion, particularly in the UK, is hampered by the need for regulatory clarity and consistent rules across different local councils, unlike in Finland where national legislation has facilitated a broader rollout.</p>

          <p>The fashion industry is increasingly utilizing artificial intelligence to navigate the fast-paced trend cycle driven by social media platforms. AI algorithms analyze vast amounts of data from runways, social media, and consumer behavior to detect emerging trends months before they become mainstream. Companies like Heuritech and Stitch Fix use this technology to make more informed decisions on product design, inventory, and marketing. However, industry experts emphasize that human expertise remains essential to interpret the data, distinguish between fleeting online fads and commercially viable trends, and provide the necessary creative oversight.</p>

          <p>The price of Bitcoin surged by 12% this week, trading within 1% of its all-time high as the U.S. government shutdown continued for a third day. Investors appear to be turning to the decentralized cryptocurrency as a safe-haven asset amid the political and economic uncertainty in Washington. Analysts from Standard Chartered noted that Bitcoin's recent performance has correlated with "US government risks," suggesting its role as a hedge is becoming more established. The bank predicts the cryptocurrency will soon surpass its previous record and could potentially reach $135,000. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>Japan's governing Liberal Democratic Party has elected Sanae Takaichi as its new leader, positioning the 64-year-old ultra-conservative to become the nation's first female prime minister. A protege of former Prime Minister Shinzo Abe, Takaichi is known for her hard-line conservative views and hawkish stance on China. Her election is seen as a move by the party to regain support from its conservative base following recent election losses. While her leadership is historic for gender representation in a country with low gender equality rankings, her regular visits to the controversial Yasukuni Shrine could strain relations with neighboring Asian countries.</p>

          <p>Analysis of the first-ever rock samples returned from the far side of the moon by China's Chang'e-6 mission indicates a significant thermal difference between the moon's two hemispheres. A joint team of Chinese and British scientists found that minerals from the far side likely formed in lava that was approximately 100 degrees Celsius cooler than the lava on the near side. This discovery provides new data to help understand the long-observed asymmetries in the moon's topography and volcanic activity. The findings contribute critical insights into the formation and evolution of Earth's natural satellite.</p>

          <p>This opinion column refutes conservative criticism of the choice of Puerto Rican artist Bad Bunny for the Super Bowl halftime show, labeling the backlash as ignorant of both geography and cultural history. The author points out that Puerto Ricans are U.S. citizens and that non-American acts like The Rolling Stones and U2 have headlined the event in the past without similar controversy. The piece argues that objecting to Bad Bunny performing in Spanish is counterproductive and ignores the long history of non-English language music succeeding in the U.S., framing the performance as an opportunity for cultural growth rather than division.</p>
