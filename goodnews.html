        </div>
        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Recent interest rate cuts by the Federal Reserve have led to lower monthly payments for home equity loans, making them a more affordable borrowing option. For a $75,000 loan, a 10-year term now averages around $923 per month, while a 15-year term is about $726, both lower than costs earlier in the year. The article notes that with average home equity at $313,000, many homeowners can borrow such amounts without overleveraging their property. It advises borrowers to compare these fixed-rate loan costs with variable-rate HELOCs to determine the best fit for their financial needs. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>During a White House meeting, President Donald Trump urged Turkish President Recep Tayyip Erdogan to stop buying oil from Russia to curtail Moscow's funding amid the war in Ukraine. The discussion occurred as Turkey seeks to rejoin the F-35 fighter jet program, from which it was removed after purchasing a Russian air defense system. Trump expressed optimism about lifting sanctions and resolving the F-35 issue, suggesting a deal could be reached quickly. The meeting highlights the complex diplomatic balancing act between the NATO allies on issues of defense and energy security.</p>

          <p>A new revision of "The Sacred Harp," a Christian songbook first published in 1844, was celebrated by over 700 singers in Atlanta. The tradition, which uses "shape notes" for sight-singing, has seen a resurgence among younger, more diverse participants, including people of color and LGBTQ+ individuals. The latest edition features 113 new songs from 49 living composers, a significant increase that reflects the changing demographics of the community. This update ensures the vitality of the historic, non-denominational singing tradition for a new era.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>A new study on Maria Branyas Morera, who died last year at 117 as the world's oldest person, suggests her extreme longevity resulted from a combination of genetics and lifestyle. Researchers at the University of Barcelona found she possessed unique genetic variants that protect against many disorders. Additionally, her habits, including not smoking or drinking and consuming a diet rich in olive oil, fish, and daily yogurt, likely contributed. The study posits that the beneficial bacteria from yogurt may have helped combat chronic inflammation, a key factor in aging and disease.</p>

          <p>As the Ryder Cup begins at Bethpage Black, there is a sense that the competition needs an away team to win to maintain its competitive validity after a long streak of home-team victories. The article suggests that Luke Donald's European team, led by Masters champion Rory McIlroy, is the best-positioned squad since 2012 to defeat the U.S. on their home turf. While the American team features top talent like Scottie Scheffler, questions linger about the form of other players. A European win would break the pattern of one-sided home victories and add much-needed jeopardy to the event.</p>

          <p>Tropical Storm Humberto is currently in the Atlantic, and forecasters are monitoring its potential interaction with another developing storm system nearby. If the two storms get close enough, they could engage in a rare meteorological phenomenon known as the Fujiwhara effect, where two cyclones orbit each other. In some cases, a stronger storm can absorb a weaker one, though it is more common for them to "dance" around a common center before separating. While this outcome is considered unlikely, it adds a layer of complexity to forecasting the storms' ultimate paths and strengths.</p>

          <p>Newly released architectural renderings offer a more detailed view of the 90,000-square-foot ballroom currently being built in the White House's East Wing. The project, significantly larger than the main White House building, will have a seated capacity of 650 people. The Trump administration has stated that construction will be funded by private donors and the president himself, with nearly $200 million already pledged from corporate and individual sources. Construction on the South Lawn began earlier this month, marking a major addition to the historic executive mansion.</p>

          <p>Delta Air Lines is in the final stages of a multi-year initiative to replace the auxiliary power units (APUs) on its fleet of over 300 Airbus A320 aircraft. The project, which began in 2022, aims to address the issue of toxic oil fumes leaking into the cabin's air supply, a problem linked to health risks for crew and passengers. Flight attendants have long advocated for a solution to these "fume events." Delta stated the replacement program is over 90% complete and that it is also exploring the use of new synthetic turbine oils.</p>

          <p>With credit card debt at high levels and interest rates remaining elevated despite Federal Reserve cuts, this article explores the value of debt relief options for struggling borrowers. It notes that unlike mortgages, credit card APRs are not directly tied to the Fed's rate and are unlikely to decrease soon. Because interest compounds daily, carrying a balance becomes increasingly costly over time. The article suggests that strategies like debt consolidation, balance transfers, or formal debt management plans can provide a more effective path forward than waiting for rates to fall.

          <p>This opinion article argues that if Republicans are serious about protecting free speech, they should pass specific legislation rather than engage in "tit-for-tat" speech policing against the left. Citing suggestions from the Foundation for Individual Rights and Expression (FIRE), the author proposes several changes. These include eliminating FCC content regulations, requiring federal officials to report "jawboning" communications with social media companies, and passing a federal anti-SLAPP law to deter frivolous lawsuits. The piece contends such laws would safeguard expressive rights for all Americans, regardless of which party is in power.</p>

          <p>Researchers analyzing a million-year-old human skull found in China, named Yunxian 2, propose it could significantly alter our understanding of human evolution. Originally thought to be Homo erectus, the new analysis suggests it is an early form of Homo longi, a sister species to Neanderthals and Homo sapiens. If correct, this implies that our own species, Homo sapiens, may have emerged at least half a million years earlier than the current consensus of around 300,000 years ago. While some experts urge caution, the findings could rewrite a key chapter of our evolutionary history.</p>

          <p>President Trump is set to sign off on a deal that will allow TikTok to continue operating in the United States under a new structure. The agreement establishes a U.S.-based joint venture with a majority of American investors, including Oracle, which will host U.S. user data and oversee security. A key component involves copying TikTok's powerful content algorithm and retraining it to run exclusively on data from its U.S. user base. This "qualified divestiture" is designed to satisfy a federal law passed over national security concerns regarding the app's Chinese parent company, ByteDance.</p>
