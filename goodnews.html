          <div class="timestamp">2025-09-07 04:09:09 EDT</div>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>A total lunar eclipse is expected to occur, creating a "Blood Moon" phenomenon visible to sky-watchers across parts of the United Kingdom. The Moon will pass through Earth's shadow, taking on a deep red hue due to the scattering of light through the planet's atmosphere. Visibility in the UK will be limited and dependent on location, with eastern regions getting the best view as the Moon rises. Astronomers encourage the public to watch the event, which requires no special equipment and showcases the mechanics of the solar system in real-time, with the next one not visible until 2026.</p>

          <p>Carlo Acutis, an Italian teenager who died of leukemia in 2006 at the age of 15, is set to be canonized as the first millennial saint by the Catholic Church. Known as "God's influencer," Acutis was a computer programming prodigy who used his skills to create a website cataloging eucharistic miracles, blending modern technology with his deep faith. His tomb in Assisi has become a major pilgrimage site, and the Vatican has recognized two miracles attributed to his intercession, a prerequisite for sainthood. His rapid canonization is seen by the Church as a way to connect with and inspire younger generations in the digital age.</p>

          <p>Anutin Charnvirakul has officially taken office as the new prime minister of Thailand following a royal endorsement from King Maha Vajiralongkorn. The conservative politician secured the position after the previous prime minister, Paetongtarn Shinawatra, was dismissed by a court order. Anutin gained the necessary support from the main opposition, the People's Party, by agreeing to dissolve parliament and call for new elections within four months. The 58-year-old, known for championing the country's cannabis decriminalization, has previously served as deputy prime minister and health minister, marking a significant shift in the nation's political leadership.</p>

          <p>A community arts project in Portland, UK, is set to unveil the "Portland Dress," a garment created over six months with contributions from more than 300 local residents. Inspired by the Red Dress Project, the initiative brought people from diverse backgrounds, including refugees, together in workshops to embroider patches depicting personal stories connected to the area. Each patch tells a unique story of memory, resilience, and community, such as a tribute to a deceased family member or a representation of new connections formed in the town. The project is being hailed as an example of how art can foster a shared sense of belonging.</p>

          <p>Quarterback Aaron Rodgers is set to make his debut for the Pittsburgh Steelers, facing his former team, the New York Jets, two years after a devastating season-ending Achilles injury just four plays into his Jets career. The initial excitement surrounding Rodgers' arrival in New York, which was seen as the final piece for a championship-contending team, quickly turned to despair. After an unsuccessful season following his return, the Jets released the 41-year-old veteran, opting for a new direction with quarterback Justin Fields. The Week 1 matchup provides a dramatic narrative of return and reunion for both Rodgers and Fields, who was previously with Pittsburgh.</p>

          <p>Daniel Andreas San Diego, a suspected double bomber who was on the FBI's most wanted terrorist list for 21 years, is facing an extradition hearing in London. He is accused of planting two bombs in the San Francisco Bay Area in 2003, with the attacks claimed by an animal rights extremist group. San Diego vanished in 2003 after a high-speed chase, and former FBI agents believe there were "missed opportunities" to arrest him sooner, discovering a "bomb-making lab" in his abandoned car. After more than two decades as a fugitive, he was discovered living under an alias in a cottage in north Wales in 2024.</p>

The company's breakthrough came from authentic social media videos where Robinson shared his story, which resonated with consumers and led to rapid sales growth.

          <p>Senator Bernie Sanders campaigned alongside New York City mayoral frontrunner Zohran Mamdani at a town hall in Brooklyn, framing the election as a crucial battle against oligarchic control. The event, part of Sanders' "Fighting Oligarchy" tour, drew a large crowd in support of Mamdani, a Democratic socialist whose platform includes rent freezes and higher taxes for the wealthy. Both politicians condemned the influence of billionaire donors in politics and criticized mainstream Democratic leaders for their lack of support for the grassroots campaign. Mamdani emphasized his commitment to defending immigrant communities and mobilizing volunteers to counter the financial power of his opponents.</p>

The winning numbers for the massive prize were announced Saturday night, with a potential cash value of $826.4 million for a single winner. This marks the seventh time a U.S. lottery jackpot has surpassed the billion-dollar threshold. The prize has been accumulating since May 31, and lottery officials remind players that ticket sales also contribute to public causes in their respective states.</p>

          <p>A joint team of researchers from the US and China has developed a novel method for launching tiny robots by harnessing the energy from collapsing vapor bubbles. The process, known as cavitation, is triggered by using a laser to rapidly heat light-absorbing materials on a wet surface, causing water droplets to boil and form bubbles. When these bubbles collapse, they release a powerful force capable of launching millimeter-scale objects high into the air. Scientists believe this technique can be precisely controlled, offering a new and efficient launching and propulsion mechanism for micro-robotics.</p>
