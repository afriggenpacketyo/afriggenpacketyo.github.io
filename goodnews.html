          <p>Eight of the ten individuals accused of robbing Kim Kardashian in Paris in 2016 were found guilty, although they will not return to prison due to suspended sentences and time already served. The ringleader, Aomar A√Øt Khedache, received the heaviest sentence of eight years, with five suspended, while two defendants accused of providing information were acquitted. Kardashian, who testified emotionally about fearing for her life during the incident, expressed gratitude to French authorities for pursuing justice. She stated that the crime was a terrifying experience that left a lasting impact, but she believes in growth and accountability.</p>

          <p>Donald Trump has expressed support for a "partnership" between US Steel and Nippon Steel, a shift from his earlier opposition to the Japanese firm's $14.9 billion bid. Trump announced the deal on social media, emphasizing that US Steel would remain in the US with its headquarters in Pittsburgh. The agreement aims to create at least 70,000 jobs and add $14 billion to the US economy, with a significant portion of the investment occurring within the next 14 months. Shares in US Steel surged following Trump's announcement, though the United Steelworkers union had previously urged him to reject the bid.</p>

          <p>The Pentagon briefly lost contact with an Army helicopter for about 20 seconds on May 1, causing two commercial planes to abort their landings at a Washington airport. The loss of contact occurred because a temporary control tower antenna was not positioned to maintain contact with the helicopter as it approached the Pentagon. Federal air traffic controllers also had difficulty pinpointing the helicopter's location, despite transmitted data. The Army has paused flights into and out of the Pentagon while working with the FAA to address safety concerns following this and a prior deadly midair collision.</p>

          <p>A new study by First Street projects that extreme weather linked to climate change could lead to a significant increase in foreclosures across the US, potentially rising 380% over the next decade. Low- to moderate-income households are particularly vulnerable, as severe weather impacts their homes and rising insurance premiums make it difficult to keep up with mortgage payments. Lenders could face billions in losses due to mortgage defaults, as climate risk is often not factored into underwriting practices. The study emphasizes the need to integrate climate risk into loan assessments to better prepare homeowners and lenders for weather-related disasters.</p>

The announcements have sparked worries globally, leading to a drop in shares and concerns about the impact on international trade.

Goodsell was the captain of the schooner Oriental, which sank in 1844, and his remains washed ashore on South Jersey beaches between 1995 and 2013. Using investigative genetic genealogy, the students matched DNA from the bones to Goodsell's descendants. This identification marks one of the oldest cold cases solved using this method, showcasing the power of modern technology in resolving historical mysteries.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Defaulting on credit card debt can have severe consequences, including a damaged credit report that can last for up to seven years. Default typically occurs after 180 days of missed payments, leading to the debt being charged off and potentially sold to a collection agency. It's important to communicate with credit card issuers to explore hardship programs or repayment plans, and consider credit counseling or debt settlement to mitigate the impact. Legal action can be taken to recover unpaid balances, potentially resulting in wage garnishment or bank account levies.</p>

          <p>Tax relief can stop IRS wage garnishment by resolving unpaid debt and halting enforced collections, but swift action and the right strategy are crucial. Effective methods include installment agreements, Offers in Compromise, Currently Not Collectible status, and innocent spouse relief. These options require detailed financial disclosures and can take time to process, so many people turn to tax relief professionals who can negotiate with the IRS and request a garnishment release while a resolution is underway. Acting quickly and demonstrating a good faith effort can significantly improve the chances of keeping income intact.</p>

          <p>Donald Trump signed executive orders aimed at spurring a "nuclear energy renaissance" to meet the electricity demands of AI and other industries. The orders intend to speed up reactor approvals, reform the Nuclear Regulatory Commission, and boost investment in the technology. While nuclear energy doesn't emit carbon, it produces radioactive waste, raising environmental concerns. The initiative aims to quadruple electricity production over the next 25 years and have experimental reactors operating by 2026, aligning with Trump's broader energy dominance agenda.</p>

          <p>Trade experts and logistics professionals are warning that President Trump's tariff threats against the European Union could backfire, potentially damaging a key trade relationship. A large tariff on European imports will make American products more expensive to produce, and U.S. exporters will suffer as a result of reduced trade. A 50% tariff would cause economic harm and potentially lead to retaliation from the EU, escalating the economic impact. Manufacturers have stressed the importance of considering the cost of running and expanding operations in the U.S. when implementing tariffs.</p>
