          <p>Dame Sarah Mullally, a former NHS chief nurse, has been named the first female Archbishop of Canterbury, the highest position in the Church of England. Her appointment comes nearly a year after Justin Welby's resignation over a safeguarding scandal, an issue she has pledged to confront directly. Mullally, previously the Bishop of London, is seen as a modernizer and has been praised by political leaders, though some conservative Anglican groups have criticized the move. She takes on the role of spiritual leader for the worldwide Anglican Communion during a period of declining attendance and internal division.</p>

          <p>Monterrey, Mexico, is home to a vibrant subculture centered around Colombian cumbia music, driven by DJs known as "sonideros." This culture, which originated in migrant neighborhoods in the 1960s, gave rise to the unique "cumbia rebajada" style, a slower tempo of the music born from an accidental equipment malfunction. The scene faced suppression during a period of intense cartel violence but has since returned to the streets, demonstrating its cultural resilience. The article explores the history and persistence of this musical identity, which blends Colombian roots with local "cholombiano" aesthetics.</p>

The English bowlers dismantled the South African batting lineup, dismissing them for just 69 runs in 20.4 overs, their third-lowest total in a One-Day International. Left-arm spinner Linsey Smith was the standout performer, taking three key wickets for only seven runs. England's openers, Amy Jones and Tammy Beaumont, then comfortably chased the target, giving their team a significant net run-rate boost early in the tournament.</p>

          <p>After nearly 34 years, Austin law enforcement announced a major breakthrough in the infamous 1991 yogurt shop murders, where four teenage girls were killed. Advanced ballistics and DNA technology have identified Robert Eugene Brashers, a now-deceased serial killer, as the likely sole perpetrator. The case, which had previously resulted in wrongful convictions, gained national attention and led to federal legislation on reopening cold cases. The new evidence fully exonerates the two men who were previously imprisoned for the crime after being coerced into confessing.</p>

          <p>California Governor Gavin Newsom is under intense pressure from the cookware industry and some celebrity chefs to veto a bill that would ban the sale of products made with PFAS "forever chemicals." The legislation, passed by the state legislature, is part of a broader effort to eliminate avoidable uses of the toxic compounds linked to serious health problems. A trade group representing major manufacturers is leading the opposition, claiming the ban is unnecessary, while public health advocates and environmental groups urge the governor to sign the bill into law.</p>

          <p>According to Brendan Wallace, CEO of venture capital firm Fifth Wall, the "winter" for property technology is over, with the sector showing signs of recovery after a challenging three-year period. However, he notes that investment in climate-related property tech is struggling due to a negative shift in political sentiment away from sustainability and ESG initiatives. Despite this, Wallace remains optimistic about the long-term prospects for climate tech in real estate, citing the ongoing need for decarbonization and the potential for local governments to drive change.

          <p>A resident has taken on the challenge of clearing a local lake from an overgrowth of water lilies, which are considered a noxious weed in the area. In a single day, he hauled out an estimated 1,100 pounds of the invasive plant, contributing to a community goal of removing 50,000 pounds in a year. The overabundance of lilies is making the water stagnant, reducing oxygen levels and threatening the survival of other marine life in the lake's ecosystem. The effort highlights the positive impact individuals can have on local environmental conservation efforts.</p>

          <h2>Taylor Swift's New Album Highlights Why Vinyl Records Are Exempt from US Tariffs</h2>

        </div>
        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>As fans purchase multiple vinyl editions of Taylor Swift's new album, the physical music format benefits from a unique exemption from U.S. import tariffs. A Cold War-era provision known as the Berman Amendment prevents the regulation of "informational materials," which includes records, CDs, and books. This has protected the booming vinyl market from price hikes that have affected other imported goods, a relief to consumers and music labels but a point of contention for some U.S.-based record manufacturers who argue it puts them at a disadvantage.</p>

The advice addresses a common fear among many Americans who feel behind on retirement savings. The strategy relies on disciplined, long-term investing in a diversified portfolio to build wealth over the next two decades. (not investment advice)</p>
