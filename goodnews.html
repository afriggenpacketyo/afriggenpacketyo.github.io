          <p>Oleksandr Usyk solidified his status in boxing history by defeating Daniel Dubois via a fifth-round stoppage at Wembley Stadium, reclaiming the undisputed heavyweight title. The 38-year-old Ukrainian fighter delivered a masterful performance, knocking Dubois down twice in the decisive round to extend his professional record to 24-0. This victory reunifies the heavyweight division's major belts under Usyk, as he regained the IBF title that was previously stripped from him, adding it to his WBA, WBO, and WBC championships.</p>

          <p>Scottie Scheffler holds a significant lead heading into the final round of The Open at Royal Portrush, positioning himself to potentially win his third major. After a strong third round, he sits at 14-under par, with his closest competitor four strokes behind. A victory would place Scheffler three-quarters of the way to a career grand slam and make him one of only four players to win the Masters, PGA Championship, and The Open before turning 30. Other contenders like Rory McIlroy and Matt Fitzpatrick trail further behind.</p>

          <p>The UK's environment secretary has committed to a new target of reducing sewage discharges from water companies by half by the year 2030. This pledge follows significant public outrage over waterway pollution and data showing a 60% rise in serious pollution incidents in 2024. The plan also includes measures to ban wet wipes containing plastic and cut phosphorus pollution from treated wastewater. The announcement comes as consumer water bills are expected to rise to fund a record £104 billion investment in infrastructure improvements.</p>

          <p>Pop star Katy Perry encountered a technical issue during her concert in San Francisco when a mechanical butterfly prop she was riding malfunctioned mid-air. While performing her song "Roar" above the audience, the prop suddenly dropped several feet, startling the singer. Perry quickly recovered and continued her performance without further incident, with the prop eventually returning her safely to the stage. The incident occurred during her "The Lifetimes Tour," which features multiple aerial stunts.</p>

          <p>Rory McIlroy delivered an eventful third round at The Open, highlighted by a bizarre moment and a spectacular eagle putt that energized the home crowd at Royal Portrush. During his round, McIlroy's shot from the rough dislodged a buried golf ball, leading to a bogey, but he later recovered dramatically by sinking a 56-foot eagle putt on the 12th hole. He finished with a round of 66, leaving him tied for fourth place but still six shots behind the leader, Scottie Scheffler, giving him an outside chance for the final day.</p>

          <p>Germany is pivoting its foreign policy focus towards a stronger alliance with France and the United Kingdom, a partnership now known as the "E3." This strategic shift is driven by the threat from Russia and uncertainty over future US commitments to NATO. German Chancellor Friedrich Merz recently signed a comprehensive bilateral treaty with the UK, focusing on security and arms cooperation. The E3 alliance aims to bolster European defense capabilities, with the nuclear deterrence of France and the UK potentially supplementing US protection for the continent.</p>

          <p>Manchester United forward Marcus Rashford is reportedly close to joining Barcelona on an initial loan deal with an option to buy, after falling out of favor at his current club. The 27-year-old has not played for United since being dropped in December and was one of five players told to train separately. Barcelona has been seeking to strengthen its attack, and the loan structure of the deal is financially advantageous for the Spanish club. The move offers Rashford a chance to revitalize his career at a top European team. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>The Christian youth organization Generation Life is engaging with young people on the Jersey shore, promoting a message of "chastity before marriage" in a setting known for hedonism. The group's Gen Z activists attempt to connect with peers by discussing modern relationship challenges, such as the negative impacts of social media, before introducing their views on chastity. This article explores how the organization adapts its traditionally religious message for a generation that is increasingly secular, risk-averse, and navigating a complex digital dating landscape, framing abstinence as a "countercultural" act of self-worth.</p>
