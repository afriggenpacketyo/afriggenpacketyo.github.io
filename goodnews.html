          <p>North Korea has officially opened the Wonsan Kalma Coastal Tourist Area, a large-scale beach resort on its eastern coast designed to accommodate nearly 20,000 people. State media reported that domestic tourists were filled with "overwhelming emotion" at the resort's "grandeur and splendor," a project personally championed by leader Kim Jong Un. The development is part of a broader effort to boost the nation's tourism industry and acquire foreign currency, with Russian tourists also expected to visit soon. This opening marks a step toward reopening the country to visitors after years of pandemic-related closures, though tourism remains highly restricted and politically sensitive.</p>

          <p>The 14th Dalai Lama has announced that he will have a successor, ending years of speculation that he might be the last to hold the title. In a recorded statement, the 90-year-old spiritual leader affirmed that the process of finding his reincarnation will follow past Buddhist traditions and should be managed by the Gaden Phodrang Trust, which he founded. He implicitly warned China, which claims the authority to approve the next leader, to not interfere in the sacred process. The decision is politically significant for Tibetans who resist Chinese control and is expected to be met with opposition from Beijing, potentially leading to rival successors.</p>

The company has seen its value increase over 1,300% since its debut in June 2024, reflecting strong confidence in its branding, pricing power, and growth potential.

          <p>China's senior leadership, including President Xi Jinping, has signaled a move to crack down on what it terms "disorderly low-price competition" plaguing many of the nation's industries. The explicit language, used at a high-level economic meeting, indicates a more focused approach to tackling the intense price wars that have been a drag on the economy. Beijing views this aggressive price-cutting as a threat to innovation, efficiency, and industrial upgrading. The policy aims to guide companies toward improving product quality and facilitate the orderly exit of outdated production capacity, rather than simply suppressing prices to gain market share.

          <p>The U.S. semiconductor industry could receive a significant boost from President Trump's sweeping domestic policy bill, which passed the Senate on Tuesday. The legislation increases the investment tax credit for building chip manufacturing plants in the U.S. from 25% to 35%, a more generous provision than previously drafted. This expansion of incentives, which builds upon the 2022 CHIPS Act, is part of Washington's ongoing effort to onshore the advanced semiconductor supply chain and reduce reliance on Asia. Companies like Intel and TSMC could benefit if the bill, which now returns to the House for reconciliation, becomes law. (not investment advice)</p>
