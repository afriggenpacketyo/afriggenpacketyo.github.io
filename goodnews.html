          <p>Australia has officially granted asylum to Ted Hui, a prominent pro-democracy activist from Hong Kong who fled the city in 2020. Hui, who faces criminal charges related to the 2019 protests, expressed gratitude but also sadness, highlighting the plight of political refugees who cannot return home. He used the opportunity to urge the Australian government to advocate for other activists who remain imprisoned in Hong Kong. The move provides Hui and his family with protection amid China's ongoing crackdown on dissent in the city.</p>

          <p>New Zealand's national rugby team, the All Blacks, secured a 41-24 victory over Argentina in their Rugby Championship opening match. The win was significant as it propelled them back to the top of the world rankings for the first time in four years, displacing South Africa. Despite a spirited second-half comeback from the Pumas, who narrowed the deficit to seven points, late tries from Samisoni Taukei'aho sealed the win for New Zealand. The match in Cordoba extended Argentina's winless home record against the All Blacks to 15 matches.</p>

        </div>
        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>In a personal essay, columnist Rhiannon Lucy Cosslett explores how her perception of Renaissance art evolved from youthful indifference to profound connection through life experiences. She contrasts her early dismissal of religious paintings with later moments of understanding, such as connecting with the rage in Artemisia Gentileschi's work after a traumatic event. The author also describes how contemplating motherhood led her to find new meaning in depictions of the Annunciation. The article suggests that aging and significant life events unlock emotional complexities that allow for a deeper appreciation of historical art.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Following a £190 million investment in new players, Arsenal is seen as a strong contender to win the Premier League for the first time in 21 years. The article highlights key signings like midfielder Martin Zubimendi and striker Viktor Gyokeres, which have added crucial depth and goal-scoring threat to the squad. Manager Mikel Arteta has focused on creating a team without a "tier system," ensuring consistent quality even with injuries, and has implemented a more direct, faster-paced attacking style. With a squad largely in its peak age range, expectations are high for the club to secure a major trophy this season.</p>

          <p>The National Museum of China in Beijing is currently hosting an exhibition of works by 19th-century realist painter Ilya Repin, who was born in present-day Ukraine but worked within the Russian Empire. The exhibition, organized in collaboration with Moscow's State Tretyakov Gallery, is curated to emphasize the artist's "Russianness" and his connection to St. Petersburg's art scene. This focus comes after Ukraine's Ministry of Culture declared Repin's works to be part of its national cultural heritage earlier this year. The event highlights the use of cultural diplomacy amid ongoing geopolitical tensions and competing historical narratives.</p>

          <p>Brenmiller Energy is developing a new version of its Thermal Energy Storage system specifically designed to support small modular nuclear reactors (SMRs). The technology addresses a key challenge for SMRs, which provide a steady power output but struggle to adjust to fluctuating grid demands. Brenmiller's system stores excess heat during low-demand periods and releases it to generate power when needed, enhancing grid stability and overall plant efficiency. The company states the concept has already been validated in a real-world industrial setting, potentially improving the safety and adoption of this clean energy source.</p>

          <p>Dan Tana, the founder of the eponymous West Hollywood Italian restaurant that has been a celebrity haven for six decades, has passed away at the age of 90. Born in Serbia, Tana was a professional soccer player and actor before opening his restaurant in 1964, creating a late-night dining spot for Hollywood stars. The establishment became famous for its clubby atmosphere, classic red-sauce dishes, and discreet service to A-list clientele like Elizabeth Taylor and George Clooney. Though he sold the restaurant in 2009, its legacy as an L.A. institution endures under its new ownership.</p>

          <h2>Decades-Old '85th Percentile' Rule for Setting Road Speed Limits Faces Reevaluation</h2>
          <div class="timestamp">2025-08-17 00:00:53 EDT</div>

          <p>A long-standing principle in traffic engineering, the "85th percentile rule," is facing increased scrutiny and modification across the United States. The rule suggests that a road's speed limit should be set at the speed that 85% of drivers travel at or below, effectively letting drivers determine the speed. However, amid rising traffic fatalities, safety advocates and some states are pushing for new models that consider factors like pedestrian activity and crash history, arguing the old rule creates a feedback loop of ever-increasing speeds. The Federal Highway Administration has recently clarified that the rule is a guideline, not a mandate, encouraging a more holistic approach.</p>

          <h2>Chinese Scientists Develop New Technique for High-Resolution 3D Brain Imaging</h2>

          <p>Researchers in China have developed a new method that renders brains and other organs transparent, allowing for the creation of exceptionally clear and accurate 3D images of their internal structures. The technique preserves the tissue's original shape and enhances the brightness of fluorescent dyes used to highlight specific cells and molecules. By preparing the tissue into an "ionic glassy" state, it becomes highly transparent while maintaining its structural integrity. This advancement could provide unprecedented views into the complex workings of biological systems and allows for long-term storage of the prepared samples.</p>

          <p>The Los Angeles Dodgers secured a 6-0 victory over the San Diego Padres, reclaiming sole possession of first place in the NL West. The game was characterized by a series of costly mistakes by the Padres, including three runners caught stealing in the first two innings and a critical two-run error by their center fielder. Dodgers' starting pitcher Blake Snell, in his first game against his former team, threw six shutout innings. The win not only extended the Dodgers' division lead but also clinched the head-to-head season series, which would serve as a tiebreaker.</p>

          <h2>Health Officials Warn of Summer Surge in Tick-Related Emergency Room Visits</h2>
          <div class="timestamp">2025-08-16 23:00:00 EDT</div>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Doctors and public health officials are reporting a significant increase in tick bites and related emergency room visits across the United States this summer. According to CDC data, May saw the highest rate of tick-related ER visits since 2019. Experts attribute the rise to a combination of factors, including warmer and more humid conditions caused by climate change, which expand tick habitats and lengthen their active season. Increased public awareness may also be contributing to more people seeking early medical care, and officials are reminding the public about proper prevention and removal techniques.</p>
