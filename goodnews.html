          <p>Tesla's stock experienced a rebound, climbing over 3% after a tumultuous period fueled by a public dispute between CEO Elon Musk and President Donald Trump. Analysts suggest that Tesla's investor base remains largely unfazed by external events, contributing to the stock's resilience. Despite reports of a potential truce brokered by a phone call between Trump and Musk, a White House official indicated that Trump is not interested in such a conversation. The ongoing conflict between Musk and Trump has created uncertainty surrounding Tesla's future, yet the stock continues to show signs of recovery. </p>

          <p>President Trump has signed an executive order to mitigate national security and public safety threats posed by drones in the United States. The order establishes a task force to improve drone detection and identification, and to combat unlawful uses such as spying and drug smuggling. The move is motivated by concerns related to the upcoming FIFA World Cup in 2026 and the Los Angeles Olympics in 2028. The order also seeks to promote U.S. development and commercial use of drones for deliveries and other purposes, alongside efforts to advance supersonic jets and electric vertical take-off and landing aircraft. </p>

          <p>Amazon is investing in automating its logistics, potentially saving billions by deploying AI-powered humanoid robots for deliveries. These robots, tested at a "humanoid park" in San Francisco, could deliver packages directly from Rivian electric vans to customers' doors, reducing delivery times and labor costs. Analysts estimate that automating a portion of its warehouses could lead to $2 billion to $3 billion in annual savings by 2030. Amazon's focus on robotics and AI is expected to enhance its market share in the U.S. parcel delivery market.  (not investment advice)</p>
