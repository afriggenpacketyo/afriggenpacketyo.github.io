          <p>Police officers are expressing strong support for President Donald Trump's plan to eliminate taxes on overtime pay, citing potential benefits for officer retention and morale. Officers claim that the proposed tax cut would provide much-needed financial relief and serve as a form of appreciation for their dedication.

          <p>Saving money in an economy with persistent inflation can be a challenge, but certificates of deposit (CDs) can help by offering higher returns than the current inflation rate. Investing in CDs allows you to lock in today's high rates for the term of the CD, and they are generally safe investments with FDIC or NCUA insurance on balances up to $250,000. Current national averages for CD yields are 2.00% APY for 1-year CDs, 1.69% APY for 3-year CDs, and 1.71% APY for 5-year CDs, but top CDs today offer much higher rates. Strategies for securing a good CD rate include looking at online banks and considering short-term CDs. (not investment advice)</p>
