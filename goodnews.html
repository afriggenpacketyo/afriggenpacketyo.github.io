          <p>This article discusses the potential earnings from an 18-month Certificate of Deposit (CD) in the current interest rate environment. While interest rates have slightly decreased from previous years, the article argues that 18-month CDs can still offer substantial returns. It provides examples of potential earnings based on different deposit amounts and interest rates, and highlights the benefits of CDs, such as protection against market uncertainty, compared to alternatives like high-yield savings accounts.

          <p>Speaker Mike Johnson is working to maintain focus on the "One Big Beautiful Bill Act" amid a public feud between President Trump and Elon Musk, who has criticized the bill. Johnson, previously a strong supporter of Musk, is attempting to distance himself from the conflict and emphasize the importance of the legislative agenda. Other House Republicans are divided on the impact of Musk's influence on the bill's passage.

          <p>The International Pride Orchestra performed at the Strathmore Music Center in Maryland after being snubbed by the Kennedy Center, which is now under the control of the Trump administration. The event, a celebration of WorldPride, featured classical music, choral performances, and drag acts. The orchestra had hoped to play at the Kennedy Center but was denied after Trump pledged to eliminate drag shows and "anti-American propaganda" from the venue.
