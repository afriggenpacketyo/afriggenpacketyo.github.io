          <p>Nvidia has confirmed it is evaluating new products for the Chinese market, following reports of a powerful new AI chip called the B30A. This development comes as the company navigates U.S. export controls designed to limit China's access to advanced semiconductor technology. The U.S. government recently allowed Nvidia and AMD to resume sales in China in exchange for a 15% share of their revenue from the region. The company stated any new offerings would be fully compliant with government approvals and designed for commercial use.</p>

          <p>Commerce Secretary Howard Lutnick has stated that Intel will be required to give the U.S. government a non-voting equity stake in exchange for funds from the CHIPS Act.

The move is part of a broader push to reshore U.S. manufacturing and reduce reliance on foreign chipmakers.

A committee spokesperson confirmed the documents will be made public after a thorough review to redact victim-identifying information and any material related to child sexual abuse.

          <p>Major restaurant chains like McDonald's, Starbucks, and Dunkin' are expanding their beverage menus to drive sales, particularly among younger consumers who favor customized, cold drinks. According to market research, beverage-specific purchases are becoming a primary reason for customer visits, rather than just being an add-on to a food order. Chains are introducing new product lines, from sweet refreshers to protein-infused cold foams, to capitalize on this trend. This strategy is seen as crucial for reversing sales slumps in a challenging consumer environment, as beverages often carry higher profit margins than food items.</p>

          <h2>Analysts Highlight Resilient Retail Stocks Amid Tariff Concerns During Back-to-School Season</h2>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>The back-to-school shopping season is facing headwinds from import tariffs and budget-conscious consumers, leading to forecasts of slightly lower spending compared to last year. Despite these challenges, some analysts believe value-oriented retailers are well-positioned to attract shoppers seeking deals. Companies like TJX Companies, Costco, and Amazon may benefit as consumers look to stretch their budgets, leveraging flexible pricing models and diverse supply chains to mitigate tariff impacts. This environment may squeeze profits for other retailers who are hesitant to pass increased costs onto already-pressured customers. (not investment advice)</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>The senior living real estate sector is experiencing a significant imbalance, with demand rapidly increasing as the baby boomer generation ages, while the construction of new facilities has slowed to a historic low. Occupancy rates are rising sharply, but inventory growth has fallen below 1% for the first time in nearly two decades. Industry leaders attribute the lack of new development primarily to high interest rates, which make financing new projects difficult. This supply-demand gap is creating a strong investment environment for existing properties, with real estate investment trusts actively acquiring facilities.</p>

          <p>The Federal Trade Commission has filed a complaint against a group of individuals for allegedly using a network of fake accounts and software to purchase hundreds of thousands of tickets on Ticketmaster for resale. The complaint alleges the group spent nearly $57 million on tickets for high-demand artists like Taylor Swift and Bruce Springsteen, reselling them for a profit of millions. The FTC claims these actions violate the Better Online Ticket Sales (BOTS) Act. The group allegedly made $1.2 million from reselling tickets to Swift's Eras Tour alone by circumventing purchase limits.</p>

          <p>The U.S. Court of Appeals for the Fifth Circuit has ruled that a public university president's ban on drag shows violates the First Amendment. The case arose after the president of West Texas A&M University canceled a planned on-campus drag performance, arguing it was denigrating to women. The court affirmed that live theatrical performances, including drag, are a form of expression protected by the Constitution. However, the article criticizes the judicial process, noting it took over two years for the courts to reach this conclusion, effectively denying the student organizers their free speech rights.</p>
