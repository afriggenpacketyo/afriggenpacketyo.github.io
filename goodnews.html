        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>The Chinese yuan has reached its strongest level against the US dollar since last November, with recent data showing significant gains in the second quarter of the year. Analysts, such as those at Goldman Sachs, attribute this trend to China's resilient economic data and growing investor concerns over the sustainability of US government debt. Projections suggest the yuan will continue to appreciate, potentially breaking the 7 per dollar mark within six months. This outlook is bolstered by a shift in sentiment among onshore clients who are now less bearish on China's near-term growth prospects. (not investment advice)</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Panelists at CNBC's East Tech West conference emphasized the importance for nations, particularly in emerging economies, to develop 'sovereign AI' to maintain strategic autonomy. This involves creating AI systems tailored to local languages and cultures, rather than relying on English-centric models from major tech companies. Experts suggest that leveraging open-source AI models and accessible cloud computing services can democratize the technology and empower regions like Southeast Asia to build their own AI ecosystems. This approach fosters local talent and ensures that the economic and cultural benefits of AI are more inclusively distributed.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>China's factory activity among export-oriented manufacturers unexpectedly grew in June, according to the private Caixin/S&P Global manufacturing PMI, which registered 50.4. This reading contrasts with the official government PMI that showed a third consecutive month of contraction, a divergence attributed to differences in survey timing and company coverage. The Caixin survey's positive result was driven by a surge in production, though new export orders continued to decline, signaling potential future headwinds. Despite the growth, businesses expressed weakened optimism due to fierce market competition and insufficient domestic demand. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>Two tropical systems have formed off Mexico's coasts, with Flossie strengthening into a hurricane in the Pacific and Barry making landfall as a tropical depression on the Atlantic side. Hurricane Flossie, with 75 mph winds, is currently located south of Manzanillo but is expected to remain offshore as it moves west-northwest. Meanwhile, the remnants of Barry are bringing heavy rainfall to eastern Mexico after making landfall near Tampico. Forecasters have issued warnings for significant rainfall and potential flooding in several Mexican states from both storm systems over the coming days.</p>

          <p>California Governor Gavin Newsom has signed into law two significant bills aimed at accelerating housing construction by reforming the California Environmental Quality Act (CEQA). The legislation, which Newsom forced through by tying it to the state budget, exempts most urban housing projects from lengthy environmental reviews that often cause delays and litigation. While developers and housing advocates have praised the move as a transformative step to address the state's housing crisis, some progressive lawmakers and labor unions have criticized the process and the sidestepping of their demands for stronger worker protections.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>A team of Chinese scientists has identified a key mechanism explaining the anti-aging effects of long-term exercise. Their research, published in the journal Cell, found that a naturally occurring compound called betaine is produced in the kidneys during exercise and acts as a crucial messenger. Betaine was observed to slow the aging of multiple organs by targeting and inhibiting an enzyme associated with inflammation. These findings not only provide a deeper understanding of the molecular link between exercise and longevity but also suggest potential anti-aging strategies that could simulate the benefits of physical activity.</p>
