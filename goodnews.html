          <p>Lee Jae Myung of South Korea's liberal Democratic Party has begun his five-year presidential term, succeeding Yoon Suk Yeol, who was ousted after imposing martial law. Lee secured 49.42% of the vote, surpassing Kim Moon Soo of the conservative People Power Party. Lee has pledged to tighten martial law legislation, support smaller businesses, and boost the economy, while also reinforcing ties with the United States and Japan to counter North Korea. He also plans to improve relations with China and Russia, and address key challenges such as talks on higher U.S. import tariffs. The new president faces the task of unifying a nation deeply divided by recent political events.</p>

          <p>Women's football is experiencing significant growth in Europe, with some clubs drawing larger crowds than men's games, generating substantial revenue, but Japan's WE League, launched in 2021, is still struggling. The UEFA Women's Champions League in March 2022 saw record-breaking attendance, and Barcelona's women's team has become a professional success, earning close to a first-division J-League club. J-League Chairman Yoshikazu Nonomura is now heading the WE League, aiming to stabilize its financial base through sponsorships. The WE League is working with the J-League and the JFA to boost attendance and increase fan engagement, and there is a need for Japan to invest in its women's football infrastructure to match European success.</p>

          <p>Ramon Morales-Reyes, an undocumented immigrant, was arrested for allegedly writing letters threatening to assassinate President Trump, but investigators now claim he was framed. Prosecutors allege that Demetric Deshawn Scott wrote the letters to prevent Morales-Reyes from testifying against him in a robbery case. Scott admitted to writing the letters, stating his intention was not to threaten Trump but to intimidate Morales-Reyes. Morales-Reyes does not speak fluent English, and his handwriting differs from that in the letters, according to court documents. Scott has been charged with witness intimidation, identity theft, and breach of bail, and the Department of Homeland Security initially published a press release announcing Morales-Reyes's arrest, including a copy of the threatening letter.</p>

She was drawn to the SEC's storied legacy in women's basketball and the opportunity to compete with legendary coaches. Staley also desired a reunion with her mother and siblings, describing her homecoming to South Carolina as a "full-circle moment" due to her family's history with racism and discrimination in the state.</p>

Lively sought to dismiss a defamation countersuit from Baldoni, citing a California law that prohibits ‚Äúweaponizing defamation lawsuits‚Äù against those who have filed suit or ‚Äúspoken out about sexual harassment and retaliation.</p>
