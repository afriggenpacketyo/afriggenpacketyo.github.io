However, CFO Scott Herren announced his retirement, with Mark Patterson slated to take over the role in July, after Herren joined the company from Autodesk in 2020. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>Warner Bros. Discovery is rebranding its streaming platform back to HBO Max, reversing a decision made just two years prior when it was renamed Max.

          <p>In the current interest rate environment, a home equity line of credit (HELOC) is significantly cheaper than a personal loan. The average HELOC interest rate is 7.99%, while the average personal loan rate is 12.47%. HELOCs are secured by the home, resulting in lower rates, and are likely to decrease further due to anticipated rate cuts. Borrowers can save hundreds of dollars per month by choosing a HELOC over a personal loan, but should carefully calculate repayments to ensure long-term affordability. (not investment advice)</p>
