          <p>California is set to experience a significant cooldown this week as a low-pressure system moves in from the Pacific Northwest. Meteorologists predict temperatures will drop 10 to 20 degrees below average, providing relief from recent heatwaves and wildfire activity. Northern California and the Bay Area may see light rain and thunderstorms, which could help suppress existing fires. While Southern California is not expected to receive significant rainfall, a deep marine layer may bring some drizzle. Forecasters caution that this cooling trend does not mark the end of summer, as Santa Ana wind season is still approaching.</p>

          <p>Aerosmith's Steven Tyler made a notable return to the stage at the 2025 MTV Video Music Awards to honor the late rock icon Ozzy Osbourne. Tyler, alongside bandmate Joe Perry and other musicians, performed a medley of Osbourne's hits, including "Crazy Train" and "Mama, I’m Coming Home." The performance marked a significant public appearance for Tyler since Aerosmith announced its retirement from touring in 2024 due to his vocal cord injury. The emotional tribute celebrated the legacy of Osbourne, the Black Sabbath frontman who passed away in July at the age of 76.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>With mortgage interest rates dropping to an 11-month low, homeowners who purchased properties when rates were near their peak may find refinancing beneficial. The article suggests evaluating if current rates are low enough to justify the action, typically if a full percentage point reduction is possible. Homeowners should also weigh the risk of waiting for even lower rates against the potential for them to rise, and consider the impact of closing costs. Ultimately, the decision should align with long-term plans for the property, as moving before breaking even on costs would negate the savings. (not investment advice)</p>

Although its resolutions are non-binding, they carry significant normative power, setting international standards and holding states accountable on the world stage.

          <h2>Market Traders Increase Bets on a Potential Half-Point Federal Reserve Rate Cut</h2>

          <p>Following a weaker-than-expected August jobs report, financial market traders are increasing the probability of a significant interest rate cut by the Federal Reserve. While a quarter-point reduction at the upcoming meeting is still considered the most likely outcome, the odds of a more aggressive half-point cut have risen to around 12%. The soft labor market data, which showed minimal payroll growth and a rising unemployment rate, is fueling speculation that the Fed will act decisively to support the economy. Economists believe this strengthens the case for a series of "insurance cuts" in the coming months. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>Prince Harry has returned to the United Kingdom for a series of engagements, beginning his visit on the third anniversary of Queen Elizabeth II's death. He first paid his respects at the late monarch's burial site in Windsor before attending the WellChild charity awards in London, where he interacted with children facing serious health issues. Meanwhile, the Prince and Princess of Wales also marked the anniversary by visiting a Women's Institute event, an organization the late Queen was deeply involved with. Speculation continues about whether Prince Harry will meet with his father, King Charles, during his time in the UK.</p>

          <p>Technology stocks are leading market gains as the 10-year Treasury yield continues to decline following last week's weak jobs report. AI-focused companies like Broadcom and Nvidia are seeing positive movement, with investors interpreting the economic data as a sign of a forthcoming Federal Reserve rate cut. In corporate news, BlackRock is set to manage $80 billion in client assets from Citigroup, a move analysts estimate could add at least 25 cents to its adjusted earnings per share. Separately, Meta Platforms and Anduril Industries have officially secured a U.S. Army contract to develop advanced combat goggles. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>Organizers of the Great North Run, a major half marathon in the UK, have issued an apology after the finisher medals mistakenly featured a map of the nearby city of Sunderland instead of Newcastle. Approximately 60,000 runners who completed the race received medals depicting the River Wear, not the River Tyne where the race takes place. The Great Run Company acknowledged the error with humor, calling the items a unique keepsake and a celebration of the entire region. The mistake, which went unnoticed by many, including the event's founder, has sparked amusement and commentary on social media, especially given the historic rivalry between the two cities.</p>

          <p>Cognition, the AI startup behind the autonomous software engineer tool 'Devin,' has secured $400 million in a new funding round, elevating its valuation to $10.2 billion. This financial milestone comes just two months after Cognition acquired Windsurf, another AI company, following the departure of Windsurf's founders to Google. The funding round was led by Peter Thiel's Founders Fund and signals strong investor confidence in Cognition's technology. The company reports that its annual recurring revenue has more than doubled since the acquisition, as it integrates Windsurf's capabilities with its own AI development platform.</p>

The 'Birth Companions' program, now in its 27th year, trains nursing students to offer emotional, informational, and physical support during labor and delivery. These student doulas advocate for patients and act as a bridge to medical staff, but do not replace them. The initiative has gained relevance with a new Maryland law requiring hospitals to facilitate the presence of certified doulas, making these valuable services more accessible.</p>

        </div>
        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>As Americans face over $1.21 trillion in collective credit card debt with high interest rates, this article outlines personalized ways to seek help. One option is to consult a non-profit credit counseling agency, which can create a comprehensive debt management plan and negotiate lower rates with creditors. Another approach is working with a debt relief company that actively negotiates to reduce the total amount owed, though this can impact credit scores. Finally, individuals can proactively contact their credit card issuers directly to inquire about hardship programs or temporary interest rate reductions, which are often available but not widely advertised.

          <p>The Metropolitan Water District is offering a significant financial incentive for Southern California businesses, schools, and public institutions to remove nonfunctional lawns. The new rebate provides $7 per square foot for replacing grass with drought-tolerant and native plants, more than double the previous offer. This initiative aims to accelerate water conservation ahead of a new state law that will prohibit using potable water on nonfunctional turf starting in 2027. To qualify, projects must include features like stormwater retention and a minimum number of water-efficient plants, promoting both water savings and biodiversity.</p>
