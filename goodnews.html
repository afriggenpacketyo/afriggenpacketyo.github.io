          <p>Michelle Ryan has reprised her role as Zoe Slater in EastEnders after a 20-year absence, marking a dramatic return to the BBC One soap. Her appearance at the end of the episode involved a reunion with stepfather Alfie Moon and cousin Stacey Slater. The return of the character, known for the iconic "you ain't my mother!" scene, was the first episode produced by the show's new executive producer, Ben Wadey. While the episode garnered a significant viewership, it was slightly less than that of Emmerdale and Coronation Street on ITV.</p>

          <p>An increasing number of women are embracing strength training, challenging traditional beauty standards that have long prioritized thinness. Three new books explore this phenomenon, examining the cultural symbolism of muscles and the empowerment that comes with physical strength. However, the article questions whether the pursuit of a well-muscled physique could lead to new forms of body neuroses, similar to those associated with the pursuit of thinness. The piece further delves into the historical context of feminine ideals and the societal implications of women embracing strength, including how it can be seen as subversive or feminist.</p>

          <p>During a meeting with UK Prime Minister Keir Starmer, President Trump displayed a trade agreement between the U.S. and the UK, which he stated was similar to one signed in May. Trump accidentally dropped the document and initially misidentified it as an agreement with the European Union. The White House clarified that the agreement was with the United Kingdom and provided additional details on steel and aluminum quotas. Trump praised Starmer's performance, concluding the bilateral meeting with positive remarks about his work.</p>

          <p>A federal judge has struck down Trump administration orders that led to the cancellation of National Institutes of Health (NIH) research grants linked to diversity, gender identity, and vaccine hesitancy. The judge ruled that the directives were arbitrary and capricious, siding with public health groups and state attorneys general who filed lawsuits. The ruling halts the cancellation of millions of dollars already awarded and allows life-saving medical research to continue. The Department of Health and Human Services is exploring legal options, maintaining that it wants taxpayer dollars to support "gold standard science" and not "divisive DEI mandates or gender ideology."</p>

          <p>Shohei Ohtani's pitching debut for the Dodgers revealed a different side of the star, one that is more emotional and combative than his playful hitting persona. In his first game in two seasons, Ohtani showed a fiery temperament, reacting strongly to calls and displaying frustration when things didn't go as planned. His performance reflected this intensity, as he threw harder than expected but struggled with control. Despite the rocky start, Ohtani's manager acknowledged that this animated behavior is characteristic of him as a pitcher.</p>
