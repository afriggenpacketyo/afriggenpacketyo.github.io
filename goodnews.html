          <p>The European Union is pursuing a new strategic agenda to elevate its partnership with India, aiming to draw the nation away from Russia's sphere of influence. This initiative focuses on enhancing trade relations and defense-industrial cooperation as an alternative to the sanctions and tariffs favored by the United States. Key EU leaders emphasize treating India as a reliable partner and a moderating voice in global forums, despite disagreements over India's procurement of Russian oil. The strategy also highlights India's potential role in diversifying supply chains away from China and as a significant market for European defense manufacturers.</p>

          <p>Scammers are increasingly targeting Medicare beneficiaries, leading to billions in improper payments and potential health risks for victims. Fraudsters often use fear and urgency, impersonating Medicare representatives over the phone to steal personal information or solicit fake payments for non-existent services or equipment. The article advises that Medicare rarely initiates phone calls and never asks for payment over the phone; official communication regarding fees is sent by mail. To mitigate risks, individuals are encouraged to hang up on suspicious callers, report fraud to the appropriate authorities, and reduce their online data exposure through data removal services.</p>

          <p>Online ticket marketplace StubHub made its debut on the New York Stock Exchange, with shares opening at $25.35 under the ticker symbol "STUB." The company priced its long-awaited IPO at $23.50 per share, raising $800 million after several delays due to market volatility. The offering comes amid a resurgence in the live events market following the pandemic and a recent flurry of tech IPOs. StubHub, which was reacquired by its co-founder in 2020, faces competition from rivals like Ticketmaster, which is currently under scrutiny by the Federal Trade Commission.</p>

          <p>In a head-to-head clinical trial, Eli Lilly's experimental oral medication, orforglipron, demonstrated superior efficacy in lowering blood sugar and promoting weight loss compared to Novo Nordisk's approved pill, Rybelsus. The late-stage study involved patients with Type 2 diabetes, where the highest dose of orforglipron reduced hemoglobin A1c levels by 2.2% and resulted in an average weight loss of 9.2%. These results position orforglipron as a potentially strong competitor in the growing market for convenient, needle-free GLP-1 drugs. Eli Lilly plans to seek regulatory approval for the treatment of Type 2 diabetes in 2026.</p>

          <p>Tropical Storm Gabrielle, the seventh named storm of the 2025 Atlantic hurricane season, has formed over the central Atlantic Ocean. Current forecasts from the National Hurricane Center predict the storm will remain over open water for several days, tracking northwest and staying north of the Caribbean islands. While it is not expected to pose an immediate threat to land, the system is projected to intensify over the weekend and could potentially develop into a low-grade hurricane. Forecasters note that Gabrielle could approach Bermuda by next week as it continues to strengthen.</p>

          <p>The National Hockey League has announced that its players will return to the Winter Olympics in 2026 for the first time in 12 years. NHL Commissioner Gary Bettman stated that the decision was made after weighing the pros and cons, ultimately concluding it was important for the league to be on a major global platform. The league had previously stopped participation after the 2014 Sochi Games due to issues with control and promotion. A new agreement with the International Olympic Committee, along with strong player desire to compete for their countries, facilitated the return.</p>

          <h2>IRS to Adjust 2026 Federal Income Tax Brackets for Inflation</h2>
          <div class="timestamp">2025-09-17 12:43:24 EDT</div>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>The IRS is expected to announce its annual inflation adjustments for federal income tax brackets, which could result in lower taxes for many American households in 2026. These adjustments prevent "bracket creep," where cost-of-living pay increases push workers into higher tax brackets without an actual increase in purchasing power. Projections suggest an inflation rate of about 2.7% will be applied, raising the income thresholds for each tax band. This means taxpayers will need to earn more to be subject to higher marginal rates, effectively allowing them to shield more of their income at lower rates. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>The Scottish Parliament has approved a landmark legal reform to eliminate the controversial "not proven" verdict from its criminal justice system. This verdict, unique to Scotland, has the same legal effect as "not guilty" but has been criticized for being confusing and failing to provide closure for victims. The reform bill also includes other significant changes, such as increasing the jury majority required for a guilty verdict from a simple majority to two-thirds. Additionally, the legislation will establish a specialized court for sexual offenses and create an independent victims and witnesses commissioner to oversee standards of care.</p>

          <p>An American mother who moved to Taiwan shared her positive experience with the country's comprehensive and affordable postpartum care centers, which starkly contrasts with her previous experience in the U.S. For approximately $5,000, she received extensive care, including a two-night stay at a private birthing clinic and a 10-day stay at a postpartum facility offering 24/7 baby care, nutritionist-prepared meals, and wellness treatments. Taiwan's system, rooted in a cultural practice of a "sitting month" for recovery, is a formalized industry that provides a level of support largely unavailable or prohibitively expensive for many in the United States.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>The Federal Reserve's Federal Open Market Committee is widely expected to announce a quarter-percentage-point interest rate cut this week. The decision comes amid significant political pressure from the Trump administration, which has been advocating for a more aggressive reduction in borrowing costs. The meeting will include a newly confirmed governor, Stephen Miran, who is anticipated to dissent in favor of a larger cut. Beyond the immediate decision, financial markets are closely watching the Fed's updated economic projections and its "dot plot" forecast, which will signal the likely path for interest rates for the remainder of the year.

          <p>Mortgage interest rates in the U.S. have fallen to their lowest level in three years, with the average 30-year fixed rate dropping to 6.13%. This significant decrease is largely driven by market anticipation of the Federal Reserve's expected interest rate cut. The lower borrowing costs have already spurred a surge in both mortgage applications for home purchases and refinancing applications from existing homeowners. For those who have been priced out of the housing market by higher rates over the past two years, this shift presents a new opportunity to buy or reduce their monthly payments.
