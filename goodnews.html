          <p>Veteran pop star Lulu, 76, has publicly disclosed her past struggle with alcoholism in her new memoir, "If You Only Knew." Now nearly 12 years sober, she sought help in 2013 after revealing her secret to family. Lulu, who was a "highly functioning alcoholic," hid her drinking for years, even while participating in "Strictly Come Dancing." Her decision to share her story is intended to be liberating and offer hope, especially given her father also suffered from alcoholism.</p>

          <p>Nineteen-year-old Tyrique George, who almost left Chelsea, proved his value by scoring and assisting in a Carabao Cup victory against Lincoln City. Playing out of position as a lone striker, George's performance was crucial in Chelsea's comeback. His dedication and unique training regimen, including playing against men from a young age, have set him apart. This display offers manager Enzo Maresca a welcome attacking option, disrupting the typical "breakthrough, loan, sale" narrative for Chelsea academy graduates.</p>

          <p>China has formally endorsed Brazil's $125 billion Tropical Forests Forever Facility (TFFF) at a UN event, providing significant momentum for the fund ahead of COP30. The TFFF, designed with World Bank support, aims to reward nations for preserving tropical forests by investing in low-risk assets and channeling returns to tropical countries based on deforestation rates. Brazil's President Lula da Silva announced a $1 billion contribution, urging other governments to make ambitious pledges. The initiative emphasizes long-term finance for forest nations, with a focus on Indigenous peoples. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>Mass protests driven by Generation Z are sweeping across Asia, fueled by anger over perceived corruption, social inequality, and lack of opportunities.

The "nepo kids" phenomenon, where politicians' children display extravagance, has become a key symbol of discontent. While governments acknowledge concerns, the long-term impact of these leaderless, digitally-driven movements on fundamental social change remains to be seen.</p>

The city also relocated some targeted employees to open positions. While this is good news for the current fiscal year, the mayor acknowledged that long-term budget challenges persist.</p>

MLB Commissioner Rob Manfred stated the system balances the umpire's role with correcting missed calls and maintaining game pace.

          <p>Michelob Ultra has become the best-selling beer in the U.S. by volume, two years after its sister brand Bud Light lost the title following a consumer boycott. Anheuser-Busch's success with Ultra comes after a challenging period, with Modelo Especial previously holding the top spot. The article notes that other consumer companies, like Coca-Cola and Colgate-Palmolive, have also reported sales slumps among Hispanic consumers, linking it to the Trump administration's stricter immigration policies. Michelob Ultra's growth is attributed partly to its non-alcoholic variant and increased marketing. (not investment advice)</p>

Developed based on U.S. Air Force recommendations, the APG-82(V)X aims to support longer-range air-to-air missiles and enable the F-15EX to operate effectively in more contested environments. Its low probability of intercept modes also make the fighter harder to detect.</p>
