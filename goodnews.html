          <h2>Report Finds Cause of Heathrow Airport Shutdown Remains Unclear</h2>

          <p>An interim report states that the root cause of the fire that led to the shutdown of Heathrow Airport, disrupting hundreds of thousands of journeys, remains unknown. The fire occurred at an electrical substation, causing a power outage at the airport, and the Metropolitan Police found no evidence of suspicious activity. The incident prompted criticism of Heathrow's management for closing the airport, and an urgent investigation was ordered to prevent future occurrences. Power was restored hours before flights resumed, and a final report is expected by the end of June to provide answers on the cause of the fire.</p>

          <p>President Trump has publicly criticized Federal Reserve Chairman Jerome Powell after the central bank decided to maintain steady interest rates, citing economic uncertainty due to tariffs. Trump referred to Powell as a 'fool' and expressed his frustration that the Fed isn't lowering rates to offset the potential economic slowdown caused by his trade policies. Powell responded by stating that the Fed's decisions are based solely on economic data and the outlook for maximum employment and price stability, and that political pressure from Trump would not impact the Fed's job.</p>

          <p>President Trump is expected to announce a 'comprehensive' trade agreement with Britain, marking the first deal since the imposition of tariffs on various trading partners. A senior British official confirmed the agreement, which is anticipated to strengthen the relationship between the two nations. The deal aims to lower British tariffs on U.S. cars and farm goods, and remove taxes on U.S. technology companies, but details are still emerging. The agreement could be a significant win for both countries, potentially offsetting weaker relations with Europe for Britain and offering vindication for Prime Minister Keir Starmer's cultivation of Trump.</p>

          <p>This article explains how mRNA vaccines work, addressing safety concerns and exploring their potential in medicine. Messenger RNA (mRNA) carries information from DNA to build proteins, and mRNA vaccines use this to trigger an immune response by coding for viral proteins. These vaccines do not alter a person's DNA and have shown no long-term safety issues, though temporary side effects like muscle aches are common. mRNA technology is also being explored for treating various diseases, including cancer and genetic disorders, offering hope for new therapies where other technologies have failed.</p>

          <p>The US and the UK are expected to announce a deal to reduce tariffs, but it will not be a comprehensive trade agreement due to the need for Congressional approval. The deal is likely to be a narrow agreement with exemptions or lower tariffs on specific goods, such as cars, steel, and aluminum. The UK may lower its digital services tax on US firms in return for lower tariffs on exports, but food standards will not be included. Negotiations and legal paperwork will follow the announcement, and the deal could be short-term.</p>
