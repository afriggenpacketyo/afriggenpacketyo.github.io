          <p>Texas Governor Greg Abbott has signed a bill into law allocating $1 billion for a school voucher program, fulfilling a campaign promise to provide school choice for Texas families. The program allows parents to use public funds to pay for private school tuition, home-schooling, and virtual learning programs, with families receiving up to $10,000 per year, and children with disabilities qualifying for as much as $30,000. Supporters argue that it will give parents more options, while critics contend that it will pull resources from public schools and subsidize private education for wealthier families. The program is capped at $1 billion for the first year and could cost up to $4.5 billion per year by 2030.</p>

          <p>The European Court of Justice has outlawed Malta's 'golden passport' scheme, the last of its kind in the EU, deeming it a mere 'commercial transaction' that undermines EU solidarity. The court ruled that granting citizenship based on investment, rather than a genuine link to the country, is unacceptable. While Malta claims the scheme generated significant revenue for charitable causes, critics argue that citizenship should not have a price tag. Despite the ban, 'golden visa' programs offering residence permits for investment remain prevalent in the EU, raising concerns about security and money laundering risks.</p>

The Conservatives suffered another disastrous set of results, while Labour was punished by voters angry with government spending curbs and higher taxes.

          <p>A recent survey in Japan reveals that nearly 30% of individuals in common-law relationships cite the requirement to change surnames upon marriage as a deterrent, with the rate higher among those in their 20s. The survey highlights the impact of Japan's unique law requiring married couples to adopt the same surname. The NGO and Yuichiro Sakai estimate that about 1.22 million people in their 20s to 50s are in common-law relationships in Japan, with 587,000 of them wishing to marry if separate surnames were allowed.</p>

          <p>Nearly 30 percent of people in common-law relationships in Japan have chosen not to marry because they do not want to change their own or their partner's last name, as required by Japanese law, a recent private survey has shown. The survey by Asuniwa, a nongovernmental organization advocating for separate surnames for married couples, found the rate was higher among people in their 20s at around 40 percent, with more than 60 percent of that group saying they would switch to legal marriage if separate surnames were allowed.</p>

          <p>A South Texas community, largely comprised of SpaceX employees, has overwhelmingly voted to establish a new city called Starbase, fulfilling a long-held ambition of Elon Musk. With a vote of 212 to 6, the community officially incorporated as a city, covering about 1.5 square miles near the Mexican border. The new municipality will be eligible for state and federal grants, and can create its own police and fire departments, and adopt its own ordinances.</p>

          <p>Ginzan Onsen in northeastern Japan's Yamagata Prefecture is now struggling with being too popular. The influx of selfie-seeking tourists has led to serious overcrowding. The community wants to protect its cultural heritage and architecture from the Taisho period (1912-1926), when nostalgia for Japanese tradition grew amid rapid societal change and Westernization. For the first time ever, the city and the hot springs association collaborated to implement admission restrictions for day-trippers from December 2024 to February of this year.</p>
