        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Chevron's stock experienced a decline following the announcement of a profit decrease due to falling oil prices. The company's net income dropped by over 30% to $3.5 billion, or $2 per share, compared to the previous year's $5.5 billion, or $2.97 per share. U.S. crude oil prices have fallen by about 18% this year due to tariffs and increased OPEC+ supply. Despite the profit decline, Chevron returned $6.9 billion to shareholders through dividends and share repurchases.</p>

          <p>The Scottish government has postponed plans to introduce new legislation criminalizing misogyny until after next year's Holyrood election. Ministers cited insufficient time to draft a law that aligns with a recent Supreme Court judgment on the definition of a woman. Instead, existing hate crime legislation will be amended to include protections based on sex. The government also confirmed that legislation to end conversion therapy will not be brought forward this term, with hopes for a UK-wide solution.</p>

          <p>A lynx born at Newquay Zoo in Cornwall could become the first UK zoo-born cat successfully released into the wild, as it has been moved to an enclosure in Germany to assess its survival skills. Typically, zoo-raised animals are not considered for release, but a shortage of female lynxes in the European breeding program prompted the unusual request. The lynx will be monitored to determine if it can survive with minimal human interaction, crucial due to the crowded nature of Central Europe.</p>

          <p>A recent poll revealed that 80% of Americans believe the country would benefit from more manufacturing jobs, while only 25% would prefer working in a factory themselves. Despite the challenges, a quarter of Americans' interest in factory jobs indicates a significant desire for economic revitalization. The decline of manufacturing has been linked to social rot and stagnant wages, emphasizing the importance of a strong industrial sector for a nation's economic health. Reindustrialization could also lead to greater national self-sufficiency and political leverage, as well as offer political opportunities for parties that can connect with working-class voters.</p>
