          <p>Seven-time Wimbledon champion Novak Djokovic successfully advanced to the second round after overcoming stomach issues in a four-set victory against Alexandre Muller. While top seed Jannik Sinner also secured a dominant win, the men's draw saw a major upset as third seed Alexander Zverev was defeated by Frenchman Arthur Rinderknech in a tense five-set match. Zverev's early exit marks him as the fourth top-10 men's player to be eliminated in the tournament's opening days, shaking up the competition's landscape.</p>

The author posits that navigating these minor but persistent irritations is a crucial test for any partnership, akin to accepting a partner's fundamental, unchangeable traits. Ultimately, the piece concludes that marriage, like a long drive, involves navigating frustrations and wrong turns, but the only way forward is to accept the journey and "proceed to the route" together.</p>

          <p>France has implemented a strict new law banning smoking in most public outdoor areas, including beaches, parks, and near schools, in an effort to "denormalize" the habit. The move aims to protect public health and reduce smoking rates, particularly among young people, with violators facing fines up to ‚Ç¨700. While smoking has been illegal in indoor public spaces since 2008, this expansion of the ban marks a significant cultural shift for a country where over 30% of adults still smoke, though caf√© terraces remain a final refuge for smokers.</p>
