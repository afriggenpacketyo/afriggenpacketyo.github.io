          <p>For the first time, Taiwan will participate in Japan's annual memorial ceremonies for the atomic bombings of Hiroshima and Nagasaki. The city of Nagasaki reversed an earlier decision and accepted Taiwan's request to attend the August 9th event, a move that is being closely watched by Beijing. Last year, Nagasaki controversially excluded Israel from the ceremony due to its actions in Gaza. This year's invitation was extended to all countries with diplomatic missions in Japan, a category Taiwan does not officially fall into, but the city accommodated the island's expressed desire to attend.</p>

          <p>The Los Angeles Sparks' official social media account took a jab at the Indiana Fever following a close win, referencing recent controversial comments made by Fever player Sophie Cunningham. The post listed Los Angeles as another city Indiana has "beef with," alluding to Cunningham's remarks questioning the appeal of new WNBA expansion cities like Detroit and Cleveland. Cunningham had previously clarified her comments, stating she was referring to the off-court lifestyle and not speaking down on the cities themselves. The social media post added another layer to the on-court rivalry between the two teams.</p>

          <p>A long-haired Chihuahua is being celebrated as a "four-legged hero" after its actions led to the rescue of its owner, who had fallen 26 feet into a glacier crevasse in Switzerland. The man, who was hiking on the Fee Glacier, used a walkie-talkie to call for help but rescuers in a helicopter could not locate the small hole. A rescue specialist then spotted the tiny dog perched on a rock right next to the crevasse, which allowed the team to pinpoint the man's exact location and save him. The dog remained still throughout the entire rescue operation.</p>

          <h2>Trump's Attacks on Federal Reserve Raise Questions of Presidential Influence</h2>

          <p>President Trump has escalated his public attacks on the Federal Reserve and its chair, Jerome Powell, demanding significant interest rate cuts. This departure from the typical presidential deference to the central bank's independence has raised concerns, though economists note that Trump's direct power is limited. The Fed's structure, which requires consensus among a 12-member committee, insulates it from unilateral presidential pressure. While Trump can appoint new members over time, his immediate influence is minimal, and Powell has publicly stated he will not be swayed by political demands. (not investment advice)</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>South Africa's Wiaan Mulder, captaining the team for the first time, chose to declare his team's innings while he was personally on a score of 367 not out. This decision meant he passed up the chance to break Brian Lara's iconic Test cricket record of 400 runs in a single innings, falling just 33 runs short. Mulder's declaration came during the second Test against Zimbabwe, prioritizing the team's strategic position over his individual shot at history. His score still stands as the fifth-highest individual innings in Test history and the best ever by a South African player.</p>

          <p>President Trump and Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu are set to meet at the White House, presenting a united front after recent joint strikes against Iran. However, the meeting is shadowed by the ongoing war in Gaza and whether a U.S.-backed ceasefire proposal can be finalized. While both leaders have expressed optimism, a key sticking point remains whether a deal for a 60-day pause and hostage release will lead to a permanent end to the war. The discussions are seen as critical for Mr. Trump's broader vision for Middle East peace, including normalizing relations between Israel and Saudi Arabia.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>The UK government plans to amend the Employment Rights Bill to grant parents the legal right to bereavement leave following a miscarriage at any stage of pregnancy. Currently, leave is only legally mandated for pregnancy loss after 24 weeks. Deputy Prime Minister Angela Rayner stated the change will give people necessary time to grieve without having to use sick leave. The move, praised by campaigners like Myleene Klass, is seen as a significant step in recognizing early pregnancy loss as a bereavement and destigmatizing the experience for families.</p>

          <p>A friendly but fierce rivalry has erupted on social media between UCLA and UC Berkeley, with both institutions claiming the title of the number one public university in the U.S. The dispute began after U.S. News & World Report released separate rankings; one global list placed Berkeley as the top public, while a national list focusing on undergraduates put UCLA at number one. This has led to a flurry of boastful posts, memes, and fan sparring online, with even the chancellors of both universities joining in with playful jabs. The debate highlights the different methodologies of college rankings and the enduring competition between the two prestigious UC campuses.</p>
