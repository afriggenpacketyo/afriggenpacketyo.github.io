          <p>The Bank of Korea has kept its benchmark interest rate at 2.5%, extending a pause initiated in May, as policymakers remain concerned about escalating household debt. This decision aligns with expectations and follows the implementation of stricter property measures across Seoul and surrounding Gyeonggi Province, aimed at curbing borrowing and housing demand. Analysts from Bank of America noted that Seoul's housing inflation has been a primary concern, hindering potential rate easing. The central bank also revised its 2025 inflation and GDP growth forecasts upwards, anticipating a modest domestic recovery despite potential trade uncertainties with the U.S. (not investment advice)</p>

          <div class="timestamp">2025-10-22 20:50:00 EDT</div>
        </div>
        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Researchers at the University of Pennsylvania are making strides in preventing breast cancer recurrence by targeting dormant "sleeper cells" that can later spread the disease. A clinical trial, co-led by Dr. Angela DeMichele, successfully identified and attacked these lurking cells in patients like Illeana Casiano-Vazquez, who had an aggressive form of breast cancer. After seven years, only two out of 51 women in the trial experienced recurrence, a rate significantly lower than expected. The team aims to expand these trials and explore the applicability of this approach to other cancers, offering new hope for long-term survival.</p>

          <p>A family of three was rescued by the Coast Guard off Cape Cod after their 30-foot pleasure boat caught fire, forcing them to swim to Naushon Island where they sheltered for nearly two days. A relative alerted authorities when the family failed to return as expected, initiating a search. The son's quick thinking to use the boat's marine radio, which washed ashore, enabled them to make a mayday call. The family was airlifted to a hospital, with one member in critical condition, highlighting the importance of quality safety equipment in emergency situations.</p>

          <p>From next year, menopause screening will be officially included in NHS health checks for women aged 40 to 74 in England, aiming to provide earlier advice and support. The initiative seeks to normalize discussions around menopause and address the common yet often debilitating symptoms experienced by three-quarters of women. While campaigners welcome the move to reduce stigma and improve support, concerns remain about the low uptake of health checks in certain communities. Health Secretary Wes Streeting hopes this measure will empower women to seek help for symptoms they often navigate in silence.</p>

          <p>Eurovision star Sam Ryder candidly discussed his "state of depression" and feelings of worthlessness following his success, as he embarked on creating his new album, "Heartland." After his debut album was rushed and his record label team was sacked, Ryder chose independence, leading to a crisis of confidence. He described losing his self-esteem and optimism, questioning music's purpose amidst global suffering. Ryder's recovery was aided by recommitting to his faith and moving to Nashville with his partner, allowing him to create a more introspective and authentic sound, which he calls Frontier Soul.</p>

          <p>The U.S. Army has chosen AeroVironment's Freedom Eagle-1 (FE-1) as its new counter-drone interceptor, primarily for defense against longer-range one-way attack drones and other uncrewed aerial systems. The FE-1, which recently completed key development milestones, is designed to be low-cost and versatile, with potential applications against subsonic cruise missiles. This selection addresses a critical short-range air defense gap within the Army, especially against threats like the Iranian-designed Shahed-136 drones. The interceptor's radar-agnostic design and cost-effectiveness aim to bolster air defense capabilities without straining existing resources.</p>

Diagnosed two weeks after childbirth, she felt isolated and received unhelpful advice, prompting her to launch a podcast and write a book to break the silence. Dr. Nighat Arif, a women's health specialist, confirmed the prevalence of such issues and the stigma surrounding them, which often leads to delayed diagnosis and inadequate support.
