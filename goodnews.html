          <p>Germany plans to significantly increase its defense spending, aiming to have the strongest conventional army in Europe, signaling a historic shift in security policy. This comes after Chancellor Friedrich Merz pledged to invest 5% of GDP in defense, acknowledging the need for modernization and expansion of the Bundeswehr. France, already a nuclear power, is also boosting its military budget, while Poland aims to develop the strongest land forces in Europe. Other nations like the UK and Italy are focusing on high-tech military advancements and modernizing their armed forces to address growing security threats. </p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>A rare dust storm swept across northwest Indiana and north-central Illinois, causing near-zero visibility and prompting the National Weather Service to issue dust storm warnings for Chicago for the first time. The storm, originating near Bloomington, Ill., was fueled by strong winds from thunderstorms lifting dust from parched farmland. The extreme dryness of the soil contributed to the severity of the storm, creating a dramatic scene as the dust cloud rolled into Chicago, reducing visibility to a quarter-mile at Midway International Airport. The event is considered unusual, reminiscent of the Dust Bowl era. </p>
