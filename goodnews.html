          <p>Frederick M. Nicholas, a decorated WWII veteran, attorney, and real estate developer who became a pivotal figure in Los Angeles's cultural landscape, has died at 105. Dubbed "Mr. Downtown Culture," he was instrumental in the development of major institutions like the Museum of Contemporary Art (MOCA) and the Walt Disney Concert Hall. Nicholas also founded Public Counsel, now the nation's largest pro bono law firm, to provide legal aid to the vulnerable. His contributions are credited with transforming L.A. into a global arts powerhouse, leaving a profound legacy in both the city's arts and public service sectors.</p>

          <p>The Broward Sheriff's Office is investigating the circumstances of a 5-year-old girl falling overboard from a Disney cruise ship, after which her father heroically jumped in to save her. Authorities clarified that the child was not being held by her father over the railing, countering some social media speculation. The incident occurred as the ship returned to Fort Lauderdale, with witnesses describing the father treading water with his daughter for over ten minutes before a rescue boat reached them. Maritime experts have praised the father's actions and the crew's quick response, noting that such incidents rarely have a positive outcome.</p>

          <p>A federal judge in Brooklyn has blocked the Trump administration's attempt to end Temporary Protected Status (TPS) for approximately 521,000 Haitian immigrants ahead of schedule. The judge ruled that Homeland Security Secretary Kristi Noem acted unlawfully by not following the congressionally mandated process for reconsidering the TPS designation. The ruling states that the program will continue until its original expiration date in February, finding that the interests of the Haitian immigrants in remaining in the U.S. outweigh potential harm to the government. This decision is a significant, albeit temporary, victory for Haitian TPS holders amid ongoing instability in their home country.</p>

          <p>President Donald Trump has announced that Israel has agreed to the necessary conditions for a 60-day ceasefire in Gaza and urged Hamas to accept the proposal. The deal, mediated by Qatar and Egypt, would provide a window to negotiate a permanent end to the war, which has created a dire humanitarian crisis. The announcement comes as aid groups call for the disbandment of the controversial Gaza Humanitarian Foundation (GHF) due to hundreds of civilian deaths near its distribution sites. This potential diplomatic breakthrough offers a glimmer of hope for de-escalation in the long and brutal conflict.</p>

          <p>U.S. soccer star Christian Pulisic, facing criticism from former players for skipping this summer's Gold Cup, spent time opening a new youth soccer facility in Culver City.

He stated that critics questioning his commitment to the national team were "way out of line." The event, which involved playing with young athletes, appeared to reinvigorate the star, who emphasized the joy of inspiring the next generation and reconnecting with the love of the game.</p>

The devices, which are not yet officially certified but permitted under martial law, have been distributed to thousands of front-line medics and hospitals.

Nvidia overcame concerns about competition and U.S. sales restrictions in China, rallying on the persistent, strong demand for its unrivaled AI chips.

          <p>Governor Gavin Newsom has signed a major legislative package that significantly overhauls the California Environmental Quality Act (CEQA) to spur housing construction. The reforms, which took effect immediately, waive CEQA's extensive environmental review process for most low- and mid-rise housing projects in urban areas already zoned for multifamily use. This change aims to eliminate a tool often used by opponents to delay or block new developments through lengthy studies and lawsuits. The move, pushed through as part of the state budget, represents a seismic political shift intended to remove long-standing barriers to addressing California's severe housing crisis.</p>
