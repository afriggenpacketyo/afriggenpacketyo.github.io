          <p>Biologists near the California-Oregon border are employing innovative and non-lethal methods, utilizing drones that blast AC/DC's “Thunderstruck” and movie clips featuring actors like Scarlett Johansson, to deter gray wolves from cattle. This experiment by the USDA Animal and Plant Health Inspection Service aims to mitigate increasing conflicts between recovering wolf populations and ranchers, a growing concern since the species' reintroduction. While early trials have shown success in interrupting wolf hunts, questions persist regarding the long-term effectiveness of the drones as wolves might habituate to the noise, and the high cost of the specialized technology presents a barrier for many ranchers. The article highlights the creative approach to wildlife management.</p>

          <p>The UK is employing an unusual arsenal, including drones, sniffer dogs, and nuclear atmospheric dispersion models, to combat the spruce bark beetle, a tiny but devastating pest threatening the nation's forests. The beetle, which has killed millions of spruce trees in Europe, was discovered to be arriving in the UK via wind, not imported wood, as initially thought. Government scientists claim successful eradication in at-risk areas in the east and southeast England, marking a significant achievement. However, climate change, leading to stressed trees and larger beetle populations in Europe, could exacerbate future incursions, making ongoing vigilance crucial.
