          <p>A federal judge in Florida suggested that President Donald Trump has the authority to unilaterally impose tariffs, citing a 1970s court case as precedent. The article states that Judge T. Kent Wetherell II transferred a lawsuit challenging Trump's tariffs to the Court of International Trade in New York, despite indicating support for the president's power. The ruling is a symbolic victory for the Trump administration, which faces multiple lawsuits questioning the legality of the "Liberation Day" tariffs, and the decision hinges on the interpretation of a 1970s law.</p>
