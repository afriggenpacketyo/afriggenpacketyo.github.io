          <p>Treasury Secretary Scott Bessent expressed confidence that the United States and China are nearing a trade pact, despite acknowledging that a few technical details still require resolution on the Chinese side. He noted that negotiations in Stockholm were "tough," and any final deal would need President Donald Trump's personal sign-off before the August 12 tariff deadline. This potential agreement follows a period of aggressive tariff exchanges, where U.S. duties reached 145% and China's countered at 125%, later reduced to 30% and 10% respectively. The U.S. also remains concerned about China's purchase of Iranian oil and technology supplies to Russia.</p>

          <p>Pop superstar Katy Perry and former Canadian Prime Minister Justin Trudeau have ignited romance rumors following several public sightings in Montreal. Trudeau, accompanied by his 16-year-old daughter, Ella-Grace, was seen enthusiastically attending Perry's sold-out concert, singing along to her hits. This concert appearance came days after the pair were reportedly spotted enjoying an intimate dinner together at a Montreal restaurant. The speculation about a new relationship emerges after Perry's recent public split from actor Orlando Bloom, and Trudeau's separation from his wife in 2023.</p>

        </div>
        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>New research suggests a remarkable evolutionary origin for the potato: it may have arisen from a chance hybridization event between an ancient tomato and a flowering plant from the Etuberosum group, 8 to 9 million years ago. Scientists previously struggled to reconcile the potato's mixed genetic lineage, which showed resemblances to both tomatoes and Etuberosum. The study found that neither parent plant could form tubers, the underground nutrient-storage organs. However, the unique genetic combination in their hybrid offspring enabled the development of tubers, allowing the proto-potato to colonize colder, drier environments and diversify into over 100 species, including the modern cultivated potato.</p>

          <p>JPMorgan Chase has reached a significant milestone, opening its 1,000th new branch since embarking on an ambitious expansion plan in 2018, primarily in new U.S. markets. The bank now operates approximately 5,000 locations, making it the largest branch network among American banks. This aggressive growth strategy, which includes plans for another 500 new locations by 2027, aims to capture more deposits and cater to a growing population, particularly in fast-growing areas like Charlotte, North Carolina. JPMorgan's expansion efforts have outpaced those of its major competitors, with new branches expected to contribute over $160 billion in incremental deposits. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>High Noon is initiating a recall of certain 12-packs of its vodka seltzers after discovering that some cans within these packs were mistakenly filled with vodka seltzer but mislabeled as Celsius energy drinks. This significant supply-chain error means consumers could inadvertently consume alcohol instead of a caffeinated beverage. The U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA) announced the recall for products distributed in Florida, New York, Ohio, South Carolina, Virginia, and Wisconsin. High Noon and Celsius, which share a third-party packaging supplier, have launched a joint investigation into the mix-up, though no illnesses or adverse reactions have been reported.</p>

          <p>Dylan Field, co-founder and CEO of Figma, expressed strong confidence that artificial intelligence, particularly the concept of superintelligence, does not represent a serious immediate threat to the future of his design software company. As Figma prepares for its public market debut, Field emphasized that the complexity of Figma's graphics engine and other proprietary technologies makes them difficult for AI to replicate rapidly. This perspective contrasts with the aggressive AI investments and focus on superintelligence by other tech leaders, such as Meta CEO Mark Zuckerberg. Figma's successful pricing of its initial public offering above its estimated range, valuing it at $19.3 billion, underscores market confidence in its position. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>West Ham midfielder Lucas Paqueta has been cleared of all spot-fixing charges by an independent regulatory commission, nearly two years after the Football Association initiated an investigation. Paqueta was accused of deliberately getting booked to influence betting markets, an offense that could have led to a lifetime ban from the sport. While the four primary charges were found "not proven," the commission did determine that Paqueta failed to cooperate with the investigation and will decide an appropriate sanction for these breaches. Paqueta expressed immense relief and gratitude, eagerly anticipating his return to professional football.</p>

          <p>UK Trade Secretary Jonathan Reynolds has defended the government's stance on potentially recognizing a Palestinian state, arguing that legal warnings about its statehood criteria are "missing the point." Prime Minister Sir Keir Starmer outlined conditions for recognition, including a ceasefire and renewed commitment to a two-state solution. However, legal experts argue Palestine lacks defined territory and a single effective government, citing undefined borders and a divided government. Separately, Canadian Prime Minister Mark Carney also announced his country's intention to recognize a Palestinian state, driven by the "catastrophe" in Gaza and the receding prospects for a two-state solution.</p>

This initiative aims to realize a long-standing proposal for a zone free from weapons of mass destruction, which has been stalled for decades. Menara would facilitate mutual verification, shared facilities, and transparency for nuclear energy's peaceful applications, such as medicine and agriculture. Zarif argues that such a body is crucial for regional security and stability, especially given the escalating threat of nuclear proliferation, offering a path towards a more secure future.</p>
