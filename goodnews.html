        </div>
        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Senator John Fetterman, a Democrat from Pennsylvania, publicly supported President Trump's decision to strike three Iranian nuclear sites, stating it was the "correct move" as Iran is a leading sponsor of terrorism that should not possess nuclear capabilities. Trump declared the operation a "very successful attack" on key nuclear sites, including Fordow, Natanz, and Isfahan, emphasizing that all planes safely exited Iranian airspace. The strike follows increasing tensions in the Middle East and Israeli military operations against Iranian targets. Fetterman's support highlights a bipartisan perspective on addressing Iran's nuclear ambitions.</p>

          <p>The author reflects on the experience of being among the small percentage of Americans who have never owned a smartphone, transitioning from feeling ashamed to experiencing a sense of smugness as the downsides of constant online connectivity become more apparent. The author argues that while there are inconveniences to not having a smartphone, they have avoided the negative effects of constant connectivity, such as decreased attention spans and social atrophy. The author also suggests that the ubiquitous use of smartphones has led to a decline in real-world engagement and an increase in social isolation.</p>

          <p>Drawing on research into resistance against the Nazis, the author suggests lessons for the U.S. left, emphasizing the importance of creating tangible change rather than just broadcasting opinions. The author argues that focusing on self-scrutiny and empathy, rather than judgment, can be more effective in persuading those who support far-right leaders. The piece underscores the need to embrace those who realize they have been misled and work towards a better future for everyone, highlighting the role of teachers, librarians, and the arts in fostering resistance and connection.</p>

          <p>Analysts suggest that despite the US's direct involvement in the Israel-Iran conflict, the long-term strategic focus on containing China in the Indo-Pacific will remain. While the US has redeployed some forces to address the Middle East crisis, Washington has repeatedly pledged to keep the main focus of strategic resources on China. Observers note that even with short-term deployments, the US is committed to its broader strategy of maintaining a strong presence in the Indo-Pacific region to deter Chinese aggression.</p>
