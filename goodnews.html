          <p>A jury in Denver has awarded nearly $20 million in damages to six bystanders who were injured during a 2022 police shooting in the city's Lower Downtown neighborhood. The civil lawsuit was filed against the Denver Police Department after an officer, who has since resigned, opened fire on a suspect and struck the individuals in a crowded area. The officer had previously pleaded guilty to misdemeanor assault and lost his police certification. Attorneys for the victims stated the verdict sends a clear message about police accountability and public safety.</p>

          <p>Indian cricketer Pratika Rawal has emerged as a key player for her national team at the Women's World Cup, a journey fueled by the unwavering support of her father, Pradeep. A university-level cricketer himself, Pradeep encouraged his daughter's passion from a young age, challenging gender norms in a country where women's cricket has fought for recognition. Now 25, the right-handed opening batter has shown immense promise with an impressive international record. Her success is attributed to a combination of her father's guidance, dedicated coaching, and her own focus on fitness and the psychological aspects of the game.</p>

          <p>The United States and China are set to conduct a new round of trade talks next week, aiming to prevent further escalation of their tariff conflict. The meeting follows President Donald Trump's admission that the current high tariff rates on Chinese goods are "not sustainable," despite defending them as a necessary response. Tensions have recently increased after China expanded export controls on critical rare earth minerals, prompting threats of 100% tariffs from the U.S. The negotiations are crucial as a temporary tariff truce is set to expire on November 10.

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>A new study indicates that a single blood test, known as the Galleri test, could significantly accelerate the diagnosis of more than 50 types of cancer. Results from a trial in North America demonstrated the test's ability to detect cancer DNA fragments in the blood, identifying malignancies at an early stage when treatment is most effective. Crucially, three-quarters of the cancers detected are types that currently lack any routine screening program, such as ovarian and pancreatic cancer. The NHS is currently conducting a large-scale trial, with results expected next year to determine its future use.</p>

          <p>A woman from Newport, Wales, discovered she had a large, cancerous kidney tumor after a minor accident during a holiday weekend at a Butlin's resort. Charlotte Morjaria, 31, sought emergency care for what she believed was a broken rib after being playfully picked up during a game. A precautionary CT scan to check for internal damage unexpectedly revealed the sizable tumor, which had produced only subtle symptoms she had attributed to other causes. Following surgery to remove her kidney, she is now cancer-free, crediting the seemingly unfortunate mishap with saving her life.</p>

          <p>Alibaba Cloud has introduced a new computing pooling system, named Aegaeon, which it claims can reduce the number of Nvidia GPUs required to serve AI models by up to 82 percent. During a beta test, the system cut the number of Nvidia H20 GPUs needed to run dozens of large language models from 1,192 to just 213. The technology addresses a major inefficiency in cloud services, where many GPUs are allocated to AI models that are only used sporadically. This innovation aims to significantly lower the high operational costs associated with serving multiple AI workloads concurrently. (not investment advice)</p>
