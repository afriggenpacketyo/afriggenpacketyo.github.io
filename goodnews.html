        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Karol Nawrocki, a nationalist backed by Donald Trump, has won the Polish presidency in a close election against Warsaw Mayor Rafa≈Ç Trzaskowski. Nawrocki's victory poses a challenge to the current pro-EU government led by Prime Minister Donald Tusk, potentially disrupting Poland's relationship with Brussels and Kyiv. As president, Nawrocki holds veto power over legislation, which he is expected to use to impede Tusk's pro-EU reforms, including the disbursement of 137 billion euros in EU funds that were previously frozen due to rule-of-law concerns. EU Commission President Ursula von der Leyen expressed confidence in continued cooperation with Poland despite the election outcome. </p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Japan's revenue from its departure tax on travelers has reached a record high in fiscal year 2024, driven by a surge in international visitors. The International Tourist Tax, levied at 1,000 yen per departing traveler, has already generated 48.1 billion yen, surpassing the previous record from fiscal 2019. The increase in tourism is attributed to a weaker yen and more available flights, according to the Japan National Tourism Organization. Prime Minister Shigeru Ishiba has suggested potentially increasing the departure tax to further promote tourism and address overcrowding at popular sites. </p>

          <p>Researchers are investigating whether microbes found in household sludge could help mitigate climate change. Scientists at The Two Frontiers Project are collecting samples from showerheads, dishwashers, and water heaters to identify microorganisms that can capture carbon dioxide. The team, inspired by extremophiles found in harsh environments, believes that microbes in these unusual home environments may have unique carbon-capturing abilities. The Two Frontiers Project is partnering with CitSci to engage homeowners nationwide in the search for these microbial heroes, hoping to find new ways to reduce CO2 levels. </p>

The move to increase tariffs to 50% from 25% has reignited trade tensions and drawn criticism from global partners.

The plan aims to provide scholarships and housing assistance to descendants of the victims, but it will not include direct cash payments to individuals. Nichols characterizes the initiative as a "road to repair" rather than reparations, emphasizing the need to restore the Greenwood district's economic vitality. The proposal follows an executive order recognizing June 1 as Tulsa race massacre observance day and seeks to overcome challenging political headwinds. </p>

          <p>The article discusses how the US economy increasingly works against fertility, demanding more years in school and longer hours at work, especially for women. The average age of new mothers is rising, and schools and workplaces are ill-suited to support those who wish to start families earlier. The piece argues that progressive leaders should offer alternatives that respect women's autonomy and ensure people can make less constrained choices about parenthood. The author advocates for more efficient and affordable education, stronger labor regulations, and policies like those in Scandinavia to support parents in balancing work and family life. </p>

RTM involves patients reimagining their trauma through mental exercises to fade its emotional charge, based on the theory of reconsolidation. It follows a manualized protocol involving a movie theater metaphor and rescripting the traumatic memory. A large-scale clinical trial by Michael Roy showed RTM modestly outperforming prolonged exposure, but skepticism remains due to the unorthodox approach and limited research. </p>
