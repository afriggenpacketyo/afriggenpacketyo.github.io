          <p>Despite societal shifts towards more equitable parenting roles, many institutions and individuals still default to assuming mothers are the primary caregivers. This phenomenon is supported by research showing that schools and medical offices are more likely to contact mothers, even when fathers are listed as the primary contact. This can lead to added stress and disruptions for mothers, while also undermining fathers' roles in parenting. Outdated software systems and societal stereotypes contribute to this persistent bias, highlighting the need for systemic changes to support more equitable parenting practices.</p>
