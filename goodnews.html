          <p>Elon Musk's favorability among Republicans has decreased by 16 points since March, according to a recent Quinnipiac University poll. While a majority of Republicans still view Musk favorably, the number has dropped from 78% to 62%. This decline follows a public disagreement between Musk and President Donald Trump over the president's spending bill. Despite the decrease in favorability, Musk remains popular among Republicans for his role in the Trump administration's Department of Government Efficiency.</p>

          <p>Elon Musk's official role in the Trump administration recently came to an end, following a public falling out with the President. A Quinnipiac University poll indicates that Musk's favorability among Republicans has declined, though a majority still hold a favorable view. Overall, only 30% of self-identified voters surveyed in the U.S. hold a favorable opinion of Musk. Despite the slide in favorability, Musk is still popular among Republicans after his time running the Department of Government Efficiency (DOGE).</p>

          <p>The United States may extend a 90-day pause on implementing steep tariffs on goods from major trading partners if they continue to negotiate "in good faith," according to U.S. Treasury Secretary Scott Bessent. Bessent's remarks suggest a willingness to prolong the deadline beyond early July for countries actively engaged in trade discussions. Japan is one such partner, with Prime Minister Shigeru Ishiba and President Donald Trump scheduled to meet during a Group of Seven summit. The Trump administration has been focused on securing trade deals with Japan, India, South Korea, and the European Union.</p>

          <p>The UK government's Spending Review emphasizes long-term investments, particularly in capital projects, with the aim of transforming the public realm and boosting economic potential. While day-to-day spending is limited, the government is betting on patience from the electorate, even as many feel squeezed financially. The review highlights increased council tax to fund the police, while more detailed infrastructure plans are expected in the coming weeks. The government is seeking to frame this moment as a turning point, focusing on national renewal and rebuilding the economy.</p>
