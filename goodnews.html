          <p>The UK's Competition and Markets Authority (CMA) is investigating Google for potentially holding too much power in the online search market, where it accounts for over 90% of searches in the UK, and could require Google to link to rival search platforms. The CMA is exploring changes that would give consumers more choice and control over their search services, which could include choice screens and increased transparency for publishers. Google's parent company, Alphabet, expressed concerns that the suggestions were "broad and unfocused," but stated it would "work constructively" with the regulator. The watchdog's final decision is expected in October, with potential implications for businesses and consumers in the UK. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>New Yorkers are voting in a mayoral primary that could significantly impact the Democratic party, with Zohran Mamdani, a democratic socialist, challenging former Governor Andrew Cuomo. Mamdani has gained momentum, especially among young voters, running on a progressive platform, while Cuomo has faced attacks focusing almost exclusively on Mamdani. The winner of the primary is likely to become the next mayor, given the city's Democratic lean, although incumbent Eric Adams is running as an independent candidate. Adams faces charges of bribery and accepting foreign campaign contributions.</p>

          <p>A coalition of private health insurance companies has pledged to standardize and reform the prior authorization process, aiming to reduce red tape for patients and healthcare providers. The pledge includes standardizing electronic submissions, reducing the number of services requiring prior authorization, honoring existing authorizations when patients change plans, and minimizing delays with real-time approvals. While this represents a voluntary commitment, federal health officials have stated they are prepared to issue new regulations if insurers do not abide by the agreement. The reforms come amid growing criticism of the prior authorization process and its impact on patient access to care.</p>

          <p>Oil prices experienced a nearly 5% drop on Tuesday following Israel's agreement to a ceasefire with Iran, easing concerns about potential supply disruptions. Prices had previously risen due to fears that Iran could blockade the Strait of Hormuz, a crucial shipping route for oil and gas. The FTSE 100 index in the UK and other major stock markets also saw gains after the ceasefire announcement. However, the price decline narrowed after Israel accused Iran of violating the ceasefire.

          <p>The U.S. Air Force's B-2 stealth bomber played a crucial role in strikes against Iranian nuclear sites, requiring pilots to endure long, multi-day flights. Pilots carefully consider their diet, undergo sleep studies, and rely on turkey sandwiches and sunflower seeds to stay alert. Mid-air refueling is one of the most dangerous aspects of these missions, requiring pilots to rely on visual cues and memorized reference points. The B-2 costs approximately $65,000 per hour to operate, and the Air Force plans to replace it with B-21 Raiders in the coming decades.</p>
