          <p>The European Union is providing ‚Ç¨5.5 million in emergency funding to Radio Free Europe/Radio Liberty after the broadcaster lost US public funding due to cuts by the Trump administration, which accused it of liberal bias. EU Foreign Policy Chief Kaja Kallas emphasized the significance of Radio Free Europe in resisting authoritarian regimes, recalling its role in delivering news to people under communist rule during her childhood in Estonia. The funds will focus on countries in regions such as Central Asia and the Caucasus, supporting independent journalism in a time of growing unfiltered content. Radio Free Europe's lawyers have challenged the decision to cut their funding in court.</p>

          <p>In a major upset in Pittsburgh's mayoral primary, Corey O‚ÄôConnor, the son of a former mayor, defeated incumbent Ed Gainey, signaling voter dissatisfaction with the city under its current progressive leadership. O‚ÄôConnor, who had support from the party's "old guard" and some Republicans, positioned himself as a pragmatic candidate focused on revitalizing the downtown area and resourcing the police. Gainey, the city‚Äôs first Black mayor, faced criticism over police leadership turnover and complaints about basic services despite some economic gains and a decrease in crime.

          <p>Japan's Farm Minister Taku Eto resigned after facing criticism for stating he doesn't buy rice because he receives so much from supporters, a comment made amidst rising rice prices. Prime Minister Shigeru Ishiba accepted Eto's resignation and is expected to replace him with Shinjiro Koizumi. Eto's remarks came shortly after the Ministry of Agriculture decided to release additional rice from emergency stockpiles to lower prices, which have doubled from a year earlier. Opinion polls showed public dissatisfaction with the government's handling of rice prices, exacerbated by stagnant wage growth amid inflation.</p>

Developed by scientists at the University of Nottingham in partnership with clinicians at Nottingham University Hospitals NHS Trust, the method has already been used in 50 operations and has had a 100% success rate in diagnosing the exact type of tumour. The new technique has seen results returned in as little as 90 minutes, and allows surgeons to perform more radical surgery, if needed, at the time.</p>
