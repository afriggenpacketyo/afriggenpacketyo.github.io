          <p>The Supreme Court has temporarily blocked the Trump administration from deporting Venezuelan migrants accused of gang membership, citing due process concerns and referring the case back to an appeals court, as detailed in this New York Times article. Justices Alito and Thomas dissented, signaling a divided court. Meanwhile, a New Jersey Transit strike disrupted commutes, and House Republicans faced internal opposition on a major domestic policy bill focused on tax cuts and military spending. The Department of Homeland Security is considering a reality TV show where immigrants compete for citizenship, and James Comey is under investigation for a social media post.</p>

          <p>Former President Joe Biden downplayed Special Counsel Robert Hur's report questioning his mental acuity, months after being interviewed about classified documents, as reported by Fox News. Audio recordings revealed Biden struggling to recall key dates, such as his son Beau's death and Trump's election year. In response to Doocy's questioning about being described as an "elderly man with a poor memory," Biden asserted his competence and dismissed the need for Hur's recommendation. The Hur report led to increased scrutiny from Republicans, while Democrats initially defended Biden before eventually urging him to drop his re-election bid.</p>

Winds of 60 to 70 mph carried dust from dry farmlands, impacting drivers on Interstate 55 and disrupting a high school graduation in Morris, Illinois.

          <p>A Wisconsin judge pleaded not guilty to federal charges of helping an undocumented immigrant evade immigration authorities, drawing parallels to a similar case in Massachusetts, as reported by NPR. Judge Shelley Joseph was charged with conspiracy and obstruction of justice for allegedly helping an undocumented immigrant escape through a back door of her courtroom. While the Wisconsin case saw swift charges, the Massachusetts case took over a year, highlighting differing approaches to prosecuting such actions.

          <p>The United Arab Emirates is increasing its investment, aid, and presence in Africa as the United States and China reduce theirs, as reported by the New York Times. Emirati investments have exploded since 2019, with $110 billion in deals announced, primarily by firms aligned with the ruling powers. The UAE sees Africa as essential for diversifying its economy away from fossil fuels, investing in ports, mines, renewable energy projects, and other strategic assets. This shift reflects a broader trend away from development aid and liberal values towards a more business-focused approach.</p>
