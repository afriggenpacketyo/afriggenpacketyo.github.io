          <p>Maryland lawmakers have introduced a bill to posthumously award Henrietta Lacks a Congressional Gold Medal for her contributions to medical research through her HeLa cells, which were taken without her consent. Lacks' cells have been instrumental in developing treatments for diseases like polio and HIV/AIDS. The bill acknowledges the controversy surrounding the use of her cells without informed consent and aims to honor her legacy, while also highlighting the importance of ethical considerations in medical research. The Lacks family has previously sued pharmaceutical companies for using HeLa cells without permission, reaching a settlement with Thermo Fisher in 2023.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Millions of consumers in the UK could be eligible for compensation up to ¬£70 each following a court ruling that found Mastercard administered unfair fees between 1992 and 2008. The legal case, brought forward by a former financial ombudsman, argued that shoppers were charged higher prices due to wrongly levied fees on transactions. Consumers who lived in England, Wales, or Northern Ireland for at least three months between June 1997 and June 2008, and bought goods or services from UK businesses accepting Mastercard, are eligible to claim compensation.</p>

          <p>The Senate voted to advance the GENIUS Act, a bill designed to regulate stablecoins, a type of cryptocurrency pegged to the value of assets like the U.S. dollar. The bill sets rules for stablecoin issuers, mandating reserves of underlying assets and granting coin holders priority in bankruptcy repayment, aiming to protect consumers. Supporters argue it will formalize the crypto industry and encourage innovation, while critics, including Senator Elizabeth Warren, claim it provides weak consumer protection and fails to address conflict-of-interest concerns, particularly regarding President Trump's cryptocurrency ventures.</p>

          <p>Tesla CEO Elon Musk announced that the company will launch its robotaxi service in Austin, Texas, by the end of June, with plans to expand to Los Angeles and San Francisco. The service will initially start with about 10 Model Y vehicles equipped with FSD Unsupervised, with remote monitoring by Tesla employees. Musk emphasized that there will be no human safety drivers in the cars, differentiating Tesla's approach from Alphabet's Waymo, which already operates commercial, driverless ride-hailing services in various U.S. markets.</p>

These developments highlight the potential for GE Vernova's energy solutions to address future electricity demands. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>Elon Musk, who was a top donor in the 2024 election, has announced plans to scale back his political spending in the future, stating that he feels he has "done enough." This marks a significant shift after Musk poured over $200 million into the 2024 race and previously indicated that his America PAC would play a major role in future elections. Sources suggest this decision is influenced by frustration with Washington and increasing attacks on his companies, including Tesla and Twitter. Since joining the Trump administration as the head of DOGE, Musk's political involvement has decreased, and Tesla's stock has surged.</p>

          <p>With gold prices surging, investors are considering adding the precious metal to their portfolios, but it's important to do so strategically. Experts recommend limiting gold investments to a maximum of 10% of the overall portfolio, avoiding riskier investment types like gold mining stocks, and monitoring the economic climate. Gold functions primarily as an income protector rather than an income producer, so balancing it with other assets is key. Monitoring the economic climate will help determine potential selling opportunities, ensuring that gold is working for the investor as intended. (not investment advice)</p>

The new feature, launched in the United States, will initially not serve ads and is part of a broader effort to integrate A.I. into various Google services, including Gmail and shopping.</p>
