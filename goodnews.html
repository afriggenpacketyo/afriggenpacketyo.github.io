        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>With inflation remaining above the Federal Reserve's target, seniors on fixed incomes face significant financial pressure. The article suggests three key strategies to manage finances effectively this August: aggressively tackling high-interest credit card debt, exploring alternative income sources like reverse mortgages, and thoroughly reviewing insurance coverages to ensure they are adequate and cost-effective. These actions aim to provide immediate relief and enhance long-term financial stability for older Americans navigating the challenging economic environment. (not investment advice)</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>The International Court of Justice has delivered a unanimous advisory opinion stating that countries have a legal duty to prevent significant environmental harm from greenhouse gas emissions originating within their borders. This historic ruling, prompted by a campaign led by the island nation of Vanuatu, affirms that existing international treaties and human rights laws compel nations to protect the climate system. While not legally binding, the opinion sets a powerful legal precedent that could influence thousands of climate change lawsuits worldwide, strengthening the position of vulnerable nations seeking accountability from major polluters.</p>

          <p>Financial giants Goldman Sachs and Bank of New York Mellon are collaborating to introduce tokenized money market funds, a move set to innovate the $7.1 trillion industry. This new platform will allow BNY's institutional clients to invest in funds from major asset managers like BlackRock and Fidelity, with ownership recorded on Goldman's blockchain. The initiative aims to provide faster, 24/7 transactions and increased efficiency by creating digital certificates of ownership. This development is seen as a foundational step toward a more integrated digital financial ecosystem where tokenized assets can be used as collateral.</p>

          <p>In a pair of significant rulings, federal judges have ordered the release of Salvadoran national Kilmar Abrego Garcia from criminal custody and temporarily barred immigration authorities from immediately detaining him. A Tennessee judge ruled he should be released pending his human smuggling trial, while a Maryland judge ordered that he be given 72 hours' notice before any deportation proceedings. The decisions address concerns that Abrego Garcia, who was previously deported in what the government called an "administrative error," would be denied due to process, ensuring he can return to his family in Maryland.</p>

The agreement, which could rise to £79 million with add-ons, marks another major acquisition for the club this summer. Ekitike, who scored 15 goals in 31 starts for Frankfurt last season, has passed his medical and will join his new team for their pre-season tour.

          <p>Retail traders, largely organized on Reddit's WallStreetBets forum, have turned their attention to GoPro and Krispy Kreme, causing significant surges in their stock prices. Shares for the wearable camera company and the doughnut chain rose sharply, fueled by speculative buying reminiscent of the 2021 GameStop mania. Both companies are seen as targets due to their relatively low stock prices and significant short interest, particularly for Krispy Kreme. This activity coincides with a broader market rally, as investors react positively to better-than-expected news regarding international trade tariffs, pushing the S&P 500 to new record highs.</p>

          <p>Former England captain Michael Vaughan has asserted that the national cricket team is stronger with the inclusion of veteran spinner Liam Dawson. Making his return to Test cricket after an eight-year absence, the 35-year-old made an immediate impact by taking a key wicket on the first day of the fourth Test against India. Vaughan highlighted Dawson's all-around package, including his consistent bowling for control, solid batting, and good fielding, as crucial assets for the team's balance. This contrasts with the team's previous preference for younger, less experienced spinners, suggesting Dawson's experience provides much-needed stability.</p>

Torres, who grew up in public housing, emphasized the need for a pragmatic governing agenda focused on tangible issues like the affordability crisis, rather than just sloganeering.

          <p>For homeowners needing to borrow a large sum like $100,000, a home equity loan is presented as a significantly cheaper option than a personal loan in the current high-interest-rate environment. The article breaks down the costs, showing that the average interest rate for a home equity loan is substantially lower than that for a personal loan, leading to major savings. For example, on a 15-year term, a borrower could save approximately $265 per month, totaling over $47,000 in interest over the life of the loan. This makes leveraging home equity an attractive financial strategy. (not investment advice)</p>

The GAO concluded that this action violated the Impoundment Control Act of 1974, which prevents the executive branch from unilaterally refusing to spend money allocated by Congress, noting that HHS failed to provide a legal justification.</p>

          <p>President Donald Trump has indicated that his administration is considering the elimination of capital gains taxes on the sale of primary residences, a move aimed at boosting the housing market. Under current law, profits from home sales are taxed once they exceed $250,000 for single filers or $500,000 for married couples. The idea follows the introduction of a bill by Rep. Marjorie Taylor Greene to achieve the same goal. While the proposal could benefit many long-term homeowners, particularly in high-value areas, experts note it could be costly and its congressional support is uncertain.</p>
