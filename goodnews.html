          <h2>Japan's Stockpiled Rice Available at Lower Prices</h2>
          <div class="timestamp">2025-05-31 01:33:00 EDT</div>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>The Japanese government has begun releasing stockpiled rice through direct contracts with retailers, offering consumers cheaper options as rice prices soar. Ito-Yokado and Iris Ohyama were the first to sell the rice, with a 5-kilogram bag priced at 2,160 yen ($15). The rice sold out quickly at an Ito-Yokado store in Tokyo, and long lines formed at an Iris Ohyama store in Sendai. This initiative aims to mitigate the impact of rising rice prices on households by selling 300,000 tons of rice from 2021 and 2022 directly to retailers, a move away from previous auction-based sales. </p>
