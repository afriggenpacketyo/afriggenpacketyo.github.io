        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Four men in their twenties required rescue from New York's Catskill Mountains after they became disoriented while hiking under the influence of psychedelic mushrooms. The group called for help when one member experienced a "debilitating high" and was found by rangers in a fetal position, unable to communicate. Another hiker was reportedly hallucinating about a non-existent bridge. Forest rangers located the group less than 1,000 feet off the marked trail and guided them back to safety without any need for hospitalization. This incident follows a similar case in the Adirondacks earlier this year where hikers mistakenly reported a friend's death while on hallucinogens.</p>

        </div>
        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>With the average 30-year fixed mortgage rate recently experiencing a significant drop, prospective homebuyers can take several steps to secure even better loan terms. Key strategies include improving one's credit score, as higher FICO scores directly correlate with lower interest rates, potentially saving thousands over the life of a loan. Increasing the down payment to 20% or more can also lead to more favorable rates from lenders and helps avoid private mortgage insurance. Additionally, borrowers should consider alternatives to the traditional 30-year fixed loan, such as adjustable-rate mortgages (ARMs), which currently offer lower initial rates.

          <h2>An Examination of Whether Seniors Can Avoid Paying for Medicare Part B Premiums</h2>

        </div>
        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>This article explores the possibility for seniors to avoid the monthly premium for Medicare Part B, which covers doctor visits and preventive care. While most cannot completely avoid the cost, there are specific scenarios for delaying enrollment or receiving financial assistance. The most common method is to remain on a creditable employer health plan past age 65, which allows for penalty-free delayed enrollment. For those with limited income, state-run Medicare Savings Programs or Medicaid can help cover or eliminate the premiums. However, forgoing Part B can restrict access to supplemental coverage like Medigap or Medicare Advantage plans, potentially leading to higher out-of-pocket costs later.</p>

        </div>
        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>In the current economic climate, savers with significant funds like $40,000 must weigh the distinct advantages of certificates of deposit (CDs) versus high-yield savings accounts. While both offer attractive returns compared to traditional savings, CDs provide a fixed interest rate, protecting earnings from future rate cuts, but require locking funds away for a set term. High-yield savings accounts offer more flexibility and access to funds, but their rates are variable and likely to decline. Savers should consider their long-term earning potential, their ability to leave the money untouched, and the still-superior returns both options offer over standard savings accounts.

          <p>Projections from Norway's parliamentary election indicate that Prime Minister Jonas Gahr Stoere's minority Labour Party government is on track to secure a narrow victory. The left-leaning alliance is expected to win a slim majority of 87 seats in the 169-seat parliament, allowing the current government to remain in power. The election campaign focused heavily on domestic issues such as inflation and the quality of public services. However, international instability, including the war in Ukraine, may have also played a role, with some observers suggesting voters preferred the stability offered by the incumbent government.</p>

          <p>England's national football team manager, Thomas Tuchel, has declared his intention to utilize long throw-ins as a tactical weapon, stating "the long throw-in is back." This strategy, famously employed by Stoke City's Rory Delap over a decade ago, is seeing a resurgence in English football as a way to create scoring opportunities. Data shows a significant increase in long throws into the penalty area in the Premier League, with teams like Brentford demonstrating their effectiveness. With limited preparation time before the World Cup, Tuchel believes focusing on set-piece opportunities like throw-ins is a smart approach to gain a competitive edge.</p>

According to the National Weather Service, temperatures are forecast to drop 10 to 20 degrees below average, with some inland areas struggling to reach the mid-80s. The low-pressure system is also bringing a chance of light rain and thunderstorms to Northern California, which could help dampen wildfire risks in the region.

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>As mortgage rates fall to an 11-month low, homeowners who purchased homes in recent years with higher rates are prompted to consider refinancing. Key questions to evaluate include whether current rates, now in the low 6% range, are low enough to justify the action, especially for those with rates near 8% from 2023. Homeowners must also weigh the risk of waiting for potentially lower rates against the savings available now, and factor in closing costs, which typically range from 2% to 6% of the loan amount. Finally, one's long-term plans for the home are crucial, as moving before breaking even on closing costs would negate the financial benefits of refinancing. (not investment advice)</p>
