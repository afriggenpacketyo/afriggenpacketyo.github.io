          <p>Bitcoin reached a new record high above $111,000, driven by positive momentum, optimism around U.S. crypto regulation, and institutional buyer interest. The price increase occurred despite a drop in U.S. stock markets, suggesting investors are seeking alternative stores of value. Moody's recent downgrade of U.S. sovereign debt also contributed to Bitcoin's appeal as a hedge against fiat instability. JPMorgan CEO Jamie Dimon, a notable bitcoin skeptic, announced that the bank will allow clients to buy the digital currency. (not investment advice)</p>
