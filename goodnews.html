          <p>President Trump is set to sign a deal that will permit TikTok to continue operating in the United States, avoiding a potential ban. The agreement structures TikTok's U.S. operations as a joint venture with a majority of American investors, including Oracle, which will manage the security of U.S. user data and review the app's code. Under the deal, TikTok's recommendation algorithm will be retrained using only U.S. user data, while its Chinese parent company, ByteDance, will retain a minority stake below the 20% foreign ownership limit set by law. The move aims to address national security concerns while preserving the popular app for its 170 million American users.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>The Social Security Administration (SSA) is ending its 85-year practice of mailing paper checks, mandating a shift to electronic payments for its nearly 70 million beneficiaries starting September 30. Recipients will now receive their benefits via direct deposit or a prepaid debit card, a move the agency states will enhance efficiency, security, and cost-effectiveness. The SSA notes that electronic payments are significantly less likely to be lost or stolen than paper checks. While the transition is comprehensive, exceptions will be made for individuals who have no other means to receive payments, addressing concerns for the unbanked population who rely on the traditional system.</p>

          <p>Jaguar Land Rover (JLR) has started to bring some of its IT systems back online, beginning a phased restart of operations after a debilitating cyberattack in August forced a complete network shutdown. The company is now able to process payments to suppliers and handle vehicle sales, which is crucial for cash flow, though its manufacturing plants remain closed until at least next month. The prolonged shutdown has put immense pressure on JLR's supply chain, with many smaller businesses facing financial ruin. In response, the UK government is actively working on a support package to assist these suppliers while they await the full resumption of production.</p>

          <p>Recent online speculation that actor Keanu Reeves and artist Alexandra Grant had married is false, as confirmed by both a representative for Reeves and Grant herself. The rumors were amplified by viral AI-generated images depicting the couple in wedding attire, which followed a tabloid report claiming they had a private ceremony in Europe. Grant addressed the misinformation on Instagram, sharing a real photo of the couple kissing and clarifying it was not an engagement or wedding announcement. She cautioned followers about the spread of fake news, even when it appears to be positive, emphasizing the need for media literacy in the age of AI.</p>

          <p>Startup airline Breeze Airways is set to launch its first international flights early next year, expanding its network to popular vacation destinations in Mexico, Jamaica, and the Dominican Republic. Founded by JetBlue's David Neeleman, the carrier will offer seasonal, non-stop service from several U.S. cities, including Norfolk, Charleston, and New Orleans, to Cancun, Montego Bay, and Punta Cana. This expansion marks a significant milestone for the airline, which debuted in 2021 and has focused on connecting underserved markets. Having recently received FAA certification for international travel, Breeze aims to continue its strategy of flying routes with limited competition from other major carriers.</p>

          <p>Amazon has agreed to a $2.5 billion settlement with the Federal Trade Commission (FTC) to resolve allegations that it tricked millions of consumers into signing up for its Prime subscription service and intentionally complicated the cancellation process. The settlement includes a $1 billion civil penalty and $1.5 billion for customer refunds, with an estimated 35 million people eligible to receive a payment of $51. The FTC lawsuit claimed Amazon used manipulative user-interface designs to secure unwanted enrollments. As part of the agreement, Amazon, which admitted no wrongdoing, must make its enrollment and cancellation processes more transparent and obtain express consent before charging customers.</p>

          <p>FundSeeder, a platform co-founded by "Market Wizards" author Jack Schwager, is successfully discovering and funding skilled financial traders from non-traditional backgrounds, including a former TV weatherman and a dentist. The firm analyzes trading performance data to identify hidden talent globally, providing them with capital to scale their strategies and bypass traditional Wall Street barriers. One such trader, former meteorologist Brian Lovern, leveraged his weather expertise to achieve triple-digit annual returns trading natural gas and has now received $3 million in backing. The initiative aims to democratize access to capital for proficient traders who lack industry connections, functioning like an accelerator for aspiring fund managers.</p>

          <h2>Investment Analyst Views Starbucks' Restructuring and Store Closures as a Positive Strategy</h2>
          <div class="timestamp">2025-09-25 13:28:07 EDT</div>
        </div>
        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>CNBC's Jim Cramer has endorsed Starbucks' new $1 billion restructuring plan, which includes laying off 900 corporate employees and closing underperforming North American stores, calling the move "very bullish." He argues that CEO Brian Niccol's strategy to eliminate weaker locations and reallocate resources to more successful ones is a necessary step to improve same-store sales and overall profitability. The plan is part of a broader "Back to Starbucks" initiative aimed at enhancing service and customer experience. Despite recent struggles, including six consecutive quarters of declining sales, the analysis suggests these decisive actions could put the coffee giant back on a path to growth.

          <p>The UK government has unveiled its "Pride in Place" program, a long-term investment of up to £5 billion designated for 339 communities across the country. The funding is intended to boost local high streets, parks, and public spaces, with spending decisions to be driven by local community groups and organizations rather than council bids. Some areas will receive £2 million annually for a decade, while others get a one-off £1.5 million payment. The initiative also aims to empower councils to purchase derelict properties for redevelopment and block the opening of unwanted betting and vape shops, in an effort to restore local pride.</p>

          <p>Billy Crudup, who has earned two Emmy awards for his role as network executive Cory Ellison on "The Morning Show," reflects on a career defined by taking risks in film and theater. The 57-year-old actor says he never expected to land such a complex and popular television role at this stage of his career. He credits his early dedication to challenging stage work, including a one-man show where he played 19 characters, with giving him the confidence for the part. It was this theatrical performance that caught the attention of co-star and executive producer Jennifer Aniston, ultimately leading to his casting in the acclaimed Apple TV+ series.</p>

          <h2>HSBC Reports Successful Use of Quantum Computing to Enhance Bond Trading Predictions</h2>
          <div class="timestamp">2025-09-25 12:47:37 EDT</div>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>In what it calls a world-first for the financial services industry, HSBC has successfully used quantum computing to optimize its bond trading algorithms. In a trial conducted with IBM, the bank combined classical computing with IBM's Heron quantum processor, resulting in a 34% improvement in the accuracy of algorithmic bond price predictions. This enhancement allows for a better estimation of the likelihood that a trade will be completed at a quoted price, which can lead to increased margins and greater market liquidity. The successful trial suggests that quantum computing is on the verge of providing practical solutions for complex financial problems.</p>
