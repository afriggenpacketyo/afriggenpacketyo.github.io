          <p>World Athletics president Lord Coe has acknowledged that the warm-up facilities for the World Championships in Tokyo are "not perfect" following complaints from athletes, including Great Britain's Keely Hodgkinson. The main warm-up area is located a 15-minute bus ride from the stadium, forcing athletes into a lengthy two-hour pre-competition routine that some find draining. While organizers state they have done their best within logistical constraints and that such setups are not unique, the situation has drawn criticism for not meeting the standards expected of a premier athletics event. The issue highlights the complex challenges of hosting major international sporting competitions.</p>

          <p>Syria is holding its first parliamentary elections following decades of dictatorship, employing a complex indirect voting system due to the country's instability and displaced populations. Instead of direct public voting, electoral colleges appointed by sub-committees will choose 121 members of the new People's Assembly. While the process includes measures for diversity and has invited international observers, it faces significant controversy. Critics argue the system gives excessive power to interim president Ahmad al-Sharaa, who will directly appoint another 70 members, potentially undermining the democratic legitimacy of the new government and its task of drafting a new constitution.</p>

          <h2>Neuroscientist Details How to Overcome Romantic Obsession Known as Limerence</h2>

        </div>
        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Neuroscientist Tom Bellamy's new book, "Smitten," explores the psychological state of "limerence," an intense romantic infatuation characterized by obsessive thoughts and emotional highs and lows. The condition, often experienced in the early stages of love, can turn into anxiety and craving if a healthy bond doesn't form, particularly when the object of affection is unavailable or sends mixed signals. Bellamy offers strategies to break the cycle, such as limiting contact, reframing positive daydreams into negative scenarios to spoil the mental reward, and focusing on new personal goals. The aim is to shift focus from the obsession to personal growth and well-being.</p>

          <h2>Liberal Democrats Face Strategic Questions After Recent Electoral Success</h2>
          <div class="timestamp">2025-09-20 04:54:02 EDT</div>
        </div>
        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>As the UK's Liberal Democrats gather for their party conference, they face a crucial question of strategy following significant gains in the last general election. Leader Sir Ed Davey's playful, attention-grabbing stunts helped the party surpass expectations, but polling now suggests many voters, including their own supporters, feel it's time for a more serious approach. The party sees an opportunity to attract centrist Conservative voters alienated by their party's internal turmoil. However, to capitalize on this, the Lib Dems must expand their policy platform beyond key campaign issues and find a way to make their moderate positions resonate in an increasingly polarized political landscape.</p>

          <h2>AI Tools Show Potential to Mitigate Workplace Burnout, But Can Also Contribute to It</h2>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Artificial intelligence is emerging as a double-edged sword in the fight against workplace burnout, a phenomenon costing U.S. companies millions annually. AI tools like ChatGPT can automate repetitive tasks and reduce cognitive load, with some studies showing a drop in emotional exhaustion in workplaces that adopt them. However, other research suggests that frequent AI users may experience higher rates of burnout. This can be due to the mental strain of using the technology, the pressure of learning new systems, and the tendency for increased efficiency to simply lead to a heavier workload rather than genuine relief, creating more work instead of alleviating it.</p>

          <p>As a new school year begins, some parents are choosing to leave school-related WhatsApp groups to escape what they describe as a source of anxiety, negativity, and administrative overload. These groups, intended for communication, often become forums for polarized opinions, competitive parenting, and a constant stream of notifications. One parent noted that headteachers have had to intervene due to divisive content. Critics also point out that the groups disproportionately place the burden of school communication on mothers. While the chats can be useful for reminders and organizing, many are finding that the benefits do not outweigh the stress and background noise.</p>
