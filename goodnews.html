          <p>Amid significant market volatility, an Invesco senior portfolio manager suggests that income funds utilizing options-based strategies can offer investors structural protection against wild swings. These funds are not reliant on traditional stock correlations and can provide income that is less sensitive to interest rate changes, which is relevant as policymakers consider rate cuts. The manager advises investors to look for ETFs managed by institutional professionals and to be cautious of unsustainable yields with high fees. (not investment advice)</p>

No injuries were reported among the 113 passengers on the arriving flight from Jackson Hole, Wyoming, who were able to deplane normally after a delay. The incident involved the wing of one plane striking the horizontal stabilizer of the other.

          <p>Efforts are underway to repair the external power supply to Ukraine's Zaporizhzhia nuclear power plant, which has relied on backup diesel generators for four weeks. The International Atomic Energy Agency announced that both Russian and Ukrainian forces agreed to special ceasefire zones to allow for the complex repairs, a crucial step for nuclear safety. The plant, Europe's largest, is under Russian control but requires a stable power source to cool its shutdown reactors and prevent a catastrophic incident. This marks the 42nd time power lines to the plant have needed restoration since Russia's full-scale invasion began.</p>

Services like HeadshotPro and Canva's new feature offer a fast alternative to costly professional photography, with some users reporting a significant increase in recruiter engagement after updating their photos. However, the trend has sparked a debate among career experts and recruiters about authenticity, as poorly generated images can appear fake. While the technology makes professional branding more accessible, it also challenges traditional notions of trust and identity in the hiring process.</p>

          <p>Sir David Attenborough has set a new record as the oldest person to win a Daytime Emmy Award, at the age of 99. He was honored for his work on the Netflix documentary "Secret Lives of Orangutans" in the outstanding daytime personality category. The renowned naturalist and broadcaster, whose career spans over seven decades, was not present to accept the award in person. The documentary also secured two other awards, including for outstanding directing. Attenborough surpassed the previous record held by actor Dick Van Dyke, who won an Emmy at age 98.</p>

          <p>The prestigious Grand Sumo Tournament is being held in London, marking only the second time in the sport's 1,500-year history that it has taken place outside of Japan. The Royal Albert Hall, which also hosted the event in 1991, has been specially prepared with an 11-ton clay ring, or dohyo, shipped from Japan. Over 40 professional wrestlers, known as rikishi, are competing in the five-day event, which requires careful attention to the sport's deep cultural and religious traditions. The tournament features top-ranked competitors, including two grand champions, known as yokozuna.</p>

          <p>In response to rising suicide rates and systemic health disparities, community-led mental health groups are providing crucial support for Black men. Organizations like Mental Health Is Real Wealth in Los Angeles create safe spaces where men can be vulnerable and discuss pressures related to masculinity, systemic racism, and economic stress without judgment. These groups serve as a gateway to therapy for many who have never sought professional help, aiming to break generational cycles of emotional suppression. Psychologists note that such spaces are vital for navigating identity crises and the unique challenges Black men face.</p>

          <p>The German phrase "Das crazy," a blend of German and English, has been voted the Youth Word of the Year for 2025, announced at the Frankfurt Book Fair. The expression, which translates to "That's crazy," is used by young people to convey surprise, speechlessness, or irony in a brief and humorous way. Its selection, determined by a public online vote organized by publisher PONS Langenscheidt, reflects the strong influence of English and internet culture on modern German slang. The term narrowly beat out "goonen," a slang word for excessive self-gratification.</p>

          <p>Psychologist Jean Twenge argues that delaying children's access to smartphones and social media until at least age 16 can lead to better mental health and success in adulthood. She advises parents to begin conversations about responsible technology use by late elementary school, years before a child receives a device. Key strategies include teaching children about online privacy and the value of their time away from screens. Additionally, Twenge stresses the importance of setting and enforcing firm rules, such as using basic, non-internet-connected phones first and implementing parental controls to moderate usage.</p>

After testing his first prototype in a supermarket's walk-in freezer, he successfully sold his initial run of 200 coats in three months. Today, his brand is profitable and worn by billionaires and financiers, with products sold in over 100 stores worldwide, including Saks Fifth Avenue.</p>

          <p>Warren Buffett outlined his investment philosophy, categorizing assets into three types and explaining his preference for productive assets over non-producing ones like gold. He described gold as an item people buy only with the hope that someone else will pay more for it later, noting that it generates no intrinsic value on its own. In contrast, he favors investments like farms or businesses that produce tangible goods or services, allowing for rational valuation based on their expected output. This approach, he argued, makes the success of an investment dependent on the asset's performance, not on market sentiment or fear. (not investment advice)</p>
