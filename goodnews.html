          <p>A bipartisan House committee has passed an amendment requiring greater congressional oversight of the U.S. government's efforts to combat human trafficking. The move came in response to an investigation revealing that the Trump administration had significantly reduced the workforce at the State Department's anti-trafficking office by over 70%. Lawmakers are also concerned that the administration has failed to publish a legally mandated annual report that assesses global anti-trafficking efforts. The amendment directs the State Department to report on the impact of these staff reductions and reorganization.</p>

          <p>Over a decade after early attempts faltered, major tech companies including Meta, Snap, and Google are once again competing to develop the next major computing platform: smart glasses. With advancements in AI and more affordable pricing, these firms hope to succeed where products like Google Glass failed. Meta recently showcased its new lineup, including advanced Ray-Ban models with AI assistants, positioning glasses as an ideal form factor for AI interaction. While consumer adoption is still niche, analysts predict an inflection point for the market in the coming years as the technology becomes more integrated into daily life.</p>

          <p>The Los Angeles Dodgers are set to achieve a franchise first by selling over 4 million tickets in a single season, a milestone they will officially cross during their final regular-season game. The team has consistently led Major League Baseball in attendance since 2013 but had never previously reached the 4-million mark. No MLB team has hit this figure since 2008, partly due to the construction of smaller modern stadiums. The Dodgers' sustained on-field success, combined with a roster of popular superstars including Shohei Ohtani, has fueled their dominance at the box office.</p>

          <p>The Federal Trade Commission, along with seven states, has filed a lawsuit against Ticketmaster and its parent company, Live Nation Entertainment, alleging illegal and anti-consumer practices. The suit claims the company works with scalpers to unlawfully purchase tickets, inflates prices through a "bait and switch" approach, and "triple dips" by collecting fees from brokers and consumers in both primary and secondary markets. The FTC alleges these tactics harm both fans and artists by frustrating efforts to keep ticket prices affordable. The agency is seeking an injunction to stop these practices.</p>

Under the agreement, Nvidia and Intel will work to connect their respective computing architectures, with Intel producing custom chips for Nvidia's AI data center platforms and PC products. The partnership provides a crucial lifeline for Intel, which has fallen behind in the AI era, and sent its stock soaring.</p>

          <p>One of Big Sur's most beloved hiking trails, the Pfeiffer Falls Trail, has reopened to the public after being closed for over a year. The trail's signature pedestrian bridge was destroyed in a 2023 storm when a massive redwood tree collapsed on it. This was a significant setback, as the trail had only recently reopened in 2021 after a 13-year closure due to a wildfire. Crews have now rebuilt the damaged section of the bridge using more resilient materials, hoping to better withstand the region's notoriously fragile and unforgiving environment.</p>
