          <p>Yang Weimin, a former senior official, urged China to prioritize boosting household income and consumption over the next five years to power future economic growth. His comments come ahead of the Communist Party's Central Committee fourth plenum, where the country's next five-year plan will be discussed. Yang emphasized the need to increase household disposable income's share of national income and consumer spending's share of total demand, identifying weak consumer demand as fundamentally an income issue.

This assertion came after a phone call with Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu and a meeting with Arab and Muslim leaders, who had expressed strong concerns about the dangers of annexation for regional peace. Far-right Israeli officials have advocated for annexation in response to Western countries recognizing Palestinian statehood, despite such settlements being deemed illegal under international law.
