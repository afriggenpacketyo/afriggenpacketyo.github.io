          <p>Chery Automobile, China's second-largest carmaker, intends to launch its initial public offering (IPO) in Hong Kong during the third quarter of this year. The company plans to use Hong Kong as a springboard to venture into the global market, according to Chairman Yin Tongyue. Chery hopes to establish more manufacturing, research and development, and data operations in Hong Kong. The IPO could potentially raise around US$1.5 billion without the involvement of Wall Street banks. This represents a significant step for Chery as it aims to become a global player in the automotive industry. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>The United States is revitalizing its nuclear capabilities to power the growing demands of artificial intelligence (AI) data centers and compete with China. A uranium enrichment facility has opened in Oak Ridge, Tennessee, aiming to secure a domestic supply of nuclear fuel. President Trump signed executive orders to quadruple domestic nuclear energy production by 2050. China plans to build 100 new nuclear power reactors by 2035. The U.S. aims to accelerate nuclear reactor construction to avoid falling behind in the AI race. The initiative highlights the importance of nuclear energy in powering AI and maintaining global competitiveness.</p>

          <p>Chancellor Rachel Reeves has announced a spending review that includes an additional ¬£29 billion per year for the NHS in England, along with increased funding for defense and housing. The review also allocates more money for artificial intelligence and transport projects, aiming to "renew Britain." However, some departments, such as the Foreign Office and the environment department, will face cuts in day-to-day spending. The government hopes that increased spending in health and investment in longer-term projects will reassure voters after a challenging first year. Despite some budget cuts, Reeves insisted that this review is not a return to austerity policies. The spending review aims to balance economic growth with fiscal responsibility.</p>

          <p>Chinese court astronomers recorded detailed observations of a dying star's explosion in 1408, providing valuable insights for modern astronomers. The astronomers described the star as being about the size of a cup-shaped oil lamp, with a pure yellow color, smooth and bright. The record confirms that the phenomenon was a nova, a slow, temporary brightening caused by a dying star, rather than a comet or meteor. The discovery was reported in The Astronomical Journal by researchers from China, Germany, and Chile. The details, including the star's size and brightness, helped the team narrow down the star's possible position.</p>

          <p>Elon Musk's favorability rating among Republicans has dropped by 16 points since March, according to a recent Quinnipiac University poll. While a majority of Republicans still view Musk favorably, the number has decreased from 78% to 62%. The decline comes after a public falling out between Musk and President Trump over the president's spending bill. Despite the drop in favorability, Musk remains popular among Republicans, with 80% rating his work with the Department of Government Efficiency as either excellent or good. This indicates a shift in sentiment towards Musk within the Republican party.</p>

This approach represents a gamble on patience in an era of impatience, as it requires the electorate to wait for the benefits of these investments to materialize.

          <p>Hong Kong is positioning itself at the forefront of global finance with the passage of a comprehensive stablecoin law. The new law aims to address past industry setbacks and establish the city as a leader in the stablecoin market. Hong Kong's regulatory stance is friendlier than Singapore's framework, potentially giving it a competitive edge in Asia. Combined with the city's vast offshore yuan holdings and China's restricted use of cryptocurrencies, the law has raised hopes that Hong Kong could secure a prominent spot in the stablecoin market, currently dominated by US dollar-backed tokens. The near-simultaneous legislative push with the United States underscores the intensifying contest over financial influence in the digital era. (not investment advice)</p>

          <h2>New Dinosaur Species Rewrites Tyrannosaur Family Tree</h2>
          <div class="timestamp">2025-06-11 20:31:20 EDT</div>

          <p>Scientists have discovered a new species of dinosaur, Khankhuuluu mongoliensis, which they say "rewrites" the evolutionary history of tyrannosaurs. The 86 million-year-old skeletons, found in Mongolia, represent the closest known ancestor of all tyrannosaurs, including T.rex. Khankhuuluu represents an evolutionary shift from small hunters to formidable giants, weighing around 750kg. The species also exhibits early evolutionary stages of features that were key to the tyrannosaurs' dominance, including skull anatomy that gave it a strong jaw. The discovery has helped revise the tyrannosaur family tree and rewrite what is known about the evolution of these dinosaurs.</p>

          <p>A federal judge has ruled that the Trump administration cannot deport or continue to detain Mahmoud Khalil, a Columbia University activist arrested by immigration officers in March. Judge Farbiarz stated that there was no compelling interest to keep Khalil in custody or deport him, as he is a lawful permanent resident. Khalil was arrested as part of President Trump's crackdown on international students protesting the Israel-Gaza war. The judge's decision is paused until June 13 to allow the government time to appeal. The case has drawn significant attention, with concerns raised about the chilling effect on free speech and the potential for irreparable harm to Khalil's career and reputation.</p>

          <p>David Hogg has announced his resignation as vice-chair of the Democratic National Committee after months of internal conflict and infighting. Hogg stated that there was a "fundamental disagreement" about the role of a Vice Chair and that he would focus on his organization, Leaders We Deserve. The announcement came shortly after the committee voted to hold new vice-chair elections, which could have resulted in his removal. DNC chair Ken Martin commended Hogg's activism and respected his decision to step back. Malcolm Kenyatta is now the sole candidate eligible for the male vice-chair role.</p>
