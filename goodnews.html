          <p>Audrey Backeberg, who disappeared from her family's home in Wisconsin in 1962, has been found alive and well, residing out of state. The Sauk County Sheriff‚Äôs Office reports that her disappearance was a personal choice and not due to any criminal activity or foul play. The case was reopened earlier this year, involving a thorough re-evaluation of case files and interviews. Initial reports suggested Backeberg hitchhiked to Madison and then took a bus to Indianapolis, where she was last seen, amidst a troubled marriage with allegations of abuse.</p>

The aides were confident he would pass, but worried that taking the test would raise further questions about his mental abilities. Biden eventually stepped down from his re-election campaign in favor of Kamala Harris after a poor debate performance against Donald Trump. Harris then lost the election to Trump.</p>
