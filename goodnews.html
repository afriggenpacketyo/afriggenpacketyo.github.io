        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Nuclear power stocks experienced a rally on Friday after reports surfaced that President Trump intends to sign executive orders aimed at accelerating reactor construction and securing vital materials for the industry. Companies like Oklo and NuScale saw significant jumps in their stock prices, while Constellation Energy and Cameco Corp also benefited from the news. The orders are expected to invoke the Defense Production Act, declaring a national emergency due to the U.S.'s reliance on Russia and China for enriched uranium and nuclear fuel processing. Additionally, federal agencies will be directed to expedite the permitting and siting of new nuclear facilities.</p>

          <p>Skeletal remains discovered on New Jersey beaches between 1995 and 2013 have been identified as Captain Henry Goodsell of the schooner Oriental, which sank in 1844. The identification was made possible through investigative genetic genealogy conducted by the New Jersey State Police and Ramapo College's Investigative Genetic Genealogy Center. Students at Ramapo College researched the case, connecting the remains, known as "Scattered Man John Doe," to ancestry matches dating back to the 1600s. The Oriental sank off the coast of Brigantine Shoal while transporting marble, resulting in the death of all five crew members.</p>

          <p>Russia and Ukraine have completed the initial phase of a prisoner exchange agreement, with each country returning 390 prisoners of war. Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy announced the exchange on X, noting it as the first stage of the "1000-for-1000" agreement reached during talks in Istanbul. The exchange is expected to continue over the weekend, as confirmed by Zelenskyy. The Russian Defense Ministry also acknowledged the swap, stating that Russia had received 390 individuals in return.

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>A federal judge has issued a preliminary injunction, blocking the Trump administration from implementing mass layoffs and reorganizing major federal agencies. Judge Susan Illston ruled that agencies cannot conduct large-scale reorganizations and reductions in force that disregard congressional mandates. The order pauses further reductions in force and reorganization of the executive branch for the duration of the lawsuit. Illston emphasized that while presidents can set policy priorities, Congress creates and funds federal agencies, assigning them duties they must carry out by statute. The judge stated that a president may not initiate large-scale executive branch reorganization without partnering with Congress.</p>

          <p>This article discusses the pros and cons of using a Home Equity Line of Credit (HELOC) this summer. Experts suggest HELOCs can be beneficial for taking advantage of falling interest rates, consolidating credit card debt, and tackling home repairs or renovations. However, they advise against using HELOCs for non-essential expenses like vacations or building a pool, as they carry the risk of foreclosure if payments are not met. The article also explores using HELOCs for college costs or buying a new house, emphasizing the importance of careful planning and considering alternative options first. (not investment advice)</p>

        </div>
        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>New research reveals that clownfish shrank in size during a severe ocean heat wave in Papua New Guinea in 2023, suggesting it may be an adaptation to survive hotter ocean temperatures. Scientists measured 134 clownfish monthly between February and August, finding that most of the fish got shorter by a few millimeters. Being smaller may help clownfish meet their energy requirements in a hot climate, and the fish that shrank had a higher chance of survival. This study adds complexity to the understanding of how marine life is affected by climate change.</p>

          <p>This article reviews Mission: Impossible‚ÄîThe Final Reckoning, noting its shift from a focus on espionage and action to a character study of Ethan Hunt. While the film contains the series' signature stunts and globe-trotting adventures, it is encumbered by its attempt to bring cohesion to Hunt's past missions. The author argues that the self-importance of the film detracts from the lighthearted and entertaining elements that propelled the franchise to its peaks. The review acknowledges the impressive action sequences but finds the film's triumphalism about Hunt the man somewhat underwhelming.</p>

          <p>President Trump has stated that Russia and Ukraine have completed a large prisoner exchange, while Ukrainian and Russian officials confirmed the swap was ongoing but not yet finalized. The exchange, involving 780 soldiers and civilians, is viewed as a potential sign of progress in halting the conflict. Trump suggested that the swap "could lead to something big???" in terms of international diplomatic efforts. The agreement was reached during recent direct Russia-Ukraine peace talks in Turkey, which marked the first face-to-face meeting between the two sides since the early weeks of the conflict.</p>
