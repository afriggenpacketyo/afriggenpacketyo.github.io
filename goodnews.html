        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Following President Trump's announcement on social media that he was renaming November 11 as "Victory Day for World War I," the White House has clarified that it will be an additional proclamation, not a replacement for Veterans Day. Trump also stated his intention to designate May 8 as "Victory Day for World War II." According to the Congressional Research Service, establishing a federal holiday or patriotic observance requires the passage of a law. This clarification comes after some confusion regarding the initial announcement.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Archaeologists excavating the Basilica of St. Stephen on Caelian Hill in Rome have unearthed a stone head depicting a Roman deity. The Appian Way Regional Park announced the discovery, noting that the head was found in the foundation of the church. Experts believe the bearded male figure is likely a deity, though layers of mortar obscure its features. The artifact will be studied and restored by the Central Institute for Restoration in Matera, contributing to understanding the cultural dynamics of the Appia Antica territory in the late antique period.</p>

          <p>China is expediting its efforts to construct the world's first nuclear fusion reactor capable of achieving net energy generation, a significant stride toward commercializing a clean and near-limitless energy source. The Burning Plasma Experimental Superconducting Tokamak (Best) is currently in its final assembly phase in Hefei and is anticipated to be completed by 2027. The assembly involves tens of thousands of components with a total weight of around 6,000 tonnes, and the project began two months ahead of schedule.</p>

          <p>Sarah Snook stars in a one-actor adaptation of Oscar Wilde's "The Picture of Dorian Gray" on Broadway, highlighting the story's relevance to modern social media culture. Snook plays 26 roles with the help of wigs, camerawork, and even a smartphone. The production humorously and ominously explores narcissism, deception, and the gap between false perfection and reality. It contrasts with another play, "Vanya," which suggests richness in seeing oneself as multiple intertwining voices, raising questions about performance, truth, and self-expression.</p>

          <p>The article argues that self-driving cars have the potential to save thousands of lives annually by reducing accidents caused by human error. A study by Waymo found that its autonomous vehicles had significantly fewer crashes and injuries compared to human drivers. The author suggests that public focus on rare incidents involving self-driving cars overlooks the daily carnage caused by human drivers. Despite challenges and potential economic disruption, the author believes that the safety benefits of autonomous vehicles justify their widespread adoption.</p>

          <p>Anthony Albanese's re-election as Australia's prime minister was bolstered by anti-Trump sentiment, despite his attempts to avoid direct criticism of the U.S. president. Voters' concerns about the cost of living and market fluctuations linked to Trump's policies contributed to the outcome. The defeat of conservative leader Peter Dutton, who mirrored some of Trump's messaging, further underscores the public's rejection of that approach. However, the election results also indicate a desire for more significant change from the Labor Party.</p>
