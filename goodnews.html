          <p>The Seattle Seahawks secured a 27-19 victory over the Houston Texans on "Monday Night Football," improving their season record to 5-2. Quarterback Sam Darnold effectively led the offense, orchestrating two early touchdowns, while the Seahawks' formidable defense largely contained Texans quarterback C.J. Stroud throughout the game, forcing multiple punts and turnovers. Despite a brief second-half rally by Houston, Seattle maintained its lead with crucial plays, including multiple scores from Zach Charbonnet and significant receiving yardage from Jaxon Smith-Njigba. This article highlights the team's ability to respond to pressure and defend their home turf, ultimately getting the job done.</p>

        </div>
        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Chinese exporters attending the Canton Fair are observing a notable increase in requests for yuan-denominated trade settlements, primarily from countries in Southeast and Central Asia, including Indonesia, Malaysia, and Kazakhstan. Businesses like Guangzhou Light Holdings report that yuan-settled orders now constitute between 10% and 20% of their total exports, marking a substantial rise from previous single-digit figures. This shift is attributed to the involvement of Chinese suppliers in major overseas data center projects and the ongoing demand for crucial infrastructure components such as diesel-generator sets in developing economies. The article indicates a growing international acceptance and utility for the Chinese currency in global trade.</p>

          <p>European stock markets are anticipated to commence trading higher on Tuesday, continuing the positive trajectory established at the week's start, significantly bolstered by robust performances within the region's defense sector. Major indices including the UK's FTSE, Germany's DAX, France's CAC 40, and Italy's FTSE MIB are all forecast to open with gains. This upward trend follows substantial increases in defense companies such as Thyssenkrupp and Hensoldt, influenced by events like the TKMS spinout and recent geopolitical discussions. Investors are now keenly focused on a busy schedule of third-quarter earnings reports from prominent corporations like Netflix and Coca-Cola, which are expected to shape market sentiment.</p>

          <p>Miami Beach is embarking on "Reefline," an innovative seven-mile-long artificial reef project that uniquely blends public art with crucial coral habitat restoration. This extensive underwater sculpture garden, designed to be easily accessible to snorkelers and divers, seeks to regenerate a vibrant coral ecosystem that was lost off the coast in the 1970s. Spearheaded by Colin Foord of "Coral Morphologic" and artistic director Ximena Caminos, the initiative involves transplanting locally collected, resilient corals onto specially cast marine-grade concrete sculptures, beginning with an installation of 22 concrete cars. Partially funded by a $5 million voter-approved bond, the project also plans an onshore marine learning center to educate visitors about endangered coral reefs, aspiring to become an iconic symbol for the city.</p>

          <p>Attorneys representing the city of Chicago and the state of Illinois have formally petitioned the Supreme Court to sustain a lower court's injunction that prevents the deployment of the National Guard to Chicago. They contend that the Trump administration's rationale for deployment is based on "mischaracterizations" of the local situation, arguing that state and local law enforcement are fully capable of managing isolated protest activities. The existing temporary restraining order permits the federalization of the Illinois National Guard but explicitly forbids its deployment within Chicago.
