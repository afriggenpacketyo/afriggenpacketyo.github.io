          <p>Goldman Sachs and Bank of New York Mellon are collaborating to allow institutional clients to purchase tokenized money market funds, recording ownership on Goldman's blockchain platform. This initiative aims to modernize the $7.1 trillion money market industry by increasing transaction efficiency and reducing friction. Major asset managers like BlackRock and Fidelity have already signed on to the project. Unlike stablecoins, these tokenized funds offer a yield, making them an attractive option for institutional investors to park cash and paving the way for a real-time, digital financial ecosystem.

          <p>The U.S. special envoy for the Middle East, Steve Witkoff, is set to travel to Europe to continue pushing for a ceasefire and peace deal in the Israel-Hamas conflict. According to officials, indirect negotiations are ongoing, with mediators awaiting Hamas's response to a recent Israeli proposal that includes a new map for potential IDF withdrawal zones. The Trump administration is reportedly cautiously optimistic about a potential breakthrough that could lead to a 60-day ceasefire and the release of hostages. A key sticking point remains the presence of Israeli troops in a southern Gaza corridor during any truce.</p>

          <p>Two former City traders, Tom Hayes and Carlo Palombo, have had their convictions for interest-rate rigging quashed by the UK's Supreme Court after a decade-long legal battle. They were among 19 traders jailed in the UK and US for manipulating the Libor and Euribor benchmark rates, which affect global borrowing costs. The court ruled that errors in jury direction during their original trials made the convictions unsafe, vindicating the traders who argued they were wrongly prosecuted for what they claimed were normal commercial practices. The Serious Fraud Office, which brought the original case, stated it will not seek a retrial.</p>

          <p>A South Korean court has reopened the case of Choi Mal-ja, a woman convicted of grievous bodily harm in 1964 for biting off part of her attacker's tongue during a sexual assault. At 19, Choi was given a suspended sentence for what the court at the time deemed an act that "exceeded the reasonable bounds of legally permissible self-defense." Inspired by the #MeToo movement, Choi, now in her 80s, successfully petitioned for a retrial to clear her name after 61 years. In a significant turn, the prosecution at the new hearing has asked the court to acquit her, with a final verdict expected in September.</p>

          <p>The UK's Competition and Markets Authority (CMA) has proposed designating Apple and Google as having "strategic market status," a move that would empower the regulator to enforce changes to their mobile ecosystems. The investigation focused on concerns that the tech giants use their control over operating systems, app stores, and browsers to stifle competition and impose unfair terms on developers. The CMA is pushing for immediate changes, including more transparent app review processes and allowing developers to steer users to alternative payment methods. Both Apple and Google have criticized the proposals, arguing they could undermine user security and innovation.</p>

The move comes as the company announced it removed nearly 135,000 Instagram accounts for sexualizing children and an additional 500,000 linked accounts. Meta is also automatically placing teen and child-representing accounts into its strictest privacy settings to filter offensive content and limit contact from unknown users. This effort follows increased scrutiny from policymakers and a renewed push in Congress to pass child online safety legislation.</p>

          <p>A cooling housing market is leading some frustrated home sellers to take their properties off the market and offer them as rentals instead, creating a new class of "accidental landlords." This trend is providing unexpected competition for large institutional rental investors, particularly in Sun Belt markets like Atlanta and Phoenix where these investors are most concentrated. While the influx of new rental supply may limit the ability of large landlords to implement significant rent increases, major players like Invitation Homes are shifting their strategy towards build-to-rent projects rather than competing for existing homes.

          <p>A Berlin court has acquitted German comedian Sebastian Hotz, known as "El Hotzo," of charges that he condoned a criminal offense through satirical social media posts made after last year's assassination attempt on Donald Trump. The prosecution had argued his posts, including one finding it "absolutely fantastic when fascists die," constituted hate crimes and called for a fine. However, the judge ruled the posts were clearly recognizable as satire, albeit in bad taste, and did not have the intention of disturbing public order or inciting crime, affirming the importance of debate in a liberal democracy.</p>

          <p>A wooden shipwreck discovered on the Scottish island of Sanday has been identified as the Earl of Chatham, a Royal Navy frigate that fought in the American War of Independence. Originally named HMS Hind and built in 1749, the vessel later had a second life as an Arctic whaling ship before it was wrecked in a storm in 1788. Archaeologists and local researchers used dendrochronology and archival records to identify the ship. The community-led effort successfully recovered the 12-ton oak timbers, which are now being preserved with plans for a permanent public display on the island.</p>
