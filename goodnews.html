          <p>Meta's newly announced advanced AI research lab, tasked with developing next-generation models for "personal superintelligence," has hired a significant number of researchers educated in China. Seven of the eleven publicly listed hires are graduates of top Chinese universities like Tsinghua and Peking University, all of whom later continued their studies and careers in the United States. This recruitment drive has reportedly intensified rivalry with competitors like OpenAI, whose CEO has criticized Meta for offering large signing bonuses to attract top talent. The composition of the team has drawn attention in China, highlighting the global competition for leading AI experts.</p>

          <p>Entrepreneur Vivek Ramaswamy has pledged to invest at least $30 million of his own fortune into his 2026 campaign for governor of Ohio. This financial commitment mirrors the scale of his self-funding during the 2024 GOP presidential primary. Ramaswamy, who has secured an endorsement from President Trump, emphasized that winning is the only option and he is prepared to use all necessary resources to achieve success. His campaign has already set a state record for first-quarter fundraising, and he is currently running largely unopposed in the Republican primary after the state's attorney general dropped out.</p>

          <p>Rio de Janeiro is deploying one of its largest-ever peacetime security operations for the upcoming BRICS summit, involving approximately 20,000 military personnel. The extensive measures are designed to protect leaders and officials from 28 countries and various international organizations. Security protocols include a strict no-fly zone over the summit venue, which will be enforced by armed fighter jets with the authority to shoot down unauthorized aircraft. The city's main domestic airport, Santos Dumont, will be closed to commercial traffic, rerouting flights to the international terminal, a level of security not seen even during the G20 summit.</p>

          <p>With the Fourth of July celebrations, experts from Canine Companions offer advice for keeping dogs safe and calm during loud fireworks displays. The primary recommendation is to avoid taking dogs to fireworks shows, as their hearing is far more sensitive than humans'. To help prepare them for the evening, owners should exercise their dogs earlier in the day and provide mental stimulation through games or puzzle toys. For noise-sensitive dogs, creating a safe, comfortable space with background noise like a TV or white noise machine can help mitigate anxiety and prevent them from panicking.</p>

          <h2>Chinese Think Tank Proposes 30 Trillion Yuan Debt Swap to Address Local Government Liabilities</h2>
          <div class="timestamp">2025-07-03 18:00:14 EDT</div>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>A Beijing-based think tank from Tsinghua University has proposed that China issue 30 trillion yuan (US$4.2 trillion) in treasury bonds to swap the hidden debts of local governments. This measure aims to tackle the country's local-level debt crisis, which is seen as a significant risk to economic and financial stability. The report suggests that this comprehensive fiscal package, combined with additional bonds to support the property market and boost consumption, could resolve these deep-rooted issues. The proposal addresses the tens of trillions in off-book liabilities held by local government financing vehicles and state-owned enterprises. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>NASA has announced the discovery of a new interstellar comet, officially named 3I/ATLAS, which is the third known object from another star system to pass through our solar system. The comet was detected using a telescope in Chile and is currently located about 420 million miles from Earth, posing no threat. Traveling at 37 miles per second, it is expected to make its closest approach to the sun in late October, passing between the orbits of Mars and Earth. Astronomers are now monitoring the object to determine its size and composition, with preliminary observations suggesting it is larger than the previous two interstellar visitors.</p>

          <h2>Opinion: A Simplified Payment System Could Make GLP-1 Drugs More Affordable Through Employer Insurance</h2>
          <div class="timestamp">2025-07-03 17:27:45 EDT</div>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>This opinion article proposes a method to make popular anti-obesity GLP-1 medications more affordable for Americans with employer-sponsored health insurance. The author suggests eliminating the complex system of rebates and coupons that inflates drug prices. Instead, manufacturers could charge health plans the same direct-to-consumer price of around $500 per month. If employers then contribute a portion of this cost, employees' out-of-pocket expenses could be significantly reduced, improving access to these transformative but currently expensive treatments. This streamlined approach would increase transparency and align costs more closely with those in other developed nations.</p>

          <p>A 35-year-old American woman, Aleese Lightyear, has found a dramatically improved quality of life after leaving her high-stress, expensive life in New York City to teach English in China. Now living in Chengdu, she earns about $30,000 a year, a salary she describes as enabling her to "live large" in China, whereas it would mean poverty in the U.S. Working just 18 hours a week, she enjoys significant benefits like a rent stipend and paid vacations, allowing her to save money and pursue hobbies. She contrasts this with her previous life, where she worked 70-80 hours a week and lived paycheck to paycheck.</p>

          <h2>Opinion: The American Revolution's Roots Lie in Biblical Tradition, Not Pure Individualism</h2>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>This opinion piece argues that the American Revolution and the Declaration of Independence should be understood not as a triumph of pure individualism, but as a movement deeply rooted in the nation's inherited political and biblical traditions. The author contends that the majority of the Declaration lists grievances against King George III for violating the established rights of Englishmen. Furthermore, the famous proclamation of self-evident, unalienable rights draws its moral force from the biblical concept of man being created in God's image. This foundation, the article asserts, is what made the American experiment in equality possible, distinct from a simple rebellion.</p>

          <p>The comprehensive domestic policy bill passed by the House includes a new, temporary tax break for senior citizens. The provision adds a $6,000 standard deduction for individual tax filers aged 65 and older ($12,000 for couples), which will be in effect from 2025 through 2028. This benefit is aimed at upper-middle-class seniors, as it phases out for those earning over $75,000 and provides no advantage to low-income seniors who already have little to no tax liability. This measure is an income tax deduction and is separate from any changes to the taxation of Social Security benefits.</p>

          <div class="timestamp">2025-07-03 16:33:42 EDT</div>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>The U.S. labor market demonstrated continued strength in June, with employers adding 147,000 jobs and the unemployment rate falling to 4.1%. This performance surpassed economists' expectations and showed resilience despite broader economic uncertainty. Job growth was led by the government sector, particularly in state and local education, while the federal workforce continued to shrink due to cuts. The strong report suggests the Federal Reserve will likely maintain current interest rates, as it monitors the potential impact of tariffs on inflation and economic activity later in the year.
