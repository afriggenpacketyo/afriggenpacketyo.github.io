          <p>Mahmoud Khalil, a pro-Palestinian activist at Columbia University, has been ordered released by a federal judge, superseding an immigration judge's order to keep him detained. The judge denied the government's motion to stay the ruling, stating that there was no proof Khalil's release would irreparably harm them or that he was a flight risk. Khalil's attorney asserts that he is being punished for speech protected by the First Amendment, after being arrested by ICE agents in March. The judge set bail conditions, excluding electronic monitoring or an immediate bond.</p>

The GENIUS Act aims to establish a regulatory framework for stablecoins, which are cryptocurrencies pegged to assets like the U.S. dollar.

          <p>A federal judge has blocked the Trump administration from requiring states to cooperate with ICE to receive transportation funding, siding with 20 states that argued the administration lacked the legal authority to tie funding to immigration enforcement. Transportation Secretary Sean Duffy had warned that grants could be cut off to recipients failing to cooperate with federal authorities. The judge ruled that Congress did not authorize the Secretary of Transportation to impose immigration enforcement conditions on federal transportation dollars. The Trump administration has threatened to cut off funding to "sanctuary" jurisdictions that limit cooperation with ICE.</p>
