          <p>Over 300 South Korean nationals detained by ICE in Georgia for alleged visa violations at a Hyundai plant were released and are being flown back to South Korea. The detentions strained U.S.-South Korea relations, with South Korean officials expressing concern over the treatment of their citizens. President Lee Jae Myung pledged $350 billion in new U.S. investment, highlighting the importance of the economic partnership. The U.S. Department of Homeland Security stated that the ICE raid was the biggest single-site enforcement action in the agency's history, citing visa overstays and unauthorized labor. The situation presents an opportunity to improve visa policies and strengthen U.S.-Korea ties. </p>

The charges involve deals related to Eden Hazard, Samuel Eto'o, and Willian, though there is no suggestion of wrongdoing by the players themselves. Chelsea reported the potential breaches to the FA and is cooperating with the investigation. The club faces potential sanctions, including fines or a transfer embargo, but does not expect a sporting sanction. </p>

          <h2>Treasury Yields Fall Amid Inflation Data and Jobless Claims</h2>
          <div class="timestamp">2025-09-11 10:40:52 EDT</div>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>The 10-year U.S. Treasury yield fell to 4% as investors analyzed mixed economic signals, including hotter consumer prices and higher jobless claims. The August consumer price index rose 2.9% annually, while weekly jobless claims jumped to 263,000, the highest since October 2021. Analysts suggest this data reinforces concerns about a weakening labor market, potentially leading the Federal Reserve to lower interest rates at its upcoming meeting. Market expectations currently favor a quarter-point rate cut. These developments reflect ongoing economic uncertainty. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>Social Security beneficiaries may see a 2.7% to 2.8% increase in their monthly checks in 2026, according to new estimates based on recent inflation data. This cost-of-living adjustment (COLA) could raise the average retirement benefit by about $54 per month. The official COLA will be announced by the Social Security Administration in October and is calculated using the Consumer Price Index for Urban Wage Earners and Clerical Workers (CPI-W). These projections are based on consumer price index data for August. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>India's Adani Group has ceased accepting vessels sanctioned by the European Union, U.S., and Britain at its ports, according to sources and internal orders. Adani, which operates 14 ports, issued orders emphasizing that sanctioned vessels will not be permitted entry, berthing, or use of port services. This move aligns with India's increasing scrutiny of vessels and transactions involving Russian oil supplies, particularly those operating under shadow fleets. Vessel agents must now provide written assurances that their ships are not subject to sanctions. This decision reflects heightened regulatory compliance. </p>

This push is driven by environmental concerns and the desire to support local electric motorbike manufacturers like VinFast and Pega. While public opinion is mixed, the policy could significantly reduce air pollution and boost the Vietnamese electric vehicle market.

The first of these stealthy, long-range drones will be delivered to the Australian navy in January next year.

The Ghost Sharks are designed for intelligence, surveillance, reconnaissance, and strike operations.
