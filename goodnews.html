          <p>Writer Jack Thorne commended the "remarkable" journalists who exposed the phone hacking scandal, ahead of ITV's new drama, "The Hack." Starring David Tennant as Guardian reporter Nick Davies, the series aims to uncover the troubling relationship between the press, politics, and police. Thorne noted that unlike the Post Office scandal, where journalism struggled to gain traction, the phone hacking case celebrated journalists holding their own industry accountable. The article also mentions the series will tell the story from both Davies' and police detective Dave Cook's perspectives.</p>

          <p>Longtime baseball broadcaster Ed Randall, a prostate cancer survivor, established the charity "Fans For The Cure" in 2003 to champion early detection by encouraging men over 40 to undergo PSA blood tests. Diagnosed unexpectedly at 47 during a routine physical, Randall learned that early detection boasts a remarkable 99% cure rate for prostate cancer. He consistently utilizes his platform on MLB Network Radio to reach his target demographic, while his organization actively hosts awareness events, provides free screenings at stadiums, and offers vital support groups for both men and women affected by the disease.</p>

          <p>Many couples commonly experience a decline in sex drive after childbirth, attributed to significant physical and hormonal changes in women, alongside emotional adjustments for both new parents. Reality TV star Holly Hagan-Blyth shared her personal experience, underscoring the vital importance of open communication with her husband to alleviate perceived pressure and foster understanding. Medical experts highlight the typical six-week healing period required for the uterus and the drastic drops in estrogen and progesterone levels as key physiological factors. This article also acknowledges that men can face similar struggles in adapting to fatherhood and encourages honest dialogue as a crucial step to navigate this widespread challenge effectively.</p>

          <p>New York mayoral candidate Zohran Mamdani agreed to participate in an ABC town hall after the network reinstated Jimmy Kimmel's late-night show. Mamdani had initially withdrawn in protest of Kimmel's suspension, which followed FCC threats over the host's criticism of the Trump administration's response to Charlie Kirk's death. Disney's decision to bring Kimmel back, citing "thoughtful conversations," ended a national debate on free speech and government intimidation. This article highlights Mamdani's stance against perceived authoritarianism and his strong lead in the mayoral race, where he faces opponents like Andrew Cuomo and Eric Adams.</p>

          <p>A federal judge has ordered the Trump administration to restore $500 million in frozen UCLA medical research grants, providing significant relief to the University of California system and its researchers. The judge ruled that the National Institutes of Health (NIH) grants were suspended without proper justification, thereby violating the Administrative Procedure Act. This article details how the grant freezes, allegedly linked to campus antisemitism, use of race in admissions, and recognition of transgender identities, threatened vital cancer and stroke research. It also highlights the ongoing legal and advocacy efforts by UC leaders to secure funding and resist federal demands.</p>

          <p>US comedian Jimmy Kimmel will return to his late-night show after Disney reinstated "Jimmy Kimmel Live!" following its suspension.

The suspension had sparked widespread debate over free speech, with FCC threats and criticism from lawmakers and Hollywood figures. This article notes that while Disney reached a decision to return the show, some ABC affiliates like Sinclair still plan to preempt it with news programming, indicating ongoing resistance. Kimmel has not yet publicly addressed the suspension or its fallout.</p>

          <p>Hundreds of pigs have been released into England's New Forest for the annual pannage season, an ancient tradition dating back to 1079. This practice involves pigs grazing on acorns, chestnuts, and beech mast, which are toxic to the area's free-roaming ponies and cattle, thus acting as nature's clean-up crew. The pigs, fitted with nose rings to minimize disruption, are crucial for the forest's ecology and the husbandry of other livestock. This article advises visitors to maintain a safe distance and drive carefully, as officials have received reports of pigs being hit by cars during the season.</p>

          <p>A 4.3 magnitude earthquake struck the San Francisco Bay Area early Monday, waking thousands of residents but causing no reported injuries or major damage. The quake, centered east-south-east of Berkeley, prompted Bay Area Rapid Transit (BART) to implement speed reductions for track inspections, causing delays. This article serves as a stark reminder of the region's seismic risks and the ongoing need for residents to prepare for larger quakes, although experts noted this particular event was relatively minor in impact compared to previous seismic activity. The last quake of similar size near Berkeley occurred in January 2018.</p>
