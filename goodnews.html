          <p>Donald Trump has endorsed Jack Ciattarelli for New Jersey governor, calling him an "America First Candidate." Ciattarelli, who was previously critical of Trump, now aligns with his policies.

Ciattarelli responded on X, saying he was "truly humbled and honored to receive President Trump‚Äôs very strong endorsement today.</p>

          <p>A New York Times article reports that the auction of the Riggio family art collection at Christie's in New York was anticlimactic, indicating potential weakness in the art market. The sale, seen as a bellwether for the auction season, struggled to meet pre-sale expectations, with some lots failing to spark bidding wars. Experts attributed the tepid interest to economic uncertainty surrounding tariffs. While some artworks sold above estimates, the withdrawal of a major Warhol painting highlighted concerns about the Warhol market, though Claude Monet's painting sold well.</p>

Newsom called on cities and counties to do their part in addressing encampments, supported by $3.3 billion in new Prop 1 funding. The ordinance states that policies must prioritize shelter and services and not unduly limit local authority to clear encampments, while also ensuring no person is criminally prosecuted for sleeping outside when they have nowhere else to go.</p>

          <p>The EPA did not release its annual U.S. greenhouse gas emissions report, but data obtained by the Environmental Defense Fund reveals that the U.S. has made progress in reducing emissions. However, the U.S. is not on track to meet certain climate goals, and concerns exist that new policies from the Trump administration could worsen carbon pollution. The report indicates that the transportation sector is the largest source of carbon dioxide emissions, and the U.S. is shifting towards more renewable energy sources for electricity generation.</p>
