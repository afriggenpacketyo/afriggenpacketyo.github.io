          <p>A low-speed collision occurred between two Delta Air Lines planes on a taxiway at New York's LaGuardia Airport. The incident involved an arriving flight from Charlotte and a departing flight to Roanoke, with the wing of one plane striking the fuselage of the other. A flight attendant sustained a minor injury and was treated at the scene before being taken to a hospital for evaluation. The collision, which involved nearly 100 people across both aircraft, did not cause significant disruptions to overall airport operations, and passengers were deplaned and accommodated with new travel arrangements.</p>

          <p>A video circulating on social media, showing Donald Trump and his daughter-in-law Lara Trump promoting so-called "MedBeds," has been identified as a fake created with artificial intelligence. The video promotes a conspiracy theory about magical beds that can cure any disease, a myth originating from far-right online communities. Fact-checkers pointed to several signs of AI generation, including mismatched mouth movements and distorted images, such as fused fingers on a doctor's hand. Experts and journalists have confirmed the video is fabricated and part of a pattern of spreading misinformation, potentially to mislead supporters about healthcare policies.</p>

          <p>Speculation is growing that China's third and most advanced aircraft carrier, the Fujian, is preparing to enter active service after it was photographed berthed next to the carrier Shandong in a naval harbor. The Fujian, which features advanced electromagnetic catapults similar to those on U.S. carriers, recently completed sea trials in the Yellow and Bohai Seas. Its latest deployment from the Shanghai shipyard marked its first time sailing south for trials. The side-by-side positioning of the two carriers highlights China's expanding naval capabilities and its progress in developing a modern blue-water navy.</p>

          <p>Taiwan's top trade negotiator has confirmed that the island will not accept a U.S. proposal to manufacture half of the chips it currently supplies to the American market locally. The proposal, aimed at reducing U.S. reliance on Taiwan for semiconductors, was reportedly not even discussed during recent trade talks, which instead focused on tariff reductions. The idea of a "50-50" split has been condemned by Taiwanese politicians, who view it as an attempt to undermine the island's critical role in the global tech industry, often referred to as its "Silicon Shield" against potential military action from China.</p>

          <p>Warren Buffett's Berkshire Hathaway has agreed to purchase Occidental Petroleum's petrochemical division, OxyChem, for $9.7 billion in an all-cash deal. This transaction marks Berkshire's largest acquisition since 2022 and comes as the conglomerate holds a near-record cash pile of $344 billion. Occidental plans to use $6.5 billion of the proceeds to pay down its debt, a move its CEO says will unlock shareholder value and allow the company to resume its stock buyback program. The deal deepens the existing relationship between the two companies, as Berkshire already holds a 28.2% stake in Occidental.</p>

          <p>Ken Murphy, the CEO of Tesco, has cautioned the UK government against imposing additional taxes on retailers in the next Budget, stating that the industry has already absorbed substantial new costs. He pointed to recent increases in National Insurance contributions and new levies for packaging recycling as significant financial burdens. Murphy's comments were made as the supermarket giant upgraded its annual profit forecast, attributing the positive outlook to increased customer spending despite price cuts on thousands of items. The Food and Drink Federation has warned that new taxes will likely be passed on to consumers through higher food prices. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>A historical retrospective explores the unique post-World War II status of Saarland, which existed as a semi-autonomous state under French influence before its population voted to join West Germany. In a 1955 referendum, nearly 68% of Saarland residents chose to become part of the Federal Republic of Germany, an event now known as the "small reunification." This decision resolved a long-standing point of contention between France and Germany and paved the way for Franco-German friendship and European unity. Today, Saarland's history is reflected in its strong cross-border culture and its role as a symbol of reconciliation.</p>

          <p>Medical experts are criticizing a recent White House press release that cited scientific studies to support a claim linking acetaminophen (Tylenol) use during pregnancy to autism. Physicians reviewing the cited research state that the evidence is "weak" and "inconclusive," and that the White House release misrepresents the findings by creating the appearance of more evidence than exists. For instance, the release links to the same studies multiple times and omits a large-scale Swedish study that found no causal link. Critics suggest the administration is exploiting poor-quality studies and presenting association as causation to support a predetermined political narrative.</p>

          <p>A cultural essay examines the growing appeal of "warrior culture" in America, from the rise of mixed martial arts (MMA) to the proliferation of military-style aesthetics. The author, a long-time martial arts practitioner, reflects on both the positive and negative aspects of this trend. While combat sports can instill discipline, self-awareness, and humility, the essay argues that the warrior ethos can become counterproductive when applied outside the gym or battlefield. The article suggests this culture, which often dismisses compromise and self-doubt, is increasingly influencing American society, driven partly by those who admire combat but have never experienced it.</p>

          <p>A California man was wrongly identified by a federal agency as a suspect who had decapitated a sea lion, after a photo of him was circulated with a $20,000 reward offer. The man, Jason Bietz, explained that the accusation stemmed from a sarcastic remark he made to another beachgoer while he and his daughter were examining a deceased seal. The National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration later retracted the notice and confirmed no animal parts were removed from the beach. The incident highlights a misunderstanding that escalated into a federal inquiry, with Bietz now working to clear his name from the false accusations.</p>

Dr. Goodall's work, which began in Tanzania in 1960, revealed the complex social and emotional lives of chimpanzees, challenging conventional scientific thought.

          <p>A growing number of parents are installing landline phones for their children as a way to foster communication skills without the risks associated with smartphones and social media. This trend is driven by concerns over the mental health impacts of constant connectivity and a desire for a simpler, more focused form of interaction. Companies are now marketing retro-style phones aimed at kids, tapping into a nostalgia for analog technology. For children, the appeal lies in the novelty and tactile nature of the devices, offering a low-pressure introduction to phone conversations and a unique, "old-timey" experience that their friends find cool.</p>

Conversely, it has sparked backlash from conservative commentators who criticize his political stances.

Despite logging millions of autonomous miles, Waymo's robotaxis have a strong safety record, with most serious accidents caused by human drivers. This contrasts sharply with competitors like Tesla and the now-defunct Cruise, which have faced scrutiny over safety issues after more rapid rollouts. Waymo's 16-year journey, backed by Google's resources, has prioritized extensive data collection and cautious expansion, demonstrating that in high-stakes AI applications, a patient, methodical approach is paramount.</p>

In an interview, Beshear criticized President Trump's handling of the government shutdown, stating that threatening to fire federal employees treats families like a "negotiating tool." Having won twice in a state that heavily favors Trump, he argued that Democrats can regain support in rural areas by showing respect, focusing on common ground issues, and investing in those communities. He presented his own success as proof that Democrats can be competitive in unexpected places.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>A new study published in JAMA Internal Medicine suggests that the alarming rise in cancer diagnoses among adults under 50 may be partially a "diagnostic mirage." While incidence rates for eight common cancers have nearly doubled since 1990, the study found that death rates have remained flat, and rates of metastatic cancer have not increased at the same pace. The authors conclude that this pattern points toward an "epidemic of diagnosis" rather than an epidemic of disease, where increased screening and better technology are detecting more cancers that may never have become clinically significant. This complicates the narrative around the surge in early-onset cancer.</p>
