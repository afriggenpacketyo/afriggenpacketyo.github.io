          <p>Coco Gauff won her first-round match at the French Open against Olivia Gadecki, despite a pre-match hiccup where she forgot her rackets in the locker room. Gauff, the No. 2 seed, realized the error just as she stepped onto Court Philippe-Chatrier, blaming her coach for the mishap due to his superstition of always packing her bag. A ball boy retrieved the rackets, and Gauff quickly dismissed Gadecki in straight sets. Gauff, the 2023 US Open champion, is aiming for her first title at Roland-Garros, where she reached the final in 2022. The article is optimistic because Gauff was able to recover from a mistake and win the match.</p>

          <p>President Volodymyr Zelensky of Ukraine is expected to visit Berlin on Wednesday, marking his first visit to Germany since Chancellor Friedrich Merz assumed office. The visit underscores Germany's growing role in supporting Ukraine, particularly amid uncertainties surrounding America's commitment.

While Germany has provided substantial military assistance to Ukraine, Chancellor Merz has been vague about providing the Taurus missile, facing opposition from within his governing coalition.

Farage stated that these measures would help lower-paid workers and that his party's "biggest aspiration" was to lift the salary level at which people start paying income tax to ¬£20,000. He said the measures would be paid for by scrapping net-zero climate measures, stopping hotel accommodation for asylum seekers, ending diversity and equality initiatives in the public sector and cutting the number of quangos.
