          <div class="timestamp">2025-10-10 08:45:29 EDT</div>
        </div>
        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>The Internal Revenue Service has officially adjusted federal income tax brackets and standard deductions for the 2026 tax year to account for persistent inflation, a crucial move designed to prevent the phenomenon of "bracket creep." This annual adjustment means that American taxpayers will need to earn more income before they are pushed into a higher tax bracket, potentially lowering their overall tax burden. For 2026, the standard deduction will increase to $32,200 for married couples filing jointly and $16,100 for single filers. These changes, influenced by recent legislation, aim to provide tangible tax relief for many households across the country. (not investment advice)</p>

The Nobel Committee highlighted her courageous struggle against the country's expanding authoritarianism and her steadfast support for a peaceful transition to democracy. In their announcement, the committee also noted the concerning global trend of democracy being in retreat and emphasized that democratic principles are a fundamental precondition for lasting peace.

          <p>Federal Reserve Governor Christopher Waller has reiterated his support for lowering interest rates but emphasized the need for a cautious and gradual approach due to conflicting economic data. He highlighted that while the labor market shows signs of weakening, GDP growth remains strong, and inflation is still running considerably above the central bank's 2% target. Waller stated he is comfortable with the Federal Open Market Committee's current projection of two more quarter-point cuts this year but opposes more aggressive reductions. His measured comments come amid reports that he is a finalist to succeed Jerome Powell as Fed Chair. (not investment advice)</p>

          <h2>Financial Advisor Identifies Over-Cautiousness as the Biggest Mistake for Young Investors</h2>

        </div>
        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>According to Josh Brown, CEO of Ritholtz Wealth Management, the most significant and common error young investors make is being overly focused on downside risk instead of prioritizing long-term growth potential. He advises that young people, who have a long time horizon for their investments to compound and recover from market volatility, should be fully invested in the stock market rather than holding significant amounts in cash or bonds. For beginners, Brown recommends using low-cost index funds or ETFs that track the broad market, as this strategy historically outperforms most individual stock picking and removes much of the complexity from investing.

          <h2>A Retrospective on Edgar Davids' Unconventional Tenure as Player-Manager at Barnet FC</h2>
          <div class="timestamp">2025-10-10 08:03:26 EDT</div>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>This article recounts the memorable and bizarre period when Dutch football legend Edgar Davids served as player-manager for Barnet FC starting in 2012. Davids joined the struggling League Two club to gain coaching experience, famously playing for free and bringing a top-tier mentality that both inspired and clashed with the existing squad. His tenure was marked by on-field brilliance, multiple red cards, wearing the number 1 shirt, and controversially skipping some away games. Despite almost saving the team from relegation in his first season, his second season in the Conference was more chaotic, ultimately leading to his departure in 2014.</p>

          <p>Costco has quietly grown into one of the world's largest clothing retailers, with its annual apparel sales increasing by nearly 40% to $9.7 billion between 2019 and 2024. This impressive sales volume now surpasses that of established specialty apparel brands like Old Navy and Abercrombie & Fitch. The company's success in this sector is driven by offering a mix of popular name brands, its own successful private label Kirkland Signature, and "opportunistic" one-off purchases that create a "treasure hunt" shopping experience for members. This strategy has proven highly effective, drawing significant consumer attention and even prompting legal action from competitors.</p>

          <p>A recent surge in Bitcoin's value has created an estimated 70,000 new crypto millionaires in the past year, bringing the total to over 240,000 individuals with holdings of $1 million or more. A new economic study analyzing crypto wallets found that these investors tend to spend about 9.7 cents for every dollar of added crypto wealth, more than double the rate for traditional stock market gains. This spending, which contributed an estimated $145 billion to U.S. consumption in 2024, is primarily directed towards restaurants, entertainment, and real estate rather than stereotypical luxury goods like high-end cars and watches.

          <p>A writer who appeared on "House Hunters Renovation" reveals the stark contrast between her polished on-screen life and her difficult off-screen reality. While the show portrayed her and her wife as a carefree couple excitedly renovating their home, they were simultaneously navigating the stressful and emotionally draining process of being foster parents to two young boys whose adoption was uncertain. The immense pressure of the renovation, filming, and the potential loss of their children pushed their marriage to the breaking point, leading them to couples counseling. The experience highlights the curated nature of reality TV and the hidden personal struggles behind a seemingly perfect facade.</p>

This marks the beginning of the first phase of a deal that includes the release of all remaining hostages in exchange for over 1,000 Palestinian prisoners. According to the agreement's terms, the hostage and prisoner exchange is set to occur within 72 hours of the IDF's completed redeployment. The U.S. Central Command is establishing a coordination center in Israel with around 200 personnel to monitor the ceasefire and facilitate humanitarian aid.</p>

          <p>The NBA is returning to China for preseason games for the first time in six years, a significant milestone in repairing its relationship with its second-largest and most lucrative international market. The league's presence in China was severely curtailed following a 2019 political controversy, but it is now looking to unlock future growth as traditional U.S. television viewership declines. With a massive fan base of over 425 million social media followers in China, the NBA is renewing key partnerships, such as with Alibaba, and investing in local infrastructure and community events to rebuild its valuable foothold in the country.</p>

          <p>A significant change to 401(k) plans is set to take effect in 2026, impacting older, high-earning workers who make additional contributions to their retirement accounts. Under a provision from the Secure 2.0 Act, individuals who earned more than $145,000 in the previous year will be required to make their "catch-up" contributions on a post-tax Roth basis only. This eliminates the option for an upfront tax deduction on these additional savings for this specific group of savers. Until 2026, all eligible workers can continue to choose between pretax and Roth catch-up contributions, if their plan allows. (not investment advice)</p>
