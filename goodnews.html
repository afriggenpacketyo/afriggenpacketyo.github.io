          <div class="timestamp">2025-07-10 12:25:01 EDT</div>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>The first-ever Hermès Birkin bag, created for the late actress and singer Jane Birkin, has fetched over $10.1 million at a Sotheby's auction in Paris. This sale sets a new world record for the most valuable handbag ever sold at auction. The iconic bag was designed in 1984 after Birkin expressed her need for a larger, practical purse to Hermès' then-leader, Jean-Louis Dumas, during a flight. The Birkin bag has since evolved into a globally recognized symbol of luxury and exclusivity, with demand consistently outstripping supply.</p>

          <p>Tesla CEO Elon Musk has revealed plans to expand the company's robotaxi service area in Austin, Texas, and integrate the xAI chatbot, Grok, into its vehicles. The announcements come amid a turbulent period for Musk, who has been in a public feud with President Trump over a major tax bill, causing volatility in Tesla's stock. Musk also recently stepped down from his government role and is dealing with the departure of the CEO from his social media platform, X. These developments reflect Musk's continued push for innovation despite facing significant political and business challenges.</p>

          <h2>Comparing Short-Term CDs and Money Market Accounts for a $20,000 Deposit</h2>

        </div>
        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>For savers deciding where to place a significant sum like $20,000, both short-term Certificates of Deposit (CDs) and money market accounts offer competitive interest rates. While money market accounts provide more flexibility, including check-writing capabilities, their interest rates are variable and can change. In contrast, CDs offer a fixed, guaranteed rate for a set term, which often results in slightly higher earnings over periods of three to twelve months. The choice ultimately depends on the saver's need for liquidity versus the desire for a guaranteed return on their investment. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>A contestant on the game show "Jeopardy!" created an awkward moment by mistakenly identifying Dallas Wings rookie Paige Bueckers as Indiana Fever star Caitlin Clark. The clue, which included a photo of Bueckers, described her as the 2025 WNBA draft's first pick and a national champion with UConn. This on-air mix-up highlights the rising profiles of these young basketball stars, even as it shows that mainstream recognition can still be inconsistent. The incident was one of several sports-related stumbles during the episode, which also saw contestants struggle with a basic NFL scoring question.</p>

          <p>A federal judge in New Hampshire has issued a preliminary injunction, temporarily blocking the enforcement of President Trump's executive order targeting birthright citizenship. The ruling, which certifies the challenge as a class-action lawsuit, comes after a Supreme Court decision limited nationwide injunctions but allowed for class-action relief. The judge found that the challengers, represented by the ACLU, were likely to suffer irreparable harm if the order was enforced. This legal victory for immigrant rights advocates represents a significant setback for the administration's efforts to restrict the 14th Amendment's citizenship clause.</p>

          <p>Research increasingly supports the idea that exposure to sunlight can positively affect happiness and mental well-being, though the effects vary among individuals. Scientists theorize that sunlight boosts mood by interacting with cells in the eyes that regulate circadian rhythms and by stimulating the production of vitamin D, which may have antidepressant properties. While excessive sun exposure carries health risks, a daily routine of about 15 minutes of morning sunlight can be beneficial. The article suggests that while sunshine is a useful tool for well-being, it is no substitute for more significant happiness factors like strong social relationships.</p>

          <p>Grocery stores like Trader Joe's and Wegmans have transcended their utilitarian purpose to become brands that inspire passionate fan bases, a phenomenon reflecting broader cultural shifts. In an era of declining traditional affiliations, consumers increasingly use brands to signal their identity and build community, turning shopping into a form of self-expression. Anthropologists and marketing experts suggest this "tribalism" is rooted in a fundamental human need for connection. The choice of where to buy groceries has become a statement about one's values, from regional pride to health consciousness, making the supermarket a modern-day cultural touchstone.</p>
