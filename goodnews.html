          <h2>Study Reveals Hallucinogenic Drug Use in Ancient Peruvian Rituals</h2>
          <div class="timestamp">2025-05-07 09:08:56 EDT</div>

          <p>A new study suggests that the prehistoric Chav√≠n people of the Peruvian Andes used psychoactive drugs during exclusive rituals, potentially influencing social and political hierarchies. Archaeologists discovered artifacts, including "snuff tubes," at Chav√≠n de Hu√°ntar containing traces of DMT and tobacco. These substances were likely consumed during tightly controlled ceremonies reserved for a select few, reinforcing social inequality. The findings indicate that hallucinogens played a significant role in the transition from egalitarian societies to stratified ones, where inequality was normalized.</p>

          <p>Starting today, Americans traveling domestically are required to use Real IDs or another acceptable form of identification, such as a U.S. passport, at airport security checkpoints.

Enhanced IDs, issued by Washington, Michigan, Minnesota, New York, and Vermont, are also acceptable and allow land and sea travel to Canada, Mexico, and the Caribbean without a passport.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Uber's first-quarter earnings surpassed expectations, but revenue fell short of projections, causing a 5% drop in share prices. Revenue grew by 14% to $11.53 billion, while net income reached $1.78 billion, a significant increase from the previous year's loss. The company expects gross bookings to range between $45.75 billion and $47.25 billion in the current quarter. Uber is also facing a lawsuit from the FTC over deceptive billing practices related to its Uber One subscription service, though the CEO maintains that the service is simple to cancel. The company is also pushing into autonomous vehicles, with 1.5 million autonomous vehicle trips completed.</p>

          <p>The national average savings account interest rate is currently 0.41%, but high-yield savings accounts offer significantly higher rates, ranging from 4.10% to 4.45%. Online banks often provide the best high-yield savings accounts due to lower overhead costs. To maximize savings, consumers should compare different accounts and consider online banks for potentially higher interest rates and lower fees. Experts recommend having an emergency fund to avoid using high-interest credit cards for unexpected expenses. (not investment advice)</p>

Gold is often viewed as a safe-haven asset during times of economic uncertainty and as a hedge against inflation.

          <p>Renewable energy production in the U.S. has tripled in the last decade, significantly reducing greenhouse gas emissions and improving energy resilience. Solar and wind energy now power millions of homes, with battery storage and electric vehicle adoption also surging.
