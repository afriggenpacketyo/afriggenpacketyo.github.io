          <p>Geely Auto, a major car manufacturer in China, is ceasing the construction of new car plants due to significant global overcapacity, as stated by Chairman Li Shufu at the Chongqing Auto Show. This decision reflects the challenges many Chinese companies face in achieving profitability amidst a brutal price war within the mainland's automotive sector. Companies like BYD, Geely, and Leapmotor have been slashing prices by as much as 20% to maintain market share. The move signals a shift towards focusing on technological advancements rather than expanding production capabilities. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>In May, China's exports to the U.S. experienced a sharp decline of 34.5%, marking the most significant drop since February 2020, which was influenced by the Covid-19 pandemic. This decrease contributed to an overall export increase of only 4.8%, falling short of expectations, while imports also decreased by 3.4% due to sluggish domestic demand. Despite the decline in trade with the U.S., exports to Southeast Asia, the European Union, and Africa saw substantial increases, and China's total trade surplus increased to $103.2 billion. These shifts reflect the ongoing impact of trade tensions and the need for China to bolster domestic consumption. (not investment advice)</p>
