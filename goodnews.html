        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>India's economy demonstrated resilience by growing at an annual rate of 7.4% in the March quarter, exceeding economists' forecasts, despite global economic uncertainties. This robust growth is attributed to strong domestic consumption and relatively low dependence on exports, which has helped cushion the impact of U.S. trade policies. The Reserve Bank of India has been cutting interest rates to bolster growth, and rural consumer demand is improving, further contributing to the positive outlook. The International Monetary Fund projects India's economy to modestly overtake Japan's, making it the world's fourth-largest economy by 2025. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>President Trump is scheduled to visit Pittsburgh to celebrate a partnership between U.S. Steel and Nippon Steel, a deal that was initially blocked by former President Biden on national security grounds. Details of the agreement remain unclear, with analysts suggesting Trump is framing it as a partnership to avoid appearing to reverse his stance on U.S. Steel remaining American. Separately, Elon Musk is leaving his position as head of the Department of Government Efficiency (DOGE) after facing legal challenges and clashes with Cabinet members. Musk's departure from DOGE may not halt the restructuring of government through data collection and workforce downsizing.</p>

          <p>Gerry Adams, the former Sinn F√©in leader, has been awarded ‚Ç¨100,000 in damages after winning a libel case against the BBC over a story alleging his involvement in the 2006 murder of Denis Donaldson. Adams denied any involvement in the murder, which was the subject of a BBC NI Spotlight program and accompanying online article in 2016. The 11-person jury in Dublin's High Court reached its verdict after nearly seven hours of deliberation. The legal victory marks a significant moment for Adams, who has long maintained his innocence.</p>

          <p>The euro has been gaining strength against the dollar amid uncertainty surrounding President Trump's tariff policies, prompting discussions about its potential to become a more prominent reserve currency. European Central Bank President Christine Lagarde suggests that the euro could "earn" greater global influence with the right policy mix, including a solid geopolitical foundation and deeper capital markets. A stronger euro would benefit Europe by lowering borrowing costs, insulating it from exchange rate volatility, and protecting it from sanctions. Market watchers are divided on whether the euro can significantly erode the dollar's dominance in global FX holdings. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>A neuroscientist dispels the notion of simple animal instincts, arguing that behaviors are shaped by a complex interplay of genetics, environment, and learning. The question of how a tailorbird knows to sew its nest, or how a dog knows to herd, is not easily answered by attributing it to instinct. Instead, these species-typical behaviors arise from a combination of predispositions, physical capabilities, and environmental interactions. Understanding the origins of these behaviors is crucial for both curiosity and conservation efforts.</p>
