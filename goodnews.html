Hong Kong currently leads the world in IPOs, followed by India, prompting HSBC to expand its services to cater to the growing wealth management clientele in the region.

          <p>During the Emergency in the mid-1970s, Prime Minister Indira Gandhi's government considered reimagining India as a centralized state with a presidential system. Inspired by Charles de Gaulle's France, the proposal aimed to concentrate executive power and sideline the judiciary. The idea, though never fully realized, influenced constitutional amendments that expanded Parliament's powers and limited judicial review. The episode reveals a forgotten chapter in India's political history, exploring the tension between parliamentary democracy and centralized control.</p>
