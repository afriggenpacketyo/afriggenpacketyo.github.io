        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>David Ellison's Paramount Skydance is reportedly preparing a takeover offer for Warner Bros. Discovery, a move that would create a massive media and content conglomerate. The potential acquisition caused Warner Bros. Discovery's stock to surge by nearly 30%. A merger would combine major franchises like Paramount's "Star Trek" and "Mission Impossible" with WBD's "Harry Potter," DC superheroes, and "Game of Thrones." This consolidation would also significantly expand Paramount's sports media rights, adding WBD's NHL, MLB, and March Madness broadcasts to its portfolio, positioning it to compete more directly with Disney's ESPN.</p>

          <p>Adobe's stock rose in after-hours trading after the company reported fiscal third-quarter earnings and revenue that exceeded Wall Street's expectations. The design software giant posted adjusted earnings of $5.31 per share on revenue of $5.99 billion, representing an 11% year-over-year increase. The company also provided a positive outlook for the fourth quarter, with forecasts for both earnings and revenue topping consensus estimates. This strong performance and optimistic guidance suggest robust growth, particularly in its digital media business, which is now expected to see higher annualized revenue growth than previously anticipated.</p>

          <p>Manchester United has sent goalkeeper Andre Onana to Turkish club Trabzonspor on a loan deal for the remainder of the 2025-26 season. The move was completed just before the Turkish transfer window closed. Onana, who was signed from Inter Milan for £47.2 million in 2023 by former manager Erik ten Hag, has not featured in any of the team's first three Premier League games this season. His only appearance under new manager Ruben Amorim was in a Carabao Cup match, indicating he was not central to the team's immediate plans.</p>

These meetings are part of a process to identify a successor to current Chair Jerome Powell, whose term expires in 2026. Bessent is also reportedly advocating for a reform agenda at the Fed, aiming to reduce the central bank's large bond portfolio and lessen its overall economic footprint. This search occurs as the Trump administration continues to pressure the Fed for an interest rate cut. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>Actress Roxana Ortega is premiering her debut play, "Am I Roxie?," a one-woman show that explores her personal journey of caring for her mother, who has Alzheimer's disease. The play delves into the emotional challenges of balancing caregiving responsibilities with maintaining her own identity and acting career. Ortega uses humor and a range of character impersonations to navigate heavy topics like grief, family duty, and self-abandonment. The production, which kicks off the Geffen Playhouse's new season, highlights the universal struggle of caring for an aging parent while trying not to lose oneself in the process.</p>

          <h2>Mortgage Rates Decline to Lowest Point in Nearly a Year</h2>
          <div class="timestamp">2025-09-11 16:12:54 EDT</div>
        </div>
        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Mortgage rates have fallen for the second consecutive week, reaching their lowest level in almost a year, with the average 30-year rate now at 6.35%. This decline is attributed to expectations of a Federal Reserve rate cut and a cooling 10-year Treasury yield. The lower rates may present an opportunity for prospective homebuyers and current homeowners considering a refinance. However, the article advises caution, noting that while waiting for rates to drop further could be beneficial, there is no guarantee they will not rise again, making it a potentially risky strategy.

          <p>Commerce Secretary Howard Lutnick announced that under a new tariff agreement, the U.S. and Japan will equally share profits from American projects funded by a $550 billion Japanese investment. This arrangement will continue until Japan's initial investment is fully recouped. After that point, the profit-sharing model will shift to a 90/10 split in favor of the United States. The deal, part of a broader agreement where Japan faces 15% baseline tariffs, aims to bolster U.S. domestic manufacturing in key sectors like nuclear power and antibiotics, using Japanese capital for projects approved by the U.S. government.

          <p>The Federal Trade Commission (FTC) has launched an inquiry into seven major technology companies, including Alphabet, Meta, OpenAI, and Snap, regarding the potential negative effects of their AI chatbots on children and teenagers. The agency is seeking information on the safety measures these companies have implemented, particularly when their chatbots act as "companions" to young users. This probe comes amid growing concerns over the societal impact of AI, including its role in what has been described as a "loneliness epidemic." The FTC's investigation will examine how the companies monetize engagement, handle personal data, and mitigate potential harms to minors.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>A debate is underway in Germany over whether classic literary works by authors like Goethe should remain central to the high school curriculum. Critics and some students argue that the required reading lists are dominated by "old white men" and lack relevance and diversity for a student body with increasingly multicultural backgrounds. Proponents, including a national teachers' association, contend that while curricula should be modernized, studying classic texts is essential for understanding history and developing critical thinking. The discussion reflects a broader tension between preserving cultural heritage and adapting education to meet the needs and interests of contemporary students.</p>

          <p>Eastman Kodak has found an unexpected hit with its new "Kodak Charmera," a line of 1980s-inspired digital toy cameras that sold out shortly after its release. The small, functional cameras are marketed as fashion accessories and sold in "blind box" packaging, tapping into Gen Z's interest in vintage aesthetics and collectibles. This early success provides a bright spot for the struggling photography pioneer, which recently issued a warning about its ability to continue operations after posting significant financial losses. The high demand for the Charmera suggests Kodak has successfully tapped into a potent nostalgia-driven consumer trend.</p>

          <p>California lawmakers are debating a bill that would ban the use of PFAS, known as "forever chemicals," in a range of consumer products including nonstick cookware, dental floss, and food packaging. The proposed legislation has created a conflict between environmental advocates, including actor Mark Ruffalo, and a coalition of celebrity chefs and cookware manufacturers. Supporters of the ban point to the significant health risks associated with PFAS exposure, while opponents argue that the specific type of PFAS used in nonstick coatings, PTFE (Teflon), is safe and has been approved by regulators. The debate centers on the potential for these chemicals to be released from pans into food.</p>

          <p>Belarus has freed 52 political prisoners, including journalists and activists, as part of an agreement with the Trump administration to secure the easing of some U.S. sanctions. In exchange for the releases, the U.S. will allow the Belarusian national airline, Belavia, to purchase aircraft parts. The deal was negotiated by a U.S. special envoy and authoritarian leader Alexander Lukashenko, who has overseen a brutal crackdown on dissent since a disputed 2020 election. While this is a significant release, human rights groups note that over 1,000 political prisoners remain incarcerated in Belarus.</p>
