          <p>Australian stocks experienced a downturn following Prime Minister Anthony Albanese's re-election, marking his second consecutive term in 21 years and signaling a desire for policy stability amidst global macroeconomic uncertainties. The S&P/ASX 200 index reversed earlier gains to close down 0.7%, while the Australian dollar appreciated slightly against the US dollar. Other Asian markets showed mixed performance, with Taiwan's Taiex declining and India's Nifty 50 rising. Oil prices also saw a significant drop after OPEC+ agreed to increase production, and US futures edged down despite strong gains on Wall Street the previous week.</p>

          <p>Former Vice President Mike Pence received the John F. Kennedy Profile in Courage Award for upholding the constitutional transfer of power after the 2020 election. In his acceptance speech, Pence emphasized the Constitution as the common ground uniting Americans and highlighted the importance of finding common ground to forge a future together. His remarks came shortly after an interview aired where President Trump expressed uncertainty about whether due process applies to all individuals in the U.S., regardless of citizenship. Pence also subtly acknowledged differences with both Democrats and his own Republican Party on issues like spending, tariffs, and support for Ukraine.</p>

          <p>Will Hutchins, best known for his role as the comically genteel sheriff Tom Brewster on the 1950s television western "Sugarfoot," passed away at the age of 94. Hutchins' character, a law student who preferred sarsaparilla to whiskey, brought a unique comedic sensibility to the genre. After "Sugarfoot," Hutchins continued to work in television and film, including appearances in Elvis Presley movies, but later found fulfillment working as a clown, traveling the world and performing for diverse audiences. He believed that the key to comedy was to approach it with the same seriousness as a dramatic role, drawing inspiration from silent film legends like Chaplin and Keaton.</p>

          <p>Silent book clubs are experiencing a surge in popularity, offering a unique social experience centered around reading in a shared space. Unlike traditional book clubs, these groups allow members to read any book they choose, followed by a period of silent reading and then optional discussion. The appeal lies in the combination of social interaction and individual immersion in literature, providing a relaxing and mindful environment. The original Silent Book Club, founded in 2012, now boasts over 1,600 chapters in 54 countries, reflecting a growing desire for socializing in ways that aren't focused on drinking or dating.</p>

Some, like Pedro Uria-Recio of CIMB Group, believe companies have a responsibility to protect jobs and equip employees with the skills needed to adapt to the AI revolution. Others, such as Tomasz Kurczyk of Prudential Singapore, argue that protecting employment may not be the right mindset and that adapting employment is key.

          <p>A report from the Health and Social Care Select Committee warns that failing to reform social care for older and disabled adults is an untenable decision that is costing the country financially and in human terms. The report emphasizes that social care is consuming an increasing proportion of councils' budgets and is integral to NHS reforms. Investment in the system could improve the quality of care and drive economic growth, creating jobs and generating returns to the wider economy.

The campaign has led to investigations and expulsions of key members of the Central Military Commission (CMC).</p>
