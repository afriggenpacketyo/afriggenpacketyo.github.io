          <p>The U.S. Department of Agriculture is launching a $750 million program to protect American cattle from the New World screwworm, a pest with flesh-eating maggots currently affecting Mexico. A new factory will be constructed in southern Texas to breed and release thousands of sterile flies, a method proven effective in eradicating the pest in the 1970s. This initiative is described as a crucial measure for farm security and the national food supply, as the parasite poses a significant threat to livestock, wildlife, and occasionally humans. The plan also includes funding for enhanced border patrols and other preventative technologies.</p>

          <p>A derelict Napoleonic fort on Thorne Island in Pembrokeshire, Wales, has been meticulously renovated into a luxury party destination and is now on the market for £3 million. The new owner, a former software CEO, purchased the abandoned 19th-century building in 2017 and spent nearly five years and a significant investment to make it habitable. The project involved overcoming immense logistical challenges, such as installing running water by cutting through solid rock. The historic fort is now equipped with 40 beds, modern amenities, and even its own nightclub, transforming it from a ruin into a unique private retreat.</p>

          <p>With food prices rising, parents in the UK are sharing creative and meticulous strategies to feed their children affordably during the six-week school summer holidays. Many families face increased financial pressure as they must provide meals that are often subsidized at school. Tactics include stocking freezers with reduced-price 'yellow sticker' items, batch cooking, and organizing the fridge to ensure food is used before it expires. Some parents also rely on community pantries that provide surplus food from supermarkets, highlighting the community-level response to the growing cost-of-living challenges.</p>

          <p>In response to limited space, the historic Hollywood Forever Cemetery in Los Angeles has unveiled a new five-story vertical mausoleum, adding a modern architectural landmark to its grounds. The Gower Mausoleum provides permanent housing for approximately 13,000 people and has already sold out two of its floors. The design emphasizes natural light and offers views of city landmarks, aiming to create a peaceful environment for visitors. This vertical expansion reflects the cemetery's evolving role as not just a resting place for stars like Judy Garland but also a cultural venue for the living, hosting movie nights and festivals.</p>

          <p>A group of students in the UK, now preparing to receive their GCSE exam results, have opened time capsule letters they wrote to their future selves four years ago. The letters were penned when they were 11 years old, just as they returned to school following a lengthy COVID-19 lockdown. In their writings, the students reflected on their fears about the pandemic, their hopes for the future, and their personal ambitions. The experience provided a poignant moment of reflection on how much they have grown and the unique challenges their generation faced during a deeply disrupted period of their education.</p>

          <p>Rising British heavyweight boxer Moses Itauma delivered a powerful statement by defeating veteran Dillian Whyte with a first-round stoppage. The 20-year-old fighter sent Whyte to the canvas with a strong right hand, and the referee waved off the fight just 119 seconds into the bout. This decisive victory, in what was considered the biggest test of his career so far, extends Itauma's undefeated professional record to 13 wins, with 11 coming by knockout. The performance further solidifies his reputation as a major future star in the heavyweight division.</p>

          <p>A new box set titled 'Sunset Boulevard' documents the final creative burst of Elvis Presley, focusing on his studio recordings in Los Angeles between 1972 and 1975. This period yielded his last major hit, 'Burning Love,' and saw him evolve into a deeply expressive ballad singer, influenced by the turmoil in his personal life. The collection offers a look into a time when Presley was creatively adrift after his 1968 comeback, and it captures the disappointment he felt after losing the co-starring role in the film 'A Star Is Born,' a setback some believe accelerated his decline.</p>

          <p>Recent data indicates that Samsung is gaining ground on Apple in the U.S. smartphone market, with its market share surging from 23% to 31% in the second quarter. This growth is largely attributed to the increasing popularity of its innovative foldable phones, like the Z Fold and Z Flip models, as well as its strategy of offering a wide range of devices at various price points. While Apple still leads the market, its share has declined, and the company is now expected to respond with new form factors, including a slimmer iPhone and potentially its own foldable device by 2026.
