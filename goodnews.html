        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>U.S. Treasury yields decreased after the Labor Department reported higher-than-expected weekly jobless claims, with first-time filings reaching 247,000, exceeding the Dow Jones estimate of 236,000. The 2-year yield fell by more than 2 basis points to 3.848%, while the 10-year Treasury yield dropped by more than 3 basis points to 4.328%. This decline follows sharp decreases on Wednesday due to disappointing U.S. data, including weakened services sector activity and lower-than-expected private sector payrolls, which heightened investor concerns about a weakening labor market. Despite these misses, Deutsche Bank suggests the numbers aren't severe enough to revive recession fears, and traders are closely watching May's nonfarm payrolls and unemployment rate.

          <p>A federal judge temporarily prevented the Trump administration from deporting the wife and five children of Mohamed Soliman, an Egyptian national accused of attacking demonstrators in Boulder, Colorado. Judge Gordon Gallagher cited the potential for irreparable harm if deportation occurred without due process and scheduled a hearing for June 13. Lawyers for the family argued that punishing individuals for relatives' crimes violates democratic justice principles, referencing Soliman's wife, Hayam El Gamal, who has a pending EB-2 visa as a network engineer. The family entered the U.S. in August 2022 and applied for asylum in September 2022, and Soliman's family is currently held at an immigration detention center in Texas.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>The European Central Bank (ECB) announced a 25-basis-point interest rate cut, lowering its inflation expectations due to a stronger euro and lower energy costs, bringing the deposit facility rate to 2%. The ECB's decision is based on its assessment of the inflation outlook, underlying inflation dynamics, and monetary policy transmission strength, with projections indicating an average inflation rate of 2% in 2025. While core inflation was revised upwards, economic growth remains lackluster, with the euro zone expanding by 0.3% in the first quarter of 2025. The ECB's decision comes amid increasing uncertainty due to geopolitical tensions and concerns about U.S. tariff policies, which could heavily impact European industries. (not investment advice)</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>The U.S. trade deficit significantly narrowed in April as President Donald Trump sharply escalated tariffs before pausing a large swath of the levies, according to U.S. Commerce Department data. The trade gap fell by more than half in April as imports plunged, with the U.S. registering a trade deficit of about $61 billion, a sharp decline from a $140 billion trade gap a month earlier. Imports dropped by 16% in April as some trade barriers took effect, with imports ticking upward a month earlier as some firms rushed to stockpile supply before the levies saddled them with additional costs. Many economists disagree with Trump's view that the trade deficit is a threat, saying it reflects the consumer-driven engine of the U.S. economy.</p>

          <p>Retail consultancy group AlixPartners created pricing models exclusively for CNBC, looking at the price of a men's sweater and men's shoes made in both China and Vietnam before and after Trump's April 2 "reciprocal" tariff announcement. Under a current 30% tariff, the price of a men's cotton sweater and a pair of men's shoes made in China would both rise about 19%, according to AlixPartners. If Trump implemented the currently suspended 145% tariff on imports from China, the price of those same sweaters or shoes would spike roughly 90%. Shoppers may not see price hikes that large for multiple reasons, and retailers usually don't want to raise prices, because it dampens demand. (not investment advice)</p>

The Department for Education has allocated ¬£1bn to fund the change up to 2029, with the government considering scrapping the two-child benefit cap. While the Institute for Fiscal Studies (IFS) acknowledges the long-term benefits, it notes that the immediate impact on poverty reduction will be limited.</p>

          <h2>NATO Inches Towards Higher Defense Spending Target</h2>

          <p>U.S. Secretary of Defence Pete Hegseth indicated that NATO members are likely to move towards a higher defense spending target of 5% of their individual GDPs. This echoes U.S. President Donald Trump's demand to increase the current target of 2%, with Hegseth emphasizing the U.S. commitment to achieving the 5% goal across the alliance. While defense expenditure has picked up among NATO members, with 23 members reaching the 2% threshold by 2024, major economies like Canada, Spain, and Italy still lag behind. Some NATO members are likely to resist the 5% spending objective, but analysts argue it's imperative for NATO to maintain this level of defense spending.</p>

          <p>Roman emperor Marcus Aurelius, known as a philosopher-king, is often quoted online for his wisdom and stoic principles, particularly in times of crisis. His writings, compiled in "Meditations," were never intended for publication but have become widely read for their insights on equanimity, good governance, and the meaning of life. Marcus Aurelius ruled during a time marked by crises, including wars, economic problems, and the Antonine Plague, and his reflections offer guidance on navigating challenges and finding happiness. An upcoming exhibition in Trier will explore Marcus Aurelius' themes and their relevance to contemporary society.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Childhood friendships, particularly best-friendships, can be valuable but also come with pressure, as adults and peers send messages that everyone needs a best friend or that friendship should look a certain way. Experts suggest that kids need a repertoire of anchors, or people who hold them up, rather than solely focusing on having one particular best friend. While best-friendships can offer benefits like reduced anxiety and improved social skills, they don't always last forever, and definitions have shifted with time, with mutual support being a key aspect. The idea of best-friendship can also be stressful, with social media amplifying these pressures and making it okay not to have one particular best friend.</p>
