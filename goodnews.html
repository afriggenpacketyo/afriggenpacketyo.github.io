          <div class="timestamp">2025-10-12 20:40:07 EDT</div>
        </div>
        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Southern California is preparing for a "winter-like" storm from late Monday through Wednesday, with the National Weather Service forecasting significant rainfall and potential commuting disruptions. Expected rainfall totals range from three-quarters of an inch to 1½ inches, with mountain areas possibly receiving up to 3½ inches, raising flood watch concerns for burn areas. The early-season storm, unusual for October, coincides with the official return of La Niña, which typically brings drier winters and could exacerbate fire conditions in the region. Thunderstorms and gusty winds are also anticipated.</p>

          <p>Former U.S. President Donald Trump asserted that the war in Gaza is over, expressing belief that the ceasefire will hold as he travels to a peace summit in Egypt. Meanwhile, Germany is preparing to pledge at least €100 million for Gaza's reconstruction, acknowledging the immense destruction and the need for international cooperation. The UN development agency estimates Israel's bombardment caused the worst housing destruction since WWII. This diplomatic push and aid commitment come as Israel expects the release of 20 living hostages in exchange for Palestinian prisoners, marking a critical phase in the region's recovery.</p>

        </div>
        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Maintaining adult friendships often proves challenging amidst life's demands, leading to "ghosting" and a loss of connections, with research showing half of friends are lost every seven years. Experts suggest honesty, vulnerability, and creative scheduling are crucial to sustaining bonds as life stages change. Relationship expert Claire Cohen emphasizes transparent communication, sharing her experience of clarifying her desire for invites despite motherhood. Psychologists advocate for embracing "mess" by integrating friends into daily routines and prioritizing in-person interactions, reminding individuals that social connection significantly enhances well-being and that friendships are resilient.</p>

          <h2>Scientists Discover Thermal Cameras Can Objectively Measure Stress Through Nose Temperature</h2>
          <div class="timestamp">2025-10-12 19:28:34 EDT</div>
        </div>
        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Psychologists at the University of Sussex are using thermal cameras to study stress, revealing that a drop in nose temperature can objectively measure stress levels and recovery. During an experimental stress test involving impromptu speeches and mental arithmetic, participants' nose temperatures decreased by 3-6 degrees, a physical reaction as blood flow shifts to eyes and ears in response to perceived danger. Lead researcher Prof. Gillian Forrester suggests this non-invasive technique could be a "game changer" for managing harmful stress, monitoring recovery, and assessing stress in non-communicative individuals or animals like great apes.</p>

        </div>
        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>The Institute for Fiscal Studies (IFS) has advised UK Chancellor Rachel Reeves to avoid "directionless tinkering and half-baked fixes" in the upcoming Budget, urging for wider tax system reform. With pressure to raise billions to meet fiscal rules, the IFS warns against economically harmful tax rises and suggests reforms to property tax and capital gains tax as better starting points. It highlights constraints on major taxes like corporation tax and fuel duties, and cautions against a wealth tax. The think tank advocates for aligning overall tax rates across income forms for a fairer, more growth-friendly system (not investment advice).</p>

          <p>Paramount, backed by billionaire Larry Ellison and his family, has initiated a bid to acquire Warner Bros. Discovery, a move that could significantly reshape Hollywood. Warner Bros. Discovery's board rejected Paramount's initial $20-a-share offer, but discussions are ongoing, with a second bid anticipated. This potential merger, driven by Paramount's need for more content to compete with streaming giants, could lead to the consolidation of major media assets, including HBO, CNN, and Warner Bros. studios. The bid comes as Warner Bros. Discovery plans to divide its assets, and despite recent box office successes, it carries substantial debt.</p>
