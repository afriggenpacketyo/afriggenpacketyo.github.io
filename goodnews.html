          <p>Saturday's newspapers are dominated by two main stories: Reform UK's strong performance in the local elections and Prince Harry's BBC interview following his legal challenge regarding his UK security. The Daily Mail emphasizes the "Reform revolution," noting the party's significant gains. The Times also splits its front page between the election results and Prince Harry's reflections on his security appeal loss and his relationship with the royal family. The Daily Telegraph focuses on the Conservative party's "bloodbath" in the elections, while also mentioning Prince Harry's desire to reconcile with his father. The Sun dedicates most of its front page to Prince Harry, describing his comments as an "incendiary attack on his family."</p>
