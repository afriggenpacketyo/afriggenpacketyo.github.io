The judge emphasized that USIP is an independent think tank supporting both the Executive and Legislative branches, and the President lacks constitutional authority over it.

          <p>NFL owners are expected to resume discussions about potentially banning the "tush push" play, which has become a signature move for the Philadelphia Eagles. Commanders linebacker Frankie Luvu has voiced his support for banning the play, describing it as a "cheapo play" akin to a rugby scrum. Luvu was penalized multiple times for jumping over the line of scrimmage during a game against the Eagles, highlighting the challenges defenses face in stopping the play. The proposal to ban the tush push requires 24 votes to pass, but a previous vote was evenly split.</p>
