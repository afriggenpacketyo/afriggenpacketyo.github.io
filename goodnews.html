          <p>Apple, in collaboration with the Trump administration, has announced a new commitment to invest an additional $100 billion in its U.S. operations over the next four years, bringing its total planned domestic spending to $600 billion. The investment includes a $2.5 billion expansion with glass manufacturer Corning in Kentucky and aims to create an "end-to-end" American supply chain for key components like chips. This move builds on previous multi-billion dollar commitments Apple has made to bolster its U.S. manufacturing presence under political pressure. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>In the current economic climate, savers are weighing the benefits of different financial products for a $10,000 deposit. This article compares a 6-month Certificate of Deposit (CD) with a money market account, noting that while starting interest rates are similar, the CD offers a fixed, guaranteed return. Given the potential for future interest rate cuts by the Federal Reserve, a CD could ultimately yield a higher, more predictable earning. The analysis suggests that for those prioritizing maximum guaranteed interest over immediate liquidity, a CD is the preferable option. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>Indiana Fever guard Sophie Cunningham has been fined $1,500 by the WNBA for publicly criticizing game officials for a second time. The fine came after she discussed referee inconsistency on her podcast, stating that a previous $500 fine for similar comments on TikTok would not deter her. Cunningham acknowledged the difficulty of officiating but expressed frustration over what she perceives as inconsistent calls, a sentiment she claims is shared by other players and fans. The incidents follow a recent on-court altercation where she defended teammate Caitlin Clark.</p>
