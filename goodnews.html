          <h2>Hawaii Tsunami Warning Downgraded to Advisory as Smaller-Than-Feared Waves Arrive</h2>
          <div class="timestamp">2025-07-30 05:49:41 EDT</div>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Following a major 8.8 magnitude earthquake off the coast of Russia, the tsunami warning for Hawaii was downgraded to an advisory after the initial waves proved to be relatively small. While some coastal flooding was reported, the impact was less severe than initially anticipated, allowing officials to ease the alert level after several hours. The Pacific Tsunami Warning Center noted wave heights of up to 4.9 feet, but the catastrophic damage once feared did not materialize. The article details the timeline of events, the official response in Hawaii, and the cautious relief as the immediate threat subsided, though the potential for strong currents and subsequent waves remained a concern for hours.</p>

          <h2>Cuba's First Foreign Farmland Lease to Vietnamese Company Yields Promising Rice Harvest</h2>
          <div class="timestamp">2025-07-30 05:41:00 EDT</div>
        </div>
        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>In an unprecedented move, Cuba has leased farmland to a foreign entity, Vietnamese company Agri VMA, to bolster its declining domestic rice production. The project in Los Palacios is showing remarkable success, with the first harvest yielding nearly four times the national average, thanks to superior Vietnamese seeds, fertilizers, and expertise. This partnership aims to reduce Cuba's reliance on costly imports amid a severe economic crisis exacerbated by US sanctions, supply shortages, and environmental challenges. The Vietnamese firm manages the operation independently and hires local workers directly, marking a significant policy shift for the Communist state as it seeks innovative solutions for its food security crisis.</p>

          <h2>Eurozone Economy Shows Resilience with Modest 0.1% Growth in Second Quarter</h2>
          <div class="timestamp">2025-07-30 05:39:59 EDT</div>
        </div>
        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>The euro zone's economy demonstrated unexpected resilience by growing 0.1% in the second quarter, surpassing economists' predictions of a flat performance. This modest expansion follows a more robust 0.6% growth in the first quarter, with the slowdown attributed to the fading effects of businesses stockpiling goods ahead of US tariffs. Analysts suggest the data indicates that the region has so far weathered the uncertainty of shifting American trade policies reasonably well. The report comes as a new trade framework between the U.S. and the European Union, which includes a 15% tariff on the bloc, is set to take effect. (not investment advice)</p>

          <h2>IMF Significantly Upgrades China's Growth Forecast Amid Strong Export Diversification</h2>

          <p>The International Monetary Fund (IMF) has notably increased its 2025 growth forecast for China, marking the largest upward revision for any economy in its latest report. This optimism is attributed to stronger-than-expected economic activity in the first half of the year and a de-escalation in US-China trade tensions. A key factor highlighted by the IMF is China's successful diversification of its export markets beyond the United States. Despite a drop in shipments to the US, China's overall exports grew significantly, driven by increased trade with regions like Southeast Asia, Africa, and Europe, showcasing the country's adaptability in the global trade landscape.

          <h2>Study Reveals Great Tit Songbirds Engage in 'Divorce' After Breeding Season</h2>
          <div class="timestamp">2025-07-30 05:00:00 EDT</div>
        </div>
        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>New research from the University of Oxford reveals that Great Tits, a common European songbird, exhibit behaviors akin to divorce. By tracking the birds with radio tags, scientists observed that while many mated pairs remain together through the winter, others gradually drift apart after the breeding season concludes. These "divorcing" birds were found to associate with each other less and less as winter progressed, suggesting they are severing old bonds and potentially forming new ones before the next spring. The study provides new insights into the complex social lives of animals, showing that the dynamics of pairing and separation are not exclusively human phenomena and play a significant role in their lives.</p>

          <h2>The Word 'Dude' Traces Its Surprising Origins to 19th-Century New York City Dandies</h2>
          <div class="timestamp">2025-07-30 05:00:00 EDT</div>
        </div>
        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>This article explores the fascinating and long history of the word "dude," revealing its origins are far from the laid-back surfer culture it's now associated with. The term was likely coined in the 1880s in New York City to describe young, effeminate men who dressed in an overly fancy, Anglophile style, possibly as a reference to "Yankee Doodle." The word later evolved to describe East Coast city dwellers visiting western "dude ranches" in elaborate cowboy attire. Over the 20th century, it was adopted by various subcultures, eventually shedding its association with fashion to become a widespread, informal term of address. Linguists note that despite its male-centric history, its usage has become increasingly gender-neutral.</p>

          <h2>New Report Finds No Evidence of Widespread Noncitizen Voting Despite Political Claims</h2>

        </div>
        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Despite persistent claims from former President Trump and other Republicans about widespread illegal voting, a new report from the Center for Election Innovation & Research (CEIR) finds that voting by non-U.S. citizens is extremely rare. After reviewing public disclosures and audits from states across the country, the research confirms that while isolated incidents occur, they are in minuscule numbers and show no signs of coordinated efforts. The report highlights that even in states that have dedicated significant resources to finding such cases, the numbers are shockingly small. Election experts maintain that the narrative of widespread noncitizen voting is a political tool rather than a reflection of a genuine threat to election integrity.</p>

          <p>Colombian international winger Luis Diaz has completed a transfer from Liverpool to German champions Bayern Munich in a deal valued at £65.5 million. The 28-year-old has signed a four-year contract, ending his three-and-a-half-year tenure at Anfield where he won four major trophies, including the Premier League. In a farewell message, Diaz stated he was leaving with a sense of "duty fulfilled" and expressed pride in the team's achievements. The move is a significant piece of summer transfer business for both clubs, with Liverpool reportedly using the funds from player sales to pursue other targets, including Newcastle striker Alexander Isak.</p>

          <p>Google has announced its intention to sign the European Union's voluntary code of practice for artificial intelligence, a move that puts it at odds with fellow tech giant Meta. While Google expressed concerns that the EU's AI Act and the associated code could potentially slow innovation in Europe, it stated its endorsement is aimed at promoting citizens' access to new AI tools. This decision comes after Meta recently refused to sign the guidelines, arguing they represent an overreach that would stifle the industry's development. The split highlights the differing strategies major tech companies are adopting to navigate the EU's landmark regulatory framework for artificial intelligence.</p>

He praised Amorim for demanding 100% effort from every player, regardless of their status, and stated that the new mentality is exactly what the team needs.

          <p>South Korean battery manufacturer LG Energy Solution has secured a major $4.3 billion contract to supply batteries to an undisclosed major corporation, with the deal running until July 2030. While the customer's identity is being kept confidential, reports have suggested it is the electric vehicle maker Tesla. The deal, one of LG's largest for lithium iron phosphate batteries, is expected to be linked to the company's new manufacturing plant in Michigan. This contract is seen as a significant move for LG Energy Solution as it expands its footprint in the U.S. energy storage market and competes with dominant Chinese players in the sector.</p>

          <p>Australia's headline inflation rate dropped to 2.1% year-over-year in the second quarter, its lowest level since March 2021 and below market expectations. This slowdown brings the figure to the lower end of the Reserve Bank of Australia's (RBA) 2%-3% target range. The cooling inflation, driven by a fall in transport costs that offset rises in housing and food, strengthens the argument for the RBA to implement another interest rate cut at its upcoming meeting. While the RBA has remained cautious, analysts believe this weaker-than-expected data, combined with a softer global growth outlook, provides sufficient evidence for further monetary policy easing.

CEO Sergio Ermotti noted that despite the strong results, client activity reflects a cautious "wait-and-see" attitude amid ongoing macroeconomic and geopolitical uncertainties, including U.S. tariff policies.
