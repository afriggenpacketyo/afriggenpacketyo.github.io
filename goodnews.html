          <p>HSBC is set to expand its investment banking operations to capitalize on the increasing demand for initial public offerings (IPOs) from companies in Asia and the Middle East, aligning with the bank's restructuring efforts to prioritize high-return markets like Hong Kong and India while exiting less profitable regions such as Europe and the US. Hong Kong currently leads the world in IPOs, followed by India's bourses ranking fourth and fifth, prompting HSBC to redirect growth towards Asia and intra-Asia opportunities. David Liao, HSBC‚Äôs co-CEO for Asia and the Middle East, emphasized Hong Kong's significance as a listing market and hub for international investors, driving the bank's decision to enhance its capacity to serve a growing wealth management clientele. This expansion signifies HSBC's strategic pivot to leverage the burgeoning IPO market in Asia and the Middle East. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>Nine veterans with PTSD traveled to Mexico for a psychedelic retreat organized by the Heroic Hearts Project, seeking relief from their combat-related trauma, using psilocybin and 5-MeO-DMT in traditional ceremonies. The retreat aimed to help veterans revisit traumatic moments and process emotions in ways that traditional therapies have not been able to achieve. While the Veterans Administration is beginning to fund clinical trials using psychedelics, many veterans are turning to retreats in countries where the drugs are legal. A year later, eight of the nine veterans reported improved symptoms and described the experience as "life-changing," highlighting the potential of psychedelics in treating PTSD.</p>

          <p>UK Home Secretary Yvette Cooper is still negotiating a funding deal with the Treasury days before the Spending Review, while other ministers, including the Housing Secretary, have reached settlements. Police budgets are expected to receive a real-terms increase over the next three years, but discussions are ongoing regarding the broader Home Office budget. Technology Secretary Peter Kyle stated that the police need to "do their bit" towards reforming public services, as the Chancellor faces pressure from all departments for additional funding. These last-minute talks precede a significant week for government, with potential implications for various departments and public services.</p>

          <p>Clayton Kershaw delivered a strong performance, earning his first win of the season in a 7-3 victory over the Cardinals, helping the Dodgers break a two-game losing streak. Kershaw pitched five innings, allowing just one run on six hits, with seven strikeouts and no walks, showcasing improved command and adjustments. The Dodgers' offense, which had struggled in previous games, provided support with seven runs, their highest total this month, with contributions from Max Muncy, Will Smith, and Tommy Edman. Kershaw's performance helps stabilize the Dodgers' rotation amid injuries, providing a much-needed boost for the team.</p>
