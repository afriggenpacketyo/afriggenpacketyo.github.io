          <p>Actress Kristin Davis recently shared that during her time on the 1990s drama "Melrose Place," a specific co-star consistently gave her the cold shoulder, refusing to even exchange morning greetings. While she did not name the individual, Davis noted the set was highly competitive, and this particular cast member, with whom she had no scenes, is now nice to her years later. This negative experience informed her own behavior on the set of "Sex and the City," where she made a point of being a "welcoming committee" for new actors to prevent them from feeling the same sense of intimidation she once did.</p>

          <p>Ukrainian anti-corruption agencies have arrested a member of parliament and several other officials, including National Guard members, in connection with a large-scale bribery scheme. The officials are accused of inflating the prices of state contracts for military drones and electronic warfare systems by up to 30%. President Volodymyr Zelensky affirmed a "zero tolerance" policy for corruption, a critical issue for Ukraine's bid to join the European Union. The arrests follow the recent restoration of independence to the country's anti-corruption bodies after a public backlash against a government bill that sought to limit their power.</p>

          <p>A decade after its launch, the Ethereum blockchain has evolved from a niche cypherpunk project into a foundational layer for the global financial system, now valued at over $420 billion. Initially a bare-bones network, it now underpins trillions in payments via stablecoins and is being integrated by major institutions like BlackRock, Deutsche Bank, and Robinhood for tokenized assets and funds. Co-founder Vitalik Buterin acknowledged the platform's staggering growth beyond initial expectations, while also warning of the risks of centralization as mainstream adoption accelerates. Experts note that institutions value Ethereum for its stability, dependability, and programmability, solidifying its role as the plumbing for a new generation of financial products.

        </div>
        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>A federal appeals court has largely maintained restrictions on immigration enforcement tactics in the Los Angeles area, affirming a lower court's finding that agents cannot base arrests solely on factors like race, ethnicity, or speaking Spanish. The ruling stems from a lawsuit over "roving" raids conducted by the Trump administration that led to protests and fear within the region's Latino community. The Ninth Circuit Court of Appeals agreed that such factors do not constitute reasonable suspicion for a stop under the 4th Amendment. The administration criticized the decision, stating that it undermines their efforts to remove criminals and that enforcement is based on illegal status, not race.</p>

          <p>Former Labour leader Jeremy Corbyn and fellow independent MP Zarah Sultana are in the process of forming a new left-wing political party but have yet to decide on a name. Rather than choosing a name themselves, they are asking their reported 600,000 registered supporters to suggest one, aiming for a title that reflects the party's core values. The new entity cannot field candidates until it is officially registered with the Electoral Commission, which has strict rules on party names. This unconventional approach aims to build a grassroots identity in a political landscape where traditional party labels are seen as losing their resonance.</p>

          <p>The Los Angeles Lakers' formal commitment to Luka Dončić, solidified by a three-year, $165 million contract extension, marks a clear shift in the team's focus and intensifies questions about the future of LeBron James. The article suggests that by officially making the 26-year-old Dončić the centerpiece of the franchise, the Lakers are navigating the transition to a post-LeBron era. With James under contract for only one more season, there is uncertainty about how he will adapt to no longer being the team's focal point. General Manager Rob Pelinka's comments were supportive but did not offer certainty that James would retire as a Laker.</p>

          <p>Comedian Harry Hill has stated that the death of his stepfather from cancer at age 54 was a key factor in his decision to leave his medical career for comedy. Hill, who was a qualified doctor, felt unsuited for the profession and recalled feeling "completely out of my depth" when breaking bad news to patients. Witnessing his stepfather's life cut short before retirement solidified his desire not to follow the same path, and he took a year off to pursue comedy in the early 1990s. He also reflected on the intense stress of writing his hit show "TV Burp," a weekly satirical review of television.</p>

          <p>Meta Platforms, a leading advocate for open-source AI with its Llama models, has indicated it will adopt a more "careful" strategy regarding future open-source releases. This shift in approach contrasts with China's current momentum in the open-source AI space, where companies like Alibaba and Zhipu AI are rapidly launching advanced models. Computer scientist Andrew Ng noted that China's competitive "Darwinian" ecosystem is helping it advance foundational models quickly, with the country's open models now rivaling top proprietary versions from the U.S. Meta's change in course reflects the evolving strategic landscape of global AI development.</p>

Her husband Adrian said he felt "betrayed" by the arrest, which occurred despite officials knowing his veteran status and his wife's family situation. Her case drew attention as an example of the Trump administration's "hyper-enforcement environment," which prioritizes arrests of non-citizens with pending removal orders, even those with strong family and military ties in the U.S.</p>

          <p>The long-standing mystery surrounding the death of a platypus gifted to Winston Churchill during World War II has finally been solved. The platypus, named Winston, died in 1943 during its voyage from Australia to the UK, with popular legend blaming the trauma of a nearby Nazi U-boat attack. However, recent archival research by university students and museum staff has revealed a more likely cause. By analyzing the platypus attendant's logbook, researchers found that the water and air temperatures on the ship climbed well above the safe threshold for the species as it crossed the equator, suggesting the animal essentially died from heat stress rather than shell-shock.</p>

          <p>China is increasingly using large-scale theme parks as a tool to boost its domestic economy and fuel consumer spending. The recent opening of the world's largest Legoland resort is the latest addition to a rapidly growing industry, with the number of amusement facilities nationwide expected to expand significantly in the coming years. According to the global association for the theme park industry (IAAPA), these attractions act as powerful economic drivers for local economies.
