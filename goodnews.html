          <p>The first lunar samples brought back to Earth in nearly 50 years have arrived in the UK on loan from China, marking a significant moment in space science collaboration. Professor Mahesh Anand, the sole UK scientist granted access, will lead a team at the Open University to analyze the dust, hoping to uncover insights into the Moon's formation and early Earth. Using lasers and other advanced techniques, they aim to validate the theory that the Moon originated from debris after Earth collided with a Mars-sized planet billions of years ago. The samples, collected by China's Chang'e 5 mission, represent a crucial opportunity for new discoveries in lunar science.</p>

          <p>Former Vice President Mike Pence is advising President Donald Trump against raising taxes on wealthy Americans, cautioning that it would negatively impact small business owners. Pence argues that the majority of those who file taxes of a million dollars are business owners who reinvest their money back into their companies. He is advocating for making the Trump-Pence tax cuts permanent to foster economic growth. Pence also praised Trump for his first term achievements, including securing the border and restoring the military, while expressing concern over deviations from a conservative agenda.</p>

The court ordered the state to continue using a court-ordered map that led to the election of Alabama's second Black congressman. The judges criticized Alabama's "deliberate decision to ignore" their previous order to create a second district where Black voters had an opportunity to elect their preferred candidate.

However, critics argue that the deal primarily mitigates recent tariff increases rather than establishing a broad free trade agreement. Mason suggests that the deal can be seen as a limited win for the Prime Minister, offering some positive news amid broader political challenges.</p>

The agreement offers relief for key UK industries affected by tariffs imposed by President Trump, but a 10% duty remains on most UK goods. While leaders from both countries hailed the deal, some analysts suggest it may not significantly alter trade terms compared to before Trump's tariffs.
