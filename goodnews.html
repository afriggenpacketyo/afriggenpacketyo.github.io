          <p>Businesses are leveraging a decades-old piece of legislation known as the "first sale rule" to minimize the impact of tariffs. This rule allows U.S. importers to calculate customs duties based on the initial sale price from the factory to a vendor, rather than the inflated price from an intermediary. The first sale rule gained renewed attention during the Trump administration's tariff regime, and requires that there be at least two sales involved, the sales must be carried out at arm's length by independent parties, there must be proof that the item was destined for the U.S., and there must be documentation of the first sale price. Companies are using this rule to reduce costs, especially in higher-value consumer goods and luxury products. </p>

          <p>China is set to launch the world‚Äôs first ship dedicated to salmon farming, the Su Hai No. 1, in June, marking a significant step in the country's efforts to enhance its seafood supply through offshore aquaculture. Built by Huangpu Wenchong Shipyard, the vessel is expected to produce up to 8,000 tonnes of salmon annually, reducing China's reliance on imported salmon. Unlike traditional offshore net-pen systems, the ship can relocate to avoid adverse conditions and includes an onboard processing facility for quick delivery to domestic markets. This initiative reflects China's emphasis on developing its ocean economy and strengthening food security amid global challenges.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>A Chinese study published in Cell Metabolism reveals that sleep facilitates the brain's repair mode by flushing out harmful oxygen-derived free radicals that accumulate during wakefulness. The research deciphers how hydrogen peroxide (H‚ÇÇO‚ÇÇ), a reactive by-product of metabolism, acts as a molecular signal to trigger sleep and restore balance in the brain. When H‚ÇÇO‚ÇÇ levels rise in sleep-regulating neurons, the brain switches to "repair mode," prompting restorative slumber. This breakthrough solves a long-standing mystery of why sleep is biologically essential and opens pathways for therapies targeting oxidative stress to combat sleep disorders.</p>

The author emphasizes the importance of remembering why Union soldiers fought and died, which was to preserve democracy and the promise of equality. Today, as democracy faces global threats, it is crucial to uphold the principles for which those soldiers sacrificed, including the rule of law and structured checks on power. The author calls for citizens to stand up against threats to these foundational principles and honor the legacy of those who fought for freedom.</p>

          <p>Japan has initiated the sale of government rice stockpiles through direct contracts, aiming to reduce soaring prices and achieve a target of 2,000 yen per 5 kilograms by early June. This move is designed to address public criticism of the government's handling of rising rice prices, which have doubled due to a poor harvest. The government plans to release around 300,000 tons of rice via contracts with major retailers, bypassing the traditional auction system.
