          <p>The White House asserted that Canada "caved" to President Trump after it reversed its plan to implement a digital services tax that would have affected U.S. tech companies. The reversal came after Trump threatened to terminate trade negotiations with Ottawa if the tax proceeded. A top economic aide suggested the U.S. will now pressure other countries to drop similar taxes as part of future trade talks. Following Canada's concession, trade negotiations have resumed, with both nations aiming to secure a new deal by July 21.</p>

          <p>President Trump is set to sign an executive order lifting some U.S. financial sanctions on Syria, a move intended to help stabilize the country following the ousting of Bashar al-Assad.

The article points to the recent Test match against India, where fast bowler Josh Tongue's success in quickly taking the last few wickets was a key factor in England's victory. It argues that failing to remove the tail can be psychologically and numerically damaging, citing a past Ashes loss as an example. The piece concludes that mastering this skill will be imperative for England's future success, particularly in the upcoming Ashes series.</p>

          <p>Major food delivery companies Deliveroo, Uber Eats, and Just Eat have agreed to strengthen security measures to prevent illegal work by asylum seekers and other unauthorized individuals. The agreement with the UK government follows reports of people illegally renting accounts to work as couriers. The companies will increase the use of facial verification and fraud detection technology to ensure only registered, eligible account holders can make deliveries. This move aims to curb illicit account sharing and brings the gig economy companies more in line with standard employment practices.</p>
