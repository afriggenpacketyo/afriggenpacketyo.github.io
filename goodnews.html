          <p>Alibaba's U.S.-listed stock jumped as much as 12% after the company reported better-than-expected net income for its first fiscal quarter, largely driven by a 26% year-over-year revenue increase in its cloud computing division. This growth is fueled by strong demand for artificial intelligence services, with AI-related product revenue maintaining triple-digit growth for the eighth consecutive quarter. While overall revenue slightly missed forecasts due to heavy investment in China's competitive "quick commerce" sector, investors were encouraged by the cloud unit's performance and the company's focus on developing new AI chips.

          <p>Shares of the "buy now, pay later" company Affirm surged over 12% after it reported fiscal fourth-quarter earnings that significantly surpassed Wall Street's expectations. The company posted a net income of $69.2 million, a stark reversal from a loss in the same period last year, and its key volume metric grew by 44%. CEO Max Levchin attributed the success to strong consumer spending and growth in partnerships with major retailers like Shopify and Amazon, which offset the loss of Walmart as a client. The company's optimistic guidance for the upcoming fiscal year further bolstered investor confidence. (not investment advice)</p>

The parade, which will be attended by 26 foreign leaders, commemorates the 80th anniversary of the end of Japanese colonial rule on the Korean peninsula.

          <h2>Kyle Schwarber's Historic Four-Homer Game Avoids Controversy in Final At-Bat</h2>

          <p>Philadelphia Phillies slugger Kyle Schwarber made baseball history by hitting four home runs in a single game against the Atlanta Braves, becoming just the 21st player to achieve the feat. He had a chance to hit a record-breaking fifth home run in his final at-bat but popped out against a position player, infielder Vidal Bruján, who was pitching in the blowout game. This outcome averted a potential controversy, as hitting a historic homer off a non-pitcher lobbing slow pitches would have likely been viewed as illegitimate by many. Schwarber's four home runs brought his season total to an MLB-leading 49.</p>

          <h2>India Utilizes Yoga as a Key Instrument of Global Cultural Diplomacy and Soft Power</h2>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Yoga, an ancient Indian practice, has become a significant tool for India's global soft power and cultural diplomacy. Spearheaded by Prime Minister Narendra Modi's government, the establishment of the International Day of Yoga on June 21 has elevated the practice into a symbol of India's cultural identity worldwide. Through international collaborations and educational programs, India promotes yoga not just as a wellness activity but as a means to foster people-to-people ties and project a non-threatening, civilizational influence. However, the practice faces criticism for over-commercialization and concerns that its association with Hindu nationalism could undermine its universal appeal.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Crystal Palace is reportedly working to sign two new central defenders before the transfer deadline, a condition that could pave the way for defender Marc Guehi's anticipated transfer to Liverpool. The Premier League champions are in talks for a £35 million deal for Guehi, who has indicated he will not sign a new contract with Palace. While Palace manager Oliver Glasner publicly insists Guehi must stay, the club is reluctant to lose him on a free transfer next summer. The club is actively pursuing replacements, including Toulouse's Jaydee Canvot and potentially Manchester City's Manuel Akanji.</p>

        </div>
        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>The U.S. Department of the Interior has drafted a proposal to significantly expand its list of "critical minerals," adding 51 commodities including copper, lead, and silicon. This strategic move is aimed at preventing potential supply-chain disruptions and reducing economic reliance on foreign sources, particularly China. The designation as a critical mineral can guide government investment, provide tax incentives, and expedite permitting for domestic mining and material recovery projects. This policy is expected to support the onshoring of production for key industries like semiconductors, automotive manufacturing, and solar panels, enhancing national and economic security.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>While the median sales price for condominiums in the U.S. has recently fallen, prospective buyers may not find them to be a bargain. An oversupply of condos, particularly in states like Florida and Texas, is driving prices down, but this is often counteracted by rising hidden costs. Increasing HOA dues, higher insurance premiums, and new building reserve requirements are adding significant monthly expenses for owners. Real estate agents advise that when these ongoing costs are factored in, the long-term affordability of a cheaper condo can be nearly the same as that of a more expensive single-family home.

          <p>German striker Nick Woltemade has completed a high-profile transfer from Stuttgart to Newcastle United for a reported record fee of €85 million. The 23-year-old, nicknamed "two-meter Messi-Musiala" for his combination of size and skill, has seen his stock rise dramatically after a successful season and a strong performance at the U21 European Championship. The move is a notable miss for Bayern Munich, which had bids for Woltemade rejected. His transfer is part of a larger trend this summer of top talent from Germany's Bundesliga moving to the financially powerful English Premier League.</p>
