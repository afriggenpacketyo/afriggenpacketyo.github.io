          <p>Novak Djokovic secured a decisive victory over British player Dan Evans in the second round of Wimbledon, winning in straight sets. The 38-year-old Serbian champion showcased a masterful performance, particularly with his serve, leaving Evans with few opportunities to gain momentum. This win marks Djokovic's 99th match victory at the tournament as he pursues a record-equaling eighth Wimbledon title. Meanwhile, British wildcard Jack Pinnington Jones was also eliminated after a straight-sets loss to Italy's Flavio Cobolli, ending his debut run.</p>

          <p>As the House prepared to vote on President Trump's major spending bill, Republican lawmakers largely dismissed threats from tech billionaire Elon Musk to support primary challengers against those who voted for it. Musk, a former Trump administration adviser, criticized the bill for its high cost and impact on the national debt. However, several GOP representatives stated they were focused on passing the president's agenda and were not concerned by Musk's warnings. They defended the legislation, highlighting its spending cuts and alignment with promises made to their constituents, asserting their unity with the president. (not investment advice)</p>

        </div>
        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>The U.S. labor market's expansion in June was significantly powered by hiring in the public sector, according to the Bureau of Labor Statistics. State and local governments added 73,000 jobs, accounting for about half of the total 147,000 nonfarm payrolls added during the month, with most new positions in education. This robust government hiring helped the overall job numbers exceed expectations. In contrast, the federal government continued to shrink its workforce, shedding 7,000 jobs, consistent with the Trump administration's focus on reducing the size of the federal bureaucracy.

          <p>The U.S. economy added 147,000 jobs in June, surpassing economists' expectations and demonstrating the labor market's continued strength amid economic uncertainty. The unemployment rate fell to 4.1%, its lowest point since February. Job growth was led by the government and health care sectors, while federal employment continued to decline due to administration-led cuts. Despite the solid report, economists anticipate a slowdown in the second half of the year, as Federal Reserve officials have indicated that trade tariffs could soon impact economic activity and inflation.

          <p>An analysis compares the potential earnings of depositing $10,000 into either a long-term certificate of deposit (CD) or a high-yield savings account. While current calculations show a high-yield savings account earning slightly more over 18-month to three-year terms, this assumes static interest rates. The article notes that CDs offer a fixed rate, providing protection against anticipated future interest rate cuts by the Federal Reserve. This makes locking in a high CD rate a potentially more secure strategy for savers concerned about market volatility. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>CNBC's Jim Cramer commented that the strong June jobs report validates Federal Reserve Chairman Jerome Powell's cautious approach to interest rates, despite pressure from President Trump for immediate cuts. With better-than-expected payroll growth and a falling unemployment rate, Cramer sees no justification for an imminent rate reduction. As the market reaches overbought levels, he and his Investing Club are considering trimming positions in high-performing stocks like Broadcom and major banks such as Goldman Sachs and Wells Fargo to lock in profits amid the strong rally.

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Throughout history, older generations have consistently expressed concern and criticism towards the youth, a trend documented in publications like The Atlantic for over a century. An article from 1925, for example, scrutinized young people for their dancing, drinking, and fashion, concluding they lacked emotion and intellectual curiosity. This pattern of viewing younger generations as a subject of study, often with condescension, has persisted through various eras. The challenge for writers is to document generational shifts with humility and nuance, avoiding stereotypes and recognizing young people as individuals navigating the unique circumstances of their time.</p>

He recounted an incident where he respectfully confronted a fan in a MAGA shirt, highlighting a belief in dialogue over division. Casey feels it would be a betrayal of the band's 30-year history to back down from its core beliefs in the current political climate.</p>
