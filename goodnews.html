          <p>The United States and China have announced a temporary agreement to cut reciprocal tariffs for 90 days, aiming to de-escalate the ongoing trade war that has been a source of market instability and economic concern.

The agreement, reached after talks in Geneva, also includes the suspension of additional countermeasures and the establishment of an economic and trade consultation mechanism for future discussions, reflecting a mutual desire to avoid economic decoupling.</p>

          <p>President Trump's tariffs, while expected to drive prices higher in the coming months, may currently be helping to tamp down inflation by raising global recession fears and crimping American spending. According to Ryan Sweet, chief U.S. economist of Oxford Economics, the import fees are contributing to weaker global oil demand and a recent drop in gasoline prices. This effect could make it more challenging for the Federal Reserve to justify holding off on interest rate cuts, especially if job growth weakens.</p>

The new legislation clarifies acceptable levels of condo insurance, but financial institutions often require full replacement value, creating a potential conflict.

He insists that cutting funding for Medicaid would result in Missouri workers and their children losing health care and rural hospitals closing, and that Republicans should instead focus on aiding working families by capping prescription drug costs and giving families with children a tax cut.</p>

          <p>Congressional Republicans are proposing a significant overhaul of the federal student loan program, aiming to simplify repayment options for future borrowers. The proposed changes would introduce a standard repayment plan with fixed monthly payments and a repayment assistance plan tied to income. While the new plans offer lower monthly payments for many borrowers, they also eliminate the $0 payment option and introduce a minimum payment of $10 per month, raising concerns about potential defaults for the lowest-income borrowers. This new plan would also eliminate President Biden's SAVE Plan, and borrowers should know that if they enroll in this plan, they cannot change plans later.</p>

          <p>Food scientists have discovered that cooling cooked white rice and pasta can transform digestible starch into resistant starch, a super nutrient with numerous health benefits. Resistant starch improves gut health, lowers inflammation, enhances insulin sensitivity, and aids in blood sugar management for people with diabetes. This process involves refrigerating the cooked grains for at least six to eight hours, causing the sugar chains to twist and branch in a way that resists digestion. Reheating the chilled grains gently, without recooking, preserves the resistant starch and its benefits.</p>

          <p>China and the US have agreed to a 90-day pause in their escalating trade war, with reciprocal tariffs to be lowered by 115%. The agreement, reached after talks in Geneva, aims to de-escalate trade tensions and prevent further damage to the global economy. Chinese duties on US goods will be lowered to 10%, while the US tax on Chinese goods will be lowered to 30%, with discussions on the fentanyl issue ongoing. The move has been met with positive reactions in financial markets, but caution remains regarding the resolution of structural contradictions between the two countries.</p>

          <p>The U.S. and China have agreed to significantly reduce tariffs imposed on each other's goods, after negotiators from both countries met over the weekend for trade talks in Switzerland. American levies on Chinese goods will drop from at least 145% to a base levy of 30% for an initial period of 90 days, while Chinese levies are set to fall from at least 125% to 10% on American goods. While welcome by importers, the tariff drops are temporary and could be pulled if talks between the two countries sour.</p>

          <p>The outlawed Kurdish group the PKK, which has waged a 40-year insurgency against Turkey, has announced it is laying down its arms and disbanding, following a call from its jailed leader, Abdullah Ocalan. Ocalan, who has been in solitary confinement since 1999, stated that there is no alternative to democracy in the pursuit of a political system. The decision was an important step towards a "terror-free Turkey", and the process would be monitored by state institutions, a spokesperson for President Tayyip Erdogan's AK Party said, according to Reuters news agency.</p>
