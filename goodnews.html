        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>In response to reciprocal tariffs imposed by the United States on imports from China, Beijing has taken steps to assist Chinese exporters in shifting their focus to the domestic market. One strategy involves encouraging the increased use of letters of credit (L/Cs) to ensure payment security and enhance credit for firms transitioning to domestic sales. Domestic L/Cs, issued by major Chinese banks, function similarly to international L/Cs, guaranteeing payment for goods and services within a one-year period. Unlike international L/Cs, domestic L/Cs can be used for both physical goods and services transactions, providing flexibility for Chinese businesses adapting to the trade war.</p>

          <p>Japan is seeking special treatment from the United States regarding tariffs, particularly on auto imports, as U.S. President Donald Trump has hinted at further increases. Ryosei Akazawa, Tokyo's top negotiator, expressed hope that a finalized bilateral deal would grant Japan exceptions from general tariff rules. Trump's threat to raise auto import tariffs aims to attract more investment in American manufacturing, potentially harming Japan's automotive industry. Akazawa is visiting Washington to make progress in negotiations before a possible meeting between Prime Minister Shigeru Ishiba and Trump at the upcoming G7 summit in Canada.

          <p>India is taking steps to develop its domestic rare earth supplies in response to China's restrictions on rare earth exports. Experts suggest that India could emerge as an alternative to China for partners like the U.S., but it will require increased public and private investment in the sector. Indian officials are evaluating how India Rare Earths, a government-owned company, can increase rare earth magnet production. This initiative follows calls for India to provide an alternative to China, which currently dominates the production and processing of rare earth elements crucial for various modern technologies.</p>

          <p>According to an expert at the World Gold Council, cryptocurrencies, including bitcoin and stablecoins, do not pose a threat to gold's role as a safe-haven investment. John Reade, the senior market strategist, asserts that long-term demand for gold remains strong due to concerns over US dollar assets, geopolitical tensions, and the economic impact of tariffs. He argues that cryptocurrencies move in tandem with equities, unlike gold, which acts as a hedge during market volatility. Reade dismisses the notion of digital assets as "gold 2.0," emphasizing their distinct characteristics and lack of comparison to gold. (not investment advice)</p>
