          <p>The technology company PlusAI has released performance results indicating significant progress toward its goal of launching factory-built autonomous trucks by 2027. The company reports reaching 86% safety case readiness and 98% autonomous miles, with plans to begin fleet trials later this year, initially focusing on the Texas Triangle freight corridor. This advancement in self-driving technology aims to address major challenges in the trucking industry, such as driver shortages, rising costs, and safety concerns. PlusAI is collaborating with major manufacturers to integrate its systems directly at the factory, which could accelerate mass production.</p>

          <p>Paramount has announced a partnership with Microsoft-owned Activision to develop, produce, and distribute a live-action feature film based on the highly successful "Call of Duty" video game franchise. The studio stated its commitment to honoring the brand's rich narrative and distinctive style, which has made it the best-selling video game series in the U.S. for 16 consecutive years. This deal is one of several major moves by Paramount since its merger with Skydance, as the studio continues to secure high-profile intellectual properties.

          <p>A 66-year-old man, Saul Gonzalez, has been arrested and charged with the 2005 murder of Valerie Laguna, a 26-year-old woman who was nine months pregnant when she was killed. Laguna's body was discovered in a cemetery in Cotulla, Texas, with the cause of death determined to be blunt force trauma to the head. The case remained unsolved for two decades until advanced forensic investigation techniques linked Gonzalez to the crime. The La Salle County Sheriff's Office emphasized their persistent efforts over the years, stating the arrest represents a significant step toward justice and healing for the victim's family and the community.</p>

          <p>A federal judge in San Francisco has barred the Trump administration from using National Guard troops and other military forces for civilian law enforcement activities in California. Senior District Judge Charles R. Breyer ruled that the deployment to quell protests over immigration raids violated the Posse Comitatus Act, a law that restricts the military's involvement in domestic policing. The judge warned that such actions could lead to the creation of "a national police force with the President as its chief." The ruling, which the administration is expected to appeal, strictly limits what the remaining 300 troops in Los Angeles can do.</p>

The deal is expected to immediately boost MPLX's distributable cash flow. The acquired assets in the Delaware Basin include over 200,000 dedicated acres, extensive gathering pipelines, and acid gas injection wells. MPLX plans to invest an additional $500 million to expand the system's sour gas treatment capacity, with projects underpinned by minimum volume commitments from regional producers.

          <p>New York Democratic Representative Jerry Nadler, 78, has announced his retirement from Congress at the end of his current term, after 34 years of service. Nadler stated that his decision was influenced by the need for "generational change" within the Democratic party, a lesson he said was highlighted by Joe Biden's unsuccessful presidential bid. As the former chair of the House Judiciary Committee, Nadler was a central figure in both of Donald Trump's impeachments. His retirement from a safe Democratic district in Manhattan is expected to set off a crowded primary for his successor.</p>

          <p>Zack Polanski has won the leadership election for the UK's Green Party, promising a more confrontational style and an "eco-populist" platform to challenge the Labour Party. Polanski, a member of the London Assembly, defeated two of the party's sitting MPs for the top job. He aims to move the party to the left and connect with voters on an emotional level, citing the communication skills of figures like Nigel Farage as a model. His election signals a potential shift in the party's strategy and raises the possibility of collaboration with a new left-wing party being formed by former Labour leader Jeremy Corbyn.</p>

          <p>Researchers with the USDA are experimenting with a novel, nonlethal method to protect cattle from gray wolves: using drones equipped with loudspeakers. The drones blast sounds like AC/DC's "Thunderstruck," clips from movies, and live human voices to scare the predators away from livestock in the California-Oregon border region. This creative approach is part of an effort to find ways for ranchers and the recovering wolf population to coexist, as conflicts increase. While the technique has shown initial success in interrupting wolf hunts, questions remain about its long-term effectiveness and whether wolves will become accustomed to the noise.</p>

          <p>With the Federal Reserve expected to cut interest rates soon, financial experts are advising savers to lock in current certificate of deposit (CD) rates before they decline. Although rates have likely peaked, they remain historically high, presenting a window of opportunity for maximizing returns. Experts suggest strategies such as CD laddering—staggering maturity dates to maintain flexibility—and considering no-penalty CDs, which allow for early withdrawal without a fee. They also caution against locking up too much cash in long-term CDs and stress the importance of shopping around for the best available rates. (not investment advice)</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Financial planners are pointing to a "golden opportunity" for investors to potentially pay 0% on long-term capital gains, thanks to new deductions in President Trump's latest tax legislation. The 0% bracket applies to investors with taxable income below certain thresholds, which have effectively been raised for 2025. This allows for "tax-gain harvesting," where profitable assets held for over a year can be sold without triggering taxes, which is useful for rebalancing portfolios or resetting an asset's cost basis for future tax savings. More investors may now qualify for this benefit. (not investment advice)</p>
