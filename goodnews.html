          <p>A joint US-China research team has pioneered an innovative method to launch millimeter-scale robots up to 1.5 meters high by leveraging the energy from collapsing vapor bubbles. This technique rapidly heats light-absorbing materials with a laser, causing water droplets to boil and create vapor bubbles. When these bubbles reach a critical size, they violently collapse, releasing a powerful force that propels the tiny jumpers. Scientists can control the light flow to dictate launch points and even enable these micro-devices to swim, showcasing cavitation as a highly efficient launching mechanism. This significant scientific advancement, detailed in the peer-reviewed journal Science, holds promise for various applications in micro-robotics.</p>

          <p>Legendary NFL coach Bill Belichick achieved his first victory in collegiate coaching, guiding the North Carolina Tar Heels to a decisive 20-3 win against the Charlotte 49ers. The Tar Heels demonstrated a strong rebound from their previous week's loss, with quarterback Gio Lopez scoring an early 51-yard touchdown pass and the defense effectively shutting down their opponents. This significant win marks a positive turning point for Belichick, who recently took over as head coach for Mack Brown, helping to quell some of the initial criticism and focus attention on the team's performance. The article underscores the importance of this early success in his new coaching role.</p>

          <p>Schools nationwide, exemplified by Yonkers Middle High School in New York, are increasingly implementing Yondr locked magnetic pouches as a solution to enforce cellphone bans in classrooms. This system mandates students to secure their phones in a pouch that can only be unlocked at specific school entry and exit points, with the primary goal of minimizing digital distractions and enhancing student engagement during lessons. While some students have welcomed the opportunity to disconnect and interact more, others have voiced skepticism, citing potential inconveniences or devising methods to circumvent the restrictions. This widespread adoption, despite considerable costs to school districts, underscores a growing national effort in education to cultivate more focused and phone-free learning environments.</p>

          <p>The Powerball jackpot has escalated to an astounding estimated $1.8 billion for Saturday night's drawing, positioning it as the second-largest lottery prize ever offered in U.S. history. This immense sum, which has an estimated cash value of $826.4 million before taxes, follows a drawing on Wednesday where no tickets matched all winning numbers for the $1.4 billion grand prize. The upcoming drawing represents the 42nd consecutive one without a jackpot winner, a streak that ties the game's record for such an occurrence. With odds of winning the top prize at 1 in 292.2 million, drawings continue to be held every Monday, Wednesday, and Saturday across 45 states, the District of Columbia, Puerto Rico, and the U.S. Virgin Islands.</p>

          <p>London-born Carlo Acutis, a teenager who passed away at the age of 15, is slated to become the Catholic Church's first millennial saint in an upcoming ceremony presided over by Pope Leo. Affectionately known as "God's influencer," Acutis utilized technology to create websites documenting miracles, intending to disseminate Catholic teachings, even though some who knew him did not perceive him as overtly devout. His canonization, which was initially postponed following the death of Pope Francis, was notably fast-tracked after two miracles were officially attributed to him. His remarkable story, including his body preserved in wax in Assisi and a dedicated shrine in London, seeks to invigorate and inspire faith among young people, making the concept of sainthood feel more accessible and contemporary.</p>

          <p>Dame Anna Wintour has transitioned from her role as editor-in-chief of US Vogue to become global editorial director, with Chloe Malle stepping in as the new head of editorial content. For nearly 40 years, Wintour was synonymous with Vogue's relevance, acclaimed for her innate ability to capture the cultural zeitgeist and broaden the magazine's cover subjects beyond traditional models to include pop stars, politicians, and more. Her partial departure now prompts significant questions about how the iconic print magazine will sustain its influence and appeal in an increasingly crowded and fast-paced digital media landscape, heavily shaped by platforms like TikTok and Instagram. Malle reportedly plans to focus on producing fewer, more themed and collectible issues to secure Vogue's future standing.</p>

          <p>The European Union is preparing for the gradual implementation of its new digital Entry/Exit System (EES), commencing on October 12, a system designed to meticulously track non-EU citizens entering and exiting the Schengen Area. This innovative system will supersede the current method of manual passport stamping, requiring first-time travelers from nations such as the UK to register their biometric information, including fingerprints and a photo, either at automated kiosks or with border officers. While the EES aims to bolster security and significantly streamline the travel process, there are notable concerns regarding potential for extensive queues and delays during its initial rollout, especially at high-traffic points like the Port of Dover and Eurostar terminals. The initial registration will remain valid for a period of three years, with details subsequently verified on each trip.</p>
