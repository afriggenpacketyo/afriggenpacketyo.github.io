          <p>The Chinese government has introduced a one-year program to subsidize interest costs on personal consumer loans in an effort to boost household spending and support the domestic economy. The plan, jointly released by the finance ministry and central bank, will cover one percentage point of annual interest on qualifying loans for purchases like cars and education. This policy is part of a wider government strategy to unlock consumer spending potential amid economic pressures. The central government will bear 90% of the subsidy cost, with provincial governments covering the remainder. (not investment advice)</p>

In his first at-bat as a visiting player, he was greeted with loud cheers and hit a two-run home run, a historic feat not seen in over 60 years. However, for his subsequent at-bats, the crowd's reception turned to boos, which Bregman said he expected and enjoyed.

          <p>AI search startup Perplexity has made an unsolicited bid to purchase Google's Chrome browser for $34.5 billion, a figure higher than the startup's own valuation. The move comes after a U.S. Department of Justice antitrust ruling suggested Google should divest Chrome to remedy its illegal monopoly in the search market. Perplexity, known for its AI-powered answer engine, stated that several investors have agreed to back the ambitious deal. This bid represents a bold strategic maneuver in the competitive AI landscape, aiming to acquire a critical gateway to the internet.</p>

          <p>While overall cancer survival rates have doubled in the last 50 years, a new study highlights a growing gap between different types of the disease. Cancers like melanoma now have 10-year survival rates above 90%, thanks to advances in treatment and detection. However, progress has been minimal for some of the deadliest cancers, including those affecting the pancreas, esophagus, and lungs, which still have survival rates below 20%. Experts are calling for a renewed focus on research and early detection for these harder-to-treat cancers to close this widening disparity.</p>

          <p>The UK's Driver and Vehicle Standards Agency will add questions about cardiopulmonary resuscitation (CPR) and the use of defibrillators to the driving theory test starting in early 2026. The initiative aims to equip the millions of learner drivers who take the test each year with basic life-saving knowledge, as drivers are often the first to arrive at the scene of an emergency. By incorporating this content into official learning materials, officials hope to improve survival rates from cardiac arrest, which can be as high as 70% with immediate intervention.</p>

          <p>The Los Angeles Department of Water and Power (DWP) has declared the water safe to drink for residents in Granada Hills and Porter Ranch, ending a weeklong "boil water" notice. The issue began when a faulty, decades-old valve became stuck, severely impeding water flow to approximately 9,200 households. After complex repairs, service was restored, and subsequent testing has confirmed the water's safety. The DWP is now advising residents to flush their pipes and appliances before consumption and will issue a $20 credit to affected customers.</p>

          <p>French President Emmanuel Macron has formally admitted that France used "repressive violence" against Cameroon during its fight for independence in the 1950s. In a letter to his Cameroonian counterpart, Macron acknowledged France's role in the deaths of independence leaders and the broader conflict, which cost tens of thousands of lives. This admission follows a 2022 historical report detailing France's use of forced displacement and support for brutal militias. The move is part of a broader, though sometimes criticized, effort by Macron's government to confront France's colonial past in Africa.</p>

          <p>Los Angeles police have arrested four teenagers suspected of being part of a gang responsible for a series of burglaries targeting high-profile residents, including actor Brad Pitt. The investigation began after Pitt's home was ransacked in June by masked thieves. Authorities state the suspects, alleged street gang members, also targeted other actors and professional athletes. The arrests highlight a trend of burglars using sophisticated methods, like surveillance and Wi-Fi jammers, to monitor and target celebrity homes when they are known to be away.</p>

          <p>The UK's National Police Chiefs' Council has issued new guidance encouraging police forces to disclose the ethnicity and nationality of suspects in high-profile and sensitive cases. The change is intended to combat misinformation and increase transparency, particularly in situations with significant public interest. This move follows several cases where a lack of official information was blamed for fueling false rumors and social unrest. Decisions will still be made on a case-by-case basis, but the guidance aims to create more consistency and public trust.</p>

          <p>A report from the UK's Transport Committee has recommended piloting a free bus pass scheme for individuals under 22 in England to improve access to work and education. MPs found that declining bus services and fares rising faster than inflation have become a barrier to opportunity, particularly for young people in rural areas. The report suggests that providing free bus travel, similar to an existing program in Scotland, could help address social exclusion and boost the economy. The recommendation comes amid concerns over infrequent or nonexistent services in some communities.</p>

          <p>The CEO of Rolls-Royce has stated that the company's plan to power artificial intelligence data centers with small modular nuclear reactors (SMRs) has the potential to make it the UK's most valuable firm. As the energy demands of AI technology skyrocket, Rolls-Royce is positioning its nuclear expertise as a key solution, having already signed deals with the UK and Czech governments. The engineering giant, which has seen its share price increase tenfold recently, believes its unique nuclear capability gives it a massive advantage in this emerging trillion-dollar market.
