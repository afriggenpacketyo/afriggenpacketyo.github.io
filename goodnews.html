          <p>Actress Helen Hunt, 61, shared her experiences with Hollywood's beauty standards and the "misery and shame" she felt early in her career. Hunt explained that she decided to move beyond those expectations, influenced by Sondra Ray's book, "The Only Diet There Is," which encourages loving every bite of food. She realized that internalizing societal pressures could ruin her life and chose to focus on self-acceptance instead. Christina Applegate also spoke about her struggles with eating disorders due to pressures from being portrayed as beautiful and sexy on "Married‚Ä¶ with Children."</p>

However, Docter mentioned that Jobs had a habit of calling employees, particularly producers, at any time of day or night, a practice he hopes not to emulate.

The author notes that some students and professors are already taking steps to limit technology use, such as banning electronic devices in classes and forming a "Luddite Club." The author suggests that Pomona, with its resources and small campus, is well-suited to experiment with tech-free initiatives, potentially differentiating itself from competitors. The author also notes the importance of teaching critical thinking and communication skills, which may be undermined by excessive technology use.</p>
