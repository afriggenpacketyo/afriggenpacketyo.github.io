          <h2>Chevron Adjusts Share Buyback Strategy Amid Oil Price Concerns</h2>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Chevron plans to decrease its share buybacks in the second quarter due to declining crude oil prices influenced by President Trump's tariffs and OPEC+ production plans. The oil major will repurchase $2.5 billion to $3 billion of its stock, less than the $3.9 billion bought back in the first quarter, although overall repurchase guidance for the year remains between $10 billion and $20 billion. An RBC Capital Markets analyst noted this decision reflects a proactive approach to a deteriorating macroeconomic environment, as Chevron's net income decreased by more than 30% compared to the previous year.

          <p>Vietnam is undergoing an administrative "revolution" spearheaded by new party chief To Lam, aimed at modernizing the state, jumpstarting economic growth, and consolidating political power. The reforms involve trimming bureaucracy, reorganizing the state, and eliminating around 100,000 public sector jobs. This overhaul is intended to address dysfunction created by the Party's anti-corruption campaign and strengthen political governance amid external pressures, but analysts suggest it may also serve to consolidate To Lam's power ahead of the Communist Party's 14th National Congress.</p>
