          <p>Oracle's shares experienced an 8% increase in extended trading after the company released its fiscal fourth-quarter results, surpassing Wall Street's expectations for both earnings and revenue. The company reported adjusted earnings per share of $1.70 against an expected $1.64, and revenue reached $15.9 billion, exceeding the projected $15.59 billion. Oracle anticipates cloud infrastructure revenue to rise by over 70% in fiscal year 2026, which is a significant jump from the 52% growth seen this past quarter. The company is also benefiting from Chinese online retailer Temu moving its infrastructure to Oracle's cloud. Optimism stems from strong financial performance and future growth projections in the cloud sector. </p>

Judge Michael E Farbiarz ordered the release to take effect on Friday, allowing the respondents time to seek appellate review if desired.

          <p>An opinion piece suggests that China remains the best hope for achieving peace in Ukraine, as the conflict drags into its fourth year. The recent launch of the International Organisation for Mediation in Hong Kong, with 32 founding signatories, is highlighted as a positive step. While peace talks have stalled and neither side seems capable of achieving victory, the article suggests that both Ukrainian President Zelensky and Russian Ambassador Nebenzia have shown some openness to negotiations. The author argues that NATO and the presence of US troops are not the answer, but that China could play a crucial role in facilitating a resolution. </p>

          <p>President Trump has stated that Chinese students are welcome at U.S. colleges and universities, seemingly reversing a recent policy that threatened to revoke their visas. This announcement, made as part of a brief outline of a trade deal with China, contrasts with earlier suggestions from Secretary of State Marco Rubio to increase vetting and potentially revoke visas for Chinese students. The potential policy shift has caused uncertainty at universities, which rely on international students for tuition revenue and campus diversity. Experts suggest that this reversal may be a negotiation tactic or reflect the importance of educating Chinese students in American values.</p>
