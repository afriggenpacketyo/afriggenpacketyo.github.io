          <p>House Republicans are considering a bill that would provide $1,000 to children born between January 1, 2025, and January 1, 2029, to be invested in financial markets through "Trump accounts." The article explains that the funds could be withdrawn later to pay for expenses like college or buying a house. While the initial investment is clear, tax experts are puzzled by the accounts, as they function much like a typical investment account rather than a tax-advantaged one.</p>
