          <p>A European court has ruled that the European Commission must provide a more detailed explanation for denying a journalist's request for text messages exchanged between Ursula von der Leyen and Pfizer's CEO during Covid-19 vaccine negotiations.

This ruling is considered a victory for transparency and accountability within the EU, highlighting that even ephemeral communications are subject to public scrutiny.

          <p>President Trump's upcoming visit to Qatar has stirred controversy due to the potential gift of a luxury jetliner from the Gulf emirate. This gesture, seen as a charm offensive by Qatar to improve its global image, has faced backlash from both Democrats and Republicans. Critics argue that accepting such a gift raises ethical and security concerns, especially given Qatar's past associations with funding terrorism. Despite the controversy, Trump defends the potential gift, underscoring the complex dynamics between the U.S. and Qatar, particularly in light of Qatar's role in mediating the Gaza conflict.</p>

          <p>China's strategic use of rare earth minerals in trade negotiations with the U.S. demonstrates its control over these critical materials. By moderately relaxing export controls on some rare earths as part of a trade truce, China signals its willingness to de-escalate tensions while maintaining its leverage. This approach allows China to manage the situation without provoking desperate measures from the U.S. that could lead to a break from China's dominance in the rare earth supply chain. China is adopting a kite-flying strategy: neither letting the string snap nor allowing the kite to soar out of control.</p>

          <p>Mortgage demand from homebuyers is showing signs of recovery, rising for the second consecutive week despite higher interest rates. The increase suggests that the growing supply of houses for sale is enticing potential buyers, outweighing concerns about economic uncertainty and tariffs. Purchase applications increased by 2% for the week and were 18% higher than the previous year. The growth in government purchase applications, favored by lower-income or first-time homebuyers, contributed to the overall recovery in mortgage demand.</p>
