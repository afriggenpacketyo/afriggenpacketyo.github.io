          <p>India is under increased pressure to conclude a trade deal with the United States before an August 1st deadline, after which certain tariffs are set to rise. A key sticking point remains U.S. demands for greater market access for agricultural products, which India has resisted to protect its farmers. Strategically, the U.S. views India as a crucial partner to counterbalance China's influence in the Indo-Pacific and global supply chains. India is also navigating its role within the BRICS bloc, using its position to maintain leverage in negotiations with Washington while pursuing other trade agreements.</p>

          <p>Former UFC middleweight champion Robert Whittaker is set to return to the octagon against Reinier de Ridder, nine months after a severe facial injury where his bottom teeth were caved in. Whittaker spoke about the unsettling injury, the subsequent surgery to install dental implants, and how his life has improved since. Now 34, the Australian fighter states that his primary motivation is no longer just regaining the title but setting an example for his children. He anticipates a tough fight against de Ridder, a former champion from another promotion known for his grappling skills.</p>

          <h2>Football Association Chief Opposes Expanding VAR's Role in Matches</h2>
          <div class="timestamp">2025-07-25 01:37:46 EDT</div>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Mark Bullingham, the chief executive of England's Football Association, has stated there is no need to expand the use of the Video Assistant Referee (VAR) system in football. Amid speculation that the sport's law-making body, IFAB, might consider using VAR for decisions on corner kicks or second yellow cards, Bullingham expressed concerns about increasing game interruptions. He believes the current implementation of VAR, which is limited to goals, penalty decisions, direct red cards, and mistaken identity, is in a "good place." This position suggests the FA will oppose any proposals to widen VAR's scope.</p>

          <p>This week's film releases offer a diverse slate, led by Marvel's "The Fantastic Four: First Steps," praised for its 1960s aesthetic and self-contained story that doesn't rely on prior MCU knowledge. Also reviewed is "Cloud," a Japanese psychological thriller from director Kiyoshi Kurosawa about an online reseller whose life spirals into paranoia and violence. For arthouse fans, "Diciannove" is an Italian coming-of-age drama about a conflicted teenager, and "Shoshana" is a historical thriller from Michael Winterbottom exploring complex relationships in 1930s Tel Aviv.</p>

          <p>Trading standards officials on the Isle of Man have confiscated more than 200 counterfeit Labubu dolls, a highly popular collectible toy. The seized items, found in two stores in Douglas, were determined to be fake and posed a serious choking hazard to children due to small parts that could easily detach. The government warned that the high demand for these dolls has led to a market flood of imitation products that often fail to meet safety standards. Officials are urging consumers to be cautious and to report any suspected counterfeit or unsafe products.</p>

          <p>As President Trump visits the U.K., an informal meeting with Prime Minister Keir Starmer is expected to focus on refining the recent U.S.-U.K. trade agreement. Key unresolved issues include the U.S. pledge to remove the 25% tariff on British steel and aluminum, which is contingent on sourcing verification to exclude Chinese materials. Additionally, Washington is pushing for the removal of the U.K.'s digital services tax, which affects American tech giants. While the U.K. is in a better negotiating position than the EU, these discussions are crucial for finalizing the pact and cementing economic ties.</p>

          <p>In a U.K. first, Wales will provide people with conditions like celiac disease with pre-loaded debit-style cards to purchase gluten-free food, starting later this year. This new system offers an alternative to the current model of obtaining specific food items on prescription from a pharmacy. The Welsh government aims to "de-medicalise" access to these necessary products, giving individuals more freedom and convenience. While the amount on the card will vary, the move is intended to help offset the significantly higher cost of gluten-free food, which can add over 35% to a person's grocery bill.</p>

Li stated that by jointly upholding free trade and multilateralism, China and the EU could act as a stabilizing force for the global economy amid rising protectionism.

          <p>USC football coach Lincoln Riley stated he feels "refreshed and recharged" heading into his fourth season, despite mounting pressure after a disappointing 7-6 record last year. He attributed his calmer outlook to having a more established program and a strong front office, allowing him to focus on fine-tuning rather than major fixes. Riley expressed confidence in the team's progress, particularly the improved depth and talent on the defensive line, and praised quarterback Jayden Maiava's development. He believes the team is close to turning its narrow losses from last season into victories.</p>

          <p>The U.K. and Australia have solidified their AUKUS defense partnership by signing a new 50-year treaty to support their respective nuclear-powered submarine programs. The agreement is expected to generate tens of thousands of jobs and could lead to £20 billion in British exports over the next 25 years. The move reinforces the trilateral security pact, which also includes the United States, at a time when Washington's long-term commitment has faced some uncertainty. The partnership is aimed at shaping collective security in the Indo-Pacific region amid growing concerns over China's military expansion.</p>

          <p>In response to devastating floods in Central Texas that claimed over 130 lives, CBS Texas is organizing the "Loud for Love" benefit concert to raise funds for those affected. The event, hosted by network anchors, will feature live performances from country artists like Coffey Anderson and will be held at a music hall in the Fort Worth Stockyards. The concert will be broadcast live, with viewers able to donate to the Salvation Army's flood relief efforts via a QR code.

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>A team of scientists from China's Lanzhou Institute of Chemical Physics has successfully made the first direct experimental observation of quantum friction between solid surfaces. While studying folded graphene, they discovered that friction did not always increase with thickness; in some cases, thicker folds slid more easily. This counterintuitive effect was traced to how bending the material altered electron movement, restricting energy loss as heat. The breakthrough finding, published in Nature Communications, could pave the way for developing ultra-efficient, low-wear nanoscale machines and devices by controlling friction at the quantum level.</p>

          <p>Princeton, Texas, located north of Dallas, has been named the fastest-growing city in the nation by the Census Bureau, with its population surging from 17,000 in 2020 to 37,000 last year. The boom is driven by affordable housing, with homes selling for significantly less than the county median. However, this explosive growth has created significant challenges, forcing the city to temporarily halt new construction to allow infrastructure like sewer lines, water, and roads to catch up. With another 13,000 homes already approved, Princeton is racing to manage its expansion, expecting to reach 100,000 residents within five years.</p>

          <p>A judge in Ontario has acquitted five former members of Canada's world junior hockey team of sexually assaulting a woman in a hotel room in 2018. In her ruling, Justice Maria Carroccia stated that she did not find the complainant's testimony to be "credible or reliable," and therefore the prosecution could not prove its case beyond a reasonable doubt. The case centered on whether the woman, who had consensual sex with one player, also consented to subsequent acts with the other four. The players, who are currently ineligible to play in the NHL, may have their status reviewed following the verdict.</p>
