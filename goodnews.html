        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>President Trump signed executive orders with the goal of expediting nuclear power plant construction by streamlining regulations and incentivizing development on federal lands. The orders direct the Nuclear Regulatory Commission (NRC) to revise its rules and expedite approval processes, aiming for decisions within 18 months, potentially including relaxed radiation exposure limits. The administration also seeks to quadruple the nation's nuclear power capacity by 2050 and rebuild domestic uranium supplies, however, skeptics worry about safety shortcuts and the loss of staff at the Energy Department's Loan Programs Office could hinder financing for new reactors. This New York Times article provides context for the nuclear industry's struggles with costs and regulatory hurdles.</p>

          <p>A two-month-old bear cub, found alone and starving in a California forest, is being raised by wildlife staff in bear costumes to minimize human interaction. The cub is recovering at the San Diego Humane Society‚Äôs Ramona Wildlife Center, where staff are using enrichment sessions that mimic maternal behavior. The goal is to prepare the cub for a future return to the wild, avoiding conflicts with humans. This Guardian article details the cub's rescue, recovery, and the efforts to keep it wild.</p>
