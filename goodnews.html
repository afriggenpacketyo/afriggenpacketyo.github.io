        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>A court ruling ordering the Tokyo government and the state to compensate Masaaki Okawara, president of Ohkawara Kakohki Co., and others for an unlawful investigation was finalized after the parties gave up appealing. The case involved a suspected unauthorized export of sensitive equipment, with authorities believing it could be used for biological weapons. The court awarded approximately 166 million yen ($1.15 million) in damages, acknowledging the arrests and indictments as illegal. The Metropolitan Police Department will review its investigation, prompted by a petition with over 40,000 signatures demanding an end to the appeals. The Ministry of Economy, Trade and Industry had cautioned the police about their interpretation of export control rules, but the police proceeded with the arrests, leading to a drawn-out legal battle. The court's decision highlights the importance of due process and accountability in law enforcement. </p>

          <p>A senior executive at iFlytek, a Chinese voice recognition solution provider, admitted that using mainland-produced semiconductors could delay the development of artificial intelligence (AI) models by three months. This delay is due to the need for additional computing resources compared to using Nvidia chips. Despite the challenges, iFlytek is committed to using domestic chips, including Huawei's Ascend 910B, to avoid the risk of losing access to imported chips.
