          <h2>Chevron Adjusts Share Buyback Pace Amid Oil Price Concerns</h2>
          <div class="timestamp">2025-05-02 13:47:07 EDT</div>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Chevron is reducing its share buyback program due to declining crude oil prices, which have impacted the company's first-quarter profits, as President Trump's tariffs and OPEC+ production plans contribute to market uncertainty. The oil major plans to repurchase $2.5 billion to $3 billion of its stock in the second quarter, lower than the $3.9 billion bought back in the first quarter, while maintaining its overall repurchase guidance of $10 billion to $20 billion for the year. Analysts suggest this adjustment reflects a cautious approach given the deteriorating macroeconomic environment. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>A recent blackout in Spain and Portugal sparked speculation about its cause, with some theories suggesting an oversupply of solar power was to blame. While it's true that solar energy provided around 60% of Spain's power at the time, the cause of the outage remains unconfirmed. Experts suggest a system failure, rather than a PV failure, was more likely the culprit, emphasizing that technical solutions are available to manage high proportions of renewable energy in the grid.</p>
