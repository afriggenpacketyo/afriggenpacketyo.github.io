          <p>The WNBA has launched an investigation into alleged racist comments made by fans during a game between the Indiana Fever and Chicago Sky, sparked by a flagrant foul committed by Caitlin Clark on Angel Reese. The league strongly condemns racism and hate in any form, and the WNBA Players‚Äô Association trusts the league to take swift action to ensure a safe environment for all. Both Clark and Reese have downplayed the incident, emphasizing it was a basketball play, while urging people not to use their names to push divisive agendas. The investigation aims to determine the validity of the allegations and take appropriate measures. </p>

The 40-year-old Briton said he savored the experience of racing in Italy for the first time as a Ferrari driver. Hamilton said the experience was reminiscent of watching Michael Schumacher race with Ferrari as a child. </p>

          <h2>Dermatologists Warn Against Leaving Razors in the Shower</h2>
          <div class="timestamp">2025-05-18 13:50:00 EDT</div>
        </div>
        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Dermatologists caution against leaving razors in the shower due to the moist environment fostering bacteria growth and causing rust, which can lead to skin irritation and infections. Instead, they recommend rinsing and drying razors thoroughly after use, storing them in a dry place outside the bathroom. Regular replacement of blades every five to seven shaves is also advised to prevent skin issues. Applying after-shave lotion and a gentle moisturizer after drying off is a good idea. </p>

          <h2>Dodgers Release Chris Taylor, Signifying End of an Era</h2>
          <div class="timestamp">2025-05-18 13:45:41 EDT</div>
        </div>
        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>The Los Angeles Dodgers released veteran Chris Taylor to make room for Tommy Edman's return, marking the end of Taylor's tenure with the team. Taylor's declining performance and the emergence of rookie Hyeseong Kim led to the decision, as the Dodgers prioritize younger, more productive players. The move signifies a shift in the team's roster and a departure from familiar faces from their 2020 and 2024 World Series-winning teams. Taylor, once a key player for the Dodgers, struggled to regain his form after elbow surgery. </p>
