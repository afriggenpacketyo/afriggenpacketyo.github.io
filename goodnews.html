          <p>The New York Times article analyzes how federal courts are resisting the Trump administration's aggressive deportation policies, emphasizing the fundamental principle of due process for immigrants. The Supreme Court recently rebuked the administration for providing inadequate notice to Venezuelan immigrants facing deportation. Legal scholars express concern that such judicial support was even necessary, highlighting the administration's disregard for constitutional protections. The article references several cases where courts have intervened to ensure immigrants have the opportunity to challenge their deportations, especially under the Alien Enemies Act.

          <p>President Trump announced he will be speaking with Russian President Vladimir Putin and Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy to discuss ending the war in Ukraine.

Trump has previously stated that progress on ending the war requires direct talks between him and Putin, while NATO leaders continue to call for a 30-day ceasefire. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>Romania is holding a high-stakes presidential election, pitting hard-right "sovereignist" George Simion against pro-EU liberal Nicusor Dan.
