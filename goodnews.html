          <h2>Ford Suspends 2025 Financial Guidance Due to Tariff Impact</h2>

          <p>Ford Motor suspended its 2025 financial guidance, anticipating a $2.5 billion hit from President Trump's tariffs, despite exceeding Wall Street's first-quarter expectations. The automaker aims to offset $1 billion of these costs, projecting a net impact of $1.5 billion. The suspension is attributed to potential industry-wide supply chain disruptions and the uncertainty surrounding tariffs, including retaliatory measures. This move follows GM's lowered 2025 guidance due to similar tariff-related expenses. Ford's action reflects broader concerns within the automotive industry regarding the economic impact of tariffs on imported vehicles and parts.</p>

          <p>China's e-commerce giants like Alibaba, JD.com, and Meituan are engaged in a new battle called "instant commerce," which combines online shopping with extremely fast delivery. Consumers in major cities can receive orders within an hour, sometimes for less than US$1 due to company subsidies. While China's advanced transport and warehousing infrastructure, powerful algorithms, and vast delivery workforce make this possible, investors are concerned about the intensified competition and the impact on company profits. The article highlights the challenges of balancing first-world infrastructure with potentially unsustainable spending in the pursuit of instant gratification for consumers.</p>

Bobby Peden, a SpaceX vice president, is the mayor, and Jenna Petrzelka and Jordan Buss, also SpaceX employees, are commissioners. Elon Musk began acquiring land in Boca Chica, Texas, a decade ago for SpaceX. The company has faced regulatory scrutiny and fines for environmental violations, and environmental groups have sued over harm to local habitat and endangered species.

          <p>Social Security cards will soon be available digitally, raising both optimism and concerns among experts. While digital access may be convenient, there are worries about access for those who are not tech savvy, particularly older or disabled individuals. The move toward digital Social Security identification is "certainly a step in the right direction," said Eva Velasquez, CEO of the Identity Theft Resource Center. If implemented properly, the digital Social Security numbers may provide more security than paper cards, she said. The new process will raise questions as to how to protect both the Social Security numbers and the devices on which they are accessed, she said.</p>
