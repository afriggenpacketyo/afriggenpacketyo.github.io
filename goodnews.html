          <p>A history enthusiast using a metal detector led archaeologists to the site of a lost medieval monastery in Derome, Sweden, after noticing a strange symbol on an 18th-century map. The surveyor had marked the location as "Klosterkullen," or "monastery hill," on a 1760 map. Ground-penetrating radar confirmed the presence of walls and structures beneath the surface, leading to the discovery of walls roughly 6.5 feet thick, believed to be the remains of pillar foundations. Experts speculate the monastery may be the original site of √Ös Abbey, dating back to the late 1100s.</p>

          <p>Top tennis players are increasingly expressing concerns about the physical demands of the tennis calendar, citing burnout and shortened careers. Alex de Minaur attributed his early French Open exit to feeling burned out, while Jack Draper raised fears about the mental toll on players. Iga Swiatek also finds the current demands exhausting, and Casper Ruud criticized the rankings "rat race."

          <p>A new study indicates that parents in Europe find greater meaning in life compared to those without children, but they often experience lower life satisfaction. The research, based on data from the European Social Survey, reveals that this satisfaction level is influenced by factors such as living situation and family policy. Mothers, in particular, tend to report lower life satisfaction than fathers, and Scandinavian countries show smaller differences between parents and child-free individuals due to robust childcare, financial support, and parental leave policies. The study highlights the importance of societal support in easing the challenges of parenthood.</p>
