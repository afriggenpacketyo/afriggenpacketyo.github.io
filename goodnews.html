It suggests that farsighted protest leaders should maintain law-abiding demonstrations, as the rule of law is a precious safeguard, and street violence gives Trump the ability to fight his enemies with the law on his side.</p>

          <p>According to a psychologist specializing in couples, the most common reasons for fights include tone of voice or attitude, family relations, household chores, and communication styles. A sour tone often signals contempt, a major predictor of divorce, while arguments about family reflect misalignments and unmet needs. Conflicts over chores usually stem from an uneven distribution of labor and a lack of recognition for the "invisible load." Ineffective communication can derail conversations, leading to defensiveness and criticism. The article suggests strategies for addressing each of these issues to improve relationship dynamics.</p>

Students are advocating for more tech-free classes and creating spaces where electronic devices are banned, while professors are limiting device use in their classrooms. The author argues that small residential liberal-arts colleges are particularly vulnerable to the pervasiveness of technology, as it undermines the closely knit community and in-person learning that these institutions prioritize. The article suggests that Pomona could differentiate itself by formalizing experiments such as tech-free dorms and dining halls.</p>

          <p>The US National Guard, a component of the US Armed Forces Reserve, is primarily deployed for disaster relief and internal security but can also support military operations abroad. The Guard consists of the Army National Guard and the Air National Guard, with approximately 419,000 reservists. When deployed within states, the governor typically commands the Guard, but the US president serves as commander-in-chief during nationwide deployments. The National Guard's duties range from responding to natural disasters to ensuring security during protests and supporting military operations overseas, and it can be activated by both state governors and the president.</p>

          <p>A state-backed think tank in China has presented the country‚Äôs "four core principles" as a framework for addressing disputes in the South China Sea. The Xinhua Institute emphasized resolving disputes through consultation, managing differences through co-management, achieving mutually beneficial outcomes, and opposing external interference. China formally presented its blueprint for cooperation in the South China Sea in 2002 through an agreement with Asean, but Beijing‚Äôs expansive claims over the waters are contested by several member states, including Vietnam, Malaysia, and the Philippines.</p>
