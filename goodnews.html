          <p>A scenic 10-mile stretch of Angeles Crest Highway has reopened to the public just before Labor Day weekend after a multi-year closure. The road, a key route for accessing hiking trails in the Angeles National Forest, was shut down due to severe damage from storms in 2022-23 and the 2024 Bridge fire. Costing nearly $8 million, the repairs included new guardrails and drainage systems, which officials hope will also reduce trail overcrowding. While celebrated by the hiking community, some express concern that the holiday weekend reopening coincides with extreme fire danger warnings for the area.</p>

          <p>A recent surge in Chinese stocks, which pushed the Shanghai Composite Index to a 10-year high, is attracting renewed interest from both domestic and overseas investors. Market analysts suggest the rally could be sustained by several factors, including Chinese savers rotating out of low-yield fixed-income products and government support for technological innovation. Global asset managers are becoming increasingly optimistic about the combined $20 trillion onshore and offshore equity markets, viewing Chinese stocks as offering "undervalued innovation" in sectors like AI and advanced manufacturing.

          <p>A federal appeals court has blocked the Trump administration's plan to terminate Temporary Protected Status (TPS) for approximately 600,000 Venezuelans living and working in the U.S. The court upheld a lower court's ruling, finding that the plaintiffs were likely to succeed in their claim that the administration overstepped its authority in ending the protections. This decision provides temporary relief for the affected individuals, allowing them to maintain their legal status while the broader court challenge against the administration's actions continues. The Department of Homeland Security condemned the ruling.</p>

          <p>Rapper Cardi B took the witness stand in a civil trial in Los Angeles, where she is being sued by a security guard for assault and battery. She denied physically attacking the guard during a 2018 altercation, testifying that while there was a verbal fight, it never became physical. Her animated testimony and colorful responses during cross-examination have gone viral on social media, with clips of her facial expressions and comments about her wigs and fingernails being widely shared.

          <p>A charity program is successfully helping teenagers with anxiety and poor school attendance by pairing them as mentors with toddlers from a local nursery. The responsibility of caring for a younger child helps the teens develop confidence, communication skills, and a sense of accountability. Participants in the program have shown significant improvements in school attendance, with one student's attendance more than doubling. The initiative, run by the charity Power2, aims to re-engage young people with their education by providing them with a positive role model experience and a sense of purpose.</p>

          <p>As Prince Harry prepares for a visit to the UK, there are tentative signs of a potential reconciliation with his father, King Charles III. Although the King will be at Balmoral in Scotland, his regular travel south for cancer treatment creates opportunities for a meeting. Recent developments, including a meeting between their respective communication teams and the conclusion of Harry's security lawsuit against the government, suggest a slight shift in mood. However, significant trust issues remain a major hurdle, and the deep rift between Harry and his brother, Prince William, shows no signs of healing.</p>

          <p>Pennsylvania State Representative Malcolm Kenyatta has embarked on a 105-mile, five-day solo march from Philadelphia to the state capitol in Harrisburg. The march is a protest against severe budget cuts to SEPTA, the region's public transit authority, which provides essential services to students, workers, and the elderly. Kenyatta is using the protest to draw attention to the funding crisis, which he attributes to the inaction of Republicans in the state legislature. He aims to highlight the growing impact of the service cuts on working people across the region.</p>
