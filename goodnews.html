          <p>Pavel Durov, the founder of Telegram, intends to divide his estimated $13.9 billion fortune among the more than 100 children he claims to have fathered. Durov stated that all his children will have equal rights to the inheritance, which they will only be able to access after 30 years, ensuring they live normal lives and build their own independence. Durov also addressed criminal charges he faces in France, where he was arrested last year for allegedly failing to properly moderate Telegram to reduce criminality, charges which he denies. He believes his work defending freedoms has earned him enemies, including powerful states, making a will necessary. </p>

Early detection and treatment, particularly before age seven, are crucial for effective correction of the condition.

          <p>Chinese scientists have created an edible, washable protein-based coating that can extend the shelf life of fruits by 2.5 times. The coating reduces moisture loss and microbial growth and has been tested on 17 varieties of whole and cut fruits. The low-cost coating delays rot by almost a week or more, costing just 9 US cents per kilogram of fruit. This new strategy is as effective as existing preservation methods but reduces carbon dioxide emissions and the potential for toxicity, offering a promising solution to global food waste.</p>
