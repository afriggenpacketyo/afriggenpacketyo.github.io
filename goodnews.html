The move aligns with the U.S. government's strategy to reduce dependency on China for these critical minerals, which are essential for manufacturing electric vehicles, weapons systems, and semiconductors. Following the announcement, the company's shares surged by approximately 17% as investors reacted positively to the potential for domestic mineral independence.</p>

          <p>King Charles visited Manchester to meet with survivors and emergency service members involved in the deadly attack on the Heaton Park synagogue earlier this month. The monarch expressed his deep sadness over the incident, which resulted in the deaths of two people, and praised the "heroes" who helped stop the attacker. The visit was seen as a significant gesture of support for the Jewish community, with one survivor noting that while the attack showed the worst of humanity, the subsequent support has shown the best.</p>

          <p>White House economic advisor Kevin Hassett stated that the ongoing government shutdown is "likely to end sometime this week," suggesting moderate Democrats may soon agree to a short-term funding resolution. The impasse stems from a dispute over Democratic demands to include an extension of Affordable Care Act subsidies in any funding bill. Hassett warned that if a resolution is not reached, the Trump administration might consider "stronger measures" to compel Democrats to negotiate, while Republican leaders continue to blame the shutdown on Senate Minority Leader Chuck Schumer.</p>

          <p>After being forced into exile by the Taliban's return to power in 2021, the Afghanistan women's national football team is set to play its first official matches. The tournament, originally planned for the UAE, was relocated to Morocco at the last minute due to visa issues, creating a tight schedule for the players. Now rebranded as "Afghan Women United," the team's return is a significant moment, with players stating they are representing all Afghan women who have been silenced and denied their basic human rights.</p>

          <p>An executive coach and author outlines five practical strategies for effectively working with a "control freak" boss without becoming exhausted or frustrated. The advice includes presenting rough drafts to invite early input, reinforcing the boss's authority with deferential language, and proactively oversharing information to satisfy their need for oversight. Other techniques involve preempting criticism by asking for initial thoughts and using the "yes, and..." method to validate their feedback while still asserting one's own ideas, thereby conserving energy and improving the working relationship.</p>

          <div class="timestamp">2025-10-20 11:00:02 EDT</div>
        </div>
        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Electric vehicles generally lose value more quickly than their internal combustion engine counterparts, depreciating by an average of 13% more over a five-year period. Key factors contributing to this trend include higher initial government and manufacturer incentives, which lower the baseline for resale value, and the rapid pace of technological advancement in battery range and features. However, this trend may be shifting as a larger volume of more affordable, mainstream used EVs is expected to enter the market, potentially stabilizing their long-term value.</p>

          <p>While Chapter 7 bankruptcy can offer a path to eliminating most unsecured debts, approval is not guaranteed for everyone and depends on several key factors. The primary obstacle is the "means test," which compares an individual's income to their state's median; those earning above the median must undergo a more detailed analysis of their disposable income. Other requirements include completing credit counseling and avoiding suspicious financial activities before filing, such as running up luxury purchases, which can lead to denial of the case.</p>
