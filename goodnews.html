          <p>Peloton reported a surprise profit in its fiscal fourth quarter, causing its stock to rise, yet simultaneously announced plans to lay off 6% of its workforce. This move is part of a broader strategy under new CEO Peter Stern to cut operating expenses by an additional $100 million by fiscal year 2026. While sales were down slightly from the previous year, the company exceeded Wall Street's earnings expectations and generated significant free cash flow. The restructuring aims to stabilize the business and position it for long-term growth amid challenges like new tariffs.</p>

          <p>Average interest rates for home equity lines of credit (HELOCs) have fallen to 8.13%, their lowest point since May, making them an increasingly attractive borrowing option. With the Federal Reserve expected to cut rates soon, the variable rates on HELOCs could decrease further, offering a potential advantage over fixed-rate home equity loans. Compared to high-interest credit cards and personal loans, HELOCs currently present one of the most affordable financing methods for homeowners. However, prospective borrowers should weigh the benefits against the risks of using their home as collateral. (not investment advice)</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Market strategists suggest that while President Trump's expansive tariff policies have created a tricky investment environment, opportunities still exist for discerning investors. Although long-term investors are often advised to ignore short-term volatility, tactical adjustments can be made by focusing on sectors less exposed to trade disputes, such as financials and utilities. Exchange-traded funds (ETFs) focused on non-physical assets like cryptocurrencies or domestically focused industries like nuclear energy have performed well. Experts note that while tariffs impact global supply chains, their effects must be weighed alongside other administration policies. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>The probability of Federal Reserve Governor Christopher Waller becoming the next Fed chair has surged on prediction markets, crossing 50% on Kalshi for the first time. This spike followed reports that President Trump's advisors are impressed with Waller's data-driven approach to monetary policy. Nominated by Trump in 2020, Waller has recently expressed a more dovish stance, dissenting from the Fed's decision to hold rates steady. His rising odds have surpassed previous front-runners Kevin Warsh and Kevin Hassett, signaling a significant shift in speculation about the central bank's future leadership.</p>
