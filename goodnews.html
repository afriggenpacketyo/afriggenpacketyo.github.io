          <p>As college graduates transition into adulthood, financial experts emphasize the importance of starting retirement savings early to harness the power of compound interest. Setting up a consistent investing routine, even with small monthly contributions, can lead to significant long-term financial stability. Experts recommend investing in low-cost index funds and exchange-traded funds (ETFs) that track broad market indexes for diversification. It is crucial to understand one's risk tolerance and avoid making impulsive decisions based on market volatility, focusing instead on the principle that time in the market is more beneficial than timing the market.

          <p>President Donald Trump defended his approach to trade negotiations, dismissing criticism that he backs down from tariff threats, a strategy dubbed the "TACO trade." Trump asserted that his tariff threats have spurred trade talks with the European Union, emphasizing that these actions are part of a negotiation strategy rather than a sign of weakness. Stocks initially fell following Trump's threat of tariffs on the EU, but rallied after he delayed the deadline, which Trump credits to jumpstarting trade talks between the U.S. and the EU.</p>

          <p>President Donald Trump's executive orders on nuclear power could lead to the deployment of small modular reactors (SMRs) in the U.S. by late 2030, according to GE Vernova CEO Scott Strazik. Trump's order directs the Nuclear Regulatory Commission (NRC) to expedite decisions on new nuclear plant applications. Strazik believes this could result in approvals to begin building SMRs by 2027, potentially adding these reactors to the U.S. nuclear fleet in the early 2030s. GE Vernova recently received approval to deploy its BWRX-300 reactor in Ontario, Canada, and has an application pending with the NRC to build a reactor in Tennessee.</p>

          <p>Toyota Motor is targeting significant growth in plug-in hybrid electric vehicles (PHEVs) as automakers navigate regulatory uncertainty and slower-than-expected adoption of all-electric vehicles. The company plans to increase PHEVs from 2.4% of its U.S. sales volume to roughly 20% by 2030. This strategy aligns with the California Air Resources Board's Advanced Clean Cars II rule, which requires automakers to exclusively sell zero-emissions vehicles in the state by 2035. Toyota's focus on PHEVs provides a stepping stone for consumers hesitant to fully commit to electric vehicles while meeting emissions regulations.</p>
