          <p>President Trump signed an executive order directing the Labor Department to review rules governing 401(k) plans. This move could allow alternative investments like cryptocurrencies, private equity, and real estate to be included in retirement accounts, a long-sought goal for the alternative asset industry. While proponents see this as expanding investment opportunities, it also introduces new risks for retirement savers due to the higher fees and lack of transparency associated with these assets. The news prompted a rise in Bitcoin's value and private equity stocks. (not investment advice)</p>

Scott also contrasted his views on free markets and capitalism with the rise of socialist beliefs, which he argued "corrodes the soul."

The festival featured new work from artists like rapper Slick Rick and producer Mara Brock Akil, creator of the Netflix series "Forever." The event serves as a sanctuary and a platform for a wide variety of Black-centered stories at a time when diversity initiatives face backlash in Hollywood and corporate America. It fosters a sense of community and relaxation, allowing creators to connect with audiences who see and celebrate their work.</p>

          <p>OpenAI has officially released GPT-5, the latest version of its widely used AI model, which CEO Sam Altman claims offers "PhD-level" expertise on any topic. The new model is described as smarter, faster, and more useful, with significantly improved reasoning capabilities and the ability to create entire software programs. While OpenAI highlights its advancements, some experts express skepticism, suggesting the announcement may be more marketing hype than a revolutionary leap and noting the ongoing gap between AI capabilities and effective regulation. The model is being rolled out to all users.</p>

          <h2>Evaluating the Worth of High-Yield Savings Accounts Ahead of Potential Fed Rate Cut</h2>
          <div class="timestamp">2025-08-07 14:59:16 EDT</div>
        </div>
        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>With a Federal Reserve interest rate cut looking increasingly likely in September, savers are questioning the value of opening a high-yield savings account. Despite the prospect of falling rates, these accounts remain a compelling option because their current rates, though slightly lower than their peak, are still substantially higher than those of traditional savings accounts. Furthermore, any rate reductions are expected to be small and gradual, meaning high-yield accounts will likely offer superior returns for the foreseeable future while providing crucial flexibility in an unpredictable economic climate.

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Archaeologists at Pompeii have uncovered new evidence showing that survivors of the 79 AD Mount Vesuvius eruption returned to the devastated city. It is believed that some former residents, along with others seeking shelter, established an informal settlement amid the ruins. They lived in "precarious conditions" without the infrastructure of the former Roman city, converting the ground floors of old homes into cellars with ovens and mills. This discovery challenges the long-held focus on the city's destruction, painting a clearer picture of a resilient, if struggling, community that reoccupied the area for centuries.</p>

          <p>Connected fitness company Peloton announced a surprise profit in its fiscal fourth quarter, causing its stock to rise. The positive result was driven by better-than-expected sales and significant cost-cutting measures. However, the company also revealed plans for another round of layoffs, impacting 6% of its staff, as it aims to reduce operating expenses by an additional $100 million. New CEO Peter Stern outlined a growth strategy that includes opening smaller "micro-stores," expanding into wellness categories beyond fitness, and improving the profitability of its hardware.

Analysts widely anticipate a "beat-and-raise" quarter, where the company exceeds earnings expectations and raises its future guidance. The stock has already gained nearly 34% year to date.

          <p>U.S. Commerce Secretary Howard Lutnick has indicated that a 90-day extension of the current tariff truce with China is probable. This is the most direct signal from a U.S. official about extending the deadline, which is set to expire next week. The statement was made as new, broad-based U.S. tariffs on imports from approximately 90 other countries took effect. Since April, the U.S. has significantly increased tariffs on Chinese goods, prompting retaliatory measures and export controls from Beijing, creating ongoing global trade tensions.</p>

Brigadier General John Lubas said the soldiers "immediately raced towards and attacked" the suspect upon hearing gunfire, with one jumping on top of the shooter to restrain him. Others provided critical first aid to the wounded before paramedics arrived. The suspect, a 28-year-old Army sergeant, is in custody, and all victims are expected to recover from their injuries.</p>
