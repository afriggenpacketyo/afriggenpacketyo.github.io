          <div class="timestamp">2025-07-18 00:05:59 EDT</div>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>In what is being hailed as a victory for the Trump administration, Congress has passed a $9 billion rescissions package, sending it to the president's desk. The legislation cuts funding for the U.S. Agency for International Development and the Corporation for Public Broadcasting, which Republicans celebrated as a step toward defunding "woke" initiatives. The process was marked by intense partisan debate, with Democrats attempting to force votes related to the Jeffrey Epstein case, a move Republicans characterized as a political tactic. This marks the first successful use of the rescissions process in over two decades.</p>

          <p>Returning to the Hollywood Bowl for the first time in seven years, Colombian music star Juanes delivered an emotional message to the Latino community of Los Angeles. He spoke about the fear caused by recent immigration raids under the Trump administration and called for unity among the diverse population of the city. During the concert, he performed songs from his new album as well as classic hits, and surprised the audience by inviting local band LA LOM and a mariachi group to join him on stage. The performance was a celebration of Latino culture and resilience.</p>

          <h2>Author Reflects on Adulthood and Uncertainty Upon Turning 35</h2>
          <div class="timestamp">2025-07-18 00:00:42 EDT</div>
        </div>
        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>In a personal essay, writer Alexander Hurst reflects on turning 35 and the realization that adulthood is a continuous process of "winging it" rather than reaching a state of complete self-assuredness. Using the French comedy series 'Bref' as a narrative anchor, he explores themes of evolving relationships, regret, and the immigrant experience of forging a new identity. The author concludes that while he lacks definitive answers, he embraces the journey of life, finding meaning in relationships and the courage to confront difficult questions in a world that feels increasingly chaotic.</p>

          <p>A farmer in China's Anhui province has captured local attention by building and successfully piloting his own 7-meter submarine. Fascinated by invention since childhood and inspired by a state television program, he secretly used 5,000 yuan (US$700) in savings to buy steel plates and an engine. He constructed the vessel while his wife was away, fulfilling a lifelong dream of creating a machine that could travel underwater. The story highlights a unique and personal tale of ingenuity and determination in rural China.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Japan's core inflation rate cooled to 3.3% in June, down from a 29-month high, a figure that aligned with economists' expectations. The easing was partly attributed to a moderation in rice price increases after the government released stockpiles, though prices remain elevated. Despite the cooling, this marks the 39th consecutive month that inflation has stayed above the Bank of Japan's 2% target, complicating the economic outlook amid concerns about yen depreciation and potential U.S. tariffs.

          <p>Fox News host Jesse Watters acknowledged on-air that his program made a mistake in its reporting on a phone conversation between California Governor Gavin Newsom and President Trump. The admission follows a $787-million defamation lawsuit filed by Newsom, who claimed Watters lied about the timeline of the call to politically harm him. While Watters stated, "I'm sorry," he maintained that Newsom's social media post was "confusing and unclear." Newsom's office responded to the remarks by indicating the lawsuit will proceed.</p>

The announcement comes amid ongoing controversy in the entertainment industry, where the use of AI has sparked fears of it replacing human artists and was a key issue in the 2023 Hollywood strikes.</p>

          <p>The White House has announced that President Trump was diagnosed with chronic venous insufficiency, which they described as a common and benign vein condition. The disclosure was made to address public speculation that arose from recent images showing the president with swollen lower legs and a bruised hand. A letter from the presidential physician accompanying the announcement stated that Mr. Trump "remains in excellent health" and that the condition is not a serious health threat, particularly for individuals over the age of 70.</p>

          <p>This article analyzes President Trump's announcement that he secured a deal for Coca-Cola to start using "REAL Cane Sugar" instead of high-fructose corn syrup. The piece frames the move as a political gesture to appeal to his base and health-conscious voters like Robert F. Kennedy Jr., who praised the change. However, it points out that from a health perspective, the switch is largely meaningless, as scientific analyses show cane sugar and high-fructose corn syrup have nearly identical metabolic effects and are both major contributors to obesity and diabetes.</p>
