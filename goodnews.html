          <div class="timestamp">2025-05-26 07:00:56 EDT</div>
        </div>
        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Businesses in Britain and the US are reportedly "rebranding" diversity, equity, and inclusion (DEI) initiatives to sidestep potential political backlash. This shift involves reframing policies under terms like "wellbeing," "belonging," and "culture," with some US-headquartered firms scaling back public celebrations of inclusion work. Experts suggest this trend reflects a broader concern that DEI has become a politically charged term, leading organizations to disguise their efforts to promote talent and address inequalities. While a full-scale rollback is considered unlikely in the UK due to legal protections, some companies are discouraging employees from speaking out on DEI-related issues.</p>

          <div class="timestamp">2025-05-26 07:00:00 EDT</div>
        </div>
        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>The article explores the concept of viewing the Earth and its elements, such as rivers and glaciers, as animate beings with inherent rights. Referencing Robert Macfarlane's book, "Is a River Alive?", the piece discusses the Rights of Nature movement and its efforts to grant legal protections to natural entities. It argues that recognizing the aliveness of what we have been taught to think of as inert matter demands, above all else, time and attention. The author contends that this shift in perspective is crucial for addressing the climate crisis, moving beyond a purely scientific approach to embrace a more holistic understanding of our relationship with the environment.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Despite portents of democratic erosion during Donald Trump's second term, America's democracy exhibits resilience due to several exceptional traits. These include a robust network of advocacy groups, a powerful and independent judiciary, a constitutional system that makes executive preferences hard to entrench, a diverse and free private press, a federal system of government, and a uniquely speech-protective legal tradition. These factors provide checks and balances against potential authoritarian overreach, empowering resistance and safeguarding fundamental rights. The observations do not encourage complacency or diminish the harm already caused by Trump‚Äôs authoritarian moves, but they do give hope.</p>

          <p>Japan has commenced sales of government rice stockpiles through direct contracts, aiming to reduce soaring prices. The move follows a pledge by the newly appointed farm minister to lower prices to approximately 2,000 yen ($14) per 5 kilograms by early June. This action addresses criticism that the government has been ineffective in preventing rice prices from escalating, which is impacting household budgets amid broader inflationary pressures.
