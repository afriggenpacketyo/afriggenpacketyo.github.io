          <p>New York Attorney General Letitia James's town hall was briefly interrupted by a Donald Trump supporter who accused her of wasting taxpayer money on a "witch hunt" and claimed she would face imprisonment for mortgage fraud. The crowd responded with boos, and the man was escorted out. James, who is known for her lawsuit against Trump and his family members alleging financial fraud, did not directly respond to the man but thanked him for attending. The Department of Justice has since opened a criminal investigation into James following accusations that she misrepresented a single-family home in Virginia as her primary residence to obtain more favorable loan terms.</p>

          <p>The U.S. government has granted refugee status to 54 Afrikaans South Africans, descendants of Dutch colonizers, who are expected to arrive in the U.S. This marks the first group of Afrikaners accepted by the U.S. after President Trump signed an executive order prioritizing humanitarian relief for Afrikaners facing racial discrimination in South Africa. The group has been given P1 refugee status, granting them a pathway to U.S. citizenship and eligibility for government benefits. President Trump and others have claimed that Afrikaners are facing persecution in South Africa, while the South African government has denied these allegations, calling the move ironic given the deportation of vulnerable people from other parts of the world.</p>

          <p>In an unprecedented move, the sister of a man killed in a 2021 road rage incident used artificial intelligence to create a likeness of her brother for his victim impact statement during the sentencing of his killer.

While the use of AI drew criticism regarding potential manipulation and deception, the video included a disclaimer clarifying its AI origin. This novel approach raises questions about the ethical and legal implications of using AI in court proceedings, particularly concerning its potential to inflame emotions.</p>

          <p>President Trump fired Librarian of Congress Carla Hayden via email, a move criticized by Democratic House Minority Leader Hakeem Jeffries as an effort to ban books and whitewash American history. Hayden, who had served since 2016, was the first woman and African American to hold the position. Democratic Representative Joe Morelle called the firing an ignorant decision that will impact America's libraries and copyrighted economic interests. Hayden expressed pride in her role as a person of color leading the world's largest library, considering the historical restrictions on people of color learning to read.</p>
