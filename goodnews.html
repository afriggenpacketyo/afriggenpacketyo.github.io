          <p>The National Crime Agency (NCA) is initiating a nationwide operation to target and imprison perpetrators of child sexual assault, particularly those involved in grooming gangs. This initiative aims to provide long-awaited justice to victims whose cases were previously mishandled and prevent further harm to children. The operation will also focus on improving how local police forces investigate these crimes and ending the culture of denial within local services regarding the prevalence of such abuse. The Home Office stated that over 800 historic cases have been reopened since January, and a national inquiry will be launched to investigate mishandling and cover-ups by various agencies and officials, ensuring accountability for past wrongdoings. The inquiry will have the power to compel investigations and call witnesses to hearings, marking a significant step towards addressing group-based child sexual assault.</p>

          <p>Taiwan has added China's Huawei and SMIC to its trade blacklist, further aligning with U.S. trade policy amidst rising tensions with Beijing. The International Trade Administration of Taiwan included Huawei and SMIC on its "Strategic High-Tech Commodities Entity List," requiring domestic firms to obtain licenses before shipping products to these entities. This move reinforces existing U.S. export restrictions already followed by companies like TSMC and tightens potential loopholes. The Taiwanese government's decision comes amid tense geopolitical relations with Mainland China, which views Taiwan as its territory. China has called for national reunification with Taiwan and opposition to Taiwan independence.</p>

          <p>Los Angeles Dodgers two-way star Shohei Ohtani is scheduled to make his pitching return against the San Diego Padres, marking his first MLB game as a pitcher since August 2023. Ohtani underwent right elbow surgery following that last appearance, keeping him off the mound since then. His return is earlier than initially expected due to injuries within the Dodgers' bullpen. He recently had a promising live batting practice, and Dodgers manager Dave Roberts noted Ohtani's eagerness to return to pitching, stating that it's time to use those "bullets in a game."</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Hospice staff are at the center of the debate surrounding the assisted dying bill, which would allow terminally ill adults with six months or less to live to medically end their lives in England and Wales. Many support assisted dying, saying it would give terminal patients autonomy, while others worry about pressure on patients and advocate for improved palliative care. Hospices, largely funded by charity, face uncertainty over how legalizing assisted dying would affect their services and express concern about funding shortages. Staff emphasize the importance of informed choices for patients, including both assisted dying and palliative care options, as the debate progresses.</p>

          <p>Shares of Santos experienced a significant surge following a non-binding takeover offer of $18.72 billion by a consortium led by Abu Dhabi's National Oil Company (ADNOC). The takeover bid, spearheaded by ADNOC's investment arm XRG, includes a cash offer of $5.76 per Santos share, marking a substantial premium from the previous closing price. Santos' board intends to unanimously recommend shareholders vote in favor of the transaction, absent a superior proposal. This bid comes as XRG seeks deals in natural gas, chemicals, and lower-carbon energy solutions, offering Santos a potentially successful takeover after past unsuccessful attempts.

          <p>Japan is shifting from a reactive to a preemptive cyber defense posture, urging the private sector to take proactive steps to protect key systems and sensitive industrial data. New legislation allows the government to track online communications and take early action against harmful servers, while obliging companies to report cyberattacks. The government plans to introduce a full-fledged preemptive defense system by 2027, with increased collaboration between the public and private sectors. Cyber threats mainly originate from China, North Korea, and Russia, along with criminal groups, prompting Japan to increase the number of trained cybersecurity workers and utilize AI to combat attacks.</p>

          <p>China's retail sales experienced their fastest growth since December 2023, driven by government subsidies and increased online shopping activity.
