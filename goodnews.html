          <p>A 24-year-old Massachusetts man has been arrested for allegedly stealing over $113,000 worth of rare Pokémon cards and collectibles from a shop in a rapid smash-and-grab theft. The suspect was apprehended after he reportedly attempted to sell a rare booster box, valued at $30,000, that matched an item stolen during the burglary. A subsequent tip and police investigation led to his arrest and the recovery of a shoebox containing numerous other high-value, graded Pokémon cards. The collectible shop owner expressed gratitude to the police and the local community for their support in resolving the case.</p>

          <p>A viral social media claim that the animated sitcom "The Simpsons" predicted a recent kiss cam incident at a Coldplay concert is false. The rumor spread rapidly with a side-by-side image showing the real-life moment next to a cartoon depiction, but a fact-check confirms no such scene exists in any episode of the show. AI-detection tools indicate the cartoon image was likely generated by artificial intelligence or otherwise digitally manipulated. This is the latest in a long line of false or misleading "Simpsons predictions," many of which are fabricated, though the show's creators acknowledge that with thousands of jokes over decades, some have coincidentally resembled real events.</p>

          <p>Actress Molly Gordon, known for supporting roles in projects like "The Bear" and "Theater Camp," is stepping into her first leading film role in the romantic comedy "Oh, Hi!" Frustrated with not being offered starring parts, Gordon co-wrote and produced the film to create the opportunity for herself. In the movie, she plays a woman who, after being told by her new boyfriend that he doesn't want a committed relationship, decides to hold him hostage to convince him otherwise. Gordon reflects on the challenges of the modern entertainment industry and the necessity of creating one's own work to showcase her range as a performer.</p>

          <h2>A Cultural History of Facial Hair's Rise, Fall, and Modern Revival</h2>

          <p>This article traces the fluctuating cultural significance of facial hair in America, from a symbol of sophistication in the 19th century to a mark of counter-culture in the 1960s. After a long period of being associated with unprofessionalism, beards and mustaches saw a revival with hippies, followed by the rugged '80s mustache, and later the cringeworthy hipster trends of the 2010s. Today, facial hair has become commonplace again, adopted by politicians seeking a more relatable image and young men embracing retro styles. The author reflects on this history, noting that facial hair has arguably returned to a peak of mainstream acceptance.</p>

          <p>The United Kingdom and India have formally signed a major free trade agreement, a multi-billion pound deal designed to boost exports and strengthen economic ties. The agreement will lower tariffs on UK exports like cars and whisky to India, while Indian goods such as textiles and jewelry will become cheaper to import into the UK. Following the signing at Chequers, Indian Prime Minister Narendra Modi met with King Charles at Sandringham. UK Prime Minister Sir Keir Starmer hailed the deal as the most significant since Brexit, stating it sends a powerful message that Britain is open for business.</p>

          <p>Great Britain's Emma Raducanu has advanced to the quarter-finals of the Washington Open with a decisive straight-sets victory over four-time Grand Slam champion Naomi Osaka. Raducanu's 6-4 6-2 win continues her strong performance in the tournament and ensures she will reclaim the top spot as the British number one in the next WTA rankings update. She is set to face Greece's Maria Sakkari in the next round. However, it was a disappointing day for British men's tennis, as both Cameron Norrie and defending champion Dan Evans were eliminated from the tournament in their respective last-16 matches.</p>

          <h2>Review: 'Oh, Hi!' Is a Sharp, Uncomfortable Romantic Comedy for the Modern Age</h2>
          <div class="timestamp">2025-07-24 15:04:46 EDT</div>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>The new film "Oh, Hi!" is a high-stakes romantic comedy that deconstructs modern dating tropes. Starring Molly Gordon and Logan Lerman, the movie follows a woman who, upon learning her new boyfriend is noncommittal, holds him captive in a remote house to hash out their issues. The review praises Gordon's nimble and likable comedic performance but notes the film struggles at times to balance its tones, shifting from rom-com to light thriller. Ultimately, the article describes "Oh, Hi!" as a flawed but pointed critique of gender dynamics and emotional immaturity, making it a pleasant if potentially perilous date night movie.</p>

          <h2>Bull Moose Lingering on Adirondack Hiking Trail Prompts Closure</h2>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>A large bull moose has caused the temporary closure of a popular hiking trail in New York's Adirondack Mountains after lingering near the summit for the entire summer. Wildlife officials say the moose's behavior is highly unusual, as the animals typically move to lower elevations to forage on aquatic plants at this time of year. While the 900-pound animal has not shown aggression, the trail remains closed for public safety. Researchers are monitoring the moose with trail cameras, suspecting an underlying illness may be influencing its behavior, but have not yet found obvious signs of disease.</p>

          <p>Wisconsin Governor Tony Evers, a Democrat, announced Thursday that he will not run for a third term in 2026, setting up the first open gubernatorial race in the battleground state in 16 years. Evers, 73, stated that after five decades in public service, it was time to focus on his family. His tenure has been marked by frequent clashes with the Republican-controlled legislature, where he used his veto power extensively to block conservative priorities. His departure opens a competitive race for both parties as Democrats also aim to gain control of the legislature under newly redrawn, more favorable electoral maps.</p>

          <p>Philadelphia Eagles quarterback Jalen Hurts has made it clear he is not dwelling on the past, including the team's Super Bowl victory just five months ago. At the start of training camp, Hurts told reporters that while he appreciated receiving his championship ring, he has "moved on" and is focused on the new season as a "blank canvas." This forward-looking mentality is shared by his teammates and coaches, who are emphasizing that they are not "defending" a title but must prove themselves all over again. Hurts said he is approaching the new journey with great intensity and passion.</p>
