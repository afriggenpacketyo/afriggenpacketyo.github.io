          <p>Ferrari reported a 17% increase in first-quarter profit, driven by high demand for personalized vehicles. CEO Benedetto Vigna highlighted the company's strong profitability due to product mix and personalization requests. However, Ferrari warned that potential U.S. tariffs on EU cars could reduce profitability by 50 basis points. The company's 2025 guidance includes net revenue exceeding 7 billion euros, with adjusted earnings per share of 8.60 euros. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>While some consumer prices, such as airfare, produce, household goods, electronics, and gasoline, have recently declined, economists warn that these lower prices may not last. Ryan Sweet of Oxford Economics attributes the price drops to idiosyncratic factors and supply-demand dynamics. Mark Zandi of Moody's notes that tariffs threaten to increase consumer prices, advising consumers to enjoy the lower prices while they last. Gasoline prices have decreased by almost 10% year-over-year, while TV and smartphone prices have fallen 9% and 14%, respectively.</p>

          <p>The Taiwanese dollar experienced a pullback after a historic surge, weakening over 3% against the U.S. dollar following a recent rally. The currency's movements have been volatile, driven by exporters converting U.S. dollar reserves and life insurers hedging debt. Despite the pullback, the Taiwanese dollar is still up over 8% this year against the greenback. Speculation has risen that exchange rates are part of U.S.-Taiwan trade negotiations, though officials deny this.</p>
