          <p>The UK economy demonstrated resilience by growing 0.7% in the first three months of 2025, surpassing analyst expectations. This growth was primarily fueled by the services sector and a significant increase in production, according to the Office for National Statistics. While Chancellor Rachel Reeves touted this as evidence of the UK's economic strength, critics pointed to downgraded growth forecasts from other financial bodies. The figures reflect economic activity just before tax increases and import tariffs took effect, leading analysts to caution that the growth rate may not be sustainable. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>A recent report reveals that U.S. airlines faced a record number of passenger complaints in 2024, driven by flight cancellations, delays, and mishandled luggage. The surge in complaints began post-pandemic as airlines struggled to meet the increasing demand for air travel. Frontier Airlines had the highest rate of complaints. New regulations mandating automatic refunds for canceled or significantly delayed flights aim to alleviate some customer frustrations, but air traffic controller shortages may further exacerbate scheduling issues in 2025.</p>

          <p>This article explores the potential benefits of spending time in nature for recovery from physical injuries, citing the experience of Sarah Allely, who found relief from post-accident symptoms through bush walks. Research suggests that time in nature can reduce symptoms of depression and anxiety, and may also help with physical pain and brain injury rehabilitation. Experts explain that nature provides a break for the brain, promoting relaxation and emotional well-being, which can positively impact physical recovery. The article emphasizes the importance of quality over quantity when spending time in nature and highlights the potential for a healthier relationship with the natural world.</p>

          <p>A medieval text in Harvard Law School's library, long believed to be a copy, has been identified by two British academics as an original 1300 version of Magna Carta. Purchased for a mere $27.50 after World War II, the manuscript is now recognized as one of only seven such documents from that era still in existence. The discovery, made by chance during research, highlights the document's significance in establishing fundamental liberties.

          <p>Denmark's economic growth, largely driven by pharmaceutical exports, is expected to moderate in the coming years, but potential U.S. tariffs on the pharma industry are unlikely to be a major factor. The IMF reports that most Danish drug products are not produced or shipped from Denmark, due to a reliance on merchanting and processing systems. While direct impacts from U.S. tariffs are expected to be limited, heightened trade tensions and policy uncertainty still pose risks to the outlook. The growth has been driven by Novo Nordisk's diabetes and weight loss medications.</p>
