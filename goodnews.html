          <p>The Trump administration is reportedly considering a list of 11 candidates to succeed Jerome Powell as Federal Reserve Chairman when his term ends. Among the names are Jefferies' David Zervos, former Fed Governor Larry Lindsey, and BlackRock's Rick Rieder, joining previously mentioned figures like Michelle Bowman and Chris Waller. According to sources, Treasury Secretary Scott Bessent will lead a deliberative interview process to create a shortlist for the president. This extensive process suggests a decision is not imminent, providing some stability by avoiding a disruptive 'shadow Fed chair' scenario. (not investment advice)</p>

She quipped that male sports fans must want to see "more of me" on their screens, playfully acknowledging the criticism she received for her frequent appearances at Kansas City Chiefs games last season. The pop superstar has become a major topic of conversation in both the entertainment and sports worlds since her relationship with the Chiefs tight end began.

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>With high interest rates on personal loans and credit cards, home equity loans and home equity lines of credit (HELOCs) are emerging as more affordable borrowing alternatives for homeowners. As of early August, average rates for 10-year home equity loans are around 8.41%, while HELOC rates are near 8.13%, significantly lower than many other credit products. These options allow homeowners to tap into their substantial home equity for large expenses. Experts note that these rates may decline further if the Federal Reserve implements cuts later in the year, making them an even more attractive option. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>An opinion article challenges the fearful narrative of a "China Shock 2.0," arguing that China's rapid advancements in technology should be seen as constructive rather than disruptive. The author contends that China is not just catching up but leading the construction of new global systems, particularly in the green transition. For example, in 2023, China installed more solar capacity than the rest of the world combined and is driving down clean energy costs globally. The piece suggests that instead of reflexive protectionism, the West should recognize that China's progress in sectors like EVs and AI is underwriting a necessary global shift.</p>

          <p>The world-famous Barbie doll was inspired by a German character named Lilli, who first appeared in a 1952 comic strip in the Bild tabloid. Lilli was depicted as a sensual, witty, and independent woman, often in suggestive situations designed to appeal to a male readership. In 1955, she was turned into a plastic doll that became a popular gag gift for men. Mattel co-founder Ruth Handler discovered the Lilli doll in Switzerland, purchased the rights, and in 1959, launched a modified version named Barbie, which went on to become one of the best-selling toys in history.</p>

          <p>Comedian Mo Amer is the creator and star of the Netflix series "Mo," a groundbreaking sitcom that explores the Palestinian-American experience through a comedic lens. The show delves into the complexities of the U.S. immigration system, the challenges of being stateless, and the hope of returning to a homeland, all based on Amer's own life. In a recent interview, Amer discussed the process of creating a show so deeply rooted in his personal reality. He also talked about the responsibility of becoming a prominent voice for Palestinian-Americans, especially during the current political moment, and using humor to navigate difficult subjects.</p>

          <h2>Mortgage Refinancing Applications Surge 23% as Homeowners Seek Savings Amid Rate Fluctuations</h2>
          <div class="timestamp">2025-08-13 08:03:50 EDT</div>
        </div>
        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Demand for mortgage refinancing surged by 23% last week, marking the strongest week for such applications since last April. This jump was driven by a slight decrease in the average contract interest rate for 30-year fixed-rate mortgages, which fell to 6.67%. The increase in activity also saw a rise in demand for adjustable-rate mortgages (ARMs), as their rates became more attractive compared to fixed-rate loans. While homeowners are actively seeking to lower their monthly payments, applications for home purchases saw only a marginal 1% increase, suggesting that high home prices continue to be a significant barrier for potential buyers.

          <p>A team of Chinese scientists from the University of Science and Technology of China has built the world's largest array of atoms for quantum computing. They developed an AI-powered system to arrange over 2,000 rubidium atoms, which serve as qubits, into perfect patterns with unprecedented speed. This achievement overcomes a major obstacle for atom-based quantum computers, which are considered a highly promising approach due to the stability and control of neutral atoms. The milestone, hailed by reviewers as a significant leap forward, could accelerate the development of powerful and practical quantum computers by enabling much larger and more complex systems.</p>

          <p>GE Appliances has announced a plan to invest over $3 billion to expand and modernize its U.S. manufacturing facilities, creating more than 1,000 jobs over five years. As part of this strategy, the company will move production of some gas ranges from Mexico and several refrigerator models from China to its plants in Georgia and Alabama. This reshoring effort also includes shifting clothes washer production from China to its major complex in Louisville, Kentucky. The company cited a long-term strategy of manufacturing closer to its customers, with tariffs on Chinese imports reportedly accelerating the decision-making process.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Following a landmark antitrust ruling that found Google illegally monopolized the search market, AI startup Perplexity has made an unsolicited offer to buy the Chrome browser for $34.5 billion. The offer comes as the U.S. Department of Justice proposes that Google be forced to sell off Chrome to remedy its anti-competitive practices. The browser is a critical component of Google's advertising business, which generates the majority of its revenue. A potential sale has also attracted interest from other major players like OpenAI and Yahoo, signaling a potential major shake-up in the tech landscape.</p>
