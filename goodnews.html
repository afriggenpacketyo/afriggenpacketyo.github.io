          <p>The UK economy experienced stronger than anticipated growth in the first quarter of the year, expanding by 0.7% between January and March, surpassing analyst forecasts of 0.6%. According to the Office for National Statistics, this growth was primarily fueled by the UK services sector, with significant contributions from production as well. Chancellor Rachel Reeves hailed the figures as evidence of the UK economy's underlying strength and potential for future growth.</p>

          <p>Denmark's economy, boosted by a surge in pharmaceutical exports, is projected to see moderate growth in the coming years, according to the International Monetary Fund. Despite the threat of potential U.S. tariffs on pharmaceutical imports, Denmark is expected to be largely shielded due to its reliance on a "merchanting and processing" system where manufacturing is contracted to other countries. The IMF notes that direct impacts from U.S. tariffs are expected to be limited, though heightened trade tensions pose risks to the outlook, as Danish drugmakers increasingly rely on intellectual property rather than domestic production.</p>

          <p>What was previously believed to be a copy of the Magna Carta at Harvard Law School has been identified as an extremely rare original from 1300, issued by King Edward I. Experts from King's College London and the University of East Anglia based their conclusion on an analysis of the document's size and handwriting, which align with those of the six previously known originals. The "Great Charter," originally dating from June 1215, is considered a foundational document for constitutions and legal systems worldwide, particularly influencing the US Declaration of Independence and Constitution.</p>

          <p>After 41 years of armed conflict, the Kurdistan Worker's Party (PKK) has announced its dissolution, a move welcomed by Turkish government and opposition parties alike, but with many questions remaining. Experts suggest this could significantly alter Turkey's political landscape, particularly for the pro-Kurdish Peoples' Equality and Democracy Party (DEM). Key issues include the terms of peace, the legal status of jailed politicians like Ekrem Imamoglu, and the fate of PKK members and their weapons. The process faces resistance within the PKK, and the Turkish government insists on eliminating illegal structures, indicating a complex path toward lasting peace and stability.</p>

          <p>A business consultant has urged the Jersey government to implement statutory workplace pensions to address the challenges of an aging population. Kevin Keen advocates for auto-enrollment schemes, similar to those in Guernsey, Australia, and the UK, to ensure more residents save for retirement. This call comes ahead of a conference focused on adapting to the island's increasing elderly population, with projections indicating a 50% rise in the number of people aged 75 and over in the next 20-30 years. The government had previously paused plans for auto-enrollment pensions, prioritizing support for employers and workers transitioning to a living wage.</p>

          <p>The Japanese government is contemplating doubling its release of stockpiled rice to address near-record high rice prices, according to sources familiar with the matter. The government is considering releasing 100,000 tons of reserve rice per month for three months through July, in addition to the 321,000 tons already auctioned between March and April. This move comes in response to a rice shortage partly caused by a poor harvest in 2023 and increased rice consumption at restaurants due to a surge in foreign tourists. The government is also considering relaxing buyback requirements for distributors to encourage greater participation in auctions.</p>

The recall affects models from 2022 to 2024, and Ford will inspect and replace the brake line or air cleaner outlet pipe as needed, free of charge.

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>The Independent Schools Council (ISC) reports that private school fees in the UK have increased by 22.6% in the last year, exceeding government predictions, following the introduction of VAT on fees. The average termly fee for a day school in January was ¬£7,382, including 20% VAT. The ISC expects a reduction in pupils applying for private schools as a result, but the Treasury says the increase in fees are not only down to VAT and the data "misrepresents reality". Many schools reduced their fees, excluding VAT, to cushion the impact on parents, but the sector has been hit by a "triple whammy" of national insurance changes, an end to charitable business rates relief and "the blow of 20% VAT on fees".</p>

          <p>US lawmakers are exploring potential restructuring of the State Department to better align economic and foreign policy goals, as major economies begin to circumvent the United States due to Washington's departure from established global trading rules. During a House East Asia and Pacific subcommittee hearing, witnesses emphasized the need for closer economic engagement with trading partners, particularly to counter China's growing influence. Concerns were raised about the current alignment of functions and agencies leading economic statecraft, with a focus on crafting legislation to address these issues.</p>

          <h2>Harvard's Previously Dismissed Magna Carta 'Copy' Now Recognized as Genuine</h2>

          <p>A manuscript long considered a mere copy of the Magna Carta, residing in Harvard Law School's library for 80 years, has been authenticated as a genuine version dating back to 1300. Two British academics, David Carpenter and Nicholas Vincent, identified the document as one of only seven originals from that period, a discovery made while researching digitized images online. The manuscript, acquired for a mere $27.50 after World War II, could be worth millions today, and is now celebrated as a cornerstone of constitutional history. The writing and word order of the charter known as HLS MS 172 matched originals of the charter from 1300.</p>

          <p>Two British academics discovered that a ‚Äúcopy‚Äù of the medieval text, held in Harvard Law School‚Äôs library for 80 years, is one of seven originals dating from 1300. Bought for $27.50 after World War II, the faint, water stained manuscript in the library of Harvard Law School had attracted relatively little attention since it arrived there in 1946. The manuscript‚Äôs value is hard to estimate, although it is fair to say that its price tag of under $30 (about $500 today) must make it one of the bargains of the last century. A 710-year-old version of Magna Carta was sold in 2007 for $21.3 million.</p>

          <p>This article analyzes the music, lyrics, and performances of Eurovision Song Contest winners since 2000 to identify the secrets to success. Key elements include singing about personal liberation, preferably in English, and alluding to folk music without sending a pure folk song. Staging is crucial, requiring spectacular, inspiring, and slightly weird elements, including setting things on fire, but avoiding the burning of pianos. Finally, the article advises against dramatic key changes and sending novelty acts, as they rarely lead to victory.</p>

          <p>Shao Chun Chen, a 39-year-old Singaporean, has relocated to Chiang Mai, Thailand, and now "supercommutes" to Singapore for a three-hour-a-week job as an adjunct lecturer. Chen earns $2,000 to $4,000 Singapore dollars per month teaching a digital marketing class, which is enough to cover his and his wife's living expenses in Thailand. He was unexpectedly laid off by the tech company in February 2024, and Chen realized that the seven-figure portfolio he had built over the years meant he no longer needed to rely on a paycheck for a long time.</p>

          <p>Starbucks has initiated a process to sell a stake in its China business, contacting private equity firms and technology companies to explore options. The company is seeking views on how to grow the China business, where it faces increasing competition from local players like Luckin Coffee and Cotti Coffee. A transaction could value the assets at several billion dollars, but Starbucks may also decide not to pursue a deal. As of March, Starbucks had more than 7,750 stores in China and generated about US$740 million in net revenue in the country during the quarter.</p>
