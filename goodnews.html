          <div class="timestamp">2025-07-04 17:44:31 EDT</div>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>A cardiologist with over two decades of experience treating heart attacks has identified five food categories he avoids giving his own children. These include microwave popcorn due to chemical-lined bags, flavored yogurts for their high sugar content, and processed meats like bacon and hot dogs, which are linked to heart disease. The list also features sugary cereals and deep-fried foods, which contribute to inflammation and poor metabolic health. The article suggests healthier alternatives like air-popped popcorn, plain yogurt with fruit, and unprocessed proteins to foster long-term wellness.</p>

          <p>England's women's cricket team defeated India by a slim margin of five runs in a dramatic T20 match at The Oval, keeping the series alive. Chasing 172, India needed six runs off the final ball but fell short, ending at 166-5. Earlier, England posted a total of 171-9, driven by strong half-centuries from Sophia Dunkley and Danni Wyatt-Hodge, before a sudden collapse saw them lose nine wickets for just 31 runs. The thrilling conclusion sets up a crucial fourth match in the five-game series, with England now trailing 2-1.</p>

          <p>Hamas has reportedly issued a "positive response" to the latest U.S.-mediated ceasefire proposal aimed at ending the conflict with Israel. The group stated it is prepared to enter negotiations to implement the framework, which is believed to include a 60-day truce. This development follows President Trump's announcement that Israel had agreed to the proposal, though Israeli officials have not publicly confirmed their commitment. The war, which began after the October 7, 2023 attacks, has resulted in a devastating humanitarian crisis and tens of thousands of casualties in Gaza.</p>

          <p>The technology IPO market is showing signs of recovery after a prolonged downturn that began in early 2022. A recent surge in public offerings, highlighted by crypto company Circle's stock increasing sixfold since its debut, has provided much-needed returns for venture capital firms. This renewed activity follows a period of stagnation caused by rising interest rates and inflation, which had created a 'backlog of liquidity drought' for many startups. While some high-profile companies remain private, the recent successes have sparked cautious optimism among investors that the market is beginning to open up again. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>In a recent interview, filmmaker Ken Burns described the American Revolution as one of the most pivotal events in world history, primarily because it introduced the concept of the 'citizen.' He argued that the revolution set in motion a global movement toward self-governance, despite the deep divisions and internal contradictions present at the nation's founding. Burns emphasized that understanding the complexities and flaws of historical figures like Thomas Jefferson makes their achievements more profound. He believes that a complicated, un-sanitized history provides a richer, more inclusive narrative for all Americans.</p>

          <p>During a speech in Iowa, President Trump proposed holding a UFC championship fight on the White House grounds as part of the nation's 250th anniversary celebration next year.

Trump mentioned that UFC CEO Dana White, a vocal supporter, would be involved in organizing the event. If it were to happen, it would be the first time a major sporting event of this kind has been hosted at the White House.</p>

          <p>Cars manufactured in China accounted for a record one in ten new car sales in the UK during June, a significant increase from the previous year. The rapid growth of Chinese brands like BYD and MG, particularly in the electric vehicle sector, comes as other Western countries impose steep tariffs on these imports. The UK has not yet followed suit, creating a major market opportunity for Chinese automakers. This trend has prompted concerns from some UK industry leaders about the ability of local manufacturers to compete with cheaper and innovative Chinese vehicles. (not investment advice)</p>
