          <p>Stablecoin issuer Circle's upcoming IPO is notable for the high percentage of shares being sold by existing shareholders (60%), similar to Facebook's 2012 IPO.  This is unusual in tech IPOs and likely reflects the prolonged lack of IPO activity and the need for venture capital firms to secure liquidity.  The company is profitable and expects to raise significant capital in the offering. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>The European Union lifted most economic sanctions on Syria, aiming to facilitate the country's reconstruction.  The decision allows the Syrian Central Bank and other lenders access to the European financial market.  However, sanctions related to security concerns and individuals linked to the al-Assad regime remain in place. The EU hopes this will aid in the return of Syrian refugees.</p>
