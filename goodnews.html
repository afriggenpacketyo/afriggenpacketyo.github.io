Guo landed his small plane without permission while attempting to become the youngest person to fly solo to all seven continents for a cancer research fundraiser. A Chilean judge ordered his release on the condition that he donate the funds raised to a children's cancer foundation, pay a $30,000 penalty, and not enter Chile for three years. Guo described his detention as a mundane experience and praised the Chilean people for their hospitality during his confinement.</p>

          <p>Max Verstappen secured pole position at the Italian Grand Prix by setting a new all-time Formula 1 speed record, surpassing the previous benchmark set in 2020. Both Verstappen and McLaren's Lando Norris broke the record, with Verstappen achieving an average speed of 164.466mph. This was attributed to the current cars having less drag, being faster on straightaways, and a recently resurfaced, higher-grip track at Monza. Despite the record, Verstappen expressed cautious optimism about winning the race, acknowledging McLaren's strong performance in race conditions throughout the season.</p>

This is the second national test of the system, which is designed to warn the public of life-threatening situations such as extreme weather or terror attacks. Officials emphasized that the test is crucial for ensuring the system's effectiveness, while domestic abuse charities have advised victims with hidden phones to turn them off during the test period.</p>

          <p>Reform UK's recent party conference in Birmingham showcased the party's significant growth and increasing political ambition, feeling more like a major party gathering than ever before. The event was substantially larger than last year's, attracting new members from across the political spectrum, particularly disaffected Conservative voters. Leader Nigel Farage's speech emphasized the need for discipline and grassroots organization as the party aims to build on its momentum. The conference's scale and professional feel, combined with its insurgent energy, signal a clear intent to become a dominant force in British politics.</p>

          <p>President Donald Trump has signed an executive order aimed at penalizing countries that wrongfully detain American citizens abroad. The order empowers the State Department to create a "state sponsor of wrongful detention" designation, which can trigger consequences such as economic sanctions and visa restrictions. Secretary of State Marco Rubio stated that the measure is modeled after the state sponsor of terrorism classification and is intended as a strong deterrent. The move comes as advocacy groups report that at least 54 Americans were wrongfully detained in 17 different countries in 2024.</p>

          <p>Prime Minister Keir Starmer has continued his government reshuffle, making significant changes at the Home Office following Yvette Cooper's move to the Foreign Office. Ministers Dame Angela Eagle and Dame Diana Johnson have been moved to other departments, with new ministers appointed to work under the new Home Secretary, Shabana Mahmood. The reshuffle, prompted by the resignation of Deputy Prime Minister Angela Rayner, aims to reset the government's agenda, particularly on key issues like illegal immigration. Other notable appointments include promoting Anna Turley to Labour Party Chair and bringing business executive Jason Stockwood into the House of Lords as a business minister.</p>

          <p>A new conservation chapter is beginning at Point Reyes National seashore in California after a landmark deal resulted in the buyout of 12 organic dairy and cattle operations. The agreement opens over 16,000 acres for a massive, five-year restoration project led by The Nature Conservancy, which aims to heal landscapes impacted by decades of ranching. The plan involves using targeted cattle grazing to manage invasive plants and restore native grasslands, creating a living laboratory for conservation. While the transition is painful for the multi-generational ranching community, it offers hope for enhancing the region's rich biodiversity.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>A dermatologist emphasizes that daily sunscreen use is as crucial as brushing your teeth for long-term health, yet only 17% of U.S. adults do so. Many people commonly miss applying sunscreen to vulnerable areas like eyelids, ears, and lips, which are highly susceptible to UV damage. While SPF 30 is recommended, higher SPFs offer more efficient protection because most people don't apply the correct amount. Sun protection is a year-round necessity, not just for summer, as cumulative sun damage occurs in every season and can lead to skin conditions later in life.</p>
