        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Skomer Island, off the Pembrokeshire coast, has recorded a record number of puffins, with 43,626 counted this year, despite global populations declining rapidly. The Wildlife Trust of South and West Wales (WTSWW) attributes the increased numbers to an abundance of food and a lack of predators on the island. Skomer's isolation protects it from predators and human impact, making it an ideal breeding ground for seabirds. While puffins thrive on Skomer, they are listed as vulnerable to extinction globally due to pollution, food shortages, and climate change.</p>

The law targets companies producing 100,000 tons of carbon dioxide or more annually across various industries. Under the system, companies will be allotted maximum emission allowances, and those exceeding the threshold will need to purchase carbon credits from companies with surpluses. The article notes that while the system aims to reduce emissions, it may also lead to price hikes for consumers as companies pass on decarbonization costs.</p>
