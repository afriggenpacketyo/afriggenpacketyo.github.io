          <p>Netflix announced that its ad-supported tier has reached 94 million monthly active users, marking a significant increase of over 20 million since November. This growth reflects the company's strategy to boost profitability through advertising, following the introduction of the ad-supported plan in November 2022. The cheaper plan, priced at $7.99 per month, offers a substantial discount compared to the ad-free plan at $17.99 per month. Netflix claims its ad tier attracts a higher level of attention, especially among 18- to 34-year-olds, surpassing U.S. broadcast and cable networks.</p>

          <p>A federal judge has ordered the release of Badar Khan Suri, a Georgetown University researcher detained by immigration authorities, finding that his detention violated his First and Fifth Amendment rights. Suri, an Indian national, was detained based on alleged connections to a Hamas official, with the government claiming he was spreading Hamas propaganda. The judge refuted the government's claims, stating there was no evidence Suri made statements supporting Hamas and that his detention was caused by his speech. The ACLU, representing Suri, called his detention an attack on students and academics for their views on the conflict in Gaza.</p>

          <p>Joseph Nye, who recently passed away at 88, is remembered for coining the term "soft power," which refers to influence gained through aid, culture, news, and promotion of human rights. Nye's concept contrasted with traditional "hard power" based on military and economic strength. He served in the State Department and Pentagon under Presidents Carter and Clinton and was dean of Harvard's Kennedy School of Government. Nye's approach to foreign policy stood in stark contrast to Donald Trump's, as he criticized Trump's undermining of institutions crucial to soft power.</p>

          <p>With credit card debt balances declining but interest rates remaining high, debt consolidation is a relevant option for borrowers. Experts recommend taking the initiative rather than waiting for interest rates to drop significantly. Shopping around for lenders is crucial to secure the most cost-effective solution, and borrowers should consider both personal loans and resources offered by debt relief companies. Exploring alternatives like a home equity line of credit (HELOC) or a home equity loan may also prove advantageous. (not investment advice)</p>

The White House estimates the deal will support 154,000 U.S. jobs annually and over one million total domestic jobs during production and delivery. The deal nearly doubles Qatar Airways' fleet.</p>

          <p>A federal judge ordered the release of Georgetown scholar Dr. Badar Khan Suri, who had been detained allegedly based on his pro-Palestinian speech, to be released on bail. The judge sided with the ACLU's argument that Suri, who had lawful status, was detained based on his protected First Amendment speech in support of Palestine. The judge also stated that Suri was unjustly punished by association of his wife, who had once worked with the Gaza foreign ministry, and his father-in-law's connection with a now-deceased Hamas leader. As conditions of his release, the judge said Suri should continue to reside in Virginia and attend all court hearings.</p>
