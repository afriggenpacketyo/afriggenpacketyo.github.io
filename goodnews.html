          <p>The Hong Kong Exchanges and Clearing (HKEX) reports strong momentum in the city's IPO market, holding the top spot globally with US$23.27 billion raised in the first nine months of 2025, surpassing the New York Stock Exchange and Nasdaq. HKEX CEO Bonnie Chan Yiting notes that over 300 companies are in the listing pipeline, and international investors from Europe, the US, the Middle East, and emerging markets are actively participating, particularly in new tech company listings. The exchange operator said this reflects their confidence in mainland China's technology development and a shift in asset allocation. This is the first time Hong Kong has ranked first in the first three quarters of the year since 2018. The score is 80.</p>

Sinochem Holdings and China Huaneng Group are among the latest to move, bringing approximately 1,000 employees each. Xiongan, launched in 2017, is intended to alleviate Beijing's congestion and redistribute non-capital functions, with officials hoping the city will draw more investment and people.

          <h2>Survey Finds Many American Workers Forego Vacation Time</h2>

        </div>
        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>A FlexJobs survey reveals that nearly a quarter of American workers did not take any vacation days this year, despite most having access to paid time off (PTO). Many employees feel they have too much work to justify taking time off, worry about falling behind, or feel guilty about leaving their team with a burden. Team culture and perceived manager disapproval also contribute to the reluctance to use PTO. Career expert Keith Spencer emphasizes that taking time off is beneficial for focus, creativity, and resilience, and workers should advocate for their right to use their PTO as part of their compensation package. The score is 60.</p>

          <p>Thousands of skin-breathing sea cucumbers, scientifically known as Leptosynapta clarki, have washed ashore on Seaside Beach in Oregon due to heavy surf and low tide. These creatures, normally burrowed in the sand, are now scattered across a two-mile stretch. The sea cucumbers are unable to return to their habitat and will dry up, providing nutrients for beach invertebrates, though birds do not consume them. Such phenomena occur when surf and tide conditions align, happening a few times a year or once every few years. The score is 75.</p>

          <p>Beyond Meat shares have surged for a third consecutive day, fueled by meme traders after Roundhill Investments added the stock to its Roundhill Meme Stock ETF (MEME). The stock rallied more than 127% on Monday and soared 146% on Tuesday, its best day ever, after announcing expanded distribution at Walmart. This surge is reminiscent of the pandemic era, when retail traders coordinated moves on online message boards. Despite this week's comeback, shares of Beyond Meat have been under pressure for a long time and the stock has slid in each of the last five years. The score is 55.</p>

          <p>With elevated interest rates persisting, homeowners can leverage their home equity through HELOCs and home equity loans as an effective borrowing strategy. The average equity level is comfortably sitting over $300,000, making borrowing with a home equity loan or home equity line of credit (HELOC) makes sense. As of October 21, 2025, average home equity loan interest rates range from 8.13% to 8.28%, while the average HELOC rate is 7.84%. These rates are poised to drop alongside a declining federal funds rate in the months ahead, either could be the ideal way to borrow a large sum of money at an affordable cost.

          <p>For individuals seeking new homes or considering refinancing, understanding current mortgage rates is essential. As of October 21, 2025, average mortgage rates are 5.80% for a 15-year mortgage and 6.36% for a 30-year mortgage. Average refinance rates are 5.80% for a 15-year refinance and 6.43% for a 30-year refinance. Taylor Jessee, CFP, notes that as the Fed stops raising rates, mortgage rates are anticipated to stabilize, offering good news for borrowers. (not investment advice)</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Experts suggest that now may be a good time to request a HELOC credit limit increase due to shifting interest rates and high home values. Homeowners can increase their HELOC limit by asking their current lender for a loan modification, refinancing their current HELOC, or applying for a new HELOC entirely. Lenders will consider factors such as credit score, debt-to-income ratio (DTI), and current home value. Jeff DerGurahian notes that lower interest rates can mean lower monthly payments, potentially helping homeowners qualify for a higher credit limit. (not investment advice)</p>
