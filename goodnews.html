        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Pfizer's acquisition of Metsera for up to $7.3 billion, a developer of next-generation weight-loss drugs, is anticipated to stimulate increased research and development spending in China's pharmaceutical sector. Analysts believe this deal, alongside other major pharmaceutical firm acquisitions, will encourage existing Chinese companies to continue investing in innovative obesity drug solutions. The transaction includes a significant premium for Metsera's shares and future payments tied to drug-development milestones. Metsera's pipeline features several "next-generation" candidates currently in pre-human testing, aiming for improved efficacy and tolerability compared to existing market products.

          <p>A former senior Chinese official, Yang Weimin, has advocated for significant efforts to increase household income over the next five years to power China's future economic growth through consumption. His comments precede the Communist Party's Central Committee's fourth plenum, where the country's next five-year plan will be discussed, likely focusing on GDP growth, industrial upgrading, and technological innovation. Yang emphasized the need to raise the share of household disposable income in national income and boost consumer spending's contribution to total demand.

          <p>US President Donald Trump announced that he would not permit Israel to annex the West Bank, declaring "It's not going to happen. There's been enough, it's time to stop." This statement follows calls for annexation from far-right Israeli officials and comes after a phone call with Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu regarding the Gaza conflict. Trump's stance was reinforced by Arab and Muslim leaders during a UN meeting, who warned against the dangers of annexation to peace prospects in Gaza and the wider Middle East. Israel has occupied the West Bank since 1967, with settlements there deemed illegal under international law.</p>

          <p>Costco surpassed Wall Street's earnings and revenue expectations for its fiscal fourth quarter, reporting double-digit increases in both membership income and e-commerce. CFO Gary Millerchip noted efforts to offset higher tariff costs by introducing private-label alternatives and shifting merchandise to less tariff-exposed categories. Despite overall inflation remaining in the low-to-mid-single-digit range, non-food merchandise saw inflation, primarily due to imported items. The company's membership fee increase and attraction of younger shoppers contributed significantly to its robust financial performance, with plans to open 35 new warehouses next year.

          <p>British energy major BP has moved out of the takeover spotlight, with its shares climbing over 32% since April, outperforming rivals. This improved sentiment is attributed to a strategic reset, leadership changes, cost-cutting progress, and recent oil discoveries. Earlier in the year, BP was subject to intense speculation as a takeover target for companies like Shell and Exxon Mobil. Strong second-quarter results, including a $2.35 billion profit, and optimism about new discoveries, particularly in Brazil, have bolstered investor confidence.
