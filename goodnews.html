          <p>Despite ongoing trade tensions, Chinese companies are increasingly focused on global expansion, with the U.S. remaining a key market. Camera company Insta360 recently had a successful Shanghai listing, noting that the U.S., Europe, and China each account for roughly 23% of its revenue. Other Chinese firms, such as battery giant CATL and robotic vacuum cleaner company Roborock, are also expanding globally. This trend reflects a shift from manufacturing for foreign brands to building independent international brands, driven partly by slowing growth in China. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>China has entered the race to mass-produce high-performance photonic chips, which could lead to significant advancements in artificial intelligence, 6G, and quantum computing. Shanghai Jiao Tong University's CHIPX has initiated production of 6-inch wafers for thin-film lithium niobate photonic chips, using light for information processing. While Europe and the US are already established in this field, China's pilot production line is showing technical gains, potentially overcoming limitations in high-speed optical links. This development signifies a major step for China in the competitive landscape of photonic chip technology.</p>

          <p>House Democrats are engaged in a behind-the-scenes race to select a new ranking member for the influential House Oversight Committee, following the death of Representative Gerry Connolly. Four Democrats are vying for the position: Stephen Lynch, Jasmine Crockett, Robert Garcia, and Kweisi Mfume, each bringing different strengths and perspectives. As they evaluate the candidates, Democrats are considering factors such as communication skills, support for battleground districts, and the ability to effectively challenge President Trump and his administration. The vote is scheduled for June 24, and the outcome will shape the party's approach to oversight and investigations in the coming years.</p>

          <p>South Korea has ceased its anti-North Korea propaganda broadcasts along the inter-Korean border, signaling a step towards easing tensions between the two nations. President Lee Jae-myung ordered the move as part of an effort to restore trust and promote peace on the Korean Peninsula. The broadcasts, which included propaganda messages and K-pop songs, were resumed last year in response to North Korea's trash-laden balloons. While North Korea has yet to comment, South Korea hopes this gesture will lead to improved relations, though prospects for immediate dialogue remain uncertain.</p>
