          <p>Nasdaq is proposing new rules that would require companies primarily operating in China to raise at least $25 million in their initial public offerings to list on the exchange. This move aims to curb "pump and dump" schemes associated with small-float IPOs and protect U.S. investors, given the difficulty of taking legal action against entities involved in manipulative trading. The change comes amid simmering U.S.-China trade tensions and follows years of increased scrutiny over a flood of tiny, high-risk Chinese IPOs in the U.S. market. The U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission must approve the proposal for it to take effect. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>Huawei has launched the Mate XTs, its second-generation trifold smartphone, with a starting price of approximately $2,520 in China. The device features two hinges, allowing it to unfold into a tablet, a design concept Huawei pioneered last year. This release is a key part of the company's strategy to solidify its comeback in the Chinese market, where it has regained the top position with an 18% market share. Despite ongoing U.S. sanctions that have restricted its access to key technologies since 2020, Huawei's continued innovation in premium devices like the Mate XTs demonstrates its resilience and dominance in the foldable phone category.</p>

Burberry's return to the blue-chip benchmark marks a significant milestone in its efforts to regain traction in the competitive luxury fashion market.

          <p>Nvidia-backed data security company Cohesity is planning a potential initial public offering for 2026, aiming for a valuation that could rival its competitor Rubrik, currently valued at $17 billion. CEO Sanjay Poonen stated that the company delayed its initial IPO plans from 2021 to first complete a strategic merger with Veritas's data protection unit, which made it the market leader. This merger, valued at over $7 billion, has positioned Cohesity for a strong public debut once it can present a full financial year of combined results. A successful IPO would represent a significant return for early investors, including Sequoia Capital and Softbank. (not investment advice)</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>A federal appeals court has upheld an Illinois law that prohibits carrying firearms on public transportation, reversing a lower court's decision. The Seventh Circuit Court of Appeals ruled that the decade-old ban is consistent with the historical tradition of regulating firearms in sensitive and crowded places, and therefore does not violate the Second Amendment. The court reasoned that the state has the authority to ensure public transit systems remain free from accessible firearms for public safety. This decision is expected to be appealed to the U.S. Supreme Court by the gun rights groups and individuals who initiated the lawsuit.</p>

          <p>Nineteen-year-old British boxer Tiah-Mai Ayton has set a goal to become the youngest undisputed champion in the four-belt era of boxing, a record currently held by Gabriela Fundora at age 22. Ayton, who has an extensive combat sports background with only three losses in over 300 fights, is preparing for her second professional boxing match. After a decorated amateur career that includes a world championship gold medal, she signed with promoter Eddie Hearn's Matchroom Boxing. Despite her ambitious goals to be undisputed in four different weight classes, Ayton maintains a grounded perspective, stating her dream is to eventually buy a farm and live a quiet life.</p>

The initiative allows patients and their families to request an urgent second opinion from a critical care team if they have serious concerns about a patient's condition that are not being addressed. The program was established after a campaign by the parents of 13-year-old Martha Mills, who died from sepsis after her family's concerns were dismissed. Data from the pilot showed nearly 5,000 calls were made, leading to hundreds of potentially life-saving interventions and demonstrating a clear need for a more equal doctor-patient relationship.</p>

          <p>A survey by the Chicago Council on Global Affairs and The Carter Centre indicates that the Chinese public has a more flexible view of its global role than commonly perceived in the U.S. While optimistic about their nation's future, a plurality of 48% of respondents expressed interest in a "shared leadership role" with other world powers, implying a desire for peaceful coexistence rather than global dominance. This nuanced perspective suggests potential avenues for reducing U.S.-China tensions, according to the report's authors. However, they also cautioned that some responses may have been influenced by self-censorship, given the political environment in China.</p>

Judge Allison Burroughs ruled that the government's action, which cited claims of antisemitism and "radical left" ideologies, violated the university's First Amendment rights to free speech. While the judge acknowledged that Harvard should have done more to combat antisemitism on campus, she concluded the administration's true motive was a targeted, ideological assault.
