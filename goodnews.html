          <p>The Los Angeles Chargers have introduced two new alternate uniforms for the 2025 season, prompting a wave of reactions from fans and players. The team unveiled a striking all-gold "Charger Power" ensemble, which has been humorously compared to mustard bottles and the Savannah Bananas baseball team. Additionally, a "Super Chargers" uniform featuring navy blue jerseys, pants, and helmets will serve as a modern throwback to the team's look from the 1990s, an era that included their only Super Bowl appearance.</p>

          <p>President Trump announced a new trade deal with Indonesia that sets a 19% tariff on Indonesian goods, a significant reduction from the previously threatened 32%. In exchange, Indonesia has committed to substantial purchases of American products, including $15 billion in U.S. energy, $4.5 billion in agricultural goods, and 50 Boeing aircraft. The agreement is one of several trade pacts being finalized by the administration to avoid steeper, more widespread tariffs, and it aims to provide the U.S. with full market access to the Southeast Asian country.</p>

          <p>Bob Becker, an 80-year-old from Fort Lauderdale, has made history by becoming the oldest person to officially complete the Badwater 135, a grueling 135-mile ultramarathon through Death Valley. Facing temperatures around 118 degrees Fahrenheit, Becker finished the race in just under the 48-hour cutoff, a goal he had narrowly missed three years prior. Becker, who only began running in his late 50s, relied on a dedicated four-person crew to provide support, nutrition, and motivation throughout the arduous journey across three mountain ranges.</p>

          <p>A bipartisan bill known as the Genius Act, which aims to create a federal regulatory framework for stablecoins, is advancing in Congress as part of a broader push to support the cryptocurrency industry. Stablecoins are a type of digital currency pegged to stable assets like the U.S. dollar, making them less volatile than cryptocurrencies like Bitcoin and potentially useful for faster, lower-cost payments. The legislation would establish consumer protections and clear rules for issuers, potentially allowing banks and credit unions to enter the $250 billion market and further mainstream the technology.</p>

          <p>The Pentagon has announced the withdrawal of 2,000 National Guard troops from Los Angeles, reducing by half the military force deployed last month amid protests against federal immigration sweeps. The deployment was initiated by President Trump against the wishes of California Governor Gavin Newsom and LA Mayor Karen Bass, who condemned it as an unconstitutional overreach. The troops were sent to protect federal property and personnel during large-scale ICE raids, which have created significant tension and disruption in the region's large immigrant communities.</p>

          <p>Alexander Torres, who spent over 20 years in prison for a murder he did not commit, will receive a $14 million settlement from Los Angeles County. Torres was convicted in 2001 based on shaky witness testimony, despite having an alibi and a cast on his arm that would have made firing a gun difficult. A judge declared him factually innocent in 2022 after a review by the L.A. County District Attorney's Conviction Integrity Unit, leading to the settlement for his federal civil lawsuit against the county and its sheriff's department.</p>

          <div class="timestamp">2025-07-15 19:02:00 EDT</div>
        </div>
        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>An independent review of the UK's National Health Service has recommended that physician associates (PAs) and anaesthesia associates (AAs) should be renamed as "assistants" to prevent patient confusion. The review, commissioned amid debate over the roles, also suggests standardized uniforms and badges to clearly distinguish them from doctors and states they should not be diagnosing patients. The BMA, the doctors' union, supports the changes but believes the review should have gone further to address concerns about the roles being used to fill doctor shortages without appropriate oversight.</p>

          <p>The world-famous Palm House at London's Royal Botanic Gardens, Kew, is set for a major £50 million renovation that will require its closure for five years starting in 2027. The project will address the toll that the hot, humid indoor conditions have taken on the 175-year-old iron-and-glass structure. The ambitious plan involves moving 1,300 plants, replacing 16,000 panes of glass, and upgrading the heating system to make the iconic Victorian glasshouse a net-zero emissions building, ensuring its preservation for future generations.</p>

          <p>The UK's Advertising Standards Authority (ASA) has banned an advert for Trip drinks after finding it made unauthorized health claims that its products could help people feel calm and reduce stress. The ad for its cucumber, mint, and magnesium drink used language like "crafted for calm," which the watchdog ruled implied a prohibited benefit for anxiety. The ASA found that the claims about its ingredients, which include CBD and ashwagandha, were not on the official register of permitted health claims for food and drink products.</p>
