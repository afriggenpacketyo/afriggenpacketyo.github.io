          <p>Three large wildfires in northeastern Minnesota are almost fully contained after burning for several weeks, leading to the lifting of all evacuation orders on Memorial Day. The Minnesota Department of Natural Resources and the National Incident Management Organization are leading efforts to control the Jenkins Creek, Munger Shaw, Camp House, and Horse River fires. Hazardous smoke conditions have prompted air quality alerts across Minnesota. Donations are being collected through United Way organizations to support affected community members.</p>

          <p>Authorities in Cologne, Germany, evacuated 20,000 people as experts worked to defuse three unexploded bombs from World War II. The operation was temporarily delayed due to a resident's refusal to evacuate, requiring intervention from public order officials, police, and the fire department. The evacuated area included the old city, numerous hotels, hospitals, and train stations, but the Cologne Cathedral was outside the immediate danger zone. Bomb defusals are common in Cologne due to the city being a major target during WWII bombings.</p>

          <p>Vietnam has abolished its long-standing two-child policy in response to a declining birth rate and a shrinking working-age population. Lawmakers passed amendments to the Population Law, allowing families to decide how many children they wish to have. The previous policy, in place since 2009, restricted families to one or two children, with stricter enforcement for government officials and Communist Party members. The Ministry of Health estimates the country's population at over 100 million, but the national fertility rate has dropped to 1.91 per woman, below the replacement level, and the two-child policy has been abandoned to increase it.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>While paying bills on time is crucial for credit scores, experts say it's not the only factor. Not all debt payments are factored into credit scores, such as rent-to-own, private school tuition, and utilities, unless they are reported to credit bureaus. Some buy now, pay later (BNPL) loans may not positively impact credit scores unless the provider reports them, but missed payments can negatively affect scores. Checking your credit report can help determine which payments are influencing your score (not investment advice).</p>

          <p>The remains of Army Air Forces 1st Lt. Charles W. McCook, a WWII pilot, have been accounted for 82 years after he was killed in a plane crash in Burma. McCook was credited with saving the life of a fellow airman, Sgt. John Boyd, by maneuvering the damaged plane to allow him to parachute to safety. His remains were recovered from a common grave near the crash site and identified through dental, anthropological, and DNA analysis. McCook will be buried in his hometown in August 2025, and a rosette has been placed next to his name on the Walls of the Missing.</p>

          <p>The average 401(k) savings rate, including employee and company contributions, reached a record high of 14.3% in the first quarter of 2025, according to Fidelity.

Experts recommend saving at least enough to get your employer's full 401(k) matching contribution, which is often described as "free money," if you cannot reach the 15% benchmark (not investment advice).</p>
