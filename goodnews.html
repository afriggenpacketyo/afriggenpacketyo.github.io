          <p>Dr. Mehmet Oz, Administrator for the Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services, detailed the administration's plans for enacting a new healthcare law affecting drug costs and Medicaid. Speaking on "Face the Nation," Oz defended new tariffs on imported medicines, stating that a "most favored nation" pricing strategy would prevent costs from being passed to consumers and address global freeloading on U.S. drug development. He also explained that new work requirements for able-bodied Medicaid recipients would be managed through a modern app-based system, arguing technology will streamline the process and connect people to employment opportunities, improving the program's sustainability.

          <p>Bank of America CEO Brian Moynihan stated that his bank's economists do not foresee a recession or any Federal Reserve rate hikes for the remainder of the year. In a "Face the Nation" interview, he projected slow but steady growth, around 1.5% this year, with inflation not expected to reach the Fed's 2% target until late 2026 or early 2027. Moynihan noted that business activity has slowed as companies await clarity on the administration's policies regarding trade, deregulation, and immigration. He also suggested that the adoption of artificial intelligence is a long-term factor in the job market but not the primary cause of recent weak job growth. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>Victims of car finance mis-selling in the UK are expected to receive less than £950 per deal under a new compensation scheme proposed by the Financial Conduct Authority (FCA). The proposal follows a Supreme Court ruling that found hidden commissions were not broadly unlawful but could be deemed unfair if excessively large. The FCA will now consult on the details of a payout scheme, estimated to cost the industry between £9 billion and £18 billion, with the first payments anticipated next year. The regulator advised affected consumers to contact their loan providers directly for claims covering agreements dating back to 2007. (not investment advice)</p>

Companies like Chipotle, Cava, and Taco Bell are launching spicy sauces, sides, and main dishes, recognizing that younger generations crave bolder and more adventurous flavors. This trend is seen as a low-cost, high-return strategy for brands to re-engage consumers amid a pullback in spending. The push is heavily amplified by social media platforms like TikTok, where spicy food challenges and taste tests consistently generate significant online buzz and drive customer trial.</p>

          <p>The Smithsonian has announced it will restore references to Donald Trump's two impeachments to its National Museum for American History exhibit in the coming weeks. The museum faced public concern after a temporary placard detailing the impeachments was removed from a section on presidential power limits. In a statement, the Smithsonian denied that the removal was due to pressure from the Trump administration, explaining the placard was taken down because it did not meet the museum's aesthetic and presentation standards. The updated exhibit will include materials on Trump's impeachments alongside those of Presidents Bill Clinton and Andrew Johnson.</p>

          <p>McLaren's Lando Norris secured victory at the Hungarian Grand Prix after a masterful defensive drive against his teammate, Oscar Piastri. Norris employed a bold one-stop strategy, which required him to expertly manage his tires while holding off a late charge from Piastri, who was on a fresher set. The win narrows Norris's deficit in the championship standings to just nine points heading into the summer break. Mercedes' George Russell finished third after overtaking Ferrari's Charles Leclerc, who faded after starting from pole position, in the closing stages of the intense race.</p>

The terminal, which will be JFK's largest, is part of a $19 billion overhaul of the airport and is designed specifically for international travelers. Its first phase is scheduled to open in mid-2026, featuring 14 gates capable of handling wide-body aircraft, and will eventually expand to 23 gates by 2030. The design prioritizes natural light and includes its own resilient microgrid to ensure continuous operation during power disruptions.</p>

          <p>China has granted export permits to 183 new Brazilian coffee companies, a significant move that provides a crucial alternative market for Brazilian producers. The approval comes just before the United States is set to impose a steep 50% tariff on Brazilian coffee and other goods, which poses a major challenge to the industry. Brazil is a primary coffee supplier to the U.S., a trade valued at $4.4 billion over the past year. This expansion into the Chinese market offers a timely lifeline for Brazilian exporters needing to divert sales from the U.S. to mitigate the impact of the new tariffs. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>Dallas Cowboys owner Jerry Jones has dismissed star defensive end Micah Parsons' public trade request as a negotiation tactic and stated he has no intention of trading him. The standoff stems from a breakdown in contract extension talks, with Parsons seeking a deal that would likely make him the highest-paid defender in the NFL. Jones insisted the situation is a normal part of the process when negotiating large contracts, comparing it to past disputes with other star players. Despite the public friction and support for Parsons from teammates, Jones expressed confidence that the issue would be resolved satisfactorily.</p>

          <p>China's advanced aircraft carrier, the Fujian, has apparently conducted its first test of its electromagnetic catapult system, a key milestone for the nation's naval modernization. Footage aired on state broadcaster CCTV showed a control room operator clearing a jet for take-off from the carrier, which is China's first to be equipped with this modern launch technology. This system allows for the launch of heavier and more varied aircraft compared to the ski-jump ramps on China's older carriers. The successful drill marks a significant step towards the Fujian's expected entry into service later this year.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>For couples facing marital difficulties without a prenuptial agreement, divorce attorneys recommend two key steps to protect personal finances. The first is to proactively gather comprehensive information about all joint financial accounts, assets, and liabilities while still married, as access can become more difficult after a separation. The second is to consider a postnuptial agreement, which defines how assets, particularly those from a business started during the marriage, would be divided in a divorce. While potentially a difficult conversation, attorneys suggest that these measures can provide security and clarity for both parties should the marriage ultimately end.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>According to a parenting expert who has studied over 200 parent-child relationships, using specific calming phrases can be highly effective in managing children's tantrums. The article suggests that instead of punishing or dismissing a child's outburst, parents should use language that validates their feelings and offers reassurance. Phrases like "You're having a big feeling. I'm right here with you" and "Your feelings make sense" help a child's nervous system regulate by making them feel safe and understood. This connection-based approach aims to prevent meltdowns by addressing the underlying distress rather than just the behavior.</p>

          <p>Despite being one of the highest-paid athletes in the world, NBA star Stephen Curry revealed he does not know his exact net worth and doesn't worry about it. In a recent podcast interview, Curry explained that he delegates his money management and focuses instead on building a portfolio of investments and relationships he can be proud of. Financial planners quoted in the article praised this mindset, suggesting that focusing on tangible goals and cash flow is often more beneficial than fixating on a net worth figure. They argue that Curry's approach of prioritizing what he's great at will better serve his long-term financial health.</p>
