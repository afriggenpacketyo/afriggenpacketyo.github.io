          <p>Donald Trump has responded to critics on Truth Social, asserting his well-being amidst online rumors. Trump has been actively denouncing opponents, a tactic he has employed since his days as a New York developer. He has also been involved in culture war issues, such as criticizing the Smithsonian museums and influencing Kennedy Center Awards choices. Trump has escalated rhetoric against the media, demanding ABC and NBC lose their licenses. The article highlights the media's intense focus on Trump's activities and contrasts it with the relative lack of attention given to Joe Biden's actions. The piece suggests that the media's overwhelmingly negative coverage of Trump may not always give him credit where it's due. Optimism rests on Trump's resilience and the media's ability to report facts fairly, despite personal biases.</p>

          <p>Real Madrid has once again demonstrated its ability to acquire world-class talent without spending exorbitant transfer fees, securing Trent Alexander-Arnold from Liverpool for a minimal fee to expedite his registration for the Club World Cup. This continues a trend of Real Madrid signing top players like David Alaba, Antonio Rudiger, and Kylian Mbappe on free transfers, often attracting players willing to run down their contracts to join the prestigious club. According to La Liga commentator Phil Kitromilides, the allure of Real Madrid is nearly irresistible for many players, regardless of their previous affiliations or boyhood teams. While other clubs completed free transfers this summer, Real Madrid's success lies in its ability to attract top talent willing to sacrifice immediate financial gains for the prestige of playing for the club.</p>

          <p>Thailand's ruling party is seeking royal approval to dissolve parliament and call for new elections after the Constitutional Court dismissed Prime Minister Paetongtarn Shinawatra. The move comes as rival factions compete for power, with the largest opposition party backing Anutin Charnvirakul to lead the country. Anutin has secured the support of 146 lawmakers from various groups and parties, contingent on dissolving the House of Representatives within four months, triggering fresh elections. The People's Party leader, Natthaphong Ruengpanyawut, expressed concerns about the potential return of a failed coalition or a coup maker as prime minister, emphasizing the need for a parliamentary vote on a new leader.</p>

          <p>England winger Lauren James has criticized fans for being "too quick to judge" her performance during Euro 2025, citing injury problems and subsequent criticism that affected her enjoyment of the Lionesses' triumph. James revealed she played through a significant injury sustained during the quarter-final against Sweden, which ultimately led to her being substituted in both the semi-final and final. She also expressed relief that other players missed penalties in the quarter-final shootout, fearing racist abuse if her own missed penalty had been decisive. Despite the challenges, James affirmed her commitment to representing England and her desire to continue contributing to the team's success.</p>
