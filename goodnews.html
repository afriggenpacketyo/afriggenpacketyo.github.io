          <p>Germany's nationwide public transport pass, the Deutschlandticket, is facing financing challenges despite its popularity since its permanent introduction in May 2023. The ticket, which allows unlimited travel on regional trains and buses across Germany, is jointly financed by the federal and 16 state governments. While the current financing is guaranteed for 2025, disagreements persist regarding future contributions, with some state governments seeking to reduce their share. Transport companies argue that the current subsidies are insufficient, leading to political contention over the long-term viability of the Deutschlandticket.</p>

          <p>Premier Li Qiang's remarks on supporting the property sector and escalating policy support suggest Beijing's ongoing concerns about the sector's drag on growth and consumption. A State Council meeting emphasized the need to optimize existing policies and enhance systematic synergy to stabilize expectations, stimulate demand, and mitigate risks. The meeting highlighted plans for a thorough stocktake of ongoing projects and land supplies, with urban-renewal projects receiving more land supply and financing aid. The ultimate goal is to halt the decline and stabilize the sector, but analysts note there is no quick fix to the sector's woes.</p>
