          <p>Chinese government officials are calling on the nation's new-energy vehicle (NEV) manufacturers to cease what they term an "irrational" and unsustainable price war. At a symposium attended by major carmakers like BYD, officials emphasized the need for lawful and rational market competition to ensure the healthy long-term development of the industry. This intervention follows a period of intense price-cutting among NEV producers, which authorities fear could destabilize the rapidly growing sector.</p>

          <p>The UK government is relaunching its Pensions Commission to address a looming retirement savings crisis, warning that future pensioners could be worse off than today's. The Department for Work and Pensions highlighted that almost half of working-age adults, particularly low earners and the self-employed, are not saving into a private pension. The revived commission will investigate barriers to saving and aim to build a national consensus on a future strategy, following the success of its predecessor which introduced automatic enrolment.</p>

          <p>WNBA players are publicly campaigning for a new collective bargaining agreement, arguing their compensation is unfairly low given the league's rapid growth. Players highlighted the issue by wearing "Pay us what you owe us" shirts, questioning the league's reported financial losses in light of soaring franchise valuations, broadcast rights, and attendance figures. The article notes that players currently receive less than 10% of league revenue, a starkly low figure for a professional sports organization.</p>

The bills also seek to fund research and provide specific protections for women of color and salon workers, who are disproportionately exposed to harmful substances.</p>
