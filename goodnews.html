          <p>Rumeysa Ozturk, a Turkish doctoral candidate at Tufts University, was released from ICE custody after a judge ruled her continued detention violated her First Amendment and due process rights. Ozturk was detained following the revocation of her student visa due to an opinion piece she co-authored criticizing Israel's war with Hamas. Judge Sessions stated that the government's case rested solely on the op-ed and lacked evidence of violence or advocacy for violence. The court ordered her release with no travel restrictions, allowing her to return to her studies at Tufts, while the Trump administration maintains that her visa was revoked due to associations that undermined U.S. foreign policy.</p>

          <p>Google has agreed to pay Texas nearly $1.4 billion to settle allegations that it violated the data privacy rights of Texas residents by unlawfully tracking and collecting their private data. Texas Attorney General Ken Paxton sued Google in 2022, and this settlement is said to be the largest of its kind between a state and Google. This settlement comes after Texas secured a similar $1.4 billion settlement from Meta for unauthorized use of biometric data. Google stated that the settlement resolves old claims related to product policies that have since been changed and that they are committed to building robust privacy controls into their services.</p>

          <p>The Trump administration has initiated an investigation into the import of commercial aircraft, jet engines, and related parts, potentially leading to new tariffs based on national security interests. The Commerce Department will gather industry input on domestic demand fulfillment, foreign supplier roles, and government support. While the aerospace industry boasts a large trade surplus, it relies on a global supply chain, and tariffs could harm suppliers. Industry leaders express concerns about the impact on trade frameworks and supply chains, while companies like Boeing and RTX estimate significant tariff costs.</p>

          <p>Pupils in Edinburgh have been cut off from revision resources ahead of key exam dates due to an attempted cyber attack on the council's education department. Staff detected a suspicious "spear-phishing" attempt impersonating a trusted source, prompting a precautionary password reset for all users. While the council said no data had been compromised, the disruption impacts students preparing for exams. The incident follows a similar cyberattack on schools in West Lothian earlier in the week, highlighting the increasing threat to educational institutions.</p>

          <p>Chinese buyers have purchased between 400,000 and 500,000 metric tons of wheat from Australia and Canada in recent weeks due to concerns about heat damage to crops in China's agricultural heartlands. The purchases include milling quality wheat for delivery in July or August. The bookings from Australia mark the first such purchases since last year. Despite the recent increase, China's wheat imports slowed sharply after large harvests last year, and the long-term impact of the heat concerns on future purchases remains uncertain.</p>
