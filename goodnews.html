          <p>The U.S. Drug Enforcement Administration (DEA) announced a major week-long crackdown on the Sinaloa drug cartel, resulting in 617 arrests across 23 U.S. field divisions and seven international regions. Operations conducted between August 25 and 29 led to the seizure of substantial quantities of illicit drugs, including 480 kilograms of fentanyl powder and 2,200 kilograms of methamphetamine, alongside 420 firearms and $12.8 million in assets. This action underscores the DEA's commitment to dismantling the cartel, which President Trump designated a terrorist group, and highlights the ongoing collaborative efforts to combat its global operations. The Sinaloa Cartel remains a significant threat to public health and national security, prompting these extensive enforcement actions.</p>

          <p>Mitchum, a prominent deodorant brand, has publicly apologized after a significant number of users reported severe skin irritation, including "agonising weeping spots" and burning sensations, from its 48-hour roll-on anti-perspirant. Consumers shared distressing experiences on social media, with some claiming "second-degree chemical burns" on their armpits. The company explained that a change in its manufacturing process, affecting a raw material, led to the issue in specific 100ml batches distributed in the UK, Ireland, and South Africa. Mitchum has since reverted to its original manufacturing process and is working to remove the problematic products from stores, urging affected individuals to contact customer services.</p>

Secret Cinema, known for its themed shows, was acquired by TodayTix Group in 2022 for $100 million, expanding its operations to the US and Australia. This move signifies further consolidation in the entertainment and event industries.</p>

During his UK visit, he attended the Community Recording Studio, an initiative backed by the charity, where he praised rap music performances and connected with youth workers. The Prince expressed his hope that the donation would help "changemakers" create safe spaces and offer hope to young people grappling with issues like knife crime, food poverty, and educational inequality. This generous act comes as speculation continues regarding a potential meeting with his father, King Charles, during his visit.</p>

Fleetwood, who secured a $10 million prize, expressed gratitude for the overwhelming support he received, highlighting its significance beyond the win itself. He also shared that his wife and stepson missed the triumph as his stepson was recovering from spinal surgery, but is now making a good recovery and will attend Wentworth. Fleetwood is focused on maintaining his strong 2025 form and is also looking ahead to Europe's Ryder Cup defense in New York.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Debit cards are increasingly surpassing credit cards in popularity for purchases, a shift driven by growing debt aversion, especially among Gen Z, and current high interest rates. Initially accounting for a third of card purchases around 2000, debit usage has steadily climbed, with new financial players like Venmo now offering reward programs to entice users. Economic factors, such as banks profiting from checking account balances and the rise of cashless stores, also contribute to this trend. While credit cards can lead to accumulating debt due to interest and late fees, debit cards, linked directly to funds, help consumers manage spending and avoid financial trouble.

          <p>A new report from Natixis Investment Managers indicates that fewer Americans, now 21% down from 41% in 2021, believe it will "take a miracle" to achieve a secure retirement. This increased optimism partly stems from recent strong S&P 500 returns, making investing appear easier to many. However, persistent worries about inflation, the possibility of outliving savings, and potential Social Security benefit cuts still concern 69% of respondents. Despite the U.S. ranking 21st globally for retirees, factors like income inequality and a decline in happiness offset strong finances and health, highlighting a complex retirement landscape.

        </div>
        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>With competitive interest rates on Certificates of Deposit (CDs) likely to change due to an anticipated Federal Reserve rate cut, savers are considering whether to open multiple CDs or a single jumbo CD account. Experts highlight that jumbo CDs typically require a minimum deposit of $100,000, while traditional CDs have lower or no minimums. In the current atypical rate environment, shorter-term CDs often offer the most competitive yields, blurring the traditional advantage of jumbo CDs. The choice hinges on flexibility versus simplicity, with a CD ladder offering adaptability to rate changes, while FDIC insurance limits also factor into decisions for large sums.

Education Secretary Bridget Phillipson, Housing Minister Alison McGovern, and senior backbencher Dame Emily Thornberry are among the candidates, alongside Lucy Powell, Paula Barker, and Bell Ribeiro-Addy. Candidates must secure support from 80 MPs by Thursday and additional backing from local parties or affiliated groups. The race, which will be decided by a vote of party members on October 25, is seen as crucial for the future direction of Labour as it navigates political challenges from both the left and right.</p>
