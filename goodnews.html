          <h2>A Look at the History of the Congressional Baseball Game</h2>
          <div class="timestamp">2025-06-09 19:33:25 EDT</div>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>The annual Congressional Baseball Game, a tradition since 1909, pits Democrats against Republicans in a friendly competition at Nationals Park. Representative Roger Williams, a former Atlanta Braves farmhand, coaches the Republican team, while Representative Linda Sanchez manages the Democrats. The game, which raises money for children's charities in the DC area, is known for its competitive spirit and occasional trash talk. This year, the Republicans are aiming for their fifth consecutive win, while the Democrats hope to break their losing streak, despite facing challenges such as injuries and the departure of star player Cedric Richmond. The Congressional Baseball Game offers a unique blend of politics and sports, providing a lighthearted break from the usual Washington gridlock.</p>

          <p>WWE made a splash in Los Angeles with a double-header event featuring AAA stars and Money in the Bank. Worlds Collide, showcasing AAA talent, broke YouTube viewership records and celebrated Mexican wrestling. Money in the Bank, however, sparked controversy, with some fans disappointed by the outcomes of the ladder matches. The surprise return of R-Truth, now known as Ron Killings, helped salvage the event after earlier reports indicated that WWE wouldn't be renewing his contract. Overall, the events provided a mix of excitement and mixed reactions for wrestling fans.</p>

          <p>The UK government has committed ¬£14.2 billion to the Sizewell C nuclear plant project in Suffolk, aiming to create 10,000 direct jobs and power six million homes. Chancellor Rachel Reeves hailed it as a landmark decision to kickstart economic growth and the biggest nuclear building program in a generation. However, Alison Downes of Stop Sizewell C condemned the announcement, fearing it would add to consumer bills and questioned the project's value for money. The final investment decision on the funding model is expected later this summer, with the project facing opposition due to concerns over cost and potential impact on the environment.</p>

          <p>President Trump, along with several CEOs, is promoting a plan to create savings accounts for newborns in the United States. Dell Technologies has pledged to provide $1,000 for these "Trump accounts" for new children of its employees, matching the government's proposed contribution.

          <p>The Walt Disney Co. has finalized its acquisition of Hulu by paying Comcast Corp. an additional $438.7 million, bringing the total cost to $9.2 billion.

Disney CEO Bob Iger stated that completing the acquisition paves the way for deeper integration of Hulu's content with Disney+ and ESPN's direct-to-consumer product. Comcast said that Hulu generated nearly $10 billion in proceeds for them and created an important audience for NBCUniversal's content.</p>
