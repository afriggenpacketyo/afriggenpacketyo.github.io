          <p>Emily Thornberry has officially announced her withdrawal from the Labour deputy leadership contest, explaining that she failed to secure the necessary 80 nominations from MPs to advance to the next stage. Her decision narrows the field to four remaining candidates vying to replace Angela Rayner, who recently resigned following a controversy over her property tax payments. Education Secretary Bridget Phillipson currently leads the race with substantial parliamentary backing, while other candidates also continue their efforts. This contest, with voting scheduled for October and a winner announced shortly thereafter, is seen as an untimely distraction for Prime Minister Sir Keir Starmer, potentially exposing internal party divisions and discontent within the government's first year in power.</p>

          <p>Japan's benchmark Nikkei 225 index achieved a new record high, mirroring robust gains on Wall Street, primarily driven by optimistic expectations for Federal Reserve rate cuts and positive inflation data. Tech investment firm SoftBank Group experienced a significant surge of over 10%, following a Wall Street Journal report detailing OpenAI's substantial five-year cloud-computing deal with Oracle, a company with which SoftBank shares a connection through the high-profile Stargate program. Concurrently, other Asian markets also registered gains, with South Korea's Kospi reaching its highest close on record. This article reflects a strong and positive investor sentiment across the region, particularly within the technology sector, against a backdrop of broader global economic optimism.

          <p>Germany is experiencing a notable drop in asylum applications and a decrease in asylum-seeker welfare recipients, shifting its position as the EU country with the most new applications. Concurrently, the center-left Social Democrats have nominated Sigrid Emmenegger for the Constitutional Court, aiming to resolve a prior political dispute over a liberal abortion-supporting candidate. Separately, a survey revealed that 93% of German airline pilots take short naps during flights, indicating growing work strains, though deemed uncritical by the union. Additionally, a Belgian festival controversially canceled a German orchestra's performance due to its Israeli conductor's perceived stance on the Israeli government.</p>

Klarna's CEO highlighted the company's expansion into banking with debit cards and deposit accounts, attracting a significant customer base.

This notable reversal of a multi-year retreat is attributed to several factors, including China's emerging leadership in specific high-growth sectors such as humanoid robotics and biotech, the government's concerted efforts to nurture its equity market and stabilize the broader economy, and an improving liquidity situation. Additionally, investors are increasingly seeking diversification from U.S. assets and are showing interest in onshore markets through A-share exchange-traded funds. The article suggests that substantial capital inflows are only "just starting," anticipating more meaningful increases as investors complete their individual stock-level homework.

          <p>China's People's Liberation Army (PLA) Rocket Force has taken decisive action, banning 74 bid evaluation experts and 116 suppliers from participating in procurement projects following an extensive corruption investigation. The official China Government Procurement News reported these significant bans, noting that some individuals and companies were stripped of qualifications that had entitled them to bid for projects across the entire PLA, with identified violations stretching back to 2016. This rigorous enforcement is a direct component of President Xi Jinping’s ongoing military reforms, specifically aimed at eradicating corruption within the branch responsible for China’s strategic nuclear missiles. The move underscores Beijing's unwavering commitment to enhancing military integrity and ensuring robust supply chain security for its critical defense assets.</p>

          <p>The Los Angeles Dodgers successfully swept the Colorado Rockies with a dominant 9-0 victory, significantly extending their National League West lead to three games, yet faced a last-minute injury setback with catcher Will Smith. Smith was unexpectedly scratched from the lineup just 15 minutes before first pitch due to renewed swelling around a bone bruise in his right hand, an injury manager Dave Roberts cautioned could potentially linger for the remainder of the season. Despite this concern, Mookie Betts delivered a stellar performance with a grand slam and five RBIs, while Blake Snell contributed six scoreless innings. The win, coupled with a Padres loss, further solidified the Dodgers' division lead, although Smith's health remains a key concern for the team's postseason aspirations.</p>

          <p>Everton Football Club has undergone a significant transformation, moving from being just above the relegation zone to fifth in the Premier League, largely fueled by a record £97 million net spend in the summer transfer window. This financial turnaround, representing their highest net outlay in a single summer, follows years of austerity and points deductions for breaching profit and sustainability regulations. The acquisition of nine new players, notably including the marquee loan signing Jack Grealish, has been instrumental in their impressive revival. Improved financial health, partly attributed to the Friedkin Group takeover and future revenues from the new Hill Dickinson Stadium, now positions Everton to ambitiously target their first trophy since 1995, with manager David Moyes carefully managing the club's rapidly rising expectations.</p>

          <p>NBA Commissioner Adam Silver has publicly stated that the league requires clear and concrete evidence before it can take any disciplinary action against Clippers owner Steve Ballmer, who faces allegations of orchestrating a secret deal to circumvent the salary cap for star player Kawhi Leonard. The Clippers are currently under investigation following claims that Leonard received a $28 million "do-nothing" endorsement deal from Aspiration, a sustainability firm that had a substantial sponsorship agreement with the team and was later revealed to be fraudulent. Silver emphasized the critical need for fundamental fairness and irrefutable proof, rather than merely an appearance of impropriety, to justify any punishment. The ongoing investigation will specifically focus on determining whether Ballmer or other Clippers representatives directed Aspiration's deal with Leonard, with potential penalties ranging from forfeited draft picks to significant fines.</p>

          <p>Facing an industry-wide slowdown and widespread consumer sticker shock, luxury brands are strategically diversifying their product offerings with more accessible items, such as $160 lipsticks and $1,400 accessories. Louis Vuitton's recent launch of a beauty collection exemplifies this trend, aiming to attract new and younger consumers to their ecosystem without diluting the exclusivity of their core high-end offerings. This "treatonomics" strategy allows brands to engage a broader aspirational customer base, with the long-term hope of fostering brand loyalty as these consumers accrue more wealth. While similar approaches proved successful during past economic downturns, the sustained effectiveness of this delicate balancing act between accessibility and exclusivity in the current economic climate remains to be fully determined.

          <p>China has invested a substantial nearly 450 billion yuan ($63.2 billion) over the past five years into a strategic mineral-exploration initiative, which has yielded significant breakthroughs in the discovery of oil, gas, copper, lithium, and uranium reserves. Officials reported the identification of over 500 large and medium-sized deposits, notably adding more than 300 billion cubic meters of natural gas in northern China’s Ordos Basin alone, a figure nearly matching the total from the preceding decade. These findings underscore China's intensified efforts to dominate critical mineral supply chains and reduce its reliance on imports, driven by paramount supply-chain-security considerations and booming demand from new technological developments amidst ongoing geopolitical tensions. The overarching initiative aims to robustly enhance national energy security and optimize resource structures.</p>

The meeting, lasting approximately 50 minutes, follows months of subtle shifts in tone from the Prince, who had previously expressed a clear desire for family reconciliation after years of public critiques. Both Buckingham Palace and Harry's team maintained a unified silence regarding the specifics of their conversation, underscoring the private nature of the tea. This reunion, occurring after a prolonged period of strained relations and public scrutiny, offers a glimmer of hope for mending the "damaging rift" within the royal family, though a full family reconciliation remains a distant prospect.</p>

          <p>A Redfin report claims San Francisco's housing costs have returned to "normal" July 2018 levels, based on a mortgage payment-to-income ratio, with home-price growth slowing and mortgage rates falling. Oakland is also projected to normalize soon. However, "normal" for San Francisco still means households spend 74% of their income on mortgages, far exceeding the national average of 30%. This article clarifies that the normalization reflects a pre-pandemic equilibrium for tech-driven metros, not affordability. The ongoing AI boom, meanwhile, is driving up rents and crowding out lower-wage tenants, indicating continued housing challenges despite the apparent market stabilization. (not investment advice)</p>
