          <p>Tropical Storm Erin has formed in the eastern Atlantic Ocean and is projected to strengthen into the season's first hurricane later this week. Originating near the Cabo Verde islands, where it caused deadly flooding, the storm is currently moving west but does not pose an immediate threat to the United States. Early models suggest Erin could intensify into a major hurricane as it approaches the Caribbean. Forecasters note there is still uncertainty regarding its long-term path, but most projections show it turning northwestward into the open ocean.</p>

          <p>Shares of Circle Internet Group, the issuer of the USDC stablecoin, rose significantly after its first quarterly earnings report as a public company. The firm reported a 53% year-over-year revenue increase to $658.1 million, driven by a 90% growth in USDC circulation. Despite posting a net loss due to IPO-related charges, the strong revenue growth reflects rising institutional interest in stablecoins, bolstered by a more favorable regulatory environment under the Trump administration. Circle also announced plans for a new blockchain, Arc, designed for stablecoin payments and capital markets. (not investment advice)</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>The Consumer Price Index for July showed a 2.7% annual increase, slightly below economists' forecasts of 2.8%, indicating that inflation remains relatively contained. On a monthly basis, prices rose by 0.2%, with a drop in energy costs helping to offset price increases in other areas. The report comes amid close scrutiny of the potential impact of President Trump's tariffs and political pressure on the Bureau of Labor Statistics. Analysts suggest the moderate inflation figures keep the possibility of a Federal Reserve interest rate cut in September on the table. (not investment advice)</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>For retirees who must take required minimum distributions (RMDs) from their retirement accounts but do not need the funds for living expenses, financial advisors suggest several smart strategies. Options include reinvesting the money in a tax-efficient brokerage account, often using exchange-traded funds (ETFs) to minimize annual tax liabilities. Another popular choice is making a qualified charitable distribution (QCD), which allows a direct transfer to a nonprofit, satisfying the RMD requirement without increasing taxable income. Additionally, the funds can be used for legacy planning, such as contributing to a 529 college savings plan for grandchildren. (not investment advice)</p>

          <h2>Core Inflation Sees Largest Monthly Gain in Six Months, Raising Tariff Concerns</h2>
          <div class="timestamp">2025-08-12 09:08:20 EDT</div>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>New government data shows that "core" inflation, which excludes food and energy, rose 0.3% in July, its largest monthly increase in six months. On an annual basis, core prices were up 3.1%, suggesting that President Trump's tariffs may be starting to have a more noticeable impact on consumer costs. While the overall headline inflation rate remained steady at 2.7%, the rise in the core metric, driven by items like transportation and medical services, is a key concern for the Federal Reserve. Analysts note that while a September rate cut is still likely, persistent inflation could complicate future decisions. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>A Vox article argues against the prevailing nostalgia for the 1990s, presenting data to show that the present day is superior in several key aspects. It points out that the 1990s had significantly higher rates of violent crime and murder in the U.S. compared to today. Globally, extreme poverty was far more widespread, and the HIV/AIDS pandemic was a much deadlier crisis. The article also highlights increased social tolerance, as seen in the widespread acceptance of same-sex marriage and interracial relationships, and higher educational attainment rates today, challenging the notion of the '90s as "the good old days."</p>
