          <p>A federal judge has ordered the release of Columbia University graduate and activist Mahmoud Khalil on bail, more than three months after his detention by ICE. Judge Michael Farbiarz determined that Khalil was not a flight risk or a threat to the community, despite arguments from Secretary of State Marco Rubio. The government accused Khalil of failing to disclose information on his residency application, but the judge expressed skepticism about the government's reasons for keeping him detained. Khalil's attorneys argued that his free speech rights were being violated, and the ruling allows him to be reunited with his family while his case continues in court. The White House maintains Khalil engaged in fraud and misrepresentation.</p>

          <p>A federal judge has ordered Secretary of State Marco Rubio, acting as the archivist, to collect any Signal messages belonging to top Trump officials that could be at risk of deletion and refer them to the Department of Justice for review. Judge James Boasberg's order came in response to a lawsuit filed by a watchdog group after the Atlantic published a story revealing the officials' Signal chat discussing plans to conduct airstrikes against the Houthis in Yemen. Boasberg said the Trump officials neglected their duties under the Federal Records Act by allowing the messages to auto-delete. American Oversight indicated it was prepared to sue again if the Trump administration failed to comply with the order.</p>

Many companies don't have explicit dress codes but expect staff to dress professionally and comfortably. Stylists agree that if shorts are allowed, they should be formal, tailored, and not too short, and beach, sports, cargo, and denim shorts are generally not appropriate.</p>

          <p>A satirical article provides humorous guidelines for ICE agents on how to dress in order to avoid appearing accountable to the public. The article suggests that ICE agents should avoid wearing uniforms or anything that identifies them as law enforcement, and instead opt for casual clothing. It encourages agents to express themselves through their clothing, as long as it doesn't reveal their official capacity. The piece mocks the idea that ICE agents should be accountable to the people of the United States or operate under the rule of law.</p>
