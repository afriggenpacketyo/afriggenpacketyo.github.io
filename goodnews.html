          <p>President Donald Trump's second state visit to the U.K. featured prominent engagements with the royal family at Windsor Castle, including a formal farewell with King Charles III. While the President prepared for political meetings with Prime Minister Sir Keir Starmer, First Lady Melania Trump joined Queen Camilla for a tour of royal treasures. The visit was marked by significant pageantry, including a state banquet for 160 guests, which Trump described as one of the highest honors of his life. This event underscores the diplomatic traditions between the two nations amidst high-level political talks.</p>

          <p>The U.K. government has announced £150 billion in investment commitments from U.S. firms, coinciding with President Donald Trump's state visit. This initiative, aimed at creating over 7,600 jobs and strengthening economic ties, includes major pledges from tech giants like Microsoft and Google, as well as a £90 billion commitment from Blackstone. The announcement comes as Prime Minister Keir Starmer and President Trump meet with investors to discuss economic deals. However, this positive development is contrasted by some domestic firms slowing investment and certain pharmaceutical companies halting UK plans, citing a challenging business environment.</p>

          <p>China's National Immigration Administration reported that foreign nationals made 15.89 million visa-free entries between January and August, accounting for approximately two-thirds of all international arrivals. This surge is largely driven by visitors from Southeast Asian countries, with a significant increase noted following a reciprocal visa-free agreement with Malaysia that took effect in July. Since the agreement, Malaysian passport holders have made 180,000 trips to China. The data indicates a successful effort by Beijing to reopen its borders and encourage tourism and business travel post-pandemic.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Despite a year of mixed results and criticism, an optimistic perspective on the U.S. men's national team under coach Mauricio Pochettino is warranted. After a convincing 2-0 victory against Japan, Pochettino defended his experimental approach, arguing that a reset with new players and tactics was necessary to build depth and energy for the upcoming World Cup. While the team has faced key player absences and inconsistent outcomes, the process has allowed new talent to emerge and has fostered a renewed sense of hunger. This long-term strategy may prove beneficial, even if the short-term results have appeared turbulent.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>The city of West Hollywood has become the first in Los Angeles County to prohibit pet stores from selling most live animals, including fish, birds, and reptiles, with the ban taking effect in May 2026. This ordinance expands on a 2010 law that already banned the sale of dogs and cats. Animal welfare organizations like the SPCA and PETA have praised the decision, arguing it combats inhumane breeding mills. However, some industry groups, such as the Pet Advocacy Network, warn that the ban could drive sales to unregulated black markets and harm responsible retailers.</p>

          <p>President Donald Trump's state visit to the U.K. is shifting from ceremonial duties to crucial business talks as he meets with Prime Minister Keir Starmer at Chequers. The agenda is expected to cover finalizing a U.S.-U.K. trade deal, addressing tariffs on British steel, and discussing the wars in Ukraine and the Middle East. The meeting follows a day of royal pageantry at Windsor Castle, which included a state banquet where King Charles praised Trump's commitment to resolving global conflicts. The visit has already yielded significant economic announcements, with £150 billion in U.S. investment pledged to the U.K.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Shares of Novo Nordisk surged after the company announced that its once-daily oral version of Wegovy demonstrated significant weight reduction in a late-stage trial. The results showed patients achieved an average weight loss of 16.6% after 64 weeks, with a safety profile comparable to its popular injectable counterpart. This development positions the Danish pharmaceutical firm to offer patients a choice between a pill and an injection, a key milestone in the competitive market for obesity treatments. The drug is currently under review by the U.S. FDA, with a decision expected later this year. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>England's star full-back, Ellie Kildunne, is set to return to the starting lineup for the highly anticipated Women's Rugby World Cup semi-final against France.

          <p>A federal judge's ruling in the government's antitrust case against Google has attempted to address the company's monopoly in internet search without stifling its competitiveness in the burgeoning field of artificial intelligence. While the ruling imposes some restrictions, such as banning exclusive search engine deals, some analysts fear it does not go far enough to check Google's power, given its vast data advantage for developing AI. The case highlights the limitations of applying century-old antitrust laws to rapidly evolving technology, prompting calls for more proactive and modern regulatory frameworks to govern the AI industry.</p>

          <p>An analysis proposes that restaurant chain Sweetgreen and AI data-labeling company Innodata could potentially achieve higher market valuations than the speculative quantum computing sector within the next three years. The article argues that Sweetgreen has a significant growth runway with its expansion plans and technology integration, despite recent stock performance issues. Meanwhile, Innodata is presented as a profitable and rapidly growing small-cap AI stock in a high-demand market, making it an attractive alternative to the currently revenue-negligible quantum computing industry.

          <p>Chinese tech giant Huawei has announced new AI computing systems powered by its in-house Ascend chips, directly challenging U.S. competitor Nvidia. The company plans to launch its "Atlas 950 SuperCluster" next year, which will connect over 500,000 Ascend chips to overcome U.S. sanctions on advanced semiconductors. A Huawei executive claimed the new system would deliver significantly more computing power than Nvidia's planned offerings. This move underscores China's accelerating push for technological self-reliance and its ambition to become a global leader in artificial intelligence amid escalating tech tensions with the United States.</p>
