          <p>Intel is spinning out its AI robotics and biometrics division into a new, independent company named RealSense, which has secured $50 million in a Series A funding round. The new venture will focus on developing technology for robotics automation, capitalizing on the growing global demand for physical AI and automation tools seen across industries. The move is part of Intel's broader strategy of cost-cutting and restructuring amid intense competition in the AI sector. RealSense, which employs about 130 people, aims to use the new capital to expand its product lines and enhance safety tools for the industry.</p>

          <div class="timestamp">2025-07-11 08:43:19 EDT</div>
        </div>
        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>President Donald Trump has announced that the United States will send Patriot air defense systems and other weapons to Ukraine, with distribution to be handled and paid for by NATO. The decision follows a direct appeal from Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky, who requested ten Patriot systems to counter a recent surge in Russian drone and missile attacks. This move marks a shift after the US had previously paused some critical weapon shipments, raising concerns in Kyiv. The advanced Patriot systems are crucial for Ukraine's ability to defend its cities and critical infrastructure against relentless Russian aerial bombardments.</p>

          <div class="timestamp">2025-07-11 08:38:05 EDT</div>
        </div>
        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>IMAX is poised for its best year on record, with CEO Rich Gelfond forecasting a global box office of $1.2 billion, a 33% increase from 2024. This success is driven by a shift in consumer preference towards premium, event-style experiences and strong partnerships with major film studios for releases like "F1: The Movie." The company's market share is growing, with its screens accounting for over 20% of domestic ticket sales for several major films, despite representing less than 1% of total screens. With a strong slate of upcoming blockbusters and plans to build 500 new theaters, investors have rallied behind the company, pushing its stock up significantly.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>The price of Bitcoin surged to a new record high, briefly topping $118,800, driven by a significant influx of institutional investment into bitcoin exchange-traded funds (ETFs). On Thursday, bitcoin ETFs recorded their largest single-day inflow of 2025, totaling $1.18 billion. The rally was also fueled by expectations of a more dovish Federal Reserve policy and the potential inflationary impact of new government spending, which can make alternative assets like Bitcoin more attractive. This price movement triggered over $650 million in short liquidations, further accelerating the upward trend as traders covered their positions. (not investment advice)</p>

She noted the remarkable progress of Ukraine's accession talks despite the ongoing war, stating the EU is prepared to open all negotiation clusters by year's end. Kos stressed that while the accession process remains merit-based, geopolitical realities have added momentum, and the EU is actively helping candidate countries like Moldova counter Russian disinformation. She acknowledged challenges with candidates like Serbia, particularly regarding the unresolved Kosovo issue, but affirmed the EU's commitment to supporting their path to membership.</p>

According to his record label, the new music is inspired by his experiences as a husband and father, resulting in a more reflective and personal sound. This release comes after Bieber sold the rights to his extensive music catalog in 2023 for an estimated $200 million.</p>

          <p>Goldman Sachs is testing "Devin," an autonomous AI software engineer from the startup Cognition, marking a significant milestone for AI adoption on Wall Street. The bank's technology chief, Marco Argenti, announced that Devin will augment the firm's 12,000 human developers, initially handling tasks like updating internal code. This move signals the arrival of more powerful "agentic AI," which can execute complex, multi-step jobs with minimal human intervention, potentially boosting worker productivity significantly. While the bank frames this as creating a "hybrid workforce," the development fuels ongoing concerns about AI-driven job displacement in the financial sector and beyond.</p>

          <p>Tesla is set to officially enter the Indian market with the launch of an "Experience Center" showroom in Mumbai on July 15. The event marks the U.S. electric vehicle maker's first official foray into the country after years of consideration. The company will likely begin direct sales to Indian customers, importing vehicles from its global factories as it currently has no manufacturing operations in India. Tesla will face challenges from established Chinese rival BYD and local manufacturer Tata Motors, as well as India's high import duties on EVs. The Indian government has offered reduced duties for companies that commit to local investment and manufacturing.</p>

          <p>A new robot designed to automate the process of cotton topping has been debuted in China's Xinjiang region, a key development for the area's massive cotton industry. The machine uses advanced lidar and machine vision to identify and vaporize the plant's top bud with a high-powered laser, a process that redirects nutrients to boost boll formation and yield. Developed by Xinjiang University, the robot reportedly achieves over 82% topping success with minimal plant damage. This innovation aims to improve efficiency and accuracy in a traditionally labor-intensive agricultural task, though it is still in the pilot phase and not yet commercially available.</p>

The company's dominance in cloud computing through Amazon Web Services (AWS) allows it to capitalize on the artificial intelligence boom, while its advertising business has become its fastest-growing segment. The article also points to Amazon's substantial cash reserve of $66 billion as a key asset for funding future innovation and acquisitions. With its stock trading at a price-to-earnings ratio significantly lower than in previous years, the analysis suggests it represents a good value for investors looking for long-term growth.

          <p>A newly discovered interstellar object, named 3I/Atlas, could be the oldest comet ever seen, potentially predating our own solar system by three billion years. It is only the third such object from beyond our solar system to be detected. Astronomers at the University of Oxford believe it originated in the Milky Way's "thick disk," a region of ancient stars, and is likely composed of a large amount of water ice. As it approaches the sun later this year, this ice is expected to vaporize, creating a glowing tail that may be visible from Earth with amateur telescopes, offering a rare glimpse into a distant part of the galaxy.</p>

This approach allows busy founders to deploy funds more quickly and effectively than through traditional foundations.

The annual COLA is a critical feature that helps retiree benefits keep pace with rising prices and is officially calculated based on inflation data from the third quarter of the year.
