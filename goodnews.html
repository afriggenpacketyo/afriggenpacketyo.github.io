          <h2>Danny Murphy Argues Manchester United's Personnel, Not System, Is the Core Problem</h2>

          <p>Football analyst Danny Murphy asserts that Manchester United's ongoing struggles are primarily attributable to player selection and their deployment, rather than the team's 3-4-2-1 formation itself. The article highlights that while the team has shown improved compactness, individual errors, particularly from Bruno Fernandes playing in a deeper central midfield role, are consistently costing them crucial points. Murphy argues that Fernandes' natural defensive instincts are not suited for this position, and other players, like Luke Shaw, appear uncomfortable in their assigned roles. He concludes that the manager's choices regarding personnel within the established system are the fundamental cause of the team's inconsistent performances.</p>

          <p>Buy now, pay later (BNPL) loans, offering interest-free installment payments, are rapidly gaining popularity among consumers, with usage projected to reach 91.5 million Americans by 2025. This article delves into why traditional banks and credit card companies are increasingly wary of the BNPL trend. It highlights that BNPL directly challenges their established revenue streams by diverting transactions and reducing credit card utilization. Furthermore, the opaque nature of BNPL transactions creates a "giant black hole" in assessing consumer credit quality, posing significant risks for financial institutions. The widespread adoption of these alternatives signals a fundamental shift in consumer credit behavior. (not investment advice)</p>
