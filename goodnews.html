          <p>Taylor Swift's representative has denied that the singer had any involvement in creative decisions on ‚ÄúIt Ends With Us,‚Äù a movie starring her friend, Blake Lively, that has been at the center of a legal battle. Swift was reportedly subpoenaed in the lawsuit between director Justin Baldoni and Lively, but her spokesperson stated that her only involvement was licensing her song ‚ÄúMy Tears Ricochet‚Äù for the film. Baldoni's team alleges that Lively and an unnamed celebrity friend pressured him to accept script changes, but Swift's team claims this is a ploy to generate tabloid interest.</p>

          <p>Hawaii has secured a $700 million settlement with pharmaceutical companies over the blood thinner Plavix, resolving a lawsuit regarding its efficacy and safety. The settlement comes after a court ruling that ordered Bristol Myers Squibb Company and Sanofi subsidiaries to pay $916 million. The companies said they are pleased to resolve the litigation and continue focusing on delivering innovative medicines to patients. While the companies did not admit wrongdoing, the lawsuit stemmed from concerns that a significant portion of patients might have a diminished response to Plavix.</p>

Ozturk was arrested after co-authoring an opinion piece critical of Israel, leading to allegations that her detainment violated her constitutional rights.

          <p>A judge temporarily barred the Trump administration from carrying out sweeping cuts and layoffs at over a dozen government agencies, part of a massive federal cost-cutting drive led by Elon Musk's Department of Government Efficiency. U.S. District Judge Susan Illston ruled that the attempts to reorganize and downsize the federal government likely exceed its legal authority. The restraining order blocks affected agencies from laying off staff or putting workers on administrative leave to comply with the executive order.</p>

          <p>Police in Bristol, UK, are focusing on disrupting and criminalizing men who buy sexual services from street sex workers, rather than targeting the women themselves. The Op Boss and Night Light police teams engage with sex workers to offer support and gather information, while also issuing community protection warnings to men caught soliciting. The National Police Chiefs' Council recommends this approach, emphasizing the vulnerability of the women involved. The Night Light team collaborates with charities and the city council to provide additional support and safety measures to sex workers.</p>

          <p>Texas lawmakers are advancing a bill designed to prevent hostile foreign powers from purchasing land in the state. Senate Bill 17 (SB17) targets governments and entities tied to countries like China, Iran, North Korea, and Russia, aiming to prevent them from gaining a foothold on Texas soil. The bill prohibits entities affiliated with governments designated as national security threats from purchasing real estate if it poses risks to public health or safety.

          <p>Hollywood studios are increasingly shifting film productions to the UK due to generous tax incentives and lower labor costs. The British Film Institute reports that a significant portion of UK production spending comes from major US film studios and streaming giants. Tax incentives like the Film Tax Relief offer a 25% tax rebate, making it cheaper to produce films in the UK compared to the US. Examples of films made in the UK include Barbie, Jurassic World: Dominion, and various superhero movies.</p>
