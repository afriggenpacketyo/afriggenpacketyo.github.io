        </div>
        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>The United Kingdom's economy experienced a slight expansion of 0.1% in August, primarily driven by an increase in manufacturing output. This modest growth follows a 0.1% contraction in July, a figure that was revised downward by the Office for National Statistics. While the government views this as positive, economists express caution, warning that the overall outlook remains weak due to slowing wage growth and rising costs for households. Future economic activity may also be dampened by uncertainty surrounding potential tax increases in the upcoming Budget. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing Company (TSMC) announced a record-breaking third-quarter profit, surging 39.1% year-over-year and significantly beating market estimates. The impressive performance is attributed to the sustained high demand for advanced artificial intelligence chips from clients like Nvidia and Apple. Revenue from high-performance computing, which includes AI applications, constituted 57% of sales, with advanced chips of 7-nanometer or smaller making up 74% of total wafer revenue. In response to this strong growth, TSMC has raised its full-year revenue growth forecast for 2025 to the mid-30% range. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>Uruguay's Senate has given final approval to a bill legalizing euthanasia, making it the first country in Latin America to formally pass such a law. The "Dignified Death" bill allows mentally sound adults with terminal, irreversible diseases to choose a medically assisted death administered by a healthcare professional. The legislation, which does not permit assisted suicide, reflects Uruguay's history of socially liberal policies and has strong public support, with over 60% of citizens in favor. The move follows decriminalization efforts in Colombia and Ecuador but sets a new legal precedent for the region.</p>

Key contributions came from Andrés Giménez, Daulton Varsho, George Springer, and Vladimir Guerrero Jr., who all hit home runs in consecutive innings. The win narrows Seattle's series lead to 2-1 and marks a significant offensive turnaround for Toronto.</p>

          <p>Former England and Newcastle United midfielder Jonjo Shelvey has asserted that his recent move to the Arabian Falcons in the UAE's third tier was not motivated by money. Shelvey explained that after an unsuccessful trial at Hull City and a subsequent injury, he accepted the offer to help grow the Dubai-based club and seek a "fresh start" for his family. He expressed concerns about safety and the social climate in the UK as a key reason for the move. The 33-year-old is now combining playing with coaching as he studies for his qualifications.</p>

          <p>Lakers guard Gabe Vincent delivered a standout performance in a preseason game against the Dallas Mavericks, scoring 22 points, including six three-pointers. Vincent was particularly effective in the first quarter, where he scored 18 points by making his first five three-point attempts consecutively. Despite his strong individual effort, the Lakers ultimately lost the game 121-94, largely due to being outscored 37-8 in the final quarter. The game also saw starting forward Jarred Vanderbilt exit early with a left quad contusion after a promising start.</p>

          <p>A 76-year-old hillwalker from Edinburgh, Ian Currie, has shared his story of survival after being lost for eight days in a remote area of the Scottish Highlands. Currie became stranded in perilous weather while attempting a 30-mile trek from Glenfinnan to Knoydart, part of the challenging Cape Wrath Trail. After his tent and phone were soaked, he endured days of exhaustion and extreme cold, believing he might not survive. He was eventually found by the local landowner and deer stalkers after a search was initiated when he failed to arrive at his destination.</p>

          <p>The People's Bank of China (PBOC) has set the yuan's daily midpoint reference rate at its strongest level in a year, fixing it at 7.0968 per US dollar. This move comes amid growing market expectations that the U.S. Federal Reserve may implement further interest rate cuts this year. A Fed governor recently noted that ongoing US-China trade tensions have increased risks to the U.S. economy, strengthening the case for rate reductions. The stronger fixing reflects China's response to these evolving global economic signals and potential shifts in monetary policy. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>Los Angeles Dodgers star Shohei Ohtani took the unusual step of taking batting practice on the field during a workout day, signaling his urgency to break out of a significant postseason slump. Since the start of the playoffs, he is just two-for-25 with 12 strikeouts, a performance his manager acknowledged is not conducive to winning a World Series. Ohtani downplayed the idea that his two-way role as both a pitcher and hitter has contributed to his struggles at the plate. The move to public batting practice is seen as a visible effort to recalibrate his swing.</p>

          <p>A federal judge has issued a temporary restraining order preventing the Trump administration from firing federal employees during the government shutdown. The ruling came in response to a lawsuit filed by two unions after more than 4,000 workers received reduction-in-force notifications. The judge called the firings "unprecedented" and cited President Trump's own social media posts as evidence that the layoffs were intended to punish political opponents by targeting specific agencies. This order provides temporary relief to thousands of workers and challenges the administration's use of the shutdown to enact workforce cuts.</p>

The diary provides a rare and vivid firsthand perspective on the historic event from a non-Western participant.

          <p>The Last Dinner Party, winners of the BBC's Sound of 2024, are releasing their second album, "From The Pyre," which they describe as darker and more grandiose than their debut.

Singer Abigail Morris reveals that some songs explore deep personal themes, including the lingering grief from her father's death as a teenager. The album reflects the band's penchant for theatrical storytelling and complex, multi-layered song structures.</p>
