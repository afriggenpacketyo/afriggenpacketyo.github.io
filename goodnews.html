          <p>President Trump announced a framework for a trade deal with the United Kingdom from the Oval Office. The announcement follows earlier reports of progress in trade negotiations between the two countries. This deal marks the first major trade agreement since Trump's implementation of widespread tariffs, and could potentially ease investor concerns about global trade tensions. The specifics of the agreement are expected to be released soon, and the administration is closely monitoring developments between Pakistan and India after the two nations exchanged fire.</p>

          <p>Shopify's stock experienced a decline of over 5% in early trading due to mixed first-quarter results and cautious guidance for the upcoming period. While the company's earnings per share and revenue surpassed expectations, its projections for gross profit and revenue growth fell slightly short of analyst forecasts. Shopify acknowledges the uncertainty created by President Trump's tariffs on Chinese imports, noting that a small percentage of its gross merchandise volume is affected by the expiration of duty-free shipments from China. The company is actively monitoring data and helping its merchants adapt to potential changes.</p>

          <p>Financial experts suggest that using an inheritance to pay off credit card debt can be a wise move, particularly with high interest rates and significant consumer debt. Paying off debt can provide an immediate and higher return compared to long-term market returns. However, the decision depends on individual financial situations, goals, and other considerations, such as potential claims against the estate or urgent financial needs. It's also crucial to address the root causes of the debt to avoid accumulating it again in the future.</p>

          <p>A Florida federal judge dismissed most of the claims against high-profile celebrities and YouTubers who promoted the now-defunct cryptocurrency exchange FTX. The ruling narrows the scope of a sprawling multidistrict litigation accusing them of using their fame to market a fraudulent platform. The judge ruled that the plaintiffs, a group of FTX investors, failed to demonstrate that the celebrities had sufficient knowledge of FTX and CEO Sam Bankman-Fried's misconduct to be held liable for promoting the exchange. The lawsuit stemmed from FTX's catastrophic collapse in November 2022, which wiped out billions of dollars in customer funds.</p>

          <p>The Bank of England reduced UK interest rates to 4.25% from 4.5%, marking the fourth cut in the past year, driven by a slowdown in inflation. Governor Andrew Bailey cautioned about global economic unpredictability due to US tariffs. The Bank considered a larger cut but balanced this with concerns over a potential global trade war impacting growth, offset by lower energy bills and inflation. This decision aligns with anticipated details of a UK-US tariff deal. Future rate cuts are expected to be gradual, reflecting a divided rate-setting committee.</p>
