          <p>Prime Minister Keir Starmer is defending his leadership and the government's planned vote on welfare reforms despite significant opposition from within the Labour party. Over 120 Labour backbenchers have signed an amendment to scrap the proposals, potentially leading to an embarrassing defeat for the government. Starmer insists the party is united on reforming the welfare system, dismissing criticism as minor distractions, while Deputy Prime Minister Angela Rayner has confirmed the vote will proceed as planned. The proposed changes to the Universal Credit and Personal Independence Payment Bill aim to slow the increase in benefit claimants, but critics argue they will push many into poverty.</p>

          <p>Shares of Flagstar bank experienced a decline after Zohran Mamdani, a New York City mayoral candidate supporting rent freezes, won the Democratic primary. Mamdani's proposal to freeze rent increases in stabilized units has raised concerns about the profitability of multi-family rental properties, impacting Flagstar due to its significant exposure to New York City real estate. Analysts estimate that a substantial portion of Flagstar's multi-family loan portfolio is subject to New York rent regulations, potentially affecting the bank's financial performance, though some analysts believe the current rent regulations are already keeping price hikes below the pace of cost increases (not investment advice).</p>

Options include transferring balances to a 0% APR credit card, paying the balance in full each month to utilize the grace period, using a 0% APR introductory offer for new purchases with careful planning, enrolling in a credit card hardship program, and requesting a temporary rate reduction. The key is to act quickly and commit to a realistic repayment plan to avoid compounding interest charges (not investment advice).</p>

          <p>The 2025 Glastonbury Festival has officially begun as thousands of attendees poured onto Worthy Farm after the gates opened. Festival co-founder Sir Michael Eavis and his daughter Emily Eavis led the countdown, marking the start of the five-day event. Over 200,000 people are expected to attend, enjoying music, circus performances, theater, and other attractions. Despite the expected traffic, travel routes to the festival have remained relatively clear, with attendees arriving by train, coach, and bike.</p>
