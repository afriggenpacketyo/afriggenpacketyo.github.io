          <p>A significant archaeological discovery has been made near Zhaling Lake in China's Qinghai province, at an altitude of 4,300 meters. Researchers have found a stone carving believed to be the only one left by Emperor Qin Shi Huang that remains at its original site. The inscription details a journey to the source of the Yellow River, fueling speculation that it is connected to the emperor's legendary search for the elixir of life. Archaeologists from the Chinese Academy of Social Sciences have hailed the finding as the most complete and significant carving from that era, offering new insights into the Qin dynasty.</p>

          <h2>Analysis: UK Prime Minister's Scotland Meeting with Trump Offers Invaluable but Risky Access</h2>
          <div class="timestamp">2025-07-28 20:40:17 EDT</div>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>President Trump's recent visit to his Scottish golf courses provided UK Prime Minister Keir Starmer with significant, albeit unconventional, diplomatic face time. The trip, though notionally private, involved extensive and free-wheeling interactions with the press, covering a wide range of topics from trade to Gaza. For Starmer, this access is seen as invaluable for building a relationship with the unpredictable U.S. president. However, it also carries clear political risks, forcing the prime minister to navigate Trump's unfiltered style while carefully articulating his own positions on key international issues.</p>

          <p>USC offensive lineman DJ Wingfield has filed a lawsuit against the NCAA after the organization denied his waiver request for a final season of eligibility. Wingfield, who transferred to USC for his last year, is challenging the NCAA's "Five-Year Rule," arguing its denial is anticompetitive and robs him of a significant NIL opportunity. The lawsuit claims his collegiate career was disrupted by the pandemic and a season-ending injury, circumstances he believes should have warranted an exemption. This legal battle places Wingfield's football future in the hands of a federal judge and adds to the growing list of antitrust challenges facing the NCAA.</p>

          <p>CNBC's Jim Cramer suggests that President Trump's major trade deal with the European Union failed to spark a market rally due to "tariff ennui" and other pressing investor concerns. He argues that Wall Street has become accustomed to Trump's negotiating pattern of threatening high tariffs before settling for a less severe deal with added incentives. Furthermore, investors are currently more focused on this week's Big Tech earnings reports, the upcoming Federal Reserve meeting on interest rates, and Friday's employment data. These factors have overshadowed the trade news, keeping the market's attention fixed on domestic economic indicators. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>In a landmark ruling, former Colombian President Álvaro Uribe has been convicted of bribery and witness tampering by a court in Bogota. The case, which marks the first time a former president in Colombia has been found guilty in a criminal court, found that Uribe attempted to persuade a jailed ex-paramilitary not to testify about his alleged ties to illegal right-wing groups. The 73-year-old, who led the country from 2002 to 2010, could face up to 12 years in prison.

Bader is a premium defender who is also having a solid offensive season, making him an attractive target.

Legal experts note that while the case didn't set new legal precedent, it served as a cultural turning point for media law in the internet age. It reinforced the limits of First Amendment protections regarding privacy and demonstrated that even newsworthy events do not grant the right to publish graphic, private content.</p>
