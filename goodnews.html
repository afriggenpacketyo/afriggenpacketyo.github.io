          <p>Microsoft has committed to unbundling its Office 365 and Microsoft 365 software suites from its Teams communication app to address competition concerns raised by European regulators. The European Commission expressed concerns about the tying of Teams to Microsoft's productivity tools. To alleviate these concerns, Microsoft will offer versions of Office 365 and Microsoft 365 without Teams at a reduced price and allow customers to switch to tools without Teams under existing contracts. Microsoft will also enhance interoperability for Teams' competitors and enable customers to move their data out of Teams to competing products.</p>

This decision comes as Novo Nordisk's share price has declined significantly over the past year due to increasing competition in the obesity drug market and disappointing trial results for its next-generation treatments.

This decline coincides with Germany's new interior minister, Alexander Dobrindt, pushing for increased border checks, instructing police to turn back asylum-seekers, with exceptions for vulnerable individuals. Dobrindt insists that the new border checks are effective, while critics from the left-wing question the legality of these measures and their impact on police officers.</p>

Same-store sales grew by 10.8%, driven by a 7.5% increase in traffic, indicating strong consumer demand for the Mediterranean chain's offerings. Diners are reportedly trading up from fast food and down from casual-dining restaurants into Cava's bowls and pitas, according to Chief Financial Officer Tricia Tolivar. Despite the positive performance, Cava reiterated its same-store sales forecast of a 6% to 8% increase for the fiscal year, anticipating slower growth in the latter half of 2025.</p>

Sixty percent of the 300,000 tons of reserve rice to be released over three months through July will be directed to retailers. The government aims to encourage distributors to participate in auctions by extending the buyback deadline from one year to five years.

          <p>President Trump's deals to sell advanced computer chips to the U.A.E. and Saudi Arabia have sparked debate within the U.S. government over whether the administration is outsourcing the future of the A.I. industry.

          <p>The Supreme Court heard arguments regarding whether President Trump can end birthright citizenship, focusing on the broader issue of whether a single lower-court judge can block presidential policies nationwide. The administration argues that courts should only apply injunctions to individual cases, while others contend that this would burden the public and the courts. The justices explored potential compromises, such as limiting universal injunctions to specific circumstances. The decision could significantly impact the power of the judicial branch to check the president's agenda.</p>
