          <p>Fair Isaac Corporation, the company behind the FICO credit score, experienced a significant stock rally after announcing a new business model that allows it to license credit scores directly to mortgage lenders. This change aims to bypass credit bureaus, potentially eliminating mark-ups and giving lenders more choice in their pricing models. The move was seen as a major disruption, causing shares of credit bureaus like Experian, TransUnion, and Equifax to fall. The new strategy is expected to improve FICO's own financial performance while potentially making the mortgage process more competitive. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>As part of a global trend toward modernizing border security, Taiwan is now requiring all visitors, including those from the U.S. and mainland China, to apply for a digital arrival card. The free application must be submitted three days before travel and requires passport details, contact information, and accommodation plans. This new procedure aims to streamline the entry process and enhance security oversight for the millions of tourists who visit the island annually. The shift reflects a broader international move towards digital systems, similar to the new Entry/Exit System being implemented in several European countries.</p>

The initiative, run by the Philadelphia Visitor Center, encourages residents to share their passion for the city and promote its positive aspects.

          <p>Tesla announced it delivered 497,099 vehicles in the third quarter, a 7% increase compared to the same period last year, narrowly beating analyst expectations. The rise in U.S. sales was partly driven by customers rushing to purchase vehicles before a key federal EV tax credit expired. Despite the delivery increase, production saw a slight decline, and the company continues to face challenges from a sales slump in Europe and growing competition. The company also reported significant growth in its energy storage business, deploying 12.5 GWh of its battery products. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>The captain of the oil tanker Boracay, believed to be part of Russia's "shadow fleet" used to circumvent sanctions, has been charged in France for refusing to comply with naval orders. The vessel, which has frequently changed its name and flag, was boarded by the French navy as it was subject to EU sanctions for transporting Russian oil. This shadow fleet, estimated to comprise hundreds of tankers, is allegedly used by Moscow to export its oil despite international restrictions imposed after the invasion of Ukraine. The captain, a Chinese national, is scheduled for a court hearing next year.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>While hundreds of thousands of federal employees face furloughs and delayed paychecks due to the government shutdown, members of Congress will continue to receive their salaries. This is because their compensation is mandated by the Constitution and funded through a permanent appropriation that does not require annual renewal, a system established in 1983. In contrast, most federal agencies are governed by the Antideficiency Act, which prohibits spending without congressional approval, leading to the furlough of non-essential personnel. Congressional staffers, however, will see their pay delayed until the shutdown ends.</p>

The average HELOC rate has dropped below 8%, down from nearly 10% a year ago, making it a competitive option for accessing large sums of cash. For a $70,000 HELOC with a 15-year repayment period, the monthly payment is now approximately $664, a savings of over $30 per month compared to last fall.
