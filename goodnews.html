          <p>Emerging markets stocks are gaining attention as the 'sell U.S.' narrative gains momentum, spurred by Moody's downgrade of the U.S. credit rating. Bank of America has touted emerging markets as 'the next bull market,' citing a weaker U.S. dollar, a peak in U.S. bond yields, and China's economic recovery. JPMorgan upgraded emerging market equities due to thawing U.S.-China trade tensions and attractive valuations. The MSCI Emerging Markets Index has outperformed the S&P 500 year-to-date, reflecting dented confidence in U.S. assets. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>Sixteen European consumer groups have urged the European Union to take action against seven low-cost airlines, including Ryanair and EasyJet, over additional baggage fees. The groups accuse the airlines of misleading passengers and creating confusion and distress at check-ins, arguing that these practices breach EU consumer law. They are seeking an investigation by the European Commission and national consumer authorities, demanding sanctions for the illegal practices. The consumer groups believe a standard luggage allowance should be included in the ticket purchase.</p>
