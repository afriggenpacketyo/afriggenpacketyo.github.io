          <p>J.D. Power has released its 2025 North American Airport Satisfaction Study, which evaluates "mega airports" based on factors like ease of travel, terminal facilities, and staff performance. The study, based on surveys from over 30,000 travelers, indicates that overall passenger satisfaction remains high despite record travel volumes. An expert from J.D. Power noted that while the ongoing government shutdown is affecting air travel, its impact on these satisfaction rankings has not yet been significant, though travelers should still prepare for potential delays.</p>

          <p>A commentary article praises two federal district court judges for their decisions to block President Trump's attempts to deploy the National Guard to Portland and Chicago. The judges ruled that the administration's rationale, which described the cities as "war-ravaged," was factually unsupported and not conceived in good faith. The article contrasts their judicial courage with what it characterizes as the Supreme Court's excessive deference to Trump, arguing these lower court rulings are crucial for upholding constitutional law and preserving American democracy.</p>
