          <div class="timestamp">2025-08-14 05:00:08 EDT</div>
        </div>
        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Researchers in China have developed a new genomic tool that could significantly improve the early detection of pancreatic cancer, one of the most lethal forms of the disease. The technology, called "Uni-C," can perform a comprehensive DNA analysis from a simple blood test in less than a day. By decoding multiple layers of genomic information from rare circulating tumor cells, the method provides deep insights that could be used for early screening, monitoring treatment, and developing personalized therapies. This breakthrough promises a non-invasive and rapid alternative to traditional biopsies.</p>

          <h2>New Research Suggests 7,000 Daily Steps is an Optimal Target for Health Benefits</h2>

        </div>
        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>A comprehensive review of global health data suggests that aiming for 7,000 steps per day is a realistic and highly beneficial target for improving health and longevity. The study, published in The Lancet, found that reaching this number was associated with a nearly 50% lower risk of dying compared to taking just 2,000 steps. This target also correlated with significantly lower risks of cancer, type 2 diabetes, and dementia. While exceeding 7,000 steps provides some additional benefit, researchers noted diminishing returns, positioning this number as a more achievable goal than the popular but unscientific 10,000-step standard.</p>

          <p>The United Kingdom's economy expanded by 0.3% in the second quarter of the year, a slowdown from the previous quarter but still better than the 0.1% growth that economists had forecast. According to the Office for National Statistics, the services and construction sectors were the primary drivers of this expansion. Despite the positive surprise, analysts express caution, noting that the weak global economy and the full impact of recent tax rises may hinder growth in the coming months. The government acknowledged the positive figures but stated more work is needed to strengthen the economy.</p>

          <p>Nicholas Rossi, who faked his death and fled to Scotland under an alias to avoid prosecution, has been found guilty of sexually assaulting a former girlfriend in 2008. After being extradited back to the U.S., a Salt Lake County jury convicted him following a trial where the victim testified about the assault. Rossi was originally identified through a DNA analysis of a rape kit backlog in 2018 and maintained he was a victim of mistaken identity. He now faces a sentence of five years to life in prison and another trial for a separate sexual assault charge.</p>

          <p>The United States has officially designated the Balochistan Liberation Army (BLA) as a foreign terrorist organization, a move that analysts believe could create an opportunity for counterterrorism cooperation between the U.S. and China. The BLA has been responsible for attacks in Pakistan, often targeting Chinese nationals and projects associated with the Belt and Road Initiative. By taking this step, Washington is addressing a security concern shared by Beijing, potentially opening a rare window for collaboration through Pakistan, despite broader strategic rivalries between the two global powers.</p>

          <p>Students across the UK are receiving their A-level and BTEC qualification results, which are crucial for university admissions and future career paths. BTecs are practical, vocational qualifications graded from Pass to Starred Distinction, while A-levels use a letter-grade system, with exam boards setting grade boundaries annually. For students who did not get their desired grades, options include appealing the results, resitting exams, or using the UCAS clearing system to find available university course vacancies. The government recently confirmed continued funding for many BTEC courses, preserving them as a key educational pathway.</p>

          <p>A podcast episode revisits the origins and significance of the 25th Amendment to the U.S. Constitution, which clarifies the procedures for presidential succession and disability. The amendment was championed by lawyer John Feerick in the years before John F. Kennedy's assassination, who recognized a critical gap in the Constitution regarding what should happen if a president becomes unable to serve. This piece of legislation provides a clear framework for the transfer of power, an essential component of ensuring governmental stability. The discussion highlights the foresight and effort required to address this crucial constitutional ambiguity.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>The Supreme Court of South Korea has rejected a copyright infringement claim against the creators of the viral children's song "Baby Shark." U.S. composer Jonathan Wright had alleged that the 2015 hit by The Pinkfong Company copied his 2011 version of the song. However, the court upheld lower court rulings, stating that Wright's rendition was not original enough to warrant copyright protection. The court affirmed that both versions are based on a traditional American summer camp chant that is in the public domain.</p>

          <p>The NBA has unanimously approved the sale of the Boston Celtics to a group led by private equity executive Bill Chisholm, in a deal that values the franchise at a record $6.1 billion. This is the highest price ever paid for an American professional sports team, surpassing the $6.05 billion for the NFL's Washington Commanders. The new ownership group will acquire at least 51% of the team, with the transaction expected to close shortly. The sale marks the end of an era for the previous ownership group, which bought the team for $360 million in 2002 and oversaw two NBA championships.</p>
