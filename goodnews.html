          <p>This article highlights two uplifting stories of resilience and serendipity. Two childhood cancer survivors, who were treated for the same leukemia 17 years ago, have unexpectedly reunited as first-year medical students, inspiring them to become the kind of doctors who once saved their lives. In a separate account, an Arkansas hairstylist's sharp observation during a routine appointment led to the early detection of skin cancer on her client's scalp, ultimately saving her life. Both narratives underscore the profound impact of shared experiences and the life-changing importance of attentiveness in everyday situations.</p>

          <p>Conservative media network Newsmax has agreed to a $67 million settlement with Dominion Voting Systems to resolve a defamation lawsuit. The suit alleged that Newsmax knowingly spread false claims about Dominion's voting machines rigging the 2020 presidential election. This settlement follows a similar, much larger payment made by Fox News and another substantial settlement from Newsmax to a different voting machine company. Despite the agreement, Newsmax maintains its coverage was fair and balanced, while internal documents revealed during the case showed that network officials were aware the election fraud claims were baseless.</p>

          <p>The US Open's mixed doubles tournament has been revamped this year, attracting a star-studded lineup of the world's top singles players, including Carlos Alcaraz, Iga Swiatek, and Novak Djokovic. By moving the event to the week before the main draw and increasing the prize money to $1 million for the winners, the tournament has generated significant buzz, though it has also drawn criticism from doubles specialists who were pushed out. The new format aims to elevate the profile of mixed doubles, with many top players expressing excitement and a competitive desire to win despite its exhibition-like feel.</p>

          <p>With two weeks remaining in the summer transfer window, Premier League clubs have already spent £2.26 billion on new players, putting them on course to break the previous record of £2.36 billion set in 2023. This spending far outpaces other top European leagues, with English top-flight clubs having a net spend of over £1 billion more than they have received in sales. The market has been fueled by several clubs breaking their own transfer records, including Liverpool's potential British record signing of Florian Wirtz, highlighting the immense financial power of the Premier League.

          <p>Labor Day, a federal holiday celebrating the achievements of American workers, will be observed this year on Monday, September 1. Originating from the labor movement's fight for better working conditions in the late 19th century, the holiday now marks the unofficial end of summer for many. While most major retailers and grocery stores will remain open, government offices, the U.S. Postal Service, banks, and the stock market will be closed. Costco is also among the businesses that will be closed in observance of the holiday, so consumers should plan accordingly.</p>

          <p>A new study reveals that the availability of over-the-counter birth control pills is successfully reaching its target demographic by reducing barriers to access. Research published in JAMA Network Open found that nearly a third of people using the OTC pill had previously used no contraceptive method at all. Furthermore, a significant portion switched from less-effective methods like condoms. The study indicates that those obtaining the pill without a prescription were more likely to be uninsured, younger, and living in rural areas, underscoring its role in promoting reproductive autonomy for those facing the greatest obstacles to healthcare.</p>

          <h2>Experts Advise Reinvesting Stock Dividends to Harness the Power of Compound Interest</h2>
          <div class="timestamp">2025-08-18 13:28:56 EDT</div>
        </div>
        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Financial experts recommend that investors utilize dividend reinvestment plans (DRIPs) as a simple and effective strategy to boost long-term returns through compound interest. A DRIP automatically uses the cash dividends paid by a stock to purchase more shares of that same stock, often including fractional shares. This passive approach ensures that money is consistently put to work, steadily growing an investment over time. For example, over a recent 10-year period, the S&P 500 ETF (SPY) saw a total return of 239% with dividends reinvested, compared to just 185% based on price return alone. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>Ismael "El Mayo" Zambada, a long-time and influential leader of Mexico's Sinaloa cartel, is scheduled to plead guilty in a Brooklyn federal court to a range of charges including drug trafficking, money laundering, and conspiracy to commit murder.

Under his leadership with co-founder "El Chapo" Guzmán, the Sinaloa cartel became one of the world's largest and most violent drug trafficking organizations.

        </div>
        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Experts suggest that while homeowners can qualify for a reverse mortgage at age 62, the best time to take one out is often later, typically in one's late 60s or early 70s. The amount of equity a borrower can access increases with age, as lenders factor in a shorter life expectancy and thus less time for interest to accrue. The decision should also depend on a retiree's immediate income needs, long-term goals, and commitment to aging in place. A reverse mortgage can be a useful tool to supplement a fixed income or delay drawing on other retirement assets. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>State health officials in Texas have officially declared that this year's measles outbreak, which sickened 762 people, is over. The declaration was made after 42 days—double the virus's maximum incubation period—passed without a new reported case in the affected counties. The outbreak, centered in West Texas, resulted in the deaths of two unvaccinated children. The Texas Department of State Health Services credited the containment to the tireless work of public health professionals in testing, vaccination, and public education efforts, but warned that providers should remain vigilant for new cases.</p>
