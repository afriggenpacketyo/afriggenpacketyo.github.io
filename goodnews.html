          <p>Simon Yates, a British cyclist, delivered an exceptional performance in the Giro d'Italia's penultimate stage, overtaking Isaac del Toro to claim his second Grand Tour title. Yates's Visma-Lease A Bike team strategically positioned Wout van Aert in the breakaway group, enabling Yates to catch him on the descent and build a significant lead over the final 30km. Yates's victory marks him as the third British rider to win the Giro, following Chris Froome and Tao Geoghegan Hart. The emotional win came after Yates overcame the challenges of the Colle delle Finestre, where his hopes had previously been dashed in 2018, and he expressed his gratitude towards his team after the race.</p>
