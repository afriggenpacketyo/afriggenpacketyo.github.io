          <p>Nvidia reported strong earnings and revenue, driven by a 73% year-over-year increase in its data center business, which includes AI chips and related components. The company's overall revenue grew by 69%, with data center sales reaching $39.1 billion, constituting 88% of total sales. Nvidia anticipates $45 billion in sales for the current quarter, although this guidance is lower than initially projected due to export restrictions on China-bound H20 chips. The gaming division also experienced substantial growth, increasing by 42% to $3.8 billion. The article demonstrates Nvidia's continued dominance in the AI chip market, driven by the demand for AI infrastructure. </p>

          <p>Consolidating credit card debt in June 2025 could be a smart financial move due to several factors, including high credit card interest rates and the potential for lower rates on alternative options like home equity borrowing products. Credit card interest rates are likely to remain high, while rates on HELOCs have declined, making them a viable consolidation option. Additionally, the compounding interest on credit card debt makes it crucial to act proactively to reduce the principal balance.
