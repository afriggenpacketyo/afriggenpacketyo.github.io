          <p>Archaeologists in Warsaw have unearthed significant remnants of Villa Regia, a magnificent 17th-century Polish royal palace, from the Vistula River. The palace was looted and destroyed during the Swedish Deluge, a devastating mid-1600s invasion where a vessel carrying stolen valuables sank as Swedish troops attempted to flee. The recovered artifacts, including large architectural elements and a previously unknown pillar capital, are considered invaluable for reconstructing the historic residence. These findings will help the Museum of Polish History tell the story of the Polish-Lithuanian Commonwealth's former power and its subsequent crisis.</p>

          <p>Despite persistent global hunger, true famines have become far less common due to significant agricultural advancements over the last century. The world is projected to produce a record amount of grain this year, continuing a long-term trend of increasing food availability per person and crop yields per acre. This progress is attributed to the Green Revolution, the development of synthetic fertilizers, expanded irrigation, and improved global trade logistics. However, challenges remain, as modern famines are now primarily caused by political failures, conflict, and climate change rather than crop failure.</p>

          <p>Jennifer Choate, a 27-year-old woman, survived an amniotic fluid embolism, a rare and often fatal complication of childbirth where amniotic fluid enters the bloodstream and causes major organ failure. During what began as a normal induced labor, her heart suddenly stopped, prompting an emergency C-section that successfully delivered her daughter. After being resuscitated and stabilized, Choate spent nine days in intensive care, driven to recover by the desire to be with her newborn. Her story highlights the unpredictable dangers of childbirth and the remarkable efforts of the medical team that saved both her and her baby.</p>

          <p>The Sudan Emergency Response Rooms (ERRs), a network of thousands of local volunteers, have been providing critical humanitarian aid since the country's civil war began in April 2023. Considered a front-runner for the Nobel Peace Prize, the group organizes food, shelter, and medical support for millions of displaced Sudanese people. The ERRs operate on the Sudanese principle of "nafeer," or collective action, coordinating logistics through online chats and local organizers on the ground. Despite challenges like unreliable communication and risks to volunteers, the network embodies a grassroots effort to sustain communities and lay a foundation for future civil society.</p>

        </div>
        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>In his new book, "The Art of Spending Money," author Morgan Housel argues that building and maintaining wealth is a two-part equation: what you have minus what you want. He emphasizes that spending decisions are highly personal and should be aligned with internal values rather than external benchmarks like social status or impressing others. Housel advises that true contentment comes from controlling one's desires and focusing on long-term compounding rather than chasing quick riches, a mindset often fueled by a fear of missing out. He suggests people ask themselves how they would live if no one was watching to better understand their genuine values.</p>

          <p>The new play "littleboy/littleman," by Rudi Goblen, presents the story of two immigrant brothers from Nicaragua with a unique, performance-art style infused with live music and hip-hop poetry. The drama centers on the conflict between the older, pragmatic Bastian and his younger, dreamer brother Fito, as they navigate life and identity in Sweetwater, Florida. Staged immersively at the Geffen Playhouse, the production breaks the fourth wall, creating a direct connection with the audience. The review praises the dynamic acting and emotionally truthful portrayal of the brothers' bond, even as it notes that the freestyle, jazz-like structure doesn't always smoothly integrate every element.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>To combat the ecological damage caused by invasive black carp in Louisiana, officials and advocates are promoting a novel solution: eating them. The voracious, mollusk-eating fish disrupts the native food web and reproduces rapidly, making it a significant threat. French chef Philippe Parola is leading an effort to convince Americans to add the nutritious, protein-rich fish to their diets, despite challenges like its free-floating bones and low market price for fishers. This culinary approach is part of a two-pronged strategy that also includes developing AI-powered software to detect and monitor the invasive species more effectively.</p>
