          <p>Maine legislators are considering a bill that would prohibit hotels from providing single-use plastic containers for personal health or beauty products, such as shampoo and other toiletries. The proposed law aims to reduce waste by mandating lodging establishments to use larger, refillable containers instead of small, single-use bottles. The ban would initially apply to hotels with more than 50 rooms in 2030 and expand to smaller establishments by 2032, with non-compliant hotels facing a $100 fine. Several major hotel chains have already begun transitioning to larger, pump-topped bottles to reduce plastic waste, and similar laws are already in effect in New York, California, and Illinois. </p>

          <p>A Chinese military drone factory has implemented robots to replace master technicians in the production of drone components. The robots, equipped with precision parallel mechanisms and real-time sensors, can perform tasks such as drilling with greater speed and accuracy than humans. This technological advancement has transformed the production line, reducing errors and increasing efficiency. The move reflects a broader trend towards unmanned and intelligent operations in global military manufacturing. </p>

          <h2>Robinhood Shares Drop After Failure to Join S&P 500</h2>
          <div class="timestamp">2025-06-09 08:59:48 EDT</div>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Shares of Robinhood declined after the online brokerage was not selected to join the S&P 500 in the latest quarterly rebalance. The stock had rallied in anticipation of the inclusion, which was expected to trigger significant trading volume and passive fund investments. Despite the setback, Robinhood's shares have doubled in price this year amid a rebound in both stocks and crypto. The company had fallen out of favor after the GameStop trading mania of 2021 fizzled and the collapse of FTX triggered a sell-off in digital assets. </p>
