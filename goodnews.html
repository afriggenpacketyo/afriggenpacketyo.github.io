        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>The UK economy demonstrated resilience by growing at a rate of 0.7% in the first three months of 2025, surpassing analysts' predictions of 0.6%. According to the Office for National Statistics, this growth was primarily fueled by the UK's robust services sector, with significant contributions from production as well. Chancellor Rachel Reeves hailed these figures as evidence of the UK economy's underlying strength and future potential. This growth signals a positive start to the year despite ongoing global economic uncertainties.</p>

        </div>
        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Denmark's economy experienced a boom in 2024, largely attributed to an exceptional surge in pharmaceutical exports, particularly from Novo Nordisk's popular drugs Ozempic and Wegovy. While the International Monetary Fund anticipates a moderation in Denmark's economic output in the coming years, it suggests that potential U.S. tariffs on pharmaceutical imports will have a limited impact. This is because most Danish drug products are not produced within the country but rather through a "merchanting and processing" system, where manufacturing is contracted to other nations. The article notes that the IMF expects medium-term growth to stabilize around 1.5% as the pharmaceutical sector matures. </p>

          <p>A manuscript held by Harvard Law School, previously thought to be a copy of the Magna Carta, has been identified as an extremely rare original dating back to 1300. British researchers determined its authenticity based on handwriting analysis and document size, aligning it with the six other known originals from King Edward I's Confirmation of the Charters. The document, purchased by Harvard in the 1940s for a mere $27.50, is now celebrated as a cornerstone of freedoms and a significant piece of constitutional history. This discovery highlights the importance of preserving and studying historical documents.</p>

          <p>The Kurdistan Worker's Party (PKK) has announced its intention to disband after 41 years of armed conflict with the Turkish state, a move that could significantly alter Turkey's political landscape. While the decision has been met with cautious optimism, questions remain about the logistics of disarmament, the fate of PKK members, and the potential for a new organization to emerge. Experts suggest that this development could lead to a more democratic constitution and detente, but the government's commitment to these changes remains uncertain. The article also explores the potential impact on neighboring countries, particularly Syria, where the SDF's fighters could be integrated into Syria's new national army.</p>

          <p>The Japanese government is contemplating doubling the release of its stockpiled rice to address near-record high prices. This consideration involves releasing 100,000 tons of reserve rice monthly for three months through July, supplementing the 321,000 tons already auctioned. The price surge is attributed to a poor harvest in 2023 and increased rice consumption by tourists. Lawmakers are also exploring relaxing the buyback requirement for distributors to encourage greater participation in auctions, aiming to stabilize rice prices and ensure adequate supply.</p>

          <p>A manuscript held in Harvard Law School's library for 80 years, once thought to be a copy, has been identified as an original 1300 version of the Magna Carta. Two British academics made the discovery, noting that the document has resurfaced at a time when Harvard is under pressure from the Trump administration. The manuscript's value is difficult to estimate, but a similar version sold for $21.3 million in 2007. This discovery underscores the significance of preserving historical documents and the importance of the rule of law.</p>
