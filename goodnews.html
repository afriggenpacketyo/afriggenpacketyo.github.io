          <p>Boeing and GE Aerospace secured a $96 billion agreement with Qatar Airways for up to 210 aircraft, marking Boeing's largest-ever widebody and 787 order. The deal, which includes 787 Dreamliners and 777X aircraft powered by GE engines, was finalized during President Donald Trump's state visit with the emir of Qatar. The White House estimates the agreement will support 154,000 U.S. jobs annually and over 1 million domestic jobs during production and delivery.
