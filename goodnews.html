          <p>Pharmaceutical company AvKare has issued a voluntary recall on several of its over-the-counter products for dry and irritated eyes after an audit by the Food and Drug Administration found regulatory "deviations." The company is recalling five products, including lubricant eye drops and eye gels. Customers are eligible for a full refund on their affected products. This action follows other recent recalls of over-the-counter eye treatments due to contamination issues. </p>
