The display includes the original 1937 English version, the first U.S. edition, and the earliest Chinese translation from 1938. Snow's book was a groundbreaking work of journalism, offering the Western world one of its first detailed accounts of the Chinese Communist Party's leadership, including interviews with Mao Zedong, based on his time embedded with the Red Army in the 1930s.</p>

          <p>Twenty years after Hurricane Katrina devastated New Orleans, personal accounts from a mother, a surgeon, and the former police chief reveal stories of profound loss and resilience. The hurricane caused nearly 1,400 deaths and displaced over a million people, but many who returned have found strength and new opportunities in the city's recovery. These survivors recall the chaos of the storm's aftermath, from being stranded on bridges to keeping hospital patients alive without power, highlighting both the deep trauma and the enduring hope that has shaped their lives.</p>

          <p>Two decades after Hurricane Katrina, New Orleans is still grappling with the mass firing of over 4,000 predominantly Black public school teachers, which occurred during the shift to a state-run charter school system. Before the storm, 71% of the city's educators were Black; that number has only recovered to 56%, impacting a student body that is over 90% Black. Black-led organizations like Black Education for New Orleans (Be Nola) are now working to rebuild this workforce through professional development and support programs, aiming to restore community ties and provide role models for students.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>A personal finance reporter details the unexpected costs and timelines involved in purchasing a wedding dress, offering advice for future brides. She learned that ordering a dress less than nine to ten months before the wedding can incur significant "rush fees," which in her case would have been an extra $500. The article recommends creating a comprehensive "attire budget" rather than just a "dress budget" to account for overlooked expenses like veils, accessories, and alterations, which can substantially increase the total cost. Proper planning and early shopping are emphasized as crucial for staying within budget.</p>

          <h2>Author Virginia Sole-Smith Discusses Anti-Diet Approaches to Children's Nutrition</h2>
          <div class="timestamp">2025-08-30 07:00:00 EDT</div>
        </div>
        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>In an interview, author Virginia Sole-Smith challenges the growing anxiety around children's diets, particularly concerns about ultra-processed foods and childhood obesity. She argues that restricting food can be harmful and that obsessing over body size has not made children healthier, instead contributing to disordered eating. Sole-Smith advocates for focusing on food access and removing stress from eating, suggesting that when children have enough to eat and autonomy over their choices, nutritional needs tend to balance out. This approach fosters a healthier relationship with food and respects a child's bodily autonomy.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Newcastle United has officially completed the signing of 23-year-old German international striker Nick Woltemade from Stuttgart for a club record fee of up to £69 million. The six-year contract surpasses the previous record set by Alexander Isak's transfer three years ago. Woltemade, who stands at 6ft 6in, had a breakout season with Stuttgart, scoring 17 goals and winning the German Cup. His signing is a significant move for Newcastle, especially given the ongoing speculation about the potential departure of current striker Isak.</p>

          <p>A 32-foot motor home that traveled across the U.S. for the Boy Scouts' centennial celebration in 2009 is set to become a permanent exhibit at the World Scouting Museum in West Virginia. Before its journey to the museum, the RV, which is wrapped in scouting logos and imagery, is being displayed at the Michigan State Fair. Organized by retired Army lieutenant colonel Frank Mallon, the original road trip was called "A Century of Values." The RV will serve as both a stationary exhibit and a roving mini-museum to promote scouting in rural areas.</p>

          <p>China is deepening its security cooperation in Africa through its Global Security Initiative (GSI), recently providing military training to Somali soldiers in an effort to help the nation build a self-reliant defense force against the extremist group al-Shabab. This follows another GSI-backed program where Somali security officials received law enforcement and border security training in China. These efforts align with Beijing's strategic interests in the region, including anti-piracy operations in the Gulf of Aden, and represent China's push to offer an alternative model for international peace and security.</p>

          <p>Following the effective shutdown of the government's climate.gov website by the Trump administration, many of its former team members are launching a new nonprofit initiative called climate.us. The original site, a key public resource for climate science, was intentionally buried by new leadership at the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration. The resurrected effort, led by former managing editor Rebecca Lindsey, aims not only to restore access to vital climate information but also to expand its mission to offer direct services, such as helping local governments with climate-related risk mapping.</p>

          <p>The Ndlovu Youth Choir from South Africa has released a Zulu-language version of Queen's classic song "Bohemian Rhapsody," marking the first time the band has ever authorized a translation of the iconic anthem. The project received the blessing of Queen's surviving members and the Mercury Phoenix Trust, coinciding with the song's 50th anniversary. The choir's artistic director was inspired by the fact that Freddie Mercury was born in Zanzibar, Tanzania. The new arrangement incorporates African musical traditions, such as isicathamiya and kwassa kwassa, while preserving the song's original message.</p>

Since taking office, Newsom has approved 160 commutations and 247 pardons, which restore certain rights to former felons.</p>

          <p>Preliminary data from the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention shows that fatal drug overdoses in the U.S. have been declining steadily since mid-2023, reaching their lowest point in five years. Despite this significant drop, President Trump has continued to frame the fentanyl crisis as a growing threat to justify policies such as mandatory minimum sentences and trade tariffs. Public health experts attribute the decline to successful disruptions of fentanyl supply chains and improved access to addiction treatment, while critics worry that Republican funding cuts could reverse this positive trend.</p>

          <p>A growing global movement to protect children online, exemplified by the UK's Online Safety Act and the proposed Kids Online Safety Act in the U.S., is fueling the development of new AI safety technologies. These regulations impose a duty of care on tech companies to shield minors from harmful content, leading to the adoption of age-verification systems by platforms like Pornhub, Spotify, and X. This has created a new market for digital ID and content-filtering technologies, such as AI that can estimate a user's age from a selfie or block inappropriate content on smartphones.</p>
