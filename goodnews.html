          <p>Tens of thousands of pro-Palestinian demonstrators gathered in central London, marching to Whitehall a day after a ceasefire between Israel and Hamas was implemented. The event, organized by the Palestine Coalition, featured speakers who called the ceasefire a positive but precarious development, vowing to continue protesting. A small group of counter-protesters also assembled nearby, leading to a minor scuffle that resulted in a few arrests by the Metropolitan Police. The march occurred amid UK government discussions about potential new curbs on protest laws.</p>
