          <p>Despite temporary tariff reprieves, a private survey reveals that 95% of Chinese exporters are planning to increase exports to markets outside the U.S. due to the intense trade war. The U.S.-China "decoupling" is expected to continue, with Chinese exporters pivoting away from the U.S. and American firms shifting production out of China. Southeast Asia, particularly Indonesia, is becoming a top choice for Chinese businesses seeking to move production overseas, while Vietnam faces mixed perceptions due to rising costs. Allianz Trade estimates that global exports could see a loss of $305 billion this year because of trade conflicts. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>Home Depot CFO Richard McPhail stated that the retailer does not plan to raise prices due to tariffs, citing the company's scale, supplier partnerships, and productivity improvements. More than half of Home Depot's sales come from the U.S., and the company has diversified its import sources, decreasing reliance on China. This pricing strategy differs from Walmart, which plans to raise prices to cover tariff costs. Home Depot reported first-quarter earnings that missed expectations but beat sales estimates, with comparable sales dropping 0.3% across the company. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>Reese Hogan, a California track athlete, received praise for briefly posing on the first-place podium after losing to a transgender athlete in the triple jump. Hogan set a personal and school record but was defeated by more than 4 feet. She was among athletes who were allegedly told to remove "Protect Girls Sports" T-shirts before the meet. The Trump administration has put California on notice, as the state continues to allow biological males to compete in girls' and women's sports, which is under a Title IX investigation.</p>

          <p>A Chinese study suggests that the ancestor of animals and plants lived on a hydrogen-metabolizing cell before the Great Oxidation Event, which led to Earth‚Äôs oxygen-rich atmosphere. The research indicates that the last common ancestor of eukaryotes lived around 2.72 billion years ago in oxygen-deficient conditions. Eukaryotes are cells or organisms characterized by a membrane-bound nucleus. Understanding eukaryogenesis could provide insights into the evolution of life and have implications for exploring life in outer space.</p>

The Northern Jaguar Reserve is home to the world‚Äôs northernmost population of jaguars, as well as ocelots, bobcats, and mountain lions. The project's Viviendo con Felinos program pays ranchers for photos of wild cats on their land, incentivizing them to protect the animals.

          <div class="timestamp">2025-05-20 07:00:00 EDT</div>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Japan is considering backing off its demand for a full removal of new U.S. tariffs to strike a trade deal with the United States. The idea emerged as Japan's top tariff negotiator, Ryosei Akazawa, is arranging to visit the United States for the third round of bilateral ministerial-level talks. The Trump administration has already reached tariff-cutting agreements with China and Britain. The prime minister has shrugged off calls for the farm chief to resign over rice gaffe.</p>
