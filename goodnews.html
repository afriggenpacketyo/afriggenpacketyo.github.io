          <p>United Launch Alliance (ULA) delayed the second flight carrying Amazon's Project Kuiper internet satellites due to an issue with the rocket booster. The launch was scrubbed with roughly 30 minutes left in the countdown due to an elevated purge temperature within the Atlas V rocket's booster engine. ULA CEO Tory Bruno indicated the issue involved a GN2 purge line that could not be resolved quickly, necessitating a stand-down for the day; a new launch date will be provided later. This launch from Florida's Space Coast was originally scheduled for the previous Friday but was rescheduled due to inclement weather, adding to the setbacks for Amazon's satellite internet project.</p>

          <p>Shares of Advanced Micro Devices (AMD) experienced a significant rise after analysts at Piper Sandler raised their price target on the stock, citing optimism about the chipmaker's latest product announcement. The analysts foresee a snapback for AMD's graphics processing units (GPUs) in the fourth quarter, anticipating that the company will have largely absorbed the $800 million in charges related to new U.S. license requirements for semiconductor exports to China. AMD recently unveiled its next-generation artificial intelligence chips, the Instinct MI400 series, and a full-server rack called Helios, which analysts believe will be pivotal for AMD Instinct growth. Piper Sandler increased its price target for AMD's share price from $125 to $140. (not investment advice)</p>

        </div>
        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>This article explores the potential monthly payments from a $400,000 annuity purchased at age 65, noting that payouts can range from approximately $2,246 to $2,590 based on factors such as gender, interest rates, and annuity type. Higher interest rates make annuities more attractive now, but monthly checks are influenced by life expectancy, the choice between single or joint life annuities, and optional features like cost-of-living adjustments. While annuities offer guaranteed income and financial security, they also come with trade-offs, including illiquidity and potentially lower returns compared to other investments, thus requiring careful consideration of individual financial circumstances and retirement goals.

          <p>The U.S. Army is undergoing a major restructuring, the Army Transformation Initiative, to cut costs and accelerate the adoption of new technologies for modern warfare. This initiative involves trimming some jobs and repositioning others, as well as shifting defense dollars to products that can be made quickly and cheaply. The Army aims to move beyond the rigid, years-long acquisition process that has defined defense procurement and perpetuate legacy programs. The focus is on infusing formations with technologies that will be effective on the battlefield, including artificial intelligence-enabled platforms, SpaceX Starlink internet connectivity, retrofitted autonomous vehicles, and drones.</p>
