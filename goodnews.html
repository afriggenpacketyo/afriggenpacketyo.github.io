          <p>Bitcoin's value increased by approximately 2% on Friday, bringing it to within 1% of its record high of over $124,000. This rally is attributed to investors seeking safe-haven assets as the U.S. government shutdown continues. The cryptocurrency has seen a 12% surge this week alone, reflecting a growing correlation with U.S. government financial risks. Analysts from Standard Chartered note that this reaction is different from previous shutdowns, suggesting Bitcoin's evolving role in the market and predicting it could soon reach a new high of $135,000.

          <p>Japan's governing Liberal Democratic Party (LDP) has elected Sanae Takaichi, a 64-year-old conservative, as its new leader, making her poised to become the nation's first female prime minister. A protege of former Prime Minister Shinzo Abe, Takaichi is known for her hard-line conservative and hawkish views on China. Her election comes after the LDP suffered significant election losses, prompting the resignation of Prime Minister Shigeru Ishiba. Takaichi's leadership is seen as an attempt to win back conservative voters, though she faces the challenge of uniting a fractured party and addressing significant economic and diplomatic issues.</p>

          <p>Analysis of the first-ever rock samples returned from the far side of the moon has revealed a significant temperature difference between the moon's two hemispheres. A team of scientists in China and Britain, studying samples from the Chang'e-6 mission, found that minerals from the far side likely formed in lava that was about 100 degrees Celsius cooler than on the near side. This discovery provides new insights into the moon's thermal asymmetry and its geological evolution. The findings, published in Nature Geoscience, help explain the long-observed stark contrasts in topography and volcanic activity between the two lunar faces.</p>

          <p>An opinion column argues that criticism of Puerto Rican artist Bad Bunny headlining the Super Bowl halftime show is nonsensical and rooted in xenophobia. The author points out that Puerto Ricans are U.S. citizens and that the NFL has a long history of featuring non-American acts like The Rolling Stones and U2. The piece refutes claims that Bad Bunny is "un-American" for singing in Spanish, highlighting that language is not a criterion for citizenship. The author suggests the selection is a smart commercial decision by the NFL to grow its global audience and encourages critics to embrace cultural diversity.</p>

          <p>Michele Mulroney, newly elected president of the Writers Guild of America West, is preparing to address major industry challenges as the union heads into contract negotiations next year. Her priorities include building on protections against AI, combating the overseas shift of film and TV production, and securing increased studio contributions to the WGA's health plan. Mulroney's election follows a recent victory for the guild, where writer protests led ABC to reverse its suspension of "Jimmy Kimmel Live!". She emphasized that while the industry environment is difficult, members are prepared to fight for a fair contract.</p>

          <p>Italian researchers have proposed a new theory that Venice's famous bronze Lion of St. Mark may have originated as a tomb guardian from China's Tang dynasty (618–907). A study published in the journal Antiquity combines stylistic analysis with lead isotope testing to support the claim. The researchers note similarities between the lion and mythical zhenmushou beasts, and chemical analysis traces the copper to ore sources in China's Lower Yangtze River basin. They speculate that the statue could have been transported to Venice by the father and uncle of explorer Marco Polo before being altered into its current form.</p>

          <p>The aviation industry is struggling to meet new mandates for the use of sustainable aviation fuels (SAF), a critical component of its plan to achieve net-zero emissions by 2050. While the UK and EU now require 2% of jet fuel to be sustainable, some airline executives, like Ryanair's Michael O'Leary, are skeptical that future targets of 6-10% by 2030 can be met due to limited production and high costs. Challenges include Shell halting a major biofuel plant and the US rolling back SAF incentives. Despite these hurdles, some investors and major airlines remain committed, viewing SAF as the only viable path to decarbonization.</p>

The endeavor involved traveling between peaks entirely by human power, cycling over 3,000 miles and running up each mountain. Jornet's project was not just a test of endurance but also an artistic expression, as he chose routes based on their aesthetic beauty rather than pure efficiency. The journey allowed him to explore the American wilderness and reflect on the importance of protecting these wild landscapes.</p>

Former club chairman Sir Bob Murray reflects that the series was a chance to document a pivotal moment for the club and the changing commercial landscape of football.

A supermoon occurs when a full moon coincides with its closest point to Earth in its elliptical orbit, making it appear up to 14% larger and 30% brighter than usual. This event marks the beginning of a series of three straight supermoons, with the next two occurring on November 5th and December 4th. This year's Harvest Moon is the one that rises closest to the autumn equinox, traditionally providing extra light for farmers.</p>
