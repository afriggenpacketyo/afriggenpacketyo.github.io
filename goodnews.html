          <p>The U.S. has announced a comprehensive trade deal with South Korea, establishing a 15% blanket tariff on the country's exports, a reduction from the previously threatened 25%. The agreement includes a $350 billion investment from South Korea into U.S.-controlled ventures, although differing interpretations exist between the two nations on how these funds will be utilized. Additionally, Seoul has committed to purchasing $100 billion in American energy products and making further investments, while U.S. goods entering South Korea will not be subject to tariffs, aiming to fortify the economic and diplomatic alliance.

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>A powerful 8.8-magnitude earthquake off Russia's coast triggered tsunami alerts across the Pacific, prompting a closer look at how these events occur and the best safety practices. Tsunamis are typically generated by strong, shallow, underwater earthquakes with vertical tectonic plate movement, creating long, fast-moving waves that gain height in shallow water. Predicting their exact size and power remains challenging, but deep-ocean sensors have improved forecasting. In the event of a warning, experts advise immediately moving to higher ground—at least 30 to 100 feet above sea level—as the waves are a series of powerful surges, not a single event, and can carry dangerous debris.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>A scientific expedition using a human-occupied submersible has discovered and filmed surprisingly abundant communities of life at depths of over 9,000 meters in the Pacific Ocean. The Chinese-led research team observed vast fields of tube worms, clams, and bacterial mats, challenging previous assumptions about the limits of life in such extreme, high-pressure environments. These ecosystems are fueled not by sunlight but by chemicals like hydrogen sulfide and methane seeping from the Earth's crust. The findings suggest that these chemosynthetic communities may be widespread in the planet's deepest trenches, opening new avenues for studying how life adapts to extreme conditions.</p>

          <p>The long-held belief that screen time is inherently harmful to children is being challenged by a group of scientists who argue there is a lack of concrete evidence for consistently negative outcomes. Critics of the prevailing narrative, like Professor Pete Etchells, point out that much of the research relies on flawed self-reporting and fails to distinguish between different types of screen engagement. While some studies link screen use to depression or sleep issues, others find little to no correlation with poor mental well-being, suggesting factors like loneliness may be more significant. The debate highlights the complexity of the issue and the absence of clear, evidence-based guidelines for parents.</p>

          <h2>Tsunami Risk from Massive Russian Quake Subsides for U.S. After Triggering Widespread Alerts</h2>

          <p>An 8.8 magnitude earthquake off Russia's Kamchatka Peninsula, one of the strongest ever recorded, triggered tsunami warnings across the Pacific, including for Hawaii and the U.S. West Coast. The quake caused flooding in Russia with waves up to 16 feet, but the impact elsewhere was minimal, with Hawaii seeing waves around 5 feet and most U.S. coastal advisories being lifted by Wednesday afternoon. While evacuations occurred and alerts were issued in multiple countries, major damage and casualties were avoided outside the immediate vicinity of the epicenter. The event served as a major test of tsunami warning systems and response protocols across the Pacific basin.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>The Federal Reserve has decided to keep its benchmark interest rate unchanged, maintaining its current range of 4.25% to 4.5% as it assesses ongoing economic uncertainty and the impact of tariffs. In its policy statement, the central bank noted that while economic growth has moderated, the labor market remains solid and inflation is still somewhat elevated. The decision revealed a rare dissent, with two Fed governors voting for a rate cut. Fed Chair Jerome Powell emphasized that the economy remains in good shape but faces risks, justifying the cautious "wait-and-see" approach before considering any rate adjustments.

          <div class="timestamp">2025-07-30 19:30:41 EDT</div>
        </div>
        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>The U.S. economy experienced a significant turnaround in the second quarter, with Gross Domestic Product (GDP) growing at an annual rate of 3%, a sharp reversal from the 0.5% contraction in the first quarter. This surge largely reflects a substantial decrease in imports following the implementation of new tariffs, which are subtracted in GDP calculations. While the headline number appears strong, economists caution that it overstates the economy's underlying health, as a key measure of domestic demand rose at its weakest pace since late 2022. The data suggests that while the economy is not in reverse, it is shifting to a lower gear. (not investment advice)</p>

          <h2>Analysis Reveals Why Massive Russian Earthquake Caused Limited Tsunami Damage</h2>
          <div class="timestamp">2025-07-30 18:55:56 EDT</div>
        </div>
        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Despite being one of the most powerful earthquakes ever recorded, the recent magnitude 8.8 tremor off Russia's coast resulted in surprisingly little widespread tsunami damage. Scientists explain that the tsunami's destructive energy was primarily directed into a sparsely populated area of the open Pacific Ocean, between Alaska and Hawaii. This trajectory allowed the waves to dissipate significantly before reaching more populated coastlines like California and Oregon. While the area near the epicenter experienced damaging waves, the specific location and directionality of the quake meant that other regions dodged a catastrophic event, representing a best-case scenario for a quake of this magnitude.</p>

          <p>A new wave of popular television shows like "The Bear" and "The Pitt" is captivating audiences by inducing anxiety rather than offering escapism. These series use hyperrealistic filmmaking techniques, such as real-time narratives and single-take sequences, to immerse viewers in the high-stakes, mundane pressures of stressful workplaces like kitchens and emergency rooms. This trend marks a shift away from comfort TV, resonating with viewers who may find the depiction of everyday stress cathartic and relatable. Psychologists suggest this "vicarious stress" can be enjoyable because it provides a risk-free thrill and fosters a strong sense of empathy for the characters.</p>
