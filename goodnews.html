          <p>In the New York City Democratic mayoral primary, Assemblyman Zohran Mamdani declared victory over former Gov. Andrew Cuomo, who conceded the race after initial results showed Mamdani leading with 44% of the vote. Cuomo, who resigned from the governorship in 2021 after facing accusations of sexual harassment, conceded to Mamdani, a Democratic Socialist, who capitalized on social media virality and enthusiasm among younger voters. Cuomo indicated he might consider an independent run in November, despite the Democratic primary winner likely having an advantage in the heavily Democratic city. The Board of Elections will certify the results on July 15 after ranked-choice tabulations are completed, due to no candidate reaching over 50% of the vote. </p>

          <p>Chinese Premier Li Qiang called for international collaboration on trade, urging countries not to turn trade into a political or security issue. Speaking at the World Economic Forum's annual conference in China, Li emphasized that globalization is irreversible and engaging in the international economy is a way of reshaping the rules and order. He called on countries to keep to the right path, without commenting on specific U.S. trade tensions or the Israel-Iran conflict. Columbia University professor Adam Tooze described Li's comment on reshaping the rules and order as very interesting, suggesting a pluralization of processes.</p>

          <p>President Donald Trump attended the NATO Summit in The Hague, Netherlands, expressing a surprisingly cordial tone toward the alliance he has previously criticized. NATO Secretary General Mark Rutte congratulated Trump for encouraging increased defense spending among European members, reaching a new 5% target. Despite progress, Trump cast doubt on whether the U.S. would abide by NATO‚Äôs mutual defense clause, Article 5, while Rutte urged partners to strengthen their own defenses. The new spending target breaks down into 3.5% for core defense spending and 1.5% for related infrastructure, with Poland leading member states at 4.1% of GDP towards defense.</p>

          <p>A China-led study suggests that a global solar-wind energy network could meet the world's energy demands by 2050 at a lower cost than independent regional systems. The researchers propose creating an interconnected system that draws on regions with abundant renewable energy potential to supply areas with high energy needs. While geopolitical boundaries and crises pose challenges, successful global interconnection could improve energy efficiency, ease decarbonization, and enhance resilience against conflict and climate extremes. The study emphasizes that the potential of solar and wind resources on Earth vastly surpasses human demand.</p>

          <p>Antoinette Lattouf, an Australian journalist, won her case against the Australian Broadcasting Corporation (ABC), with a court ruling that she was unfairly sacked over a social media post about the war in Gaza.

Lattouf said she was punished for her political opinion, while the ABC apologized for its handling of the matter, stating that it had let down its staff and audiences. The case has raised questions over the broadcaster's independence and how it supports culturally diverse staff.</p>

          <p>California leaders reached a tentative agreement on a $321.1-billion state budget, contingent on the Legislature passing a housing reform proposal. The agreement reflects resistance to proposed cuts, opting instead to borrow money, tap into state reserves, and shift funding to offset a $12-billion deficit. The budget includes a "poison pill" that requires legislators to pass a bill lessening environmental review requirements for building projects. The deal restores cost-of-living adjustments for child-care workers and rejects a cap on overtime hours for in-home caregivers, while also providing additional funding for Homeless Housing, Assistance and Prevention grants.</p>

          <p>Two young bears, Mish and Lucy, escaped from their enclosure at Wildwood Devon wildlife park in the U.K. and consumed a week's worth of honey before falling asleep. The bears posed no threat to the public, and visitors were safely escorted to a secure building as a precaution. Keepers successfully used recall training to encourage the bears back into their enclosure, and an investigation is underway to determine how the escape occurred. The park is reviewing its protocols to prevent future incidents, ensuring the safety of both the animals and visitors.</p>

          <p>The UK's climate advisers report that more people are buying electric cars and installing heat pumps, but further increases are needed to meet climate goals. The Climate Change Committee (CCC) emphasizes that the government must ensure households benefit from the transition to cleaner technologies through lower bills. While the UK has made progress in reducing greenhouse gas emissions, transport and buildings remain the biggest emitters. The CCC highlights the need to make electricity cheaper to encourage wider adoption of electric vehicles and heat pumps.</p>

          <p>A US district judge blocked the Trump administration from withholding funds previously awarded to 14 states for electric vehicle charger infrastructure. The judge granted a partial injunction to the states, ruling that their lawsuit against Trump‚Äôs Department of Transportation would likely succeed. The Trump administration had ordered states not to spend $5 billion in funds allocated under the Biden administration‚Äôs national electric vehicle infrastructure (Nevi) program. The ruling follows a Government Accountability Office finding that the Trump administration violated the law by withholding the funding.</p>

          <p>Manhattan District Attorney Alvin Bragg, who oversaw the hush-money case against President Donald Trump, won the Democratic primary for reelection. Bragg defeated Patrick Timmins and will face Republican Maud Maron in the November general election, with Democrats holding a significant voter advantage in Manhattan. Bragg's tenure has been marked by high-profile cases and scrutiny, including criticism over his initial policy memo and praise for his efforts to fight gun violence and prosecute hate crimes. His campaign emphasized his efforts to fight gun violence, help sexual assault survivors, prosecute hate crimes and go after bad landlords and exploitative bosses.</p>
