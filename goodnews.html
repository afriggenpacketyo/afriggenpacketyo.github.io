        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>The Bank of England has maintained the UK's interest rates at 4.25%, but suggested potential cuts as early as August amid persistent inflation exceeding the Bank's target rate. Governor Andrew Bailey cautioned about global unpredictability, citing concerns over the Israel-Iran conflict's impact on energy costs and overall prices. While marginally raising expectations for the UK economy, the Bank acknowledged underlying growth as weak and noted signs of softening in the labor market. Susannah Streeter from Hargreaves Lansdown indicated that the possibility of two interest rate cuts this year remains viable, offering potential relief for borrowers. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>The FDA has approved Yeztugo, a twice-yearly injectable medication, as the first of its kind for preventing HIV infection. Gilead Sciences, the drug's creator, claims the injectable HIV-1 capsid inhibitor (lenacapavir) reduces the risk of sexually acquired HIV in adults and adolescents. Clinical trials demonstrated nearly 100% effectiveness in preventing HIV and superiority to daily oral medications. Lenacapavir uses a multi-stage approach, distinguishing it from other antivirals by inhibiting HIV at multiple stages of its lifecycle, making it a significant breakthrough in the fight against the HIV epidemic.</p>

          <p>Millions more households in Britain will receive ¬£150 off their energy bills this winter due to changes in the Warm Home Discount eligibility criteria. The government is scrapping the property size and energy score qualifications, extending the discount to 2.7 million more homes, including nearly a million households with children. While energy companies will fund the discount, the government aims to offset potential bill increases through savings from cutting energy companies' expenditure and addressing problem debt. Chancellor Rachel Reeves confirmed ¬£13.2 billion will be allocated to the Warm Homes Plan to improve energy efficiency and reduce heating costs.</p>

          <p>The United States saw a significant increase in its millionaire population in 2024, adding approximately 1,000 new millionaires per day, according to a UBS report. The US is home to 23.8 million millionaires, an increase of 1.5% from the previous year, driven by a strong performance on Wall Street and a stable US dollar. However, the first six months of 2025 have been more volatile due to trade war concerns and recession fears, impacting the dollar. UBS economist James Mazeau suggests it is too early to determine if US household wealth growth will slow, noting that a weaker dollar could spur wealth growth in countries with non-dollar currencies.</p>

          <p>Samsung is planning to release a thinner version of its flagship foldable smartphone to compete with Chinese rivals like Honor and Oppo, who have released thinner and lighter devices. Slimness has become a critical factor in the foldable phone market, as consumers are less willing to compromise on thickness and weight for the larger screen real estate. Analyst Ming-Chi Kuo said that Apple plans to enter the foldable market starting next year. While the market for foldable phones remains small, accounting for just 2% of the overall smartphone market, thinner designs may attract more consumers.</p>

He proposes building "Scientist AI," a non-autonomous system designed to predict and block potentially harmful actions by other AIs. Scientist AI would act as a guardrail, assessing the moral acceptability of an AI agent's actions and preventing those deemed harmful, with the goal of ensuring AI remains aligned with human values.</p>

The court found that some of their detentions violated international human rights covenants and amounted to unjust physical restraint. The plaintiffs had sought damages for detentions spanning over a decade, during which they were repeatedly detained and released. The court acknowledged that their deteriorating health conditions, including diagnoses of depression, were not adequately addressed during their detention.</p>
