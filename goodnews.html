          <p>The German parliament is set to vote on a draft budget for 2025 that includes a significant increase in government spending, facilitated by easing the country's debt brake. Finance Minister Lars Klingbeil's plan involves taking on new debt to fund infrastructure repairs, a stimulus package for the economy, and record military investments. The defense budget is projected to more than double by 2029, reaching ‚Ç¨152.8 billion, which aligns with Germany's growing security concerns due to Russia's invasion of Ukraine and pressure from the U.S. to increase military spending. The vote has been delayed due to national elections and a split between political parties over budget spending, with final approval expected in September. (not investment advice)</p>

          <h2>Proposed Tax Break on Car Loan Interest Primarily Benefits Luxury Vehicle Buyers</h2>

        </div>
        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Republicans are proposing a tax deduction of up to $10,000 on annual interest for new auto loans, as part of the "One Big Beautiful Bill Act," but the structure of the tax break would largely benefit buyers of expensive vehicles. According to Cox Automotive, it would take a loan of roughly $112,000 to use up the full deduction, implying a vehicle purchase price of about $130,000. The tax break is temporary and ends after 2028, and is reduced once an individual's annual income exceeds $100,000, or $200,000 for married couples, making it unlikely that most households would claim the full benefit. Qualifying cars must also receive final assembly in the U.S., further limiting the potential roster of vehicles. (not investment advice)</p>

She experienced numerous rejections and a lack of feedback, leading her to question the value of her degree. Morgan believes the use of AI in resume screening programs may have initially hindered her progress, as her CV needed adjustments to be properly read by applicant tracking systems. Despite the challenges, she persevered and reached the assessment stages for 221 roles before finally securing employment, highlighting the increasing competition for graduate positions.</p>

Google expressed concerns that the suggested changes could have significant implications for businesses and consumers in the UK.

          <p>As the planet warms and deadly heat waves worsen, cities are appointing "heat officers" to build resilience through urban greening and the creation of cool zones. Cities from Athens to Dhaka are working to protect residents from extreme heat, with chief heat officers responding to emergencies and implementing long-term solutions.
