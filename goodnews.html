          <p>The governments of the United Kingdom, Canada, and Australia have formally announced their recognition of a Palestinian state in a coordinated diplomatic move. This decision is intended to revive the possibility of a two-state solution and build international momentum for a lasting peace agreement. The announcement has been met with strong opposition from both the United States and Israel, who argue that it rewards Hamas and is an empty gesture given the current political divisions among Palestinians.</p>

          <p>In a commentary for the Jewish New Year, Rabbi Angela Buchdahl explains the concept of Teshuvah, or repentance, as a fundamentally hopeful and communal act. She describes how, during Rosh Hashanah, Jews collectively take responsibility for societal shortcomings rather than confessing individually. Buchdahl applies this idea to modern American society, urging a collective return to the nation's better self by acknowledging shared failings and embracing the possibility of positive change.</p>

          <div class="timestamp">2025-09-21 10:23:53 EDT</div>
        </div>
        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>According to child psychology expert Reem Raouda, children with strong social skills are often raised by parents who model specific behaviors from an early age. The article outlines nine key practices, including talking openly about emotions, demonstrating empathy in daily life, and allowing children space to solve their own conflicts. The central message is that true social intelligence is built on a foundation of emotional safety and authentic connection at home, rather than just memorizing polite phrases.</p>

          <p>The once-famous Las Vegas buffet is fading from the city's culinary landscape, increasingly replaced by trendy food halls and specialty restaurants that appeal to modern tastes. "Pawn Stars" personality Rick Harrison calls the trend an example of "Darwinism," noting how consumer preferences evolve over time. Several major casinos on the Strip have shuttered their buffets in recent years, opting instead for more diverse and contemporary dining concepts to attract a younger demographic.</p>
