          <p>A bag containing an inflammable signal flame tube fell from a U.S. military helicopter over the Motobu peninsula in northern Okinawa Prefecture, Japan. The U.S. Marine Corps confirmed that the 18-kilogram bag was inadvertently dropped during a routine drill from a UH-1 helicopter. Authorities stated that there were no confirmed civilian casualties in the area where the bag landed, and the Marines are conducting a thorough examination of the incident while prioritizing the safety of local residents. The Okinawa Defense Bureau is asking residents to contact them if the bag is found, as the southern island prefecture hosts a significant portion of U.S. military facilities in Japan.</p>

          <p>Family offices, managing the wealth of the ultra-rich, are struggling to find qualified money managers due to a talent crunch and trust issues. While the number of family offices is expected to grow significantly by 2030, a shortage of advisors is anticipated, as family offices compete with banks and private equity firms for top talent. The article notes that trust is a key criterion for family offices, often outweighing other qualifications, and that young employees are reluctant to work in these environments due to the lack of clear corporate structure and career progression. European family offices are raising compensation packages to attract and retain talent.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>British businesses are expressing concerns that the UK government's plan to tighten immigration rules will lead to labor shortages, particularly in sectors like health and social care that heavily rely on migrant workers. The government's proposals include raising English-language requirements and skill levels for migrants, aiming to prioritize British workers. However, businesses worry that Brits may be unable or unwilling to fill the resulting gaps, especially in social care, where recruitment of home-grown workers is already a struggle. Care England warns the plans could have serious consequences for a sector already under immense pressure with 131,000 vacancies.</p>

          <p>Iranian officials have proposed a joint nuclear-enrichment venture involving regional Arab countries and American investments as an alternative to Washington's demand that Iran dismantle its nuclear program. Foreign Minister Abbas Araghchi presented the idea to American special envoy Steve Witkoff during talks in Oman. The proposal involves Iran enriching uranium to a low grade and shipping it to other Arab countries for civilian use, with potential oversight from international representatives. While a spokesman for Mr. Witkoff denied the proposal had come up in the talks, President Trump has stated that he wants to make a deal with Iran.</p>

          <p>U.S. retail egg prices fell in April, marking the first month-to-month drop since October 2024, with the average price for a dozen Grade A eggs declining to $5.12 after reaching a record $6.23 in March. Despite the decrease, prices remain near historic highs due to a persistent outbreak of bird flu that has wiped out flocks of egg-laying hens. President Trump has focused on lowering egg prices, and the U.S. Department of Agriculture is investing $1 billion to help farmers improve biosecurity measures. The antitrust division of the U.S. Department of Justice is also investigating Cal-Maine Foods, the largest U.S. egg producer.</p>

          <p>President Trump defended his decision to accept a $400 million jet from Qatar, citing delays in Boeing's production of the new Air Force One fleet. Trump stated that the luxury jet, offered as a temporary solution, would ensure the U.S. has an impressive plane, comparable to those of Saudi Arabia, the UAE, and Qatar. He justified the gift as a reward for the U.S. military's successful defense of Qatar and said it would save taxpayers money. The president plans to retire the plane to the presidential library once Boeing delivers the new Air Force One fleet.</p>

          <p>Chimpanzees in Uganda have been observed using medicinal plants in multiple ways to treat open wounds and other injuries, demonstrating a behavior known as "forest first aid." University of Oxford scientists, working in the Budongo Forest, documented instances of the animals applying plants to their own wounds and occasionally to each other's. The research builds on previous findings that chimps self-medicate with specific plants. The scientists have also compiled a catalog of various ways chimpanzees utilize natural medicines to maintain their health in the wild, adding to the growing evidence that primates use natural remedies.</p>
