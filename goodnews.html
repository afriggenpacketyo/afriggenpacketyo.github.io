          <h2>Reform UK Achieves Narrow Victory in Runcorn and Helsby By-Election</h2>
          <div class="timestamp">2025-05-02 03:06:16 EDT</div>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Reform UK candidate Sarah Pochin won the Runcorn and Helsby by-election by a mere six votes, marking a significant win against the Labour Party in what was previously a safe Labour seat. The by-election was triggered by the resignation of the former Labour MP following an assault conviction, creating an opening for Reform amidst voter frustration. Nigel Farage celebrated the victory as a sign of Reform's growing influence, while Labour officials acknowledged the challenging circumstances of the election. This close contest highlights the potential shift in British politics towards a more fragmented party system, with Reform gaining ground.</p>

          <p>China appears to be softening its stance on K-pop, potentially signaling an easing of restrictions on South Korean acts performing in mainland China after a ban in 2016 due to political tensions. The decision is seen as part of China's broader strategy to revitalize domestic demand amid a consumption downturn, with cultural events like K-pop concerts expected to stimulate spending in tourism and local commerce. K-pop is considered a tariff-proof sector with core revenue drivers like streaming and concerts being digital and intangible, making them immune to cross-border tariffs. This move also has a diplomatic dimension, potentially restoring ties with neighboring countries like South Korea amidst China's own economic challenges.</p>

          <p>Temu, the e-commerce platform owned by Chinese giant PDD Holdings, is shifting its US operations to a "local fulfillment model" in response to tariffs imposed by President Trump and the end of the "de minimis" duty exemption policy. This means that sales to American customers are now handled by locally-based sellers, with orders fulfilled from within the country. Temu is actively recruiting US sellers to join the platform, and may phase out China-based merchants, requiring them to establish operations in the US or stop selling to American shoppers. This adaptation allows Temu to maintain competitive pricing for US consumers despite the trade barriers.</p>

          <p>Oil major Shell reported stronger-than-expected first-quarter profits and announced a $3.5 billion share buyback program, marking the 14th consecutive quarter of buybacks exceeding $3 billion. The company's adjusted earnings of $5.58 billion beat analyst expectations, despite falling from $7.73 billion in the same period last year. Shell's CEO, Wael Sawan, cited the company's strong performance and resilient balance sheet as reasons for the buyback, aligning with their strategic direction to increase shareholder returns and cut spending. This move contrasts with rival BP's decision to lower its share buyback after first-quarter profits fell short of expectations.</p>

          <p>A federal judge in Texas has permanently barred the Trump administration from using the Alien Enemies Act to deport Venezuelans deemed criminals, asserting the White House's use of the statute was illegal. Judge Rodriguez's ruling rejected the administration's attempt to apply the 18th-century wartime law to modern immigration policy, arguing the act is intended for times of declared war or military invasion, not for dealing with street gangs. The decision, limited to the Southern District of Texas, could influence other cases challenging the administration's use of the act. The American Civil Liberties Union praised the ruling, emphasizing the president cannot invoke wartime authority during peacetime.</p>

The other scene introduces a spaceship bearing the logo of the Fantastic Four, hinting at their arrival in the MCU and their involvement in future events like "Avengers: Doomsday".

          <p>Toyota, Honda, and other Japanese carmakers experienced a combined 11.8% increase in U.S. sales in April, driven by customers purchasing vehicles before anticipated price hikes due to additional tariffs on imported cars. President Trump's imposition of a 25% tariff on cars produced outside the United States prompted a rush to buy hybrid and sport-utility vehicles. While this surge in sales provides a short-term boost, the auto market outlook remains uncertain as this last-minute buying is expected to reduce future demand. Toyota's sales rose 10%, while Honda and Mazda also saw significant increases.</p>

          <p>A group of Chinese entrepreneurs educated abroad has publicly condemned remarks made by Dong Mingzhu, chairwoman of Gree Group, who suggested that overseas-trained workers could be spies. Dong's comments have ignited a debate about global versus local talent in China, amid ongoing tensions with the United States. The Society of Younger Generation Entrepreneurs Returned from Overseas of Shanxi Province demanded that Dong be held accountable for her remarks and apologize. They emphasized the need for an open and inclusive environment for talent development and criticized Dong for imposing the "spy" speculation on the entire group of returnees.</p>

          <p>Reform UK secured its first Parliamentary by-election win, taking Runcorn and Helsby from Labour by a narrow margin, and also won its first mayoral contest in Greater Lincolnshire. Labour retained mayoralties in North Tyneside, Doncaster, and the West of England, but saw its vote share decrease as Reform came in second in all three races. Reform UK also made gains in council seats, winning more than half of the first 100 declared. The Conservative Party is expected to face heavy losses across the country, with Reform UK posing a threat from the right in some areas.</p>

          <p>Roche has struck a $5.3 billion deal with Zealand Pharma to co-develop and co-commercialize petrelintide, a novel amylin analog for weight loss, marking Roche's latest effort to compete in the obesity drug market. The deal includes upfront cash payments of $1.65 billion to Zealand, with potential milestone payments reaching up to $5.3 billion. Petrelintide, seen as a potential "future backbone therapy" for weight management, could offer comparable weight reduction to GLP-1s with potentially superior tolerability and lean muscle preservation. Both companies emphasize the co-development and co-commercialization nature of the partnership, citing a strong scientific and cultural fit.</p>

          <p>Liverpool fans celebrating the club's Premier League title-clinching victory over Tottenham Hotspur generated seismic activity at Anfield, according to scientists from the University of Liverpool. The most significant tremor, registering a magnitude of 1.74 on the Richter scale, occurred after Alexis Mac Allister's goal. Data revealed that the 60,415-strong crowd produced real seismic activity in response to goals scored during the game. Researchers hope the study will inspire innovative ideas for potential applications, perhaps even to enhance the stadium experience.</p>

          <p>European Union leaders are preparing to engage in trade negotiations with the United States and China, navigating a complex geopolitical landscape. The EU aims to secure economic carve-outs from both superpowers while avoiding alienating either one.

Further complicating matters is the potential for the US and China to engage in their own negotiations, potentially leaving Europe isolated.</p>

          <p>India will include caste details in its next census, a decision with significant socio-economic and political implications. The move is likely to lead to demands for increasing quotas for government jobs and college admissions for Other Backward Classes. While successive governments have resisted updating caste data due to potential social unrest, supporters argue it's necessary for implementing social justice programs. The decision comes months before crucial elections in Bihar, where caste is a key issue.</p>

          <p>China is evaluating the possibility of trade talks with the U.S., potentially opening the door for negotiations to resolve the ongoing trade war. While assessing the possibility of starting any negotiations, Chinese authorities reiterated Beijing's request for the U.S. to remove all unilateral tariffs. Senior U.S. officials have reached out recently multiple times, hoping to start negotiations with China on tariffs, a spokesperson for the commerce ministry said in a statement Friday. China's willingness to engage in talks is contingent on the U.S. demonstrating sincerity by canceling the tariffs.</p>
