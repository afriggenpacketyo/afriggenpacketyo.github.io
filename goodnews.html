          <p>Emily Thornberry has officially pulled out of the race to become the next deputy leader of the UK's Labour Party, narrowing the field to four remaining candidates. Announcing her decision, Thornberry, who chairs the Commons foreign affairs committee, was unable to secure the 80 nominations from fellow MPs required to advance in the contest. Education Secretary Bridget Phillipson is currently the frontrunner with significant backing from parliamentary colleagues. The contest, which follows Angela Rayner's resignation, will conclude with a vote in October, with the winner announced at the end of that month.</p>

          <p>Japan's Nikkei 225 stock index achieved a new all-time high, driven by a significant surge of over 10% in SoftBank Group's stock value. This rally was influenced by positive overnight performance on Wall Street and news of a major cloud-computing deal between Oracle and OpenAI, both of which are linked to SoftBank through the U.S. "Stargate" AI initiative. The market gains reflect broader investor optimism fueled by hopes for U.S. Federal Reserve rate cuts and cooling inflation data, although some other Asian markets showed mixed results.

          <p>Germany has experienced a significant drop in the number of asylum seekers receiving welfare benefits, with a 10% decrease reported between the end of 2023 and 2024. This reduction coincides with an overall fall in new asylum applications, placing Germany third in the EU for new claims, behind France and Spain. In separate domestic news, Germany's coalition government has nominated a new candidate for the Constitutional Court after a previous nominee was rejected, and a Belgian festival's cancellation of a German orchestra with an Israeli conductor has sparked accusations of a "cultural boycott" from Germany's culture minister.</p>

          <p>Former Liverpool defender Andre Wisdom has opened up about the life-altering impact of being stabbed during a robbery in 2020, an event he says changed the course of his professional career. Although he recovered to play again for Derby County, he struggled with severe nerve damage and the physical and emotional trauma, ultimately leading to his departure from top-tier football. Now 32, Wisdom plays for the seventh-tier club FC United of Manchester, expressing gratitude for still being able to play the sport he loves. He has also focused on his future by investing in property and pursuing his coaching badges.</p>

          <h2>US Investor Interest in Chinese Stocks Reaches Five-Year High, Morgan Stanley Reports</h2>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>According to a Morgan Stanley report, U.S. investors are demonstrating their highest level of interest in Chinese stocks in five years, with over 90% expressing a willingness to increase their exposure. This renewed interest, which extends to both U.S.-listed and onshore A-share markets, marks a significant reversal after a multi-year retreat. The shift is attributed to China's leadership in specific sectors like robotics and biotech, efforts to stabilize its economy, and a growing demand for diversification away from U.S. assets. The bank suggests that this relocation of capital back to China is just beginning. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>China's People's Liberation Army Rocket Force has banned nearly 200 suppliers and bid evaluation experts as part of a significant anti-corruption investigation. The force, which oversees China's strategic nuclear missile arsenal, announced that 74 experts and 116 suppliers were barred from procurement projects due to violations, with some stripped of bidding qualifications across the entire military. This move reflects President Xi Jinping's ongoing efforts to enforce discipline and root out corruption within the armed forces, particularly in a critical branch established during his military reforms. The crackdown targets irregularities dating back as far as 2016.</p>

          <p>The Los Angeles Dodgers completed a series sweep against the Colorado Rockies with a 9-0 victory, extending their lead in the National League West to three games. Mookie Betts had a standout performance with five RBIs, including a grand slam, and pitcher Blake Snell delivered six scoreless innings with 11 strikeouts. However, the win was tempered by a late setback, as catcher Will Smith was scratched from the lineup just before the game due to swelling in his bruised right hand. The team also welcomed utilityman Tommy Edman back from the injured list, bringing them closer to a fully healthy roster.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Everton FC has undergone a significant transformation, marked by a record summer of recruitment with a net spend of £97 million on nine new players. This is the club's highest net outlay in a single summer window and a stark contrast to previous years of financial constraint, which included points deductions for breaching profit and sustainability rules. The turnaround is attributed to a combination of minimal spending in recent seasons, a transformative takeover by the Friedkin Group that managed the club's debt, and the future revenue potential of their new stadium. This strategic overhaul has revitalized the club's prospects on and off the pitch.</p>

          <p>NBA Commissioner Adam Silver has addressed allegations that the Los Angeles Clippers circumvented the salary cap with an endorsement deal for star Kawhi Leonard, stating that the league requires clear evidence of wrongdoing before taking disciplinary action. The investigation centers on claims that a firm with a sponsorship deal with the Clippers paid Leonard for a no-show role at the direction of the team. Silver emphasized that the burden of proof is on the league and that he would be reluctant to act on a mere appearance of impropriety, ensuring a fair process.

          <p>Amid a sector-wide slowdown, major luxury brands like Louis Vuitton and Prada are diversifying their product lines with less expensive items, such as cosmetics and accessories, to attract a broader consumer base. Louis Vuitton recently launched a beauty collection with lipsticks priced at $160, aiming to engage aspirational shoppers without diluting the brand's core exclusivity. This strategy, sometimes called "treatonomics," bets that consumers will still splurge on small luxuries even while cutting back on larger purchases. The goal is to bring younger customers into the brand's ecosystem, hoping to foster long-term loyalty as their purchasing power grows.</p>

Ukrainian drones have been credited with destroying a significant portion of Russian equipment and are crucial for halting ground assaults.

          <p>Stock markets around the world are rallying, with several major benchmarks like the MSCI All Country World Index and the S&P 500 hitting new record highs. This surge in investor confidence is being driven by signs of easing inflation, resilient corporate earnings, and widespread expectations that the U.S. Federal Reserve will soon begin cutting interest rates. Recent U.S. economic data, including a weaker-than-expected producer price index, has bolstered the case for policy easing. This positive sentiment marks a significant shift from earlier in the year when fears of sticky inflation and geopolitical risks dominated market outlooks.</p>

In recent months, Prince Harry had expressed a desire for reconciliation, and the meeting suggests a dialogue has opened between the two camps. While a full family reconciliation, particularly with his brother Prince William, remains distant, the meeting is seen as a positive development in a deeply strained relationship.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>A recent analysis by real estate company Redfin suggests that San Francisco's housing costs have returned to a "normal" level when measured by the ratio of mortgage payments to local income. The report indicates that this ratio has reverted to its July 2018 level, primarily because wage growth in the tech-driven city has outpaced the slowing growth of home prices. However, this return to a pre-pandemic equilibrium does not mean the city is affordable, as the 2018 baseline still required a very high percentage of income for housing. The trend also does not reflect the reality for renters, who face rising costs.</p>
