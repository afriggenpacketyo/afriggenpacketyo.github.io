Qatar Airways also signed an agreement with GE Aerospace for over 400 engines to power these aircraft, making it the largest purchase of widebody aircraft engines in GE Aerospace's history.

          <p>Shares of the stock trading platform eToro experienced a significant surge in their Nasdaq debut, increasing by nearly 29% after the company raised almost $310 million in its initial public offering. The Israel-based company sold nearly six million shares at $52 each, exceeding the expected range of $46 to $50, valuing the company at roughly $4.2 billion at the IPO price. EToro's CEO Yoni Assia cited stabilizing market volatility as a key factor in the decision to proceed with the IPO. The company has seen substantial growth in its cryptocurrency business, with revenue from crypto assets more than tripling in 2024, though it anticipates a slight decrease in crypto's contribution to trading commissions in the first quarter.</p>

Analysts believe this deal could help mitigate revenue headwinds tied to restrictions on goods going to China. With this recovery, Nvidia's market capitalization has risen back above $3 trillion, although the stock remains more than 11% below its 52-week high from January. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>Following recent communications and radar outages at major airports, discussions about radar technology and its origins have resurfaced. The word 'radar' is an acronym for RAdio Detection And Ranging, dating back to the U.S. Navy in the early 1940s. The technology works by emitting radio waves that bounce off objects, allowing calculation of distance, elevation, speed, and trajectory. Early applications can be traced to German physicist Christian H√ºlsmeyer's Telemobiloskop in 1904, designed to prevent ship collisions, and the British military's development during World War II which proved pivotal in detecting enemy aircraft.</p>

          <p>OpenAI announced the launch of a "safety evaluations hub," a public webpage where the company will share the safety results of its artificial intelligence models. The hub will display how the models perform on tests for hallucinations, jailbreaks, and harmful content, including hateful content and illicit advice. OpenAI stated that it uses the safety evaluations internally to inform decisions about model safety and deployment, and will update the hub periodically to communicate more proactively about safety. The announcement comes amid concerns that tech companies are prioritizing product development over safety research.</p>

          <p>Amazon shares are on a five-day winning streak, outperforming other Big Tech companies and the broader market. The easing of trade tensions between the U.S. and China is a significant factor, as lower tariffs normalize supply chains for Amazon's third-party products. A deal with FedEx to deliver large packages also contributes to managing delivery costs. Amazon Web Services is investing $5 billion in Saudi Arabia to build AI infrastructure, and Amazon Prime Video's ad-supported tier has surpassed 130 million active users in the U.S. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>The Los Angeles Dodgers are calling up top prospect Dalton Rushing and designating longtime backup catcher Austin Barnes for assignment. Rushing, a 2022 second-round pick, has impressed with his offensive performance in the minor leagues. The decision to part ways with Barnes, a two-time World Series champion and the longest-tenured position player on the roster, comes as a surprise. Barnes had been serving as a backup to Will Smith, and was batting .214 this season.</p>
