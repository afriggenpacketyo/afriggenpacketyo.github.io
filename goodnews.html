          <p>England's cricket team has named 22-year-old fast bowler Sonny Baker in the squad for his international debut in the first one-day international against South Africa at Headingley. Baker's inclusion comes after a series of impressive performances for the Manchester Originals in The Hundred competition. His rapid ascent also includes a first-class debut for the England Lions earlier this year, positioning him as a potential candidate for the upcoming Ashes tour. The squad also sees the return of fellow fast bowlers Jofra Archer and Brydon Carse, who were absent from the final Test against India.</p>

          <p>South Korea's defense ministry has suspended its "Voice of Freedom" radio broadcasts, a long-standing psychological warfare tool that transmitted outside information and K-pop music into North Korea. The move is the latest in a series of de-escalation measures by President Lee Jae Myung's administration, which seeks to improve relations with the nuclear-armed North. This follows the recent halt of propaganda broadcasts from loudspeakers along the heavily fortified border. Despite these gestures, Pyongyang has so far shown little interest in reciprocating, recently calling President Lee a "hypocrite" for his remarks on denuclearization.</p>

          <p>Newcastle has successfully negotiated a deal worth £55 million to sign Brentford forward Yoane Wissa, just a day after the player publicly stated his desire to leave the club. The fee consists of an initial £50 million with an additional £5 million in add-ons. The 28-year-old DR Congo international is now traveling to Newcastle to finalize the move. This acquisition is a crucial step for Newcastle to bolster its attack, especially after agreeing to sell striker Alexander Isak to Liverpool in a British transfer record deal. Wissa scored more non-penalty goals than any other Premier League player last season.</p>

          <p>The Republican-led House Oversight Committee has officially withdrawn its subpoena for former special counsel Robert Mueller to testify. A committee spokesperson stated that the decision was made after learning of health issues that would prevent Mueller from appearing before the panel. The subpoena was part of the committee's investigation into the Jeffrey Epstein files, as Mueller served as FBI director from 2001 to 2013, a period during which Epstein was under investigation. Mueller's family has since informed The New York Times that he has been battling Parkinson's disease, which prohibits him from testifying before Congress.</p>

          <p>The final phase of England's largest-ever expansion of funded childcare has begun, offering working parents 30 hours of government-paid childcare per week for children aged nine months to four years. While the scheme is expected to save eligible families thousands of pounds annually, it has created challenges, including long nursery waiting lists due to staff shortages. The strict eligibility deadlines, tied to birth dates and academic terms, have led some parents to make critical medical decisions, such as choosing an earlier Caesarean section date, to qualify for funding sooner and avoid months of additional costs.</p>

          <p>Employees at Yosemite, Sequoia, and Kings Canyon national parks have voted overwhelmingly to unionize, with over 97% of ballots cast in favor. The move to join the National Federation of Federal Employees represents more than 600 staffers, including rangers, biologists, and firefighters. Organizers say the unionization effort gained critical momentum after mass firings of National Park Service employees in February under the Trump administration, which has also overseen a 25% staff reduction and proposed a $1-billion budget cut. Workers cited rock-bottom morale, job insecurity, low pay, and poor living conditions as primary drivers for seeking union protection.</p>

Led by welder Rennae Ross, the modern-day Rosies are repairing the ship's heavily rusted deck to preserve it as a museum. The effort is a tribute to the millions of women who contributed to the war effort and aims to show younger generations that the trades are viable professions for women.</p>

          <p>In a personal column, a parent describes the profound and disorienting transition to an empty nest after 27 years of raising children. With the departure of the youngest child for college, the once-chaotic house is now silent and orderly, and the rigid structure of school schedules and parenting duties has vanished. The author reflects on the challenge of being the "sole proprietor" of her day, missing not only her child but also the constant activity that defined her adult life. She shares a list of personal resolutions to navigate this new phase, from eating proper meals to rediscovering hobbies.</p>

          <p>The Los Angeles County Museum of Art has begun installing the first artwork in its new, still-under-construction David Geffen Galleries. The piece is a 27-foot-long photo sculpture by L.A. artist Todd Gray titled "Octavia Butler’s Gaze," a permanent commission for the museum's entrance. The installation process involves drilling directly into the new building's signature concrete walls, a key element of architect Peter Zumthor's design. The new galleries, set to open in 2026, will feature a non-chronological, interwoven presentation of art, focusing on themes of migration and intersection rather than traditional regional or temporal divisions.</p>

The rest of the former mall is being converted by UCLA into a major research center. The new apartment complex offers high-end amenities like a resort-style pool, a sauna, and a pet spa, with rents ranging from $3,800 for a studio to $8,500 for a townhouse.</p>

          <p>Royal Mail has reported an annual profit of £12 million, marking its first return to profitability in three years. The turnaround for the 500-year-old postal service comes after its acquisition by Czech billionaire Daniel Kretinsky's EP Group in April. The positive financial results are attributed to a strategic shift towards more lucrative parcel deliveries, which saw a 6% volume increase, and cost-cutting measures such as halting Saturday second-class letter deliveries. The new ownership has committed to maintaining the Universal Service Obligation and keeping the company's headquarters and brand in the UK for the next five years.</p>

          <p>The annual rate of UK house price growth slowed to 2.1% in August, matching the lowest level seen this year, according to data from the lender Nationwide. The average UK home now costs £271,079, but high prices relative to incomes continue to make homeownership challenging for many. This sluggish market data emerges as the government is reportedly considering a major overhaul of property taxes, including stamp duty and council tax, in the upcoming Autumn budget. Experts suggest that while such reforms could stimulate the market, they would also have significant implications for tax revenue. (not investment advice)</p>

The policy aims to make train travel more affordable and attractive, encouraging commuters to switch from cars to public transport. For example, a ticket from Edinburgh to Glasgow will now be nearly 50% cheaper during what was formerly the peak period. The Scottish government expects the initiative to cost between £40 million to £45 million annually, viewing it as a crucial investment in the rail network and the public.</p>
