          <p>The global market for diabetes drugs, increasingly used for obesity treatment, is poised for expansion in Asia, with Chinese biotech firms like Innovent Biologics entering the competition against industry giants Eli Lilly and Novo Nordisk.

Morgan Stanley has raised its forecast for the global obesity-control drug market to $150 billion by 2035, citing growth potential in China and Japan.

          <p>South African President Cyril Ramaphosa is scheduled to visit the White House to counter what he views as misinformation from President Trump, particularly regarding claims of a genocide against white farmers in South Africa. Ramaphosa aims to persuade Trump that close ties with South Africa, the largest economy in Africa, benefit the United States. He also intends to engage with Elon Musk, a vocal critic of South Africa, to explore potential business opportunities for Tesla and SpaceX in the country, such as building electric vehicle charging stations and utilizing South African facilities for rocket launches. Ramaphosa also plans to address America's support of Israel by arguing that the term genocide is inappropriately used in the South Africa context.</p>

          <p>Recent satellite imagery indicates that Russia is increasing its military infrastructure along the Finnish border, a move confirmed by NATO officials, including new tents, warehouses for military vehicles, and upgrades to fighter jet shelters and helicopter bases. While troop levels remain low due to the ongoing war in Ukraine, Finland, a recent NATO member, anticipates a significant increase in Russian forces within five years. Military analysts suggest this area could become a hotspot, particularly within the Arctic Circle, and recent military exercises involving American and Finnish troops have focused on Arctic warfare scenarios.
