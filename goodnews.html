          <p>Cape Verde is celebrating its 50th anniversary of independence, reflecting on significant progress in development, particularly in education and healthcare. Since 1975, the nation has dramatically reduced illiteracy from 65% to about 3% and built a robust healthcare system, resulting in one of Africa's highest life expectancies. Despite these successes, challenges like youth unemployment and migration persist, with about 6% of young people leaving the country between 2009 and 2021. The government continues to address poverty through social policies, aiming to build on its reputation as one of the continent's most stable democracies.</p>

          <p>Mercedes driver George Russell has stated he is confident about his future with the team, despite speculation linking four-time world champion Max Verstappen to his seat for next season. Speaking before the British Grand Prix, Russell, whose contract expires this year, said the likelihood of him not being at Mercedes is "exceptionally low." Team boss Toto Wolff has acknowledged speaking with Verstappen's representatives but also indicated Russell is likely to stay. Russell emphasized his strong performance this season, including a recent win, as the primary factor in securing his position with the team.</p>

          <p>Seven-time Wimbledon champion Novak Djokovic delivered a commanding performance to defeat British veteran Dan Evans in straight sets, 6-3, 6-2, 6-0, in the second round. Djokovic's serving was nearly flawless, preventing Evans from gaining any momentum in what could be the 35-year-old's final appearance at the tournament. The win marks Djokovic's 99th victory at Wimbledon as he continues his quest for a record-equaling eighth men's singles title. In other results, British wildcard Jack Pinnington Jones was eliminated after a straight-sets loss to Italy's Flavio Cobolli, ending his debut run.</p>

          <p>Chelsea faces a significant selection problem for their upcoming Club World Cup quarter-final against Palmeiras, as key midfielder Mois√©s Caicedo is suspended. Caicedo, a linchpin in the team's structure, received a yellow card for dissent in the previous match, triggering a one-game ban. His absence leaves a major void in Chelsea's midfield, as he has been a durable and consistent starter known for his defensive prowess and energy. Manager Enzo Maresca must now find a way to compensate for the loss of his most effective tackler in a crucial match against formidable Brazilian opposition.</p>

          <p>The U.S. labor market's growth in June was predominantly powered by the public sector, with state and local governments adding 73,000 jobs. This accounted for about half of the total 147,000 nonfarm payrolls added during the month, with most new positions being in education. The healthcare and social assistance sector also saw significant growth, adding over 58,000 jobs. In contrast, the federal government workforce shrank by 7,000, and sectors like professional services and manufacturing experienced job losses, showing a mixed but overall positive employment picture for the month.

          <p>The U.S. labor market demonstrated continued resilience in June, with employers adding 147,000 jobs, surpassing economists' expectations. The unemployment rate also fell to 4.1%, its lowest point since February, indicating a solid employment situation despite broader economic uncertainties. The strong report was largely driven by hiring in the government and healthcare sectors. This steady job growth makes it likely that the Federal Reserve will maintain its current interest rates, holding off on cuts as it continues to monitor the potential impact of tariffs on inflation and economic activity.

          <p>An analysis of where to best place a $10,000 deposit shows that a high-yield savings account currently offers slightly better returns than a long-term certificate of deposit (CD). Based on July 2025 rates, a high-yield savings account at 4.30% would earn marginally more over 18 months to three years than CDs with slightly lower fixed rates. However, the article notes that high-yield savings rates are variable and likely to fall if the Federal Reserve cuts interest rates as anticipated. Therefore, locking in a slightly lower but guaranteed CD rate now could prove to be the more profitable long-term strategy. (not investment advice)</p>

After a near standstill since early 2022, the number of tech IPOs has been slowly increasing, providing much-needed returns for venture capital firms and their investors. While major companies like SpaceX and Stripe remain private, the recent activity, including the anticipated Figma IPO, is fostering cautious optimism that the window for public offerings is reopening, though sustained momentum remains uncertain.

          <p>Following the release of a strong June jobs report, CNBC's Jim Cramer suggested the data validates Federal Reserve Chairman Jerome Powell's cautious approach to interest rates. Cramer argued that the better-than-expected job growth and low unemployment rate show there is no immediate need for the rate cuts that President Trump has been demanding. With the stock market reaching new highs, Cramer also discussed potential portfolio trimming strategies in an overbought market. He highlighted stocks like Broadcom and certain banks as candidates for taking profits, advising against greed in the current climate. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>This essay reflects on the long-standing journalistic tradition of writing about "the youths," often with a condescending or worried tone. The author examines historical examples from The Atlantic, where writers have scrutinized younger generations for everything from their dancing and dress to their perceived lack of emotion or ambition. While acknowledging that generational shifts are real and worth documenting, the piece questions where the line is between empathetic observation and hollow stereotyping. The author concludes that the best writing approaches young adults with humility and nuance, recognizing them as individuals navigating the unique challenges of their time.</p>
