        </div>
        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>California Attorney General Rob Bonta is opposing the Menendez brothers' request to remove the Los Angeles District Attorney's office from their resentencing case, arguing that the defense has not provided sufficient evidence of bias. The brothers' attorneys claim the DA's office has shown bias and violated Marsy's Law against their family. Bonta's office asserts that the defense's claims do not meet the "stringent standards" required for an office-wide recusal, emphasizing that any potential conflicts have been addressed, such as the DA walling off an attorney who previously represented Kitty Menendez's brother. A hearing is scheduled to address the recusal motion and the possibility of resentencing.</p>

          <p>Street sex workers in Bristol are working with police and a charity to protect at-risk children by providing vital information on child exploitation. The Night Light initiative, started in 2020, relies on the women's insights to identify and prosecute child sex offenders and help underage girls leave the streets. In one case, a sex worker helped convict a man who was abusing his daughter, and in another, a man showing child abuse photos was reported to the authorities. This unique project highlights the crucial role these women play in safeguarding vulnerable children and bringing perpetrators to justice.</p>

          <p>Richard Irvine, the owner of Colonsay Smokery on the remote Scottish island of Colonsay, is offering his business for free to the right candidate who commits to living on the island. Irvine, a serial business creator, established the smokery in 2022 with the intention of giving it away to attract younger people to the island community. The island, located off the west coast of Scotland, faces challenges in attracting new families due to a lack of affordable housing and jobs. The ideal candidate would likely be part of a young couple or family, with one partner working remotely and the other running the smokery.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Asia's largest economies have approved a new rapid financing mechanism using regional currencies, including the Chinese yuan, signaling a potential shift away from the US dollar. This decision aims to shield East and Southeast Asian countries from financial volatility caused by US President Donald Trump's global tariff war. The move could lead to a longer-term shift towards a regional monetary system less reliant on the dollar, potentially giving China a more significant role in the region's financial landscape. The new mechanism is part of the Chiang Mai Initiative Multilatalisation (CMIM), a currency swap arrangement among ASEAN, China, Japan, and South Korea.</p>

          <p>Sovereignty, the winner of the Kentucky Derby, will not compete in the Preakness Stakes, ending the chance for a Triple Crown winner this year. Trainer Bill Mott cited the horse's long-term interests as the reason, with plans to enter Sovereignty in the Belmont Stakes instead. This marks the fifth time since 2018 that the Preakness will proceed without a potential Triple Crown contender.

Jury members for the fiction prize included the novelists Bryan Washington, Jonathan Lethem, Ayana Mathis and Laila Lalami, and the critic Merve Emre.
