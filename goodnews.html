          <p>Arsenal has officially completed the high-profile signing of England forward Eberechi Eze from Crystal Palace in a deal valued at £60 million, including £8 million in add-ons. This acquisition marks the Gunners' seventh summer signing, significantly bolstering their squad. Notably, Eze, a boyhood Arsenal fan, chose to rejoin his former youth club despite rival Tottenham Hotspur also having agreed to terms with both the player and Crystal Palace. Sporting director Andrea Berta described Eze as a "creative and explosive talent with huge technical quality," while manager Mikel Arteta praised his powerful and exciting playing style, emphasizing his journey and ambition. This strategic transfer is anticipated to inject a new, dynamic dimension into Arsenal's attacking game, raising expectations for their performance in the upcoming season.</p>

          <p>Travian Robertson, the South Carolina defensive line coach and a former NFL player, is currently in stable condition after being involved in a car accident on Friday morning. The university released a statement confirming the incident, with head coach Shane Beamer indicating that Robertson, now in his third year as a Gamecocks assistant, is anticipated to make a full recovery. Reports suggest the 36-year-old sustained a significant lower leg injury in a head-on collision and has since undergone ankle surgery. The university has requested privacy for the Robertson family and prayers for all affected by the accident. Consequently, Robertson is expected to be absent from the sidelines for the upcoming season opener against Virginia Tech on August 31.</p>

          <p>Scotland overcame pre-tournament player contract uncertainties to deliver a dominant six-try victory over Wales in their Women's Rugby World Cup opener, setting a new attendance record for a match between the two nations with 10,054 fans. Francesca McGhie starred with a hat-trick, supported by tries from Leia Brebner-Holden, Evie Gallagher, and Emma Orr, as Scotland outclassed Wales in nearly every aspect of the game. Despite an early try from Wales' Alex Callender, Scotland secured a record 30-point winning margin against their Celtic rivals. This impressive display puts Scotland in a strong position for their next match against Fiji, while Wales faces a challenging regrouping period before taking on Canada.</p>

          <p>Wall Street saw a significant rally on Friday, turning a weekly loss into a gain, after Federal Reserve Chairman Jerome Powell hinted at potential interest rate cuts during his speech at the Jackson Hole economic symposium. This signal particularly benefited cyclical, economically sensitive stocks like DuPont and Home Depot, while defensive groups lagged. While lower rates generally lift all markets, big tech stocks saw only slight gains as their fortunes are more tied to AI innovation than borrowing costs. The Dow Jones Industrial Average reached a new all-time high, closing at a record, while the S&P 500 and Nasdaq Composite also rallied. This suggests investor confidence in a more accommodative monetary policy ahead. (not investment advice)</p>

However, this warm spell will be short-lived, as the remnants of Hurricane Erin are forecast to bring cooler, unsettled weather with wind and rain starting from Tuesday. Major events like Notting Hill Carnival and Reading and Leeds festival will enjoy increasingly warm and sunny conditions over the weekend. Travelers are advised to anticipate potential delays and cancellations due to rail strikes on the CrossCountry network and engineering works, with the RNLI warning of rough seas for coastal visitors.</p>

          <p>A central Berlin street, formerly known by a name with overt racist connotations, has been officially renamed Anton-Wilhelm-Amo-Strasse to honor the first Africa-born scholar to receive a European doctorate. This change, initially approved in 2020, faced a lawsuit from residents but was upheld by the Higher Administrative Court of Berlin-Brandenburg. The renaming coincided with International Day for the Remembrance of the Slave Trade and its Abolition. Anton Wilhelm Amo, enslaved as a boy in Ghana, became a philosopher and legal scholar in 18th-century Germany, advocating for the rights of Black people in Europe. The decision is seen as a significant step in decolonizing Berlin's public spaces and recognizing overlooked Black history.</p>

          <p>A colossal landslide in Alaska's Tracy Arm fjord triggered a powerful tsunami on August 10, with scientists estimating up to 100 million cubic meters of rock fell, creating a wave that surged 1,400 feet up the opposite fjord wall. Despite the historic scale of the event, no casualties were reported, largely due to early morning timing and poor weather deterring visitors from the popular tourist destination. Scientists, including Dennis Staley of the USGS, consider it a "close call" and "dodged a bullet." Experts are increasingly concerned about such events, which appear to be rising as glaciers retreat due to climate change, potentially "de-buttressing" mountain walls and thawing permafrost.</p>

          <p>British comedian Sam Nicoresti has made history by becoming the first transgender person to win the Best Comedy Show award at the Edinburgh Fringe for their show "Baby Doomer," which explores life as a trans woman. In another first, Ayoade Bamgboye won Best Newcomer for "Swings and Roundabouts," becoming the first Black woman to receive that accolade. This year's festival also notably abolished the "funniest joke" award. Nicoresti, who received a £10,000 prize, expressed excitement, dedicating the win to "queers making weird art" and sharing the moment with the first all-female lineup of award winners. Bamgboye's show, drawing on her move from Nigeria, has been praised for its "thrilling debut."</p>

          <p>Hawaii's Kilauea volcano has resumed erupting, marking its 31st display of molten rock since December, with lava shooting 100 feet into the air across its summit crater floor. The eruption, contained within the summit crater, poses no threat to nearby homes. This frequent activity is characteristic of Kilauea, one of the world's most active volcanoes. Scientists monitor magma flow and ground changes to predict eruptions, noting the current pattern of towering lava fountains is the fourth in 200 years. Park Service volunteer Janice Wei describes the spectacle as "nature's most extraordinary show," while cultural practitioners connect it to the stories of the volcano goddess Pele.</p>

          <p>College athletics are undergoing a significant transformation, moving from casual club activities to a highly professionalized and lucrative industry, particularly in football and men's basketball. Recent court decisions now allow college athletes to receive compensation from advertisers, fans, and their institutions, fundamentally altering their status. This shift is reshaping both athletes' careers and the overall experience of college-level sports. The article highlights that while this professionalization is long overdue for revenue-generating athletes, it raises questions about the future of niche college sports and the broader implications for admissions and equity, as college sports have historically been seen as a form of affirmative action for affluent white students.</p>

          <p>Restaurateur Tommy Fello, 72, is regaining significant function in his left arm and hand after a stroke, thanks to the Vivistim System, an FDA-approved vagus nerve stimulation implant. After traditional physical and occupational therapy yielded only minor improvements, Fello became the first Cleveland Clinic patient to receive the device. The system works by delivering gentle pulses to the vagus nerve during rehabilitation exercises, enhancing the brain's neuroplasticity and creating new neural connections. Dr. Erez Nossek, a neurosurgeon, highlights it as a "first-of-its-kind technology" redefining stroke recovery possibilities. Fello, who once felt his arm was "just like an appendage," is now thrilled with his progress and hopes for further improvements.</p>

          <p>The CEO of a major Angolan rail project has clarified that its development is not aimed at countering China, despite US officials announcing a planned cross-continental railway linking the Atlantic and Indian Oceans. The company, LAR, maintains strong commercial ties with China, serving Chinese-owned mining companies and relying on Chinese manufacturing for equipment. The CEO emphasized that LAR's role is purely logistical, operating the rail and port components of the corridor, and that "no geopolitics [are] involved whatsoever." This statement seeks to de-escalate any perception of the project as a strategic move against China's influence in Africa, focusing instead on its commercial and developmental objectives.</p>

          <h2>Zelenskyy's Wardrobe Choices Reflect "High-Stakes Endgame Diplomacy" in White House Meeting</h2>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy's choice of attire for his recent Oval Office meeting with President Trump has been interpreted as a deliberate act of "wardrobe diplomacy." Unlike a previous combative meeting where he wore a casual Henley shirt, Zelenskyy appeared in a black canvas blazer over a collared shirt, signaling a more formal and serious approach. This sartorial shift was noted by both Trump and a right-wing reporter who had previously criticized his casual wear. Experts suggest that Zelenskyy, working with a Ukrainian designer, is blending his wartime style with a more formal look for "high-stakes endgame diplomacy," aiming to foster a more productive dialogue with the US administration.</p>
