          <h2>Pentagon Acquires Major Stake in MP Materials to Secure Rare Earth Supply</h2>
          <div class="timestamp">2025-07-10 10:37:24 EDT</div>
        </div>
        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>The Pentagon is set to become the largest shareholder in MP Materials, the only operational rare earth mine in the U.S., by investing $400 million in preferred stock. This strategic move aims to expand MP Materials' processing capacity and magnet production, which are crucial for advanced military weapons systems like the F-35 warplane, drones, and submarines. The initiative seeks to significantly reduce U.S. dependence on foreign countries, particularly China, for these critical minerals, which has been a point of contention in trade disputes. This public-private partnership will also finance a new magnet manufacturing facility, with the Pentagon guaranteeing a minimum price for neodymium-praseodymium oxide (NdPr), a key rare earth compound.

          <p>The article highlights that artificial intelligence tool adoption is increasing rapidly across businesses and consumers, despite being far from ubiquity, suggesting significant future growth for the AI trade. U.S. Census Bureau data shows a sharp rise in companies using AI, with adoption rates varying by company size, and consumer use of OpenAI's ChatGPT has notably doubled since summer 2023, particularly among younger adults. This widespread embrace, coupled with OpenAI's impressive revenue growth and Microsoft's surge in token processing, validates Wall Street's excitement for the sector. The trend indicates continued monetization opportunities across various industries, cementing AI's position as a clear winner in 2025. (not investment advice)</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Christian Horner's departure from Red Bull, following sexual assault allegations, removes a point of tension around star driver Max Verstappen, potentially making him more likely to stay despite his contract until 2028. However, the article highlights that Verstappen's primary concerns now revolve around the car's declining performance, as McLaren has surpassed Red Bull as the leading force in Formula 1. The team also faces questions about its technical department post-Adrian Newey and the competitiveness of its new engine for 2026. Laurent Mekies, Horner's successor, faces the challenge of stabilizing the team and improving car design.</p>

          <p>Amazon Web Services (AWS) has developed its own innovative hardware, called the In-Row Heat Exchanger (IRHX), specifically designed to cool next-generation Nvidia graphics processing units (GPUs) that are essential for intensive artificial intelligence workloads. This strategic development addresses the immense energy and cooling demands of Nvidia's powerful AI chips, as existing commercial solutions were deemed inadequate for AWS's vast scale or would require excessive data center floor space. By creating proprietary hardware, AWS aims to lessen its reliance on external suppliers, potentially boosting its bottom line. This article highlights AWS's proactive and strategic response to the accelerating AI boom and its commitment to optimizing its cloud infrastructure.</p>
