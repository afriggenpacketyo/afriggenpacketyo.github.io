        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>According to royal experts, Kate Middleton's success as a modern royal lies in her adherence to royal rules and traditions, unlike Princess Diana, who often challenged them. Kate married Prince William at a more mature age, allowing her to better understand the responsibilities and expectations of royal life. She maintains a composed demeanor, focusing on duty and avoiding personal drama, which has helped her navigate intense media scrutiny. In contrast, Princess Diana faced immense pressure and lacked the support system that Kate benefits from, leading to a more turbulent experience within the royal family. The article also notes the importance of Prince William's supportive role in helping Kate manage her royal duties with ease.</p>

          <p>The Kurdistan Workers‚Äô Party (PKK), a Kurdish militia group, has declared its intention to lay down arms and disband after a 40-year insurgency against the Turkish state. This decision follows a call from the group's imprisoned leader, Abdullah Ocalan, who suggested that the armed struggle had achieved its purpose and further progress could be made through political means. The PKK, considered a terrorist organization by Turkey, the United States, and others, has sought greater rights for Kurds within Turkey, moving away from its initial goal of an independent state. This move could significantly reshape Turkish politics and influence other Kurdish militias in the region, potentially leading to a new era of political dialogue and expanded Kurdish rights. The article highlights the potential benefits for President Erdogan, who could gain support among Kurds and claim success in ending the conflict.</p>

          <p>The United States and China have reached an agreement to temporarily reduce tariffs imposed on each other, signaling a potential de-escalation in their ongoing trade war. Both countries will suspend most of the levies imposed since early April for 90 days, allowing trade negotiations to progress. U.S. Treasury Secretary Scott Bessent stated that the U.S. would reduce tariffs on Chinese imports to about 30%, while China would lower its tariffs on American imports to 10%. This breakthrough has buoyed commodities and currency markets, offering hope for a resolution to the trade tensions that have cast a shadow over the global financial landscape. The article mentions that the differences between the two countries may not have been as significant as initially perceived.</p>

          <p>Plans to build 164 apartments at a former factory site in Hunslet, Leeds, have been delayed due to the developer's inability to include affordable rentals. Councillors on Leeds City Council's planning panel deferred the decision after Countrylarge Ltd. stated that providing discount homes was not financially viable. Concerns were also raised about the reduction in green space contributions and the limited number of parking spaces included in the development. The project will be subject to a "late-stage review," requiring an affordable housing contribution if excess profits are made.</p>

There is a long history of US presidents accepting gifts from foreign powers. The very desk from which Trump has signed a record number of executive order was given to the US by Queen Victoria in 1880. Under US law, foreign gifts valued at less than $480 can be retained by federal employees. Anything over that amount is considered a gift to the ‚Äúpeople of the United States‚Äù and must be logged and then disposed of by the White House Gift Unit.</p>
