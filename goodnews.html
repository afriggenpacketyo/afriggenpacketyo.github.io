          <p>The recent Spending Review is a gamble on long-term impacts in a world demanding immediate results. The review's details, initially obscured by political rhetoric, gradually emerge as analysts dissect accompanying documents. One example is the expectation that many people in England and Wales will be paying higher council tax to help fund the police, which was not explicitly set out. Further details on infrastructure plans are expected in the coming weeks, but the full implications of the review may take months to unfold. </p>

          <p>Scientists have identified a new dinosaur species, Khankhuuluu mongoliensis, that is changing the understanding of tyrannosaur evolution. Discovered in a Mongolian museum, the 86-million-year-old skeletons represent the closest known ancestor of all tyrannosaurs, including the T.rex. This species is considered a transitional fossil between smaller, earlier tyrannosauroids and the larger, more formidable giants that dominated North America and Asia. The discovery reveals early evolutionary stages of key tyrannosaur features, such as skull anatomy that enabled a powerful jaw. </p>
