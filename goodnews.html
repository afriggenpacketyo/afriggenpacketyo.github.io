This increase is attributed to both a rise in submissions and Tripadvisor's more aggressive policies against incentivized reviews. The company employs a three-pronged approach involving auto-detection, human review, and community feedback to identify and remove fake reviews. Most paid reviews originate in Asia, particularly Indonesia and Vietnam, and Tripadvisor uses various techniques, including AI and posing as fake review brokers, to combat this issue.</p>

          <p>According to the article, emotionally safe parenting is a new approach to raising highly successful children. This parenting style emphasizes emotional attunement, self-awareness, and inner healing. Emotionally safe parents accept their child's emotions, respond without shaming, view "bad" behavior as stress signals, and take responsibility after conflicts. The approach also involves parents doing internal work to become less reactive and creating an environment where children feel safe expressing themselves.</p>
