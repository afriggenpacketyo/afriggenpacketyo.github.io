          <p>A new peace deal between Israel and Hamas, brokered by the U.S., has highlighted Turkey's significant diplomatic role in the negotiations. Turkish President Erdoğan, at President Trump's request, reportedly used his country's close relationship with Hamas to help persuade the group to agree to the terms. As part of the implementation, Turkey may contribute to a multinational task force in Gaza, potentially assisting in locating the remains of Israeli hostages, though the deployment of Turkish troops would require parliamentary approval.</p>

This initiative is part of President Trump's broader effort to pressure drugmakers to reduce costs and increase manufacturing within the United States, using the threat of tariffs as leverage.</p>

          <p>Chicha, a unique genre of Peruvian cumbia, represents a complex fusion of cultural influences that reflect the nation's identity. Originating in the 1960s from the mass migration of Indigenous Andean people to Lima, the music blends Colombian cumbia, Andean huayno, and psychedelic rock, characterized by its prominent electric guitar. Icons like Chacalón and Los Shapis brought chicha to the masses, giving a voice to marginalized migrant communities and cementing its status as a powerful symbol of Peruvian popular culture.</p>

          <p>The Federal Communications Commission (FCC) has confirmed that major U.S. online retailers have removed millions of listings for prohibited Chinese electronics. The delisted items include unauthorized equipment or products from companies on a U.S. government blacklist, such as Huawei and ZTE, over national security concerns. This action is part of a broader crackdown by U.S. agencies to prevent unapproved Chinese technology from entering the American market, with the FCC planning to vote on even tighter restrictions soon.</p>

          <p>An opinion piece argues that President Trump's recent success in forcing Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu to accept a Gaza peace plan demonstrates that direct U.S. pressure is the only effective method. For months, Netanyahu had reportedly undermined negotiations to prolong the war and his own political survival.

          <p>Financial experts are highlighting both the advantages and disadvantages for retirees considering investments in precious metals like gold and silver. While these assets can serve as a hedge against inflation and a store of value during economic uncertainty, they do not generate income through dividends or interest. Potential investors must also consider practical factors such as storage costs, insurance, and higher capital gains tax rates compared to stocks, making balanced allocation essential.

        </div>
        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Financial experts explain that central banks purchase gold to diversify their reserves, reducing reliance on single currencies like the U.S. dollar and acquiring an asset outside the traditional banking system. Gold serves as a stable store of value, a hedge against inflation, and provides financial security with no counterparty risk, making it a crucial tool for crisis management. Its historical trustworthiness and limited supply ensure it remains a cornerstone of national reserves for maintaining economic stability. (not investment advice)</p>

Current average 30-year refinance rates are around 6.51%, and options like adjustable-rate mortgages or buying mortgage points could help borrowers secure even lower rates and achieve significant savings.
