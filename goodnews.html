          <h2>China Implements Mandatory Safety Certification for Power Banks Following Fire Incidents</h2>
          <div class="timestamp">2025-08-15 06:00:21 EDT</div>
        </div>
        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>In response to a series of fire incidents linked to faulty products, China has mandated new safety regulations for power banks. Effective immediately, all lithium-ion battery packs must obtain a China Compulsory Certification (CCC) before they can be manufactured, sold, or distributed in the country. This move aims to enforce higher quality and safety standards in an industry previously plagued by a lack of compulsory checks. While not an outright ban on uncertified devices, the rule may lead to their prohibition in public spaces and on transportation, aligning with existing civil aviation bans.</p>

The story follows two women, both named Rebecca, as they navigate a breakup while becoming entangled with the same third woman, Charlotte, who has her own complex secrets. The reviewer highlights the novel's engaging and complex plot, which involves the two Rebeccas pretending to be married to foster a child. The review also contrasts the characters' contemporary experiences with the dangers and fears faced by lesbians in the 1980s, celebrating the novel as a reflection of a world changed for the better by queer activism.</p>

          <p>Humanity's long-standing obsession with Mars, now championed by figures like Elon Musk, has its roots in a 19th-century astronomical misinterpretation. The belief in an intelligent Martian civilization began when Italian astronomer Giovanni Schiaparelli's term "canali" (channels) was mistranslated as "canals," suggesting artificial construction. This idea was popularized by astronomer Percival Lowell, who theorized a vast irrigation network built by a wise, dying race, capturing the public imagination during a time of societal despair. Though later disproven, this early craze fueled generations of science fiction and inspired the very space exploration that continues today.</p>

          <h2>Chinese Scientists Announce Breakthrough in Overcoming 40-Year-Old Computing Speed Limit</h2>
          <div class="timestamp">2025-08-15 05:17:22 EDT</div>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>A research team from Tsinghua University in China has developed a new approach to solve a fundamental problem in theoretical computer science, potentially breaking a decades-old barrier in computing speed. The problem involves finding the most efficient path in a network, traditionally solved by Dijkstra’s algorithm, which has a known speed limit due to its sorting process. The new method bypasses this sorting step, focusing only on the most critical points to significantly reduce calculation time. This innovative work has already earned the Best Paper Award at a major international computing symposium.</p>

          <p>In a recently detailed speech, Chinese President Xi Jinping called for the solid and thorough implementation of policies designed to support the country's private sector. He vowed that the government would ensure a level playing field, protect the legal rights of entrepreneurs, and address long-standing issues like overdue payments from government entities. Xi stressed that decisions made by the party's Central Committee must be carried out without delay or compromise. The speech signals continued high-level support for private businesses, which have faced challenges despite various relief policies introduced in recent years.</p>

          <p>Oil prices fell in early trading as investors adopted a cautious stance ahead of the meeting between U.S. President Donald Trump and Russian President Vladimir Putin. Brent crude futures dropped to $66.44 a barrel amid speculation that the talks could potentially lead to an easing of sanctions on Russian oil supply if a deal on Ukraine is reached. Meanwhile, gold prices saw a slight increase as a traditional safe-haven asset during times of geopolitical uncertainty. The U.S. dollar weakened slightly, providing a small boost to the British pound ahead of the high-stakes summit in Alaska. (not investment advice)</p>

          <h2>Rising British Heavyweight Boxer Moses Itauma Faces Key Test Against Dillian Whyte</h2>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>At just 20 years old, undefeated British heavyweight Moses Itauma is preparing for the biggest fight of his career against veteran Dillian Whyte in Saudi Arabia. With an impressive record of 12 wins and 10 knockouts, the highly-touted southpaw is seen as a future star with a style reminiscent of Oleksandr Usyk. While he has already surpassed the early-career achievements of British champions like Tyson Fury and Anthony Joshua, this bout is considered his true breakthrough opportunity. A victory over a well-known name like Whyte would validate the hype surrounding Itauma and put him on a fast track toward a world title shot.</p>
