          <p>In a wide-ranging BBC interview, UK Conservative leader Kemi Badenoch shared personal anecdotes that have shaped her character and political views. She recounted an incident from her school days in Nigeria where she exposed a classmate for cheating, highlighting her intolerance for rule-breaking. Badenoch also discussed her return to the UK at 16, the "poverty of low expectations" she encountered from some teachers, and how she lost her religious faith while still identifying as a "cultural Christian." The interview provides insight into the personal background of the politician currently tasked with rebuilding the Conservative Party's standing.</p>

        </div>
        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Despite political pressure to increase U.S. auto exports, American-made pickup trucks and large SUVs face significant cultural and practical hurdles in markets like Japan and Europe. Consumers in these regions often find the vehicles too large for narrow city streets and tight parking spaces, and too fuel-inefficient for local preferences. While some enthusiasts appreciate the design of classic American cars, the mass market is dominated by smaller, locally produced vehicles. This reality suggests that lowering tariffs and changing regulations may not be enough to convince overseas buyers to embrace Detroit's larger offerings.</p>

          <p>Conductor Gustavo Dudamel returned to the Hollywood Bowl for a celebrated but bittersweet week of performances with the Los Angeles Philharmonic, marking the 20th anniversary of his U.S. debut. The concert featured a savvy pairing of Duke Ellington and Maurice Ravel, with pianist Seong-Jin Cho as the soloist for Ravel's two piano concertos. The review praises the orchestra's ability to "swing" through Ellington's symphonic works, a rare feat for a classical ensemble. However, the homecoming was tinged with sadness due to the cancellation of the upcoming visit by Dudamel's Simón Bolívar Symphony Orchestra of Venezuela.</p>

          <div class="timestamp">2025-08-06 20:02:50 EDT</div>

          <p>The UK government has announced plans to tighten regulations on the non-surgical cosmetic industry to protect consumers from "dodgy practitioners." The new rules will require clinics to obtain a license to offer procedures like Botox and dermal fillers, ensuring they meet strict safety and training standards. For higher-risk treatments, such as non-surgical Brazilian butt lifts (BBLs), only qualified health professionals will be permitted to perform them. The crackdown follows growing concerns over patient harm and a number of high-profile cases, including a death linked to an unregulated BBL procedure.</p>

          <p>Los Angeles FC has officially introduced South Korean soccer superstar Son Heung-min, a major acquisition intended to elevate the club's performance and global brand. The transfer from England's Tottenham Hotspur, for a reported MLS record fee of $26 million, brings one of Asia's most popular and talented athletes to Los Angeles. Son is expected to have an immediate on-field impact and forge a strong connection with the city's large Korean-American community, similar to how his predecessor Carlos Vela connected with the Hispanic fanbase. The signing is seen as a strategic move to grow LAFC's international profile.</p>

          <p>The head of the UK's university admissions service, UCAS, has predicted that a record number of 18-year-old students are likely to secure their first-choice university spot this year, even if they narrowly miss their required grades. Dr. Jo Saxton stated that uncertainty around international student enrollment is making UK undergraduates a more stable and attractive option for universities' financial planning. This increased flexibility means institutions may be more willing to accept near-miss candidates. The prediction comes as thousands of students across the UK await their A-level and other qualification results next week.</p>

          <p>Dodgers star Shohei Ohtani delivered a truly impressive two-way performance, but it was not enough to secure a victory against the St. Louis Cardinals, as the team lost 5-3.

He also hit his 39th home run of the season, which also marked his 1,000th career major league hit. However, the Dodgers' bullpen faltered in the later innings, giving up the lead and wasting Ohtani's exceptional effort on both sides of the ball.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Financial markets widely anticipate that the Bank of England will cut its key interest rate on Thursday from 4.25% to 4.0%, which would mark its fifth reduction since last August. A lower base rate would provide some relief for homeowners with variable-rate mortgages but would mean lower returns for savers. The expected cut comes despite UK inflation remaining above the Bank's 2% target, but signs of a cooling labor market may be giving the Bank room to act. The decision will be accompanied by new economic forecasts for the UK, which has seen sluggish growth in recent months. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>New archaeological evidence suggests that survivors of the catastrophic AD 79 eruption of Mount Vesuvius returned to live among the ruins of Pompeii. Researchers believe that some residents who couldn't afford to relocate, possibly joined by other settlers, established a precarious settlement within the devastated city. This informal community appears to have existed until the 5th century, with people inhabiting the upper floors of buried buildings and using lower levels as cellars. The findings provide a new perspective on the city's history, revealing a post-eruption phase of survival and reoccupation that was previously overlooked by archaeologists.</p>

          <p>Brian Robbins has stepped down as co-chief executive of Paramount Global and head of its film studio, a move that was widely expected ahead of the company's acquisition by Skydance Media. The departure is part of a larger leadership shake-up, with Skydance installing its own executives to manage the historic studio. Robbins, who had been with the company since 2017, led Paramount Pictures through a tumultuous period, overseeing major franchises like "Mission: Impossible" and the studio's highest-grossing film, "Top Gun: Maverick." His exit marks a significant transition as the Redstone era at Paramount comes to a close.</p>
