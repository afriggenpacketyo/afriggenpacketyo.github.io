          <p>Comedian Cristela Alonzo reflects on her upbringing in a south Texas border town, where she lived in an abandoned diner with her undocumented mother and siblings. She details the constant fear of immigration enforcement and the financial hardships that defined her early life, shaping the personal and political themes in her comedy. Alonzo's experiences, including caring for her family and breaking into stand-up, are central to her Netflix specials, which explore class and the current political climate.

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>A new fitness trend circulating on TikTok suggests that consuming a spoonful of honey and salt before exercising can provide a significant energy boost, similar to commercial pre-workout supplements. The combination of a rapidly digesting carbohydrate (honey) and sodium is believed to enhance physical performance. A certified holistic nutritionist interviewed for the article confirms the scientific basis for the trend but recommends pairing it with a more substantial snack for sustained energy. The article notes the hack's popularity is likely due to honey's quick absorption into the bloodstream.</p>

          <p>Despite a recent downgrade from Morgan Stanley analysts, who cited a lack of new catalysts after the bank's asset cap was lifted, Jim Cramer's Investing Club remains confident in Wells Fargo's stock. The article argues that the downgrade overlooks the bank's strategic shift towards diversifying its revenue streams beyond net interest income. Management is focusing on growing fee-based businesses like investment banking, capital markets, and credit cards to reduce dependency on Federal Reserve interest rate policies. The club views the stock as undervalued and believes CEO Charlie Scharf's long-term strategy will prove successful. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>Experts confirm that the 74 million Americans receiving Social Security benefits will continue to get their monthly checks even if the U.S. government shuts down on October 1. Because the program is funded through mandatory spending, payments are not subject to the annual appropriations process that is currently stalled in Congress. However, a shutdown could disrupt other Social Security Administration (SSA) services, as its operating budget requires congressional approval. Services like benefit verifications, replacing Medicare cards, and processing earnings corrections could be temporarily halted, depending on how many SSA employees are furloughed.</p>

In a rare interview, Stanton revealed that after flunking out of college and later being fired from a finance job, he felt lost and turned to photography as a "life preserver." This journey led him to create HONY, a project that has connected millions and raised $20 million for various causes.

          <p>A pioneering experiment in California, known as Project Nexus, is demonstrating the dual benefits of covering irrigation canals with solar panels. The project aims to reduce water evaporation by shading the canals while simultaneously using the cool water below to increase the efficiency of the solar panels. Researchers estimate that covering California's canal network could save 63 billion gallons of water annually and generate significant renewable energy. This mutually beneficial relationship between water infrastructure and solar technology represents a creative solution to address both water scarcity and the need for clean energy in the state.</p>

          <p>Financial personality Dave Ramsey offered blunt advice to a caller who had amassed a $1.1 million portfolio by investing in just a few stocks, calling her strategy "unsustainable" and risky. He strongly recommended that she sell the stocks, pay the capital gains taxes, and reinvest the proceeds into a diversified portfolio of mutual funds. Ramsey emphasized that concentrating wealth in a small number of companies exposes an investor to catastrophic losses if those specific companies falter. He stressed that true long-term wealth building relies on spreading risk across many different investments. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>To better achieve financial goals, behavioral economist Katy Milkman recommends a simple two-step process: set a specific goal and then create a reminder to take action. This approach helps bridge the gap between intention and execution, which is where many savings plans fail. For those who save manually, this could be a recurring calendar alert, while automating savings through direct deposit is an even more effective strategy. Milkman's research also shows that people are most motivated to start new habits during "fresh starts," such as the beginning of a new year or after a birthday.</p>

          <p>Tropical Storm Imelda, the ninth named storm of the Atlantic hurricane season, is forecast to strengthen into a hurricane by Tuesday. According to the National Hurricane Center, the storm was bringing heavy rain to the northwestern Bahamas on Monday. However, its projected path shows it turning east-northeastward and moving away from the southeastern United States, though it may approach Bermuda later in the week. While a direct U.S. landfall is not expected, swells generated by the storm are likely to cause life-threatening surf and rip current conditions along much of the East Coast.</p>
