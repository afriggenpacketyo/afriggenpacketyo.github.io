          <p>A recent CBS News poll reveals that while a majority of California Democrats support Governor Gavin Newsom running for president in 2028, the state's overall electorate is more divided on the matter. The poll shows more Democratic support for a Newsom candidacy than for one by former Vice President Kamala Harris. Voters also indicated they believe Newsom is currently focused on both state and national issues. The survey highlights a broader perception that California sets a good example for the nation on technology and culture but falls short on housing, taxes, and economic policy.</p>

        </div>
        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>For the second consecutive week, average 30-year mortgage rates have fallen, now standing at 6.19%, offering a potential opening for homebuyers who have been sidelined by higher borrowing costs. While this downward trend is positive, experts advise caution, as the decreases are gradual and could reverse due to various economic factors. Prospective buyers are encouraged to weigh the benefits of acting now, with potentially less market competition, against the possibility of further, albeit likely modest, rate cuts later in the year. Acting now could secure a desired property before the traditionally competitive spring buying season arrives. (not investment advice)</p>

        </div>
        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Gold prices have experienced significant fluctuations, dropping sharply before rebounding, creating opportunities for strategic investors. The volatility is driven by competing factors, including Federal Reserve rate cuts weakening the dollar and a strong stock market pulling investors toward riskier assets. To capitalize on these swings, investors can consider trading gold mining stocks or ETFs, which offer leveraged exposure and liquidity. Alternatively, using gold-backed ETFs or futures allows for direct short-term plays on price movements, while long-term investors can strategically purchase physical gold during price dips.

          <p>The Trump administration has denied a report that it is "currently" negotiating to take equity stakes in quantum computing firms like IonQ and Rigetti Computing, yet shares in these companies remained higher. A Commerce Department spokesperson stated no such negotiations are underway, but investors seem to be interpreting the specific wording optimistically, suggesting talks could happen later or involve different financial structures like warrants. The U.S. government views quantum computing as critical for national security, especially in competition with China, creating sustained investor interest despite the technology not yet being commercially viable.

          <p>In Yorgos Lanthimos's new paranoid comedy "Bugonia," Emma Stone stars as a pharmaceutical CEO held captive by two conspiracy theorists, played by Jesse Plemons and Aidan Delbis, who believe she is an alien. The film strips away elaborate settings, focusing on Stone's mesmerizing and darkly humorous performance as she endures torture while maintaining a cool, corporate composure. The script, adapted from a Korean film, explores themes of online radicalization and the desperate human need for purpose. Stone's portrayal of a character who is both a victim and a terrifyingly manipulative figure is a highlight of the unsettling yet compelling movie.</p>

          <p>Pediatric psychologists and child development experts are decoding common toddler behaviors like constantly saying "no," claiming everything as "mine," and resisting transitions between activities. These actions, while often frustrating for parents, are developmentally appropriate and crucial for a child's growing sense of self and independence. Experts explain that toddlers are testing boundaries to understand their place in the world and exert control over their environment. The article offers practical parenting tips, such as modeling calm responses, offering limited choices to give toddlers a sense of agency, and reframing negative commands into positive instructions.</p>

          <p>President Trump has reversed plans to "surge" federal forces into San Francisco to address crime, following phone calls from prominent tech leaders including Nvidia CEO Jensen Huang and Salesforce CEO Marc Benioff. In a social media post, Trump stated that these leaders, along with Mayor Daniel Lurie, convinced him that the city was making substantial progress on its own. Mayor Lurie confirmed the decision, emphasizing that while federal partnerships are welcome, a military presence would hinder the city's recovery. The reversal is a significant political development, showcasing the influence of the tech industry and a de-escalation of federal intervention.</p>

          <p>The Senate has unanimously passed the IRS MATH Act, which aims to make "math error" notices sent to taxpayers clearer and more helpful. The bill, which now heads to the president's desk, addresses complaints that current notices for simple clerical mistakes are confusing and do not adequately explain how to correct the error or the consequences of not responding. Taxpayers currently have 60 days to respond before the IRS's proposed changes become final. Lawmakers hope the new legislation will make it easier for individuals to resolve minor tax return issues without needing professional assistance.</p>

Management also signaled that struggling business segments are expected to improve and that its large cash reserve may be used for stock buybacks, boosting investor confidence.

          <p>The German government has announced it will step in to pay the October salaries for approximately 11,000 local employees at U.S. military bases in the country. This measure ensures that these workers will not face financial hardship due to the ongoing U.S. federal government shutdown, which has halted the flow of funds from Washington. A German Finance Ministry spokeswoman described the move as "a sign of solidarity with the U.S. armed forces" and stated that Germany expects to be reimbursed once the U.S. government resumes payments. The action underscores the close defense cooperation between the two NATO allies.</p>
