Vance, a known cryptocurrency advocate, has personal investments in Bitcoin, and his appearance follows similar participation from Donald Trump Jr. and Eric Trump. The Trump administration's growing ties to crypto, including financial interests and policy promises, have drawn criticism from Democrats and ethics experts, who cite potential conflicts of interest. Despite skepticism about its volatility, Bitcoin's value has risen nearly 60% in the last year, attracting bipartisan interest and increasing its prominence in financial and political discussions (not investment advice).</p>
