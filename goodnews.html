        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Texas Governor Greg Abbott's office is highlighting its rapid distribution of disaster relief funds to flood victims, contrasting it with California's response to recent wildfires. In partnership with country music star George Strait, Texas delivered initial $25,000 checks to families just two weeks after a benefit concert. Abbott criticized California's "FireAid" concert, from which direct funds were slower to reach victims. The Texas relief effort proceeded despite a political standoff where Democratic lawmakers fled the state to block a redistricting vote, which Abbott claims has slowed other necessary legislative responses to the disaster.</p>

          <p>Despite President Trump's declaration of a "crime emergency" to justify federalizing the D.C. police, official data shows a significant decrease in violent crime. According to the city's Metropolitan Police Department, violent crime in 2024 hit a 30-year low and is down another 26% so far in 2025. While the homicide rate did spike in 2023, it was not the highest ever recorded and has since fallen. Carjackings have also decreased substantially from their peak in mid-2023. While D.C.'s violence level remains higher than the average of some other large cities, the downward trend is described by experts as "unmistakable and large."</p>

          <p>Prince Harry and Meghan Markle's production company, Archewell Productions, has signed a new multi-year deal with Netflix, though the terms are less exclusive than their previous agreement. The new pact is a "first-look" deal for film and television projects, unlike their original overall deal which gave Netflix exclusive rights to all content and covered overhead costs. The couple's initial projects, including the documentary series "Harry & Meghan," have been highly successful for the streaming service. Their upcoming slate includes a second season of Meghan's cooking show and a film adaptation of the romance novel "Meet Me at the Lake."</p>

          <p>The Los Angeles City Council has approved the construction of a 51-story residential tower in the South Park neighborhood, though a start date remains uncertain due to a challenging financial climate. The project, planned by New York developer Mack Real Estate, will feature 536 rental units, ground-floor retail, and parking for over 500 vehicles. Despite high demand for housing, developers currently face significant hurdles, including high interest rates, rising material costs from tariffs, and increased labor expenses. While South Park is a vibrant area with high occupancy rates, experts note that many approved downtown projects are struggling to move forward.</p>

          <h2>Broadcasting Giant Sinclair Explores Merger Options for its TV Stations</h2>

          <p>Sinclair, one of the largest owners of broadcast television stations in the U.S., is conducting a strategic review that could lead to a merger of its broadcast business. The company has reportedly held deep discussions with potential partners amid broad industry expectations of deregulation under the Trump administration. Sinclair is also considering spinning off its ventures unit, which includes the Tennis Channel. The move comes as broadcast station groups face declining revenue from traditional pay-TV bundles, making consolidation an attractive option. Sinclair's shares rose nearly 13% in after-market trading following the announcement.</p>

          <p>Twenty-two-year-old fast bowler Sonny Baker delivered an outstanding performance to lead the Manchester Originals to a 10-run victory over the London Spirit. Baker's impressive opening spell, where he conceded only four runs from his first ten deliveries, was crucial in restricting the Spirit's chase. His pace and swing troubled veteran international batters David Warner and Kane Williamson. Captain Phil Salt and England great James Anderson both praised the young bowler's skill and potential. The performance highlighted why Baker, who was recently awarded an England development contract, is considered a highly-rated rising star in cricket.</p>

          <p>President Donald Trump announced that gold will not be subject to tariffs, directly contradicting a recent U.S. Customs and Border Protection ruling. The customs decision had indicated that certain gold bars from Switzerland and other nations would face a 39% duty, causing the precious metal to hit a record high. Following Trump's announcement on Truth Social, gold futures dropped significantly, closing over 2% lower. The initial ruling had caused concern among precious metals associations about its potential to negatively impact the international flow of physical gold. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>After pausing its initial public offering plans in April due to market volatility, ticketing company StubHub is reportedly aiming for a September debut. The company, which filed an updated prospectus, showed 10% revenue growth in the first quarter but also a wider net loss compared to the previous year. The move comes as the IPO market shows signs of revival after a prolonged quiet period. StubHub, reacquired by co-founder Eric Baker in 2020, faces significant competition from rivals like Ticketmaster and SeatGeek in the online ticketing space. (not investment advice)</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Ford has announced a major investment to retool its Louisville, Kentucky, assembly plant to produce a new, more affordable electric pickup truck. The vehicle, priced in the $30,000 range, is expected to roll out within 18 months and represents a strategic pivot for the company toward cheaper EVs. This move comes as the U.S. EV industry faces political headwinds and lower-than-expected demand for pricier models. Ford aims to compete with the wave of affordable EVs from Chinese automakers by simplifying its vehicle design and manufacturing process, calling it a "Model T" moment for the company's electric future.</p>
