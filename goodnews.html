          <p>Actress Kristin Scott Thomas discusses her directorial debut, "My Mother's Wedding," a film deeply rooted in her personal history of loss. The movie, starring Scarlett Johansson and Sienna Miller, explores the lives of three daughters grappling with grief as their mother prepares to remarry. Thomas, who lost her father at age five and her stepfather five years later, drew from these childhood traumas to create the screenplay. She also reflects on her career, from overcoming shyness to her roles in iconic films like "The English Patient" and "Four Weddings and a Funeral."</p>

          <h2>Research Reveals Four-Day Workweek Boosts Happiness by Improving On-the-Job Effectiveness</h2>
          <div class="timestamp">2025-07-27 09:35:01 EDT</div>
        </div>
        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Studies on the four-day workweek show that increased employee happiness stems from more than just extra free time. According to lead researcher Juliet Schor, a significant factor is that employees feel more effective and productive at their jobs. Faced with a condensed schedule, teams are motivated to streamline processes and eliminate unnecessary tasks, leading to a greater sense of accomplishment and control over their work. This boost in professional satisfaction positively impacts overall well-being, improves work-life balance, and can even strengthen team spirit through shared accountability.</p>

          <p>The art of Louise Nevelson, known for her massive, monochromatic sculptures often created from found objects, is being celebrated in new exhibitions at the Whitney Museum in New York and the Columbus Museum of Art. Though the art world was slow to recognize her, Nevelson became an iconic figure, famous for her layered personal style and for "dumpster diving" for materials on the streets of New York. Born in Ukraine in 1899, she pursued her artistic vision fiercely throughout her life, creating some of her best work in her 70s and 80s, leaving a legacy of passion and perseverance.</p>

          <p>On the second day of his visit to Scotland, Donald Trump played golf at his Turnberry resort before a scheduled meeting with European Commission President Ursula von der Leyen to discuss transatlantic trade. The talks are critical, with Trump having previously threatened 30% tariffs on EU goods if a deal is not reached. Senior EU officials are reportedly optimistic about establishing a framework for a pact. Trump is also expected to meet with UK Prime Minister Keir Starmer and Scottish First Minister John Swinney during his visit, which has drawn both small pro-Trump gatherings and larger anti-Trump protests.</p>

          <p>A seasoned travel writer with experience in 70 countries outlines phrases that American travelers should avoid to prevent appearing rude or ignorant abroad.

          <p>After years of crises, aerospace giant Boeing is showing signs of a turnaround under CEO Kelly Ortberg, who came out of retirement to lead the company a year ago. The manufacturer's aircraft production has increased, deliveries have hit an 18-month high, and the company's stock is up over 30% this year. Despite these gains, challenges remain, including fixing quality control issues highlighted by a January door-plug blowout and overcoming production caps imposed by the FAA. However, major airline customers have expressed renewed confidence in Boeing's leadership and the improved quality of its aircraft. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>According to former England and Lions scrum-half Matt Dawson, the British and Irish Lions need to complete a 3-0 series whitewash against Australia to cement their place as a legendary team. While celebrating the current 2-0 series lead, Dawson argues that a clean sweep would be a historic achievement, not seen on a major tour in decades. He contrasts the current squad's mindset with his 1997 team, which celebrated heavily after securing the series and lost the final test. Dawson suggests that to achieve this goal, coach Andy Farrell may need to rotate the squad to keep players fresh for the final match.</p>
