          <p>Mediterranean chain Cava exceeded sales expectations in its recent fiscal quarter, demonstrating double-digit same-store sales growth of 10.8%, driven by a 7.5% increase in traffic. CFO Tricia Tolivar noted increased premium attachment and positive traffic across all geographies and income cohorts. This performance contrasts with other fast-casual chains like Chipotle and Sweetgreen, which have reported declining transactions and sales. Despite the strong quarter, Cava maintained its conservative same-store sales forecast of 6% to 8% for the fiscal year, with shares falling 5% in extended trading. (not investment advice)</p>

The goal is to gain a better understanding of magma chambers, which could revolutionize volcanology and improve the accuracy of eruption forecasts. The project seeks to address the limitations of current forecasting methods, which rely heavily on pattern recognition and historical data. By collecting real-time data from within the magma chamber, scientists hope to develop more sophisticated models of volcanic activity.</p>

          <p>Microsoft has proposed unbundling its Office 365 and Microsoft 365 software suites from its Teams communication app in response to antitrust concerns raised by European regulators. The European Commission is scrutinizing Microsoft's practice of tying Teams with its popular Office suite, following a legal complaint from Slack. Microsoft's commitments include offering versions of Office without Teams at a reduced price and allowing customers to switch to tools without Teams. Salesforce, which acquired Slack, stated that the European Commission's announcement affirms that Microsoft's practices have harmed competition.</p>

          <p>Signs of life in the IPO market, with companies like Chime and eToro going public, have renewed optimism for Goldman Sachs' investment banking segment. Goldman served as a lead underwriter for both of this week's financial technology deals. Despite a rocky few years for the IPO market, easing trade tensions and a rallying stock market have emboldened companies to go public.
