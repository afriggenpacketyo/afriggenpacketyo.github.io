          <p>During a meeting at the Shanghai Cooperation Organisation summit, Chinese President Xi Jinping emphasized that China and India should be partners, not rivals, and present development opportunities to each other. He told Indian Prime Minister Narendra Modi that the two nations, as the world's most populous and members of the Global South, need to be good friends and neighbors. This diplomatic engagement comes as both countries work to manage border tensions and navigate a complex geopolitical environment. Modi, on his first visit to China in seven years, echoed the positive sentiment, stating that relations were moving in a meaningful direction.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>A global craze for matcha, fueled by its reputation as a superfood on social media platforms like TikTok, has led to significant supply shortages and soaring prices, even in Japan. The increased demand, coupled with a post-pandemic tourism boom, has strained Japan's aging farming communities and driven up the price of tencha, the tea leaves used to make matcha. Retailers are implementing purchase limits to manage stock, while major companies like Ito En are creating dedicated divisions to secure supply. The situation has prompted the Japanese government to consider subsidizing farmers to cultivate more of the labor-intensive tea.</p>

          <p>Lucy Guo, aged thirty, has been named Forbes' youngest self-made female billionaire with a net worth of $1.3 billion following the acquisition of her AI data company, Scale AI, by Meta. Growing up with frugal immigrant parents, Guo developed an entrepreneurial mindset early, trading Pokémon cards and selling items on the playground. She later dropped out of Carnegie Mellon University to accept a Thiel Fellowship, a decision that initially disappointed her parents but ultimately led to her immense success.

          <p>New government figures from England suggest a strong correlation between a pupil's attendance in the first week of the school year and their overall absence rate. The data revealed that 57% of students who missed some school in the first week of September 2024 later became "persistently absent," compared to only 14% of those with full attendance. Education Secretary Bridget Phillipson urged schools and parents to prioritize getting children into school from day one to combat persistent absenteeism, which has remained higher than pre-pandemic levels. The issue is compounded by unauthorized term-time holidays and other factors affecting attendance.</p>

          <p>Chinese President Xi Jinping and Indian Prime Minister Narendra Modi met in Tianjin, pledging to resolve ongoing border disputes that have strained relations since deadly clashes in 2020. The meeting occurred ahead of the Shanghai Cooperation Organisation (SCO) summit, a regional security group founded by China. Both leaders emphasized the need for a stable relationship, with Xi stating the border issue should not define their overall ties and Modi noting a "peaceful environment" following military disengagement. The summit, also attended by Russian President Vladimir Putin, is seen as a significant diplomatic event as member nations navigate trade conflicts with the United States.</p>

          <p>England and Chelsea defender Millie Bright has described her decision to withdraw from the Euro 2025 squad as the best she has ever made, citing the need to prioritize her mental and physical health. After a demanding season where she helped Chelsea secure a domestic treble, Bright realized she was on the verge of a breakdown and could not give her best for the national team. Instead of participating in the tournament, she underwent knee surgery and began counseling. Bright now feels she is in a much better place and is ready for the upcoming Women's Super League season.</p>

          <p>Dr. Sohan Dasgupta, a political appointee in the Trump administration, is stepping down from his leadership role at the Millennium Challenge Corporation (MCC) after a four-month tenure. He stated his mission was to reposition the U.S. foreign aid agency as a strategic investment tool to counter Chinese influence and promote an "America First" agenda. Created in 2004, the MCC provides large-scale grants to developing nations for infrastructure and energy projects. Under Dasgupta's guidance, the agency emphasized evaluating projects based on their return on investment for the United States and their alignment with national security interests.</p>

          <p>Manchester United clinched a dramatic 3-2 victory against Burnley thanks to a stoppage-time penalty from Bruno Fernandes, providing a moment of relief for manager Ruben Amorim. However, the narrow win highlighted persistent issues, particularly with goalkeeping errors that have plagued the team in the opening weeks of the season. Amorim acknowledged the struggles, stating that every possession near their box feels like a potential goal against them. The club is reportedly in talks to sign a new goalkeeper, Senne Lammens from Royal Antwerp, to address the pressing problem before the transfer deadline.</p>

          <p>In an innovative experiment, biologists with the USDA are using drones to protect cattle from gray wolves near the California-Oregon border. The drones are equipped with loudspeakers that blast sounds like AC/DC's "Thunderstruck," clips from movies, and live human voices to haze the predators and interrupt their hunts. This non-lethal technique is part of an effort to find new ways for ranchers and the recovering wolf population to coexist. While the technology is expensive and its long-term effectiveness is still being studied, initial results have shown success in scaring wolves away from livestock.</p>

          <p>The recent meeting between Indian Prime Minister Narendra Modi and Chinese President Xi Jinping is being viewed as a potential economic reset for both nations, largely driven by significant US tariffs. With the Trump administration imposing a 50% tariff on key Indian exports, and China facing its own trade pressures, the world's two most populous countries may find common ground. Experts suggest this could lead to renewed cooperation, such as the resumption of direct flights and potential deals on trade and investment. The dynamic highlights a shifting geopolitical landscape where Delhi and Beijing are exploring alternatives to reliance on Western economies.</p>

          <p>Canada's Felix Auger-Aliassime secured a major upset at the US Open by defeating world No. 3 Alexander Zverev in a four-set thriller. After dropping the first set, Auger-Aliassime mounted a strong comeback to win 4-6, 7-6 (7), 6-4, 6-4, marking his first Grand Slam victory over a top-five opponent. The nearly four-hour match on Louis Armstrong Stadium saw Zverev grow increasingly frustrated as the momentum shifted. This victory propels Auger-Aliassime into the fourth round, where he will face Andrey Rublev, and signifies a return to form after a period of inconsistent results and injuries.</p>

He predicts that the transaction volume facilitated by Tron, which is expected to reach $8 trillion this year, will exceed that of Swift within the next five years. Sun highlighted Tron's ability to process transactions in seconds compared to Swift's days-long settlement times. His confidence is rooted in Tron's growing dominance in the stablecoin market, which facilitates rapid, low-cost cross-border payments.</p>
