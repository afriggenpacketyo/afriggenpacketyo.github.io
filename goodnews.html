        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>A recently introduced bill, the Evidence-Based Drug Policy Act of 2025 (EBDPA), aims to ease research restrictions on cannabis and other Schedule I substances. Representatives Dina Titus and Ilhan Omar introduced the bill to allow research to catch up with the increasing cannabis consumption in the U.S. The bill would repeal sections of the Office of National Drug Control Policy Reauthorization Act of 1998, potentially attracting bipartisan support. If passed, the law could lead to increased research to inform medical use practices and advance medicine in the U.S.</p>

          <p>Kosmos-482, a Soviet spacecraft intended for Venus in 1972, re-entered Earth's atmosphere after 53 years and likely crashed into the Indian Ocean. The failed mission serves as a reminder of the Cold War era's ambitious space race and the Soviet Union's focus on Venus exploration. While the U.S. prioritized the moon, the Soviets launched numerous missions to Venus, achieving several milestones in planetary exploration. The re-entry highlights the legacy of early space exploration and the enduring presence of space debris orbiting Earth.</p>

While some community members are skeptical, county leaders support the effort to increase housing supply and support the agricultural industry.
