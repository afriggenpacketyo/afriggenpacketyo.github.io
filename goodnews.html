          <div class="timestamp">2025-09-02 10:13:51 EDT</div>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Financial experts are highlighting a provision in President Trump's new tax legislation that could expand eligibility for the 0% long-term capital gains tax bracket. For 2025, single filers with taxable income up to $48,350 and married couples up to $96,700 could qualify, allowing for "tax-gain harvesting" by selling profitable assets without tax liability. This creates an opportunity for investors to rebalance portfolios or reset their cost basis on investments, though the strategy's suitability depends on an individual's broader financial plan.

          <p>A U.S. District Judge has ruled that the Trump administration's deployment of National Guard members and U.S. Marines to Los Angeles violated the Posse Comitatus Act of 1878, which prohibits using the military for domestic law enforcement. The ruling blocks the administration from using these forces for civilian law enforcement activities like arrests and crowd control within California. Judge Charles Breyer's decision stemmed from a lawsuit filed by the state and warned that such deployments could create "a national police force with the President as its chief."</p>

          <p>Amid a sales slump for its electric vehicles, Tesla CEO Elon Musk has shifted focus, predicting that the company's Optimus humanoid robot will eventually account for approximately 80% of Tesla's value. Musk is positioning Tesla as a leader in "real-world AI," with future growth centered on autonomous robotaxis and humanoid robots rather than just cars. This pivot comes as Tesla faces increasing competition in the EV market and is still behind competitors like Waymo in the robotaxi space, with plans to begin pilot production of Optimus in 2025.</p>

          <p>Apollo Global CEO Marc Rowan claims the traditional investment model centered on public stocks and bonds is "broken," arguing that private markets offer better opportunities for diversification and growth. He contends that the public stock market has become dominated by a few mega-tech stocks and passive indexing, diminishing its ability to reflect the true strength of the economy. Rowan believes a fundamental shift is underway where investors will increasingly allocate capital to private credit and equity, redefining the conventional wisdom about risk and liquidity.

          <p>Alternative asset management firm Blue Owl Capital is pursuing a novel marketing strategy by sponsoring professional tennis players to increase its brand visibility among a broader audience. This move is part of a larger trend where private market firms, traditionally secretive, are seeking to build public profiles as they tap into retail and high-net-worth investor channels. By aligning with stakeholder "passion points" like sports, firms like Blue Owl aim to move out of obscurity and differentiate themselves in an increasingly competitive industry that is expanding beyond its institutional roots.</p>
