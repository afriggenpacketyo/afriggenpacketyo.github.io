        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>In an opinion piece, an American-Israeli law professor explains the decision to nominate former President Donald Trump for the Nobel Peace Prize. The nomination is tied to his efforts in securing the release of hostages from the Middle East, an act described as a personal victory against a backdrop of rising antisemitism. The author credits Trump's diplomatic impact, citing the Abraham Accords as a historic reshaping of the region's geopolitics. The article argues that his unique negotiating style and commitment to peace through strength make him a deserving candidate for the prestigious award.</p>

          <p>Delta Air Lines has issued a strong fourth-quarter forecast, surpassing analyst expectations due to rising airfares and sustained demand for luxury travel. The airline reported third-quarter adjusted earnings of $1.71 per share, beating estimates and signaling a recovery in consumer confidence and travel spending. Revenue from premium cabin segments saw a 9% increase, highlighting a trend where high-end travel continues to outperform the main cabin. The optimistic outlook boosted Delta's stock and had a positive ripple effect on other major airline shares.</p>

          <p>Israel and Hamas have agreed to the first phase of a ceasefire deal, which is expected to be ratified by the Israeli government. The agreement, brokered after intense negotiations, involves the release of all remaining hostages from Gaza in exchange for an undetermined number of Palestinian prisoners. As part of the deal, the Israel Defense Forces will pull back to a designated demarcation line within Gaza. This development marks a significant step toward ending the two-year conflict that began with Hamas's terror attack on October 7, 2023.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>PepsiCo announced third-quarter earnings and revenue that surpassed Wall Street's expectations, largely due to strong performance in its international markets. This growth helped to counterbalance a continued decline in sales volume within North America for both its food and beverage divisions. The company reported adjusted earnings of $2.29 per share on revenue of $23.94 billion. Despite the positive results, PepsiCo faces pressure from activist investor Elliott Investment Management to implement changes, including potentially refranchising its North American bottling network, to improve performance in its home market.</p>

        </div>
        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>The UK government has announced that all victims of the Post Office Horizon IT scandal will now be entitled to free legal advice when pursuing compensation claims. This significant change is a response to the public inquiry into one of Britain's most severe miscarriages of justice, where faulty software led to wrongful prosecutions of over 900 sub-postmasters. Previously, many victims in the Horizon Shortfall Scheme had to accept low settlement offers without legal counsel. The new provision aims to ensure fairer outcomes and provides an appeals process for those who already accepted fixed payouts.</p>

          <p>Jennifer Lopez described her latest film, "Kiss of the Spider Woman," as a project she has wanted to do her entire life, arriving at a time when its message of acceptance is crucial. In an interview, she explained that the movie, based on a 1970s novel, explores the bond between a transgender character and a political revolutionary. Lopez plays three different versions of the same woman, a challenge she found creatively fulfilling. She emphasized the film's core theme of seeing past differences to recognize shared humanity, stating that love, not hate, is the answer in a world with growing division.</p>

          <p>Late-night host Jimmy Kimmel revealed he thought his show was over following the intense backlash to his comments about the murder of conservative activist Charlie Kirk. He stated his remarks, which criticized attempts to politicize the tragedy, were "maliciously mischaracterized" by right-wing media. The controversy led to his temporary suspension by ABC and a refusal by some affiliate stations to air his program. Kimmel credited Disney executive Dana Walden with helping him navigate the crisis, which he said culminated in a reaffirmation of First Amendment principles and resulted in a surge in ratings upon his return.</p>

          <p>This article challenges the shame often associated with credit card debt, arguing that it is simply a tool used when cash reserves are unavailable. Financial educator Rita-Soledad Fernández Paulino debunks three common myths: that people with debt are bad with money, that all debt should be avoided, and that escaping debt is impossible. She notes that debt often arises from emergencies or stressful life events, not just poor spending habits. The article emphasizes the importance of building a budget surplus and understanding how credit works to manage and eliminate debt effectively.</p>

          <p>A Kazakh official emphasized the need for greater infrastructure investment to establish the country as a vital trade bridge between China and Europe. Vice-Minister of Trade and Integration, Asset Nussupov, highlighted that differences in customs and logistics procedures create bottlenecks for goods traveling along the route. He pointed to the Middle Corridor, a trade route crossing the Caspian Sea, as a key opportunity to realize Kazakhstan's transit potential. According to a World Bank report, trade volumes along this corridor are projected to triple by 2030, a goal that Nussupov stated is impossible without significant new investment.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>In a significant genetic discovery, scientists from BGI Research in China have identified the master sex-determining gene in the central bearded dragon. For these Australian lizards, sex is determined by both genetics and incubation temperature, a trait shared with reptiles like turtles and crocodiles. If eggs are incubated at 32°C or higher, some genetically male embryos will develop as females. By sequencing the lizard's genome with long-read technology, researchers were able to pinpoint the specific gene responsible for this unique biological process, advancing the understanding of temperature-dependent sex determination.</p>
