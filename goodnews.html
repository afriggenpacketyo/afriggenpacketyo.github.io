          <p>Director Guillermo del Toro's long-awaited adaptation of 'Frankenstein' has premiered at the Venice Film Festival, fulfilling a career-long ambition for the filmmaker. The Netflix-funded project, starring Oscar Isaac as Victor Frankenstein and Jacob Elordi as his creation, is a large-scale, 149-minute epic that delves into the perspectives of both characters. Early reviews are divided, with some critics praising it as one of del Toro's finest works for its artistry and emotional depth, while others found it visually impressive but lacking in substance. The film is noted for its extensive use of physical sets over CGI, reflecting the director's commitment to practical craftsmanship.</p>

          <p>As the 80th anniversary of the end of the Sino-Japanese war approaches, some are looking to the shared history of World War II as a potential foundation for improving strained US-China relations. This perspective highlights the forgotten stories of cooperation between the two nations during the conflict. Among these accounts are the efforts of Chinese villagers who risked their own lives to protect and shelter American airmen who were shot down by the Japanese army. The article suggests that remembering this period of mutual support and shared sacrifice could offer a path toward building better bilateral ties from a grassroots level.</p>

          <p>Manchester United narrowly defeated Burnley 3-2, thanks to a stoppage-time penalty from Bruno Fernandes, providing a crucial win for manager Ruben Amorim. However, the victory was overshadowed by persistent issues with the team's goalkeepers, as Altay Bayindir made a critical error leading to Burnley's second goal. This follows similar mistakes from Andre Onana in previous matches, prompting Amorim to acknowledge that being a United goalkeeper is difficult at the moment. The team is also dealing with new injury concerns for players Matheus Cunha and Mason Mount, adding to the challenges facing the club.</p>

          <h2>Experts Offer Guidelines on Safe Screen Time for Children at Different Developmental Stages</h2>
          <div class="timestamp">2025-08-30 15:10:00 EDT</div>
        </div>
        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>While no universal rules exist for children's screen time, a consensus among medical and psychological experts suggests a precautionary approach based on developmental stages. For toddlers, the recommendation is to be screen-free until age three to encourage exploration of the physical world and development of self-controlled attention. As children grow, limited and supervised screen time is advised to ensure it doesn't replace crucial activities like physical play, social interaction, and imaginative development. For adolescents, open communication about online activities is considered more important than strict time limits to protect them from potential online dangers like grooming.</p>

          <p>Jack Grealish is experiencing a career resurgence since joining Everton on a season-long loan from Manchester City, earning man-of-the-match honors in a 3-2 win over Wolves. The midfielder, who struggled for playing time at City, has provided four assists in his last two games, becoming a key creative force for his new club. Manager David Moyes lauded Grealish's performance, stating he is "even better than I thought" and is providing the team with a creative edge. Despite his strong form, Grealish was recently left out of the England squad for upcoming World Cup qualifiers.</p>

          <p>New York City's health department has officially declared an end to the Legionnaires' disease outbreak in central Harlem, as no new cases have been identified in three weeks. The outbreak resulted in 114 cases, 90 hospitalizations, and seven deaths. Investigators traced the source of the Legionella bacteria to cooling towers at Harlem Hospital and a nearby construction site, both of which have since been cleaned and disinfected. In response, the city administration has proposed new regulations, including more frequent testing of cooling towers to improve detection and prevent future clusters of the disease.</p>

          <p>Germany is ending a freeze on its program to admit vulnerable Afghans, many of whom fled to Pakistan after the Taliban takeover and have been waiting for German visas. These individuals, who had previously worked for German organizations, face the constant threat of arrest and deportation back to Afghanistan, where they fear for their lives. The German government had paused the program to implement new security checks, but recent court rulings have compelled officials to honor the legally binding commitments to issue visas. The first families are expected to arrive in Germany on scheduled flights soon.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Researchers say a stethoscope enhanced with artificial intelligence can detect heart failure, valve disease, and abnormal rhythms in seconds. A UK study involving over 12,000 patients found that the device, which analyzes subtle heart sounds undetectable by the human ear, significantly increased the detection rates for these conditions compared to traditional methods. The AI stethoscope records an ECG and sends the data to the cloud for instant analysis against a vast patient database. The British Heart Foundation has called the innovation a potential "game-changer" for enabling earlier diagnosis and treatment, with plans for a wider rollout.</p>
