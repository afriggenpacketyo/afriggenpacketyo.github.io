          <p>Following Karen Read's acquittal on murder and manslaughter charges in the death of her boyfriend, John O'Keefe, her parents, Bill and Janet Read, have spoken out, expressing their relief and focus on returning to normalcy after two years of a life-changing ordeal. They credited their daughter's strength and determination, referring to her as the "fifth lawyer" in the case, for helping them navigate the difficult period. The Reads acknowledged the hurtful and misogynistic comments directed at Karen during the trial and emphasized their commitment to speaking out and helping others in need moving forward. The family recognizes that the question of who is responsible for O'Keefe's death remains unanswered, a truth they hope will be revealed someday.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>A study by the Meiji Yasuda Research Institute reveals that visits by foreign tourists to locations associated with anime and manga in Japan have significantly benefited local economies. In 2024, approximately 3 million foreign tourists, representing 8.1% of inbound visitors, explored these anime-related sites, marking an increase from 4.8% in 2016. Purchases of anime and manga goods totaled an estimated 54.3 billion yen last year, a 53% increase from 2016, highlighting the economic impact of "seichi junrei" or "holy pilgrimage." While the trend offers substantial economic advantages, the report also underscores the need for local governments to address overtourism issues and provide multilingual support to accommodate the growing number of international visitors.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Faced with surging rice prices, Japanese restaurants and food companies are increasingly turning to noodles as a cost-effective alternative for consumers. Antworks Co., which operates pork rice bowl eateries, recently opened its first ramen noodle restaurant and plans to expand its noodle business due to the high cost of rice. Similarly, Yoshinoya Holdings Co. is bolstering its ramen noodle offerings, citing saturation in the beef bowl market and the need to balance ingredient costs. As rice prices have doubled year-over-year, supermarkets are also seeing increased sales of frozen udon noodles and other alternatives, reflecting a shift in consumer preferences.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>A mysterious human skull, discovered in the 1930s and known as "dragon man," has been identified as belonging to the Denisovan species. Researchers used dental calculus to extract DNA from the 146,000-year-old skull after previous attempts to extract DNA from a tooth failed. Comparison of the genetic material revealed that the "dragon man" was not a new species but rather the first intact Denisovan specimen to date. Denisovans are known to have coexisted with modern-day humans and are closely related to Neanderthals, adding to our understanding of human evolution.</p>
