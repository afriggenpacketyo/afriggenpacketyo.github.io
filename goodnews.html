          <p>Epic Games has resubmitted Fortnite to Apple's App Store following a judge's ruling that Apple cannot prevent developers from using external links for payments. The game was previously removed in 2020 for circumventing Apple's commission fees. The ruling allows developers to avoid Apple's in-app purchase system, which takes a 15% to 30% cut. Amazon and Spotify have already updated their apps to take advantage of this change. Apple is appealing the ruling, and still has the option to reject Fortnite's resubmission, continuing the ongoing legal battle between Epic Games and Apple.</p>

          <p>The U.S.-UK trade deal on steel tariffs imposes conditions on the "nature of ownership" of British plants to prevent Chinese steel from circumventing U.S. tariffs. The Trump administration sought assurances that the Chinese-owned British Steel plant in Scunthorpe would not be used by Beijing as a backdoor to avoid tariffs. The deal aims to reduce car tariffs to 10% and steel tariffs to zero if certain conditions are met. The agreement emphasizes the security of supply chains and ownership requirements, although some terms remain unclear.</p>

          <p>The FDA has approved additional color additives from natural sources, aligning with HHS Secretary Robert F. Kennedy Jr.'s initiative to eliminate artificial food dyes. The approved additives include Galdieria extract blue, butterfly pea flower extract, and calcium phosphate, expanding their use in various food products. Kennedy aims to phase out petroleum-based dyes, citing their lack of nutritional value and potential health risks. Some U.S. food manufacturers, like Tyson Foods, are already working to eliminate artificial food dyes. FDA Commissioner Dr. Marty Makary is meeting with the Consumer Brand Association to promote the removal of dyes from the U.S. food supply.</p>

He emphasizes the implications of humans living to 100 and beyond due to advancements in technology and biotech.

          <p>Debt consolidation can simplify finances by combining multiple debts into a single monthly payment. Options include personal consolidation loans, balance transfers, home equity loans, debt management plans, and debt consolidation programs. It's important to evaluate the total cost over the life of the loan, not just the monthly payment, and to maintain discipline and patience. Credit card interest rates are hovering near record highs, averaging around 22% currently, and the average cardholder carrying about $8,000 in revolving debt, streamlining your payments can be more than just a convenience (not investment advice).</p>

BART has struggled to regain ridership since the Covid-19 pandemic, with passenger traffic remaining less than half of pre-pandemic levels.
