          <p>This opinion article argues that China's plan to build a large new embassy at the former Royal Mint site in London is a significant diplomatic and symbolic gesture. The author suggests that beyond being a planning issue, the project signals China's view of London as a crucial global partner for finance and trade. While acknowledging political opposition and security concerns, the piece posits that the embassy's construction represents a long-term commitment that contrasts with the UK's recent trend of selling diplomatic assets. The project is framed as a test of Britain's international standing and capacity.</p>

During the talks, Trump suggested the U.S. would help provide security guarantees for Ukraine but walked back his previous demand for an immediate ceasefire as a precondition for negotiations. Trump continued to advocate for a trilateral meeting with Russian President Vladimir Putin, a proposal Zelenskyy said Ukraine was ready for. European leaders in attendance emphasized the necessity of a ceasefire and robust security protections for Ukraine.</p>

The team's bowlers were instrumental, restricting the Brave to a score of 133, with notable performances from Jason Behrendorff and Rashid Khan. In the chase, a powerful partnership between Jordan Cox (56) and Sam Curran (50 not out) guided the Invincibles to their target with 11 balls remaining.

          <p>A source within Hamas has indicated that the group has agreed to the most recent ceasefire proposal presented by Egyptian and Qatari mediators. The deal is reportedly based on a U.S.-led framework and would involve an initial 60-day truce, during which Hamas would release about half of the remaining Israeli hostages in exchange for Palestinian prisoners. This development comes as the Israeli military intensifies its operations in Gaza City, and it remains unclear how the Israeli government will respond to the proposal. The potential agreement offers a glimmer of hope for de-escalation in the prolonged conflict.</p>

          <h2>Exploring Debt Forgiveness Options for Buy Now, Pay Later Plans</h2>

          <p>This article examines whether debts from popular "buy now, pay later" (BNPL) services are eligible for debt forgiveness programs. As unsecured debts, BNPL plans can technically be included in debt settlement negotiations, similar to credit card or personal loan debts. However, eligibility can be inconsistent, as BNPL is a newer form of credit and not all providers may be willing to negotiate settlements. The piece advises consumers struggling with BNPL payments to consider direct negotiation with the provider, debt consolidation, or credit counseling as alternative strategies for managing this growing form of consumer debt.</p>

          <p>A federal judge has issued an injunction to stop the Federal Trade Commission (FTC) from investigating the liberal media watchdog group Media Matters for America. The investigation was launched after Media Matters published a report alleging that antisemitic content on the social media platform X was appearing alongside major brand advertisements. The judge ruled that the FTC's probe likely represented a retaliatory action that violated the organization's First Amendment rights to freedom of speech. The ruling is a significant development in the ongoing legal battles between Media Matters and X owner Elon Musk.</p>

          <p>The musical "& Juliet," now playing at the Ahmanson Theatre, offers a fresh, feminist take on Shakespeare's classic tragedy, set to a soundtrack of pop hits from producer Max Martin. The show's premise has Juliet choosing not to die and instead embarking on a new life of self-discovery in Paris, guided by the playwright's wife, Anne Hathaway. The review praises the production's energetic direction, clever book by David West Read, and vibrant performances, particularly from lead Rachel Webb as Juliet. Described as a euphoric and witty dance party, the musical successfully transforms the tragic tale into a feel-good celebration of second chances.</p>

          <p>This article addresses whether age limits exist for buying annuities, a retirement product gaining popularity for its guaranteed income stream. While there are no federal laws setting a maximum age, individual insurance companies often impose their own limits, typically between 80 and 85, due to risk assessment. The piece explains that the best age to purchase an annuity depends on individual retirement strategy rather than a specific number. It outlines the advantages of buying at different life stages, from one's late 50s to early 80s, balancing the benefit of higher payouts for older buyers against potential health disqualifications.</p>

          <p>Beijing recently hosted the first "World Humanoid Robot Games," a three-day event where humanoid robots competed in events like soccer, martial arts, and track and field. The competition, which attracted teams from 16 countries, highlighted the capabilities of robots from Chinese manufacturers such as Unitree, a rival to Tesla's Optimus. The event is part of a broader Chinese government initiative to establish a world-class humanoid robotics industry by 2027. In addition to athletic contests, the robots demonstrated their skills in practical job-related tasks, including factory work and housekeeping, showcasing the technology's potential.</p>

          <p>The third-ever observed interstellar object, 3I/ATLAS, is exhibiting unusual characteristics, leading to speculation about its nature. Harvard astronomer Avi Loeb has pointed to Hubble Telescope observations showing a glow of light ahead of the object, but without a corresponding cometary tail, suggesting the object may be generating its own light. Loeb proposes two possibilities: it is either a rare radioactive fragment from a supernova or an artificially powered spacecraft. While acknowledging the need for more evidence, he notes the object's upcoming close pass by Mars will provide a unique opportunity for observation by NASA's orbiters.</p>
