          <p>The U.S. Naval Academy has reinstated almost all of the 381 books previously removed from its libraries. This reversal follows a new review using standardized Pentagon search terms for DEI titles. The Navy initially removed the books based on its own search terms, but the new review identified only a few titles needing further assessment by a DOD panel. Cmdr. Tim Hawkins, a Navy spokesperson, confirmed that the majority of the books are back in circulation, ensuring compliance with directives from the President and Department of Defense.</p>

The injunction was requested by school districts in Massachusetts, the American Federation of Teachers, and 21 Democratic state attorneys general.

The proposal also requires both parents to have a Social Security number, potentially excluding 4.5 million children who are U.S. citizens or lawfully present.

And what are your fees, and how do I know this will be worth it? Understanding these aspects can help you make informed decisions and resolve your tax debt efficiently (not investment advice).</p>
