          <p>Sources indicate that Republican National Committee chairman Michael Whatley is preparing to run for the U.S. Senate seat in North Carolina for the 2026 cycle. His candidacy reportedly has the support of the White House, and it follows Lara Trump's announcement that she will not seek the seat. On the Democratic side, former North Carolina Governor Roy Cooper is also expected to announce his candidacy for the same position, which is being vacated by retiring Republican Senator Thom Tillis. This sets the stage for a high-profile and competitive battleground contest.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Shares of retailer American Eagle Outfitters have surged, positioning it as the newest meme stock to capture the attention of individual investors. The rally appears to be linked to a new marketing campaign featuring actress Sydney Sweeney, which generated buzz on popular online forums like Reddit's Wall Street Bets. The stock's high short interest, with over 13% of its tradable shares sold short, makes it a classic target for a short squeeze. This phenomenon follows similar recent volatile trading in other consumer-facing stocks like GoPro and Krispy Kreme, driven by coordinated retail investor activity. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>On his "Morning Meeting" livestream, CNBC's Jim Cramer advised that recent pullbacks in the stock prices of Honeywell and Dover are creating opportunities for new investors to buy. He expressed that the declines, which occurred despite both companies reporting solid quarterly earnings, were unjustified. Cramer noted the broader market was showing signs of positivity, with the S&P 500 and Nasdaq hitting new highs. He suggested that the negative reaction to these specific industrial stocks was a misreading of their strong performance and underlying fundamentals. (not investment advice)</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>This article explores the psychological and philosophical concept that our perception of time changes as we age, often feeling like it accelerates. This phenomenon, supported by theories from philosophers like Henri Bergson and modern psychological research, suggests that a unit of time is relative to the total time one has lived. The article proposes that instead of passively accepting this, individuals can subjectively "lengthen" their lives by seeking out novel experiences, avoiding routine, and focusing on meaningful, emotionally resonant activities. By creating denser memories and savoring moments, one can enhance the perceived value and duration of their remaining time.</p>

          <p>McDonald's is planning to test a new lineup of beverages, including flavored cold brews, refreshers, and sodas, at over 500 restaurants later this summer. The move is an effort to attract younger consumers and compete with beverage-focused chains like Dutch Bros. and Swig. This test follows the company's decision to shut down its stand-alone CosMc's drink-centric spinoff, opting instead to integrate its popular concepts into the main McDonald's menu. The expansion into customizable, colorful drinks aims to boost sales during afternoon snack periods and reverse recent lackluster sales growth.</p>

          <p>Jeremy Corbyn, the former leader of the UK's Labour Party and current independent MP, is launching a new political party. Co-founded with fellow independent MP Zarah Sultana, the yet-to-be-named party aims to "take on the rich and powerful" and offer a grassroots, community-led alternative to what they describe as Labour's "control freaks." The new venture will campaign on a platform to the left of Labour, focusing on issues like wealth redistribution, nationalization, and a more anti-Israel foreign policy. The launch signals a formal split on the British left and could potentially draw votes away from Labour in future elections.</p>
