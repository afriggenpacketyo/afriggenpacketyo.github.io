          <p>President Trump emphasized the strong U.S.-Saudi relationship during a U.S.-Saudi investment summit, highlighting a $600 billion investment from Saudi Arabia, including a major defense sales agreement. Trump praised Saudi Arabia as a model for the Middle East and criticized past U.S. foreign policy approaches while announcing agreements for judicial cooperation, defense modernization, and FBI partnerships. He also indicated a move to normalize relations with Syria's new government, giving them a chance at peace. The visit, his first of the second term, included meetings with business leaders like Elon Musk and discussions on topics ranging from Iran's nuclear program to the Israel-Hamas war. Trump defended accepting a donated jumbo jet from Qatar for presidential use, viewing it as a practical decision.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>This article explores whether credit card debt forgiveness remains a viable option despite signs of economic improvement, such as easing inflation and a steady job market. It notes that while the economy may be improving, many Americans still struggle with high credit card interest rates and mounting debt. Debt forgiveness can provide targeted relief by drastically reducing debt obligations, particularly for those earning enough to get by but not enough to catch up on debts. The article advises considering debt forgiveness if debt feels unmanageable, if one is falling behind on payments, or if alternative solutions are not feasible, while also acknowledging the trade-offs like credit score impacts (not investment advice).</p>

          <p>Salma Hayek, the 58-year-old actress, is featured on the latest Sports Illustrated Swimsuit cover, despite initially having doubts about the photo shoot. Hayek expressed disbelief and excitement, noting that she never imagined appearing on the cover because she didn't fit the traditional model type. She emphasized the significance of this opportunity at her age, viewing it as a sign of positive change and inclusivity in the industry. During the shoot, she tried on over 100 bikinis, some of which required alterations, and the suitcase containing the selected bikinis was lost, requiring her to wear extras on set.</p>

The move marks a significant shift in U.S. policy and puts Trump at odds with Israel, which is skeptical of al-Sharaa's past.

          <p>This article discusses the challenges faced by Dodgers pitching prospect Roki Sasaki, whose fastball velocity has significantly declined since his MLB debut in Japan. Initially hitting 100 mph, Sasaki's fastball now averages 96 mph, sometimes dropping to 92-93 mph, impacting its effectiveness due to a lack of natural deception. Pitching coach Mark Prior acknowledges the issue, emphasizing the need for premium velocity to compensate for the fastball's flatter shape. The Dodgers coaching staff is working to identify the root cause and help Sasaki regain his velocity, as his other pitches, like the splitter, have proven effective.</p>

          <p>Inflation eased in April, driven by lower prices for consumer staples like groceries and gasoline, with the consumer price index rising 2.3% annually. However, economists warn that tariffs imposed by President Trump could reignite inflation, offsetting recent gains. Tariffs, taxes on imports paid by U.S. companies, are expected to be passed on to consumers via higher prices. The article notes that current tariff policies could cost the average U.S. household an extra $2,800, and a 10% average tariff rate could add 1 percentage point to the CPI after six to nine months.

          <p>Independent test results confirm that drinking water in fire-affected areas of Altadena and the Pacific Palisades is largely safe, leading utilities to lift the remaining "do not drink" orders. Researchers found only one home with elevated benzene levels, which could be reduced by flushing the pipes. The quick restoration of safe drinking water is attributed to the efforts of local utilities and regulators, following a post-fire remediation playbook. Residents are advised to flush their lines and appliances to ensure complete removal of any contaminants. The LA Fire HEALTH Study is conducting a 10-year effort to understand the health consequences of the fires.</p>
