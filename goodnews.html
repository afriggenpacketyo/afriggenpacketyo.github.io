        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Representative Marjorie Taylor Greene introduced the "Protect Children's Innocence Act of 2025," which seeks to punish individuals who perform gender transition measures on minors. The bill targets chemical castration and genital or bodily mutilation linked to interstate or foreign commerce, with exceptions for necessary medical health needs, not including mental health disorders. Offenders could face fines, imprisonment of up to a decade, or both. The proposal has garnered support from numerous House Republican cosponsors, with markup scheduled in the House Judiciary Committee.</p>

          <div class="timestamp">2025-05-21 07:21:42 EDT</div>
        </div>
        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>The Supreme Court has affirmed the public's right to wild camp on Dartmoor, rejecting an appeal by landowners who argued permission was needed. Judges cited the 1985 Dartmoor Commons Act, which grants the public access for open-air recreation, naturally including camping. The ruling is expected to reignite the debate over public access to land in England, as Dartmoor remains a rare exception where wild camping is legally permitted. The Dartmoor National Park Association welcomed the decision, emphasizing the need for responsible access and respect for landowners.</p>

          <p>Mortgage applications decreased by 5.1% as mortgage rates rose to 6.92%, the highest since February, according to the Mortgage Bankers Association. Concerns over rising inflation and the impact of increasing deficits and debt drove the increase in rates. Applications for home purchases dropped 5%, although they remain 13% higher than a year ago, while refinance applications also fell by 5%. The market is experiencing more listings, but higher interest rates and economic concerns have tempered the spring buying season.</p>

          <p>A team of doctors and vets in Pakistan is treating two elephants, Madhubala and Malika, for tuberculosis by administering at least 400 pills a day to each animal. The medication, the same used to treat TB in humans, is hidden inside food items like apples, bananas, and Pakistani sweets. The treatment has been challenging, with the elephants initially rejecting the bitter medicine. The team hopes the year-long treatment plan will help the elephants recover from the contagious illness.</p>
