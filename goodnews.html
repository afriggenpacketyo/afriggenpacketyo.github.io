          <p>The Trump administration is partnering with leading technology companies, including Oracle and Microsoft, to improve healthcare data accessibility for Medicare beneficiaries. The initiative aims to create a new digital system that simplifies the exchange of patient information for older Americans and individuals with disabilities. President Trump is expected to officially announce the plan, which coincides with the 60th anniversary of the legislation that established Medicare and Medicaid. The collaboration seeks to modernize the digital services offered by the Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services, enhancing how beneficiaries manage their health data.</p>

          <p>While watermelon is a hydrating and nutritious summer fruit, health experts caution against excessive consumption due to potential negative effects. It is a high "FODMAP" food, meaning its sugars can cause digestive issues like bloating and gas, particularly for those with irritable bowel syndrome. The fruit also contains tyramine, an amino acid that can trigger migraines in susceptible individuals. Additionally, its natural sugar content, while moderate, requires people with diabetes to be mindful of their intake to avoid significant impacts on their blood sugar levels.</p>

          <p>Starbucks reported its sixth straight quarter of declining same-store sales, with a global drop of 2%. However, CEO Brian Niccol stated that the company's turnaround plan is progressing ahead of schedule, with positive signs in customer engagement and operational efficiency in the U.S. market. The company is focused on its "Green Apron Service" program to improve hospitality and is reintroducing seating to make cafes more welcoming. While U.S. sales fell 2%, this was better than analysts expected, and sales in China grew by 2% for the first time in over a year. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>Paola Clouatre, the Mexican-born wife of a U.S. Marine Corps veteran, has been released from an ICE detention center in Louisiana. Her release followed an intervention by the office of Republican Senator John Kennedy, a supporter of the Trump administration's immigration policies. Clouatre was detained in May during a green card application appointment due to a decade-old deportation order issued after her mother missed a court date. After a judge halted the deportation, Senator Kennedy's office formally requested her release from the Department of Homeland Security, which was granted shortly thereafter.</p>

This trend reflects a broader shift as venture firms see an opportunity to disrupt the industry dominated by legacy contractors.
