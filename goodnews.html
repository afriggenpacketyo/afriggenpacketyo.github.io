          <p>Max Verstappen secured a dominant victory at the Italian Grand Prix, but the race was marked by controversy within the McLaren team. Lando Norris finished second after the team instructed his teammate, Oscar Piastri, to let him pass, citing fairness after a slow pit stop had reversed their on-track positions. The decision sparked debate, as Piastri initially questioned the call but ultimately complied, cutting his championship lead over Norris to 31 points. This incident highlights the growing tension and complex team dynamics as the two drivers contend for the Formula 1 title.</p>

          <p>John L. Burton, a formidable figure in California politics for six decades, has passed away at the age of 92. Known for his pro-labor stance, colorful language, and dedication to helping the vulnerable, Burton was instrumental in shaping state policy on welfare, foster care, and civil rights. He served in the Assembly and Congress before becoming the powerful leader of the state Senate, overcoming personal struggles with addiction to return to public service. As chairman of the California Democratic Party, he solidified the party's dominance, leaving a legacy of fighting for the underdog.</p>

          <p>President Donald Trump recently hosted the first event in the newly renovated White House Rose Garden, dubbed the "Rose Garden Club," for Republican members of Congress. The unveiling of the space, which features a new patio-like design, quickly became a subject of online mockery. Social media users and critics compared the new look to the patio of a Cheesecake Factory or an Au Bon Pain, with some expressing a desire to see it restored to its previous state. The event itself included dinner, speeches, and autographs, but the focus of public commentary was largely on the aesthetic changes.</p>

          <p>England secured a record-breaking 342-run victory over South Africa in the third one-day international, driven by standout performances from Jacob Bethell and Jofra Archer. The 21-year-old Bethell scored his maiden professional century with an elegant 110 runs, supported by Joe Root's 100, propelling England to a formidable total of 414-5. In response, South Africa's batting lineup collapsed under a hostile opening spell from Archer, who took four wickets and reduced them to 72-9. The win served as a morale boost for England despite having already lost the series.</p>

McIlroy forced the play-off with a dramatic 25-foot eagle putt on the final hole of regulation play, tying Lagergren's score. This marks McIlroy's second time winning his national open and his fourth victory of the year, providing a significant boost just weeks before the Ryder Cup. The win is seen as a well-timed return to form for the world number two after a quiet end to his PGA Tour season.</p>

          <h2>Analysis Reveals Highest and Lowest U.S. States for Lottery Spending</h2>

          <p>As the Powerball jackpot recently soared to nearly $1.8 billion, a new analysis highlights significant state-by-state differences in lottery ticket spending. Massachusetts residents spend the most, averaging $915 per year, followed by Rhode Island at $573. In contrast, North Dakotans spend the least, at just $50 annually, a figure that may be influenced by reduced access in more rural areas. Lotteries serve as a notable source of state revenue, accounting for an average of 1% of a state's general funds and as much as 3% in states like Rhode Island.</p>

          <p>Investors are closely watching two major events in the week ahead that could significantly impact the stock market: key inflation reports and Apple's annual hardware launch. The Producer Price Index (PPI) and Consumer Price Index (CPI) data will be critical in shaping expectations for a potential Federal Reserve rate cut in September. Meanwhile, Apple is expected to unveil its new iPhone 17 lineup, with analysts watching for new features and potential price increases that could boost the company's sluggish revenue growth.

As part of his release, Guo must pay a $30,000 donation and is banned from entering Chile for three years, but he reportedly plans to continue his mission.</p>

The test, which sent a message and vibration for about 10 seconds, was designed to ensure the system's effectiveness in warning the public about life-threatening events like severe weather or public safety emergencies. Prime Minister Keir Starmer called the test a success and an important step for national safety. The system has already been used in five real emergencies on a regional basis.</p>

Acutis, an amateur computer programmer born in London, was known for his deep faith and for using the internet to document miracles and spread Catholic teachings, earning him the nickname "God's influencer." His canonization followed the Vatican's recognition of two miracles attributed to his intercession. His life is presented as a modern model of holiness for young people around the world.</p>

The 12-hour journey is believed to be the world's longest in such a vessel, aimed at promoting fungal materials as a biodegradable alternative to plastics used in marine recreation. The unique, bumpy kayak was cultivated on a hemp substrate inside a fiberglass mold. Shoemaker hopes his achievement will inspire further innovation in sustainable, mycelium-based technologies.</p>

          <h2>Commentary Argues Panic Over Tariff Details Overlooks Broader Economic Strength</h2>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>This commentary piece argues that while the end of the "de minimis" tariff exemption will affect some small businesses, the resulting panic is misdirected. The author contends that the vast majority of small businesses are service-based and will not be directly impacted by this specific change. The article suggests the larger concern should be overall economic health, such as employment and consumer spending power, which currently remain strong enough to absorb the price increases caused by tariffs. Businesses are advised to adapt by diversifying suppliers and offering flexible payment options rather than panicking over policy details.</p>
