          <p>During the G7 summit, President Trump displayed a trade agreement signed with the United Kingdom, alongside Prime Minister Keir Starmer. Trump humorously blamed the wind after accidentally dropping the document and initially misidentified the agreement as being with the European Union. The White House clarified that the agreement was indeed with the UK, and Trump admitted that it was not significantly different from the one signed in May. He praised Prime Minister Starmer's work and indicated the deal would produce jobs and income for both countries, with additional details provided on steel and aluminum quotas. Optimism about the potential economic benefits of the trade agreement is present in the article's coverage.</p>

          <p>With economic uncertainty and concerns about Social Security, annuities are gaining traction as guaranteed income solutions for retirement, particularly for seniors. A $400,000 annuity purchased at age 75 can provide substantial monthly income, with estimates ranging from $3,173 to $3,415 for single individuals and $2,736 for joint life options, influenced by gender, interest rates, and annuity structure. While offering financial security, immediate annuities eliminate access to the principal and potential for higher investment returns, making it crucial to consider one's overall financial picture and health. This decision should be based on individual financial needs and long-term goals (not investment advice).</p>

          <p>Senators Warren and Representative Schakowsky are pressing five major pharmaceutical companies‚ÄîPfizer, Merck, Johnson & Johnson, AbbVie, and Amgen‚Äîregarding their low tax bills and lobbying efforts. They allege that these companies avoid U.S. taxes by shifting profits to offshore subsidiaries, a practice they claim was enabled by a provision in Trump's 2017 Tax Cuts and Jobs Act. The lawmakers question whether the companies' lobbying efforts aim to maintain this tax loophole in Trump's "One Big Beautiful Bill Act," which could make many provisions in the 2017 tax act permanent and cut spending on programs for low-income Americans. Democrats are trying to build public opposition to the legislation as the GOP attempts to balance competing party interests to pass it.</p>

          <p>Kraft Heinz announced it will remove artificial dyes from its U.S. products by the end of 2027 and will immediately cease making new products containing these dyes. This decision comes amid pressure from U.S. Department of Health and Human Services Secretary Robert F. Kennedy Jr. to eliminate synthetic food dyes. The company stated that 10% of its products contain the dyes and that it has been investing in replacing them with natural colors. The FDA currently allows 36 food color additives, including eight synthetic dyes, although some states have enacted bans to restrict their use.</p>

Changes to the bill include disclosure requirements for members of Congress and Executive Branch officials holding stablecoins over $5,000, stronger bankruptcy protections for bank depositors, and Treasury rules for monitoring suspicious transactions.

Experts predict that gold could reach $4,000 per ounce within one to two years, depending on various factors such as global instability, central bank demand, and inflation. They recommend strategies for investing in the gold market, including maintaining a long-term outlook, leasing out gold, and considering gold mining mutual funds (not investment advice).
