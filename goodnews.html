The acquisition, valued at $35 billion, will allow Capital One to become both a credit card issuer and a payment network operator, similar to American Express. CEO Richard Fairbank believes that increasing Discover's international presence will enable Capital One to shift more of its branded credit cards away from Visa and Mastercard, exceeding initial synergy estimates.
