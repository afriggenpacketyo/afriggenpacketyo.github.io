          <p>Sources indicate that Japan's Nippon Steel is expected to finalize its acquisition of U.S. Steel at $55 per share, a deal that President Trump has cleared, referring to it as a "partnership" involving a $14 billion investment by Nippon over the next 14 months. U.S. Steel's headquarters will remain in Pittsburgh, and the company will have an American CEO with a majority of its board members from the U.S., according to Pennsylvania Senator Dave McCormick. The United Steelworkers union, however, remains concerned about Nippon's track record of violating trade laws and its potential impact on domestic steelmaking capacity and union jobs. The agreement includes a national security component, ensuring U.S. government approval over board members and production levels. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>Education Secretary Bridget Phillipson has indicated that the government is considering scrapping the two-child benefit cap, a policy that prevents most families from claiming means-tested benefits for any third or additional children born after April 2017. Phillipson warned that removing the cap would "cost a lot of money" but acknowledged that the policy has pushed people into poverty. The government is expected to announce its decision in the autumn, coinciding with the publication of its child poverty strategy, with the Child Poverty Taskforce assessing the cap and considering all options. Phillipson emphasized that a Labour government would prioritize different choices, recognizing the high "cost of inaction" on children's life chances.</p>

          <p>Consumer confidence experienced a significant boost in May, ending a five-month decline, as President Trump rolled back some tariffs, which had previously caused company warnings about potential price increases.

This improvement followed a trade agreement between the U.S. and China that reduced tit-for-tat tariffs, leading to a stock market surge and softened recession forecasts from Wall Street firms. Despite these positive developments, tariffs remain in place, and retailers continue to warn of potential price hikes.</p>

However, complex situations involving large debts, IRS enforcement actions, or Offers in Compromise often warrant professional assistance from enrolled agents, CPAs, or tax attorneys.
