          <p>President Trump signed an executive order establishing a "Gold Card" visa program, offering expedited immigrant visas for non-Americans who donate at least $1 million to the Commerce Department. Corporations can sponsor individuals for $2 million, with 80,000 such cards planned. This initiative, which replaces existing EB-1 and EB-2 visa programs, aims to attract high-value individuals, according to Commerce Secretary Howard Lutnick. The administration is also considering a $5 million "Platinum Card" for extended tax-free stays, requiring congressional approval. Additionally, an executive order imposed a new $100,000 fee on H-1B visas, impacting tech industries and sparking debate over its legal authority and economic implications (not investment advice).</p>

          <p>President Trump announced a "productive" phone call with Chinese President Xi Jinping, claiming an agreement on TikTok's U.S. operations, reportedly involving a sale to U.S. investors. However, China's official state news agency Xinhua offered a less definitive stance, stating Beijing merely "welcomes negotiations" and hopes the U.S. provides a fair business environment. The core issue remains the ownership of TikTok's powerful algorithm. Trump, who has previously delayed a ban, now views the platform as key for his 2024 campaign, while U.S. lawmakers continue to express national security concerns over ByteDance's links to the Chinese Communist Party.</p>

          <p>Tropical Storm Gabrielle, the seventh named storm of the 2025 Atlantic hurricane season, has formed over the central Atlantic Ocean and is projected to intensify into a hurricane by Sunday. Forecasters currently predict its trajectory will keep it safely north of the Caribbean islands and away from major landmasses, though it might pass to the east of Bermuda next week. Despite initial predictions for a more active season, hurricane activity has been somewhat subdued. Officials are closely monitoring Gabrielle's strengthening over open waters, anticipating gradual intensification late in the weekend without immediate threats to populated areas.</p>

          <p>A U.S. federal judge dismissed former President Donald Trump's $15 billion defamation lawsuit against The New York Times, calling the complaint "decidedly improper and impermissible" for its political nature and excessive length. Judge Steven Merryday stated the 85-page filing was a "megaphone for public relations" rather than a serious legal document. While not ruling on the legal merits, the judge granted Trump's lawyers 28 days to refile an amended complaint, emphasizing it must be professional and concise. The Times welcomed the ruling, reiterating its view that the lawsuit was an attempt to stifle independent reporting.</p>
