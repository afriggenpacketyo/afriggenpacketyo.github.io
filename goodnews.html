          <h2>BP's Strategic Reset and Strong Performance Diminish Takeover Speculation</h2>

        </div>
        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>British energy major BP has seen its shares climb over 32% since early April, significantly diminishing the takeover speculation that had surrounded it. This positive shift is attributed to a comprehensive strategic reset, a leadership shake-up, progress on cost-cutting initiatives, and a string of recent oil discoveries, including a "very optimistic" find in Brazil's Santos Basin. The company reported underlying replacement cost profit of $2.35 billion for the second quarter, comfortably surpassing analyst expectations of $1.81 billion. These factors have led to notable rating and price target upgrades, reinforcing BP's stable and growing outlook in the energy sector. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>Chinese toy company Pop Mart is expressing satisfaction with the decline in resale prices for its popular Labubu monster toys, despite previous extreme markups. The company asserts its products are created for art appreciation and joy, not solely for profit, aiming to make them accessible to genuine fans. To combat scalping and meet demand, Pop Mart has significantly ramped up production, now churning out 30 million plush toys monthly—ten times last year's levels. This strategic pivot aims for a steadier, more sustainable business model, moving away from being a "one-hit wonder" and fostering long-term customer loyalty. (not investment advice)</p>

The People's Bank of China highlighted three key platforms designed to accelerate the e-CNY's internationalization and reshape the global financial architecture, currently dominated by the US dollar. These platforms include a cross-border digital payment system, a blockchain service platform for on-chain payments, and a digital asset platform. This ambitious initiative positions the digital yuan as a major alternative amidst the growing international interest in stablecoins and digital currencies. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>The Seattle Seahawks clinched their eighth consecutive victory against the Arizona Cardinals, winning 23-20 on a dramatic 52-yard field goal by Jason Myers as time expired. Despite blowing a 14-point fourth-quarter lead, the Seahawks' Sam Darnold threw for 242 yards and a touchdown, while the defense sacked Kyler Murray six times. The Cardinals rallied with two late touchdowns but a penalty on the ensuing kickoff set up Seattle for the game-winning kick, which Myers calmly converted. The article highlights the Seahawks' efficient offensive play and their resilience in closing out a tight game, extending their NFC West dominance.</p>

During a recent interview, he affirmed that Ukraine would hold elections during a ceasefire, despite martial law currently prohibiting them. Zelenskyy, first elected in 2019, has served beyond his original five-year mandate due to the ongoing conflict. His remarks underscore a commitment to national resolution and democratic principles over personal political ambition, offering a vision for Ukraine's post-war future.</p>

          <p>Labour leader Sir Keir Starmer has publicly acknowledged that left-wing parties, including his own, previously "shied away from people's concerns around illegal immigration," making it too easy for individuals to enter the UK and work unlawfully. He announced plans for a compulsory UK-wide digital ID scheme as part of Labour's strategy to tackle the issue and counter the rising populist right. Starmer stressed the need for "patriotic national renewal" and urged Britons to reject Reform UK's "toxic" solutions, while also pledging a £5bn funding boost for 339 "overlooked" communities. This article highlights Labour's proactive shift on a critical electoral issue.</p>

          <p>Raj Ganguly, co-founder of B Capital, asserts that artificial intelligence is in the nascent phase of a "super cycle" that could span 15 to 20 years, profoundly impacting industries globally. He highlights generative AI's role in revitalizing Silicon Valley and enabling sole founders to build and code without traditional programming skills. The next decade is expected to focus on "deep tech" like AI and advanced semiconductors, reshaping sectors less touched by technology. While acknowledging a "frothy" market, Ganguly sees significant profit opportunities in AI-native applications, particularly from India, which are poised to become market leaders.

With a total length of 2,890 meters and a main span of 1,420 meters, it will also become the world's longest mountain bridge. The bridge will significantly facilitate traffic across the incredibly deep and narrow gorge known as the "Earth's crack," showcasing China's advanced infrastructure capabilities.</p>

          <p>A federal judge has granted preliminary approval for a $1.5 billion settlement between AI company Anthropic and authors who alleged the company illegally pirated nearly half a million books to train its chatbots. The settlement will compensate authors and publishers approximately $3,000 per covered book, though it does not apply to future works. While the court previously ruled AI training constitutes transformative fair use, this agreement resolves specific claims about how materials were obtained. The Authors Guild and Association of American Publishers hail it as a milestone, signaling to AI companies that copyright infringement carries a steep price.</p>

          <p>California Senate Bill 576, sparked by an 8-month-old being woken by loud commercials, seeks to mandate volume consistency for streaming service ads, mirroring existing federal law for broadcasters. If signed by Governor Gavin Newsom, this bill could effectively set a national standard, as companies often adopt California's policies across the U.S. The Motion Picture Association opposes the bill, citing complexities in managing varied ad sources. However, proponents, including Senator Tom Umberg, argue that streaming platforms possess the technological capability to regulate ad volume for consumer benefit, hoping to improve the viewing experience for many.</p>

          <p>US country music star Luke Combs observes that British fans are uniquely engaged, consuming entire albums rather than just singles, and focusing intently on lyrics, a contrast to American audiences. Country music is now the fastest-growing genre in the UK, with three billion streams last year, a trend Combs attributes to its universal appeal and artists investing time in the UK market. Combs is performing at the historic Grand Ole Opry's first-ever show outside the US, held at London's Royal Albert Hall. He credits streaming for broadening the genre's audience and anticipates more international shows if this event is successful.</p>

          <p>Approximately 200 pieces of live coral, illegally smuggled from Indonesia, have found a new home at the New York Aquarium after being seized by the U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service at JFK Airport. The coral, protected under endangered species acts and destined for pet shops, was in poor health after five days in transit. Aquarium experts, acting as a "coral hospital," successfully rehabilitated the coral, many of which have since regained their vibrant color and been moved to public display. This rescue highlights the critical role of aquariums in conservation efforts and educating the public about the severe impact of illegal wildlife trade.</p>
