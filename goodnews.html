          <p>Nearly a third of the 260 miners trapped underground at a Sibanye-Stillwater gold mine in South Africa were safely brought to the surface after an accident damaged the hoist system. The incident occurred at the Kloof gold mine, one of Sibanye's deepest mines, situated west of Johannesburg. While there were no fatalities or injuries, concerns were raised about the miners' well-being during the 24-hour ordeal. The Fox News article mentions that mining accidents are not uncommon in South Africa, particularly in abandoned mines taken over by informal diggers.</p>
