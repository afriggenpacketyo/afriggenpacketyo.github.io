        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Employees are increasingly pushing back against corporate return-to-office mandates through subtle means like "coffee badging," where they appear at the office for only a few hours. Stanford research indicates that work-from-home rates have remained stable since early 2023, suggesting a significant compliance gap between company policies and employee actions. This resistance is partly enabled by middle managers who are reluctant to enforce rules they themselves dislike, leading to a new dynamic where workers dictate their own terms for in-office presence.</p>

          <p>Instagram has launched a new awards program called "Rings," which will recognize 25 top creators with a physical gold ring and a special profile badge, but no cash prize. The move comes as Meta has reduced its creator bonus programs, prompting questions about the value of symbolic recognition over direct financial support. A panel including Instagram head Adam Mosseri and filmmaker Spike Lee will select the winners, with the initiative aimed at providing creators with elevated visibility and a new incentive.</p>

        </div>
        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Financial experts advise that forthcoming changes from President Trump's tax legislation could impact strategies for year-end charitable donations. Starting in 2026, a new charitable tax break for non-itemizers will be introduced, potentially making it advantageous for some to delay smaller gifts until then. Conversely, higher earners may face a reduced benefit from 2026 due to a new deduction "floor" and a cap for the top tax bracket, creating an incentive to accelerate donations this year using tools like donor-advised funds.

          <p>According to a new report from Adobe Analytics, U.S. online holiday spending is forecasted to grow by 5.3% year-over-year, reaching $253.4 billion. This growth rate is notably slower than the 8.7% increase seen in the previous year and below the ten-year average, indicating a more cautious consumer mindset. Shoppers are expected to be heavily focused on seeking discounts, with Cyber Week anticipated to drive a significant portion of sales, while mobile devices are set to account for over half of all online spending.

          <p>Sanae Takaichi, a hardline conservative and political heir to former Prime Minister Shinzo Abe, has won the leadership election for Japan's ruling Liberal Democratic Party, positioning her to become the nation's first female prime minister. Known for her nationalist views and admiration for Margaret Thatcher, Takaichi is expected to continue Abe's market-friendly economic policies and traditionalist vision.
