        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>UK health officials have reported the first detection of West Nile virus in UK mosquitoes, although they emphasize that the risk to the general public remains very low. The virus, typically spread among birds, can infect humans through mosquito bites, potentially causing minor symptoms or, in rare instances, severe brain illnesses. This discovery aligns with the broader trend of mosquito-borne diseases expanding into new regions due to climate change. The UK Health Security Agency and the Animal and Plant Health Agency identified fragments of the virus in mosquitoes collected near Retford, Nottinghamshire, indicating a changing landscape for infectious diseases in the UK.</p>

          <p>Vani Hari, known as the Food Babe, has transitioned from blogging about healthy eating to becoming a significant voice in the Trump administration's healthy-food agenda. Once a critic of the FDA, she now praises the agency's efforts to eradicate petroleum-based food dyes, marking a surprising shift in her relationship with government regulators. Her rise has sparked controversy, with some questioning her scientific rigor and others praising her dedication to making America's food healthier.

Santa Barbara, California, is the least affordable, driven by high housing costs and low affordability ratios.
