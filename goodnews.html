          <h2>Johns Hopkins Students Develop Braille Printer for Brewery Labels, Enhancing Accessibility</h2>
          <div class="timestamp">2025-07-07 09:17:38 EDT</div>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Engineering students at Johns Hopkins University have innovated a specialized printer for a Maryland brewery, designed to add braille writing to beer labels. This project, a collaboration with Blind Industries & Services of Maryland (BISM), addresses a significant accessibility need by creating a machine capable of punching braille onto plastic labels, a task commercial printers cannot easily perform. The students prioritized user-friendliness, developing open hardware and software that integrates with BISM's existing systems, empowering employees with low or no vision. This invention not only streamlines the labeling process but also supports an annual fundraiser for individuals with vision loss, demonstrating practical application of engineering for social good.</p>

          <p>Doris Garcia, a 96-year-old Coloradan, realized a lifelong dream of meeting penguins, 70 years after being denied an Antarctica research trip solely because of her gender. In the 1950s, Garcia, a George Washington University mathematics graduate working for the US government in Argentina, was on the boat for the expedition when she was told she couldn't go. Compassionate Hospice and the Denver Zoo Conservation Alliance collaborated to arrange a special, behind-the-scenes encounter with African penguins at the zoo. This heartwarming event brought immense joy to Garcia, fulfilling a long-held aspiration.</p>

          <p>An inclusive theater program in Queens, the QCP Players Program, is empowering adults with developmental disabilities through performing arts. Partnering with AhHa!Broadway, the initiative engages participants not only as actors but also in vital roles like set painting, stage crew, and ushers for their debut performance of "Willy Wonka." Over 12 weeks of rehearsals, organizers have observed significant improvements in participants' focus, energy, creativity, and collaboration. The program aims to showcase the talents and joy of these individuals, demonstrating that people with disabilities can achieve anything they set their minds to, fostering confidence and teamwork.</p>

          <p>This article provides an overview of current Certificate of Deposit (CD) interest rates, emphasizing their role in preserving buying power against inflation. It highlights that while national average CD yields are lower, top rates from online banks offer significantly higher returns, often surpassing the current inflation rate. The article explains the inverted yield curve phenomenon, where short-term CDs currently offer better rates than longer terms, and suggests strategies like comparing online banks and CD laddering to maximize earnings (not investment advice).</p>

          <p>Netflix continues to attract renowned directors like Martin Scorsese and Greta Gerwig by offering lucrative contracts, extensive creative freedom, and access to over 300 million subscribers, despite its minimal theatrical release strategy. The streaming giant views traditional box office models as outdated, prioritizing direct-to-subscriber content delivery and saving millions in marketing costs. While other media companies are re-embracing theatrical runs, Netflix serves as a unique haven for high-budget or niche auteur films that might not otherwise be produced. The article highlights that Netflix measures success by viewership, not box office revenue, and its stock performance remains strong amidst significant content investment.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>The UK government is set to extend bereavement leave entitlements to parents who experience a miscarriage before 24 weeks of pregnancy, a significant change from current laws that only cover losses after this gestation period or of a child under 18. The proposed amendment to the Employment Rights Bill will grant parents a legal right to at least one week of unpaid time off to grieve. This move has been widely welcomed by campaigners, including Labour MP Sarah Owen and Myleene Klass, who emphasize that early pregnancy loss is a profound bereavement, not merely an illness, and deserves formal recognition and support.</p>

          <p>This article uncovers the decades-long struggle for recognition faced by Janet Bennett, the 96-year-old designer of the iconic mosaic murals at Los Angeles International Airport. Completed in 1961, these colorful installations have been mistakenly attributed to others, with LAX still refusing official credit due to old records. In a heartwarming turn, the Los Angeles Dodgers reached out to Bennett, whose work inspired a new tile wall at Dodger Stadium, and have explicitly credited her for the design. This act of recognition by the Dodgers highlights the artist's overlooked legacy, contrasting sharply with the airport's continued silence.</p>

Additionally, it increases the estate and gift tax exemption, and introduces new financial breaks for tip income, overtime pay, and auto loans.

Economists, however, assert that Trump holds limited power over the central bank due to its historically independent and nonpartisan structure. The Federal Open Market Committee, which sets interest rates, operates by consensus among its 12 members, most of whom serve long terms. The Supreme Court has also indicated protection for the Fed chair, and Powell has publicly resisted political pressure, affirming the Fed's commitment to independent policy decisions (not investment advice).</p>

The decision came despite being just 33 runs shy of Lara's 2004 record, which itself surpassed Matthew Hayden's 380.
