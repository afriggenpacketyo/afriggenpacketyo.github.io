          <h2>Poetry Advocated as an Analog Solution for Mindful Living in Digital Age</h2>
          <div class="timestamp">2025-08-28 14:19:00 EDT</div>
        </div>
        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>This article advocates for poetry as a powerful, analog solution for mindful living, offering a deeper engagement with the present moment than contemporary digital wellness tools. It posits that poetry, by recording our observations, emotions, and experiences, addresses a fundamental cause of modern unwellness: the feeling of life slipping away. The piece highlights the work of poet Linda Gregg, whose ability to draw from "resonant sources" of human life—including family, politics, love, and fears—creates an immersive experience. Gregg's poem "The Last Night in Mithymna" is presented as an example, demonstrating how her unique use of language can cultivate a sense of satisfaction and bring the reader into a state of heightened self-awareness, aligning them with their surroundings.</p>

          <h2>Best Buy Reports Modest Sales Recovery, Cites Tariff Uncertainty for Cautious Outlook</h2>

        </div>
        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Best Buy reported better-than-expected revenue and earnings for its latest quarter, signaling a modest sales recovery, but maintained its full-year guidance due to ongoing tariff uncertainty. CEO Corie Barry noted the company is "trending toward the higher end of our sales range" for the back half of the year, while acknowledging potential impacts on consumer spending. Comparable sales increased 1.6%, the highest in three years, driven by strong performance in mobile phones, video gaming (including the Nintendo Switch 2 launch), and computing, though offset by weaker appliance and home theater sales. The retailer is implementing strategies like a new third-party marketplace, sharpened pricing, and enhanced in-store experiences to stimulate growth amid a challenging economic environment.

        </div>
        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>The UK Department for Transport has announced the first electric vehicles (EVs) eligible for discounts under a new £650 million grant scheme, aiming to accelerate the transition from petrol and diesel cars. Ford's Puma Gen-E and e-Tourneo Courier will receive the maximum £3,750 discount, while 26 other models are cleared for £1,500 reductions, automatically applied at the point of sale. This initiative seeks to bring EV prices closer to their petrol and diesel counterparts, addressing upfront cost as a major barrier for many drivers. The government plans to ban new petrol/diesel car sales by 2030, but critics still cite the need for more charging infrastructure.</p>

          <p>With no federal law governing facial recognition, 23 U.S. states have enacted or expanded legislation to restrict how tech companies collect and analyze biometric data, including faces and voices. Recent laws in Colorado and Texas require consent before use and ban data sales, while Oregon mandates consumer opt-in. Privacy advocates, like Adam Schwartz of the Electronic Frontier Foundation, emphasize the need for laws that change company behavior, as cutting-edge AI makes such technology ubiquitous. Illinois's law, allowing individuals to sue, has led to significant settlements, but the article highlights challenges in enforcing state laws against elusive overseas companies like PimEyes.</p>

          <h2>Strategies to Maximize Social Security Retirement Benefits for a More Secure Future</h2>
          <div class="timestamp">2025-08-28 13:18:47 EDT</div>

          <p>For millions of Americans, Social Security is a crucial retirement income source, with many relying on it for half or more of their income. This article outlines three key strategies to maximize future Social Security benefits. Firstly, delaying claiming benefits beyond full retirement age can permanently increase monthly checks by 8% annually until age 70. Secondly, continuing to work and earn more, especially in higher-earning years, boosts the benefit calculation based on the 35 highest-earning years. Lastly, married couples can strategically coordinate spousal benefits, often by having the higher earner delay, to ensure a larger survivor benefit. The article also suggests annuities, reverse mortgages, and maintaining a retirement portfolio as supplementary income tools. (not investment advice)</p>

          <h2>Comparing Interest Earnings: $40,000 CD Versus Money Market Account Amid Rate Cuts</h2>

          <p>As interest rates decline due to Federal Reserve cuts, this article compares the potential interest earnings of a $40,000 Certificate of Deposit (CD) versus a $40,000 money market account. While CDs offer fixed, guaranteed rates, money market accounts have variable rates subject to change, making their future earnings speculative. The analysis shows that for shorter terms (3 and 9 months), money market accounts could earn slightly more based on current rates, but for 6 months, a CD earns more, and for a year, they are identical. However, the article emphasizes that CD returns are guaranteed, unlike money market accounts, which are likely to see rates fall further. Savers prioritizing guaranteed returns might find CDs more secure in this shifting rate environment. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>Eli Lilly, the manufacturer of the popular weight loss drug Mounjaro, has offered a discounted deal to UK suppliers, aiming to limit the price increase for consumers starting in September. This intervention comes after the company initially announced a potential 170% list price hike, which could have raised the highest dose to £330 per month. Under the new arrangement, the highest dose is expected to sell to suppliers for £247.50, meaning patient price increases will likely be less severe than first feared. The article notes that President Trump previously criticized high U.S. drug costs compared to other countries, and this deal does not affect the NHS's already negotiated discounted rate.

          <p>Nvidia's stock fluctuated as its latest earnings report revealed robust AI demand, with sales surging 56% to $46.74 billion, but provided limited clarity on its future in China. The company's better-than-expected results were overshadowed by concerns regarding U.S. restrictions, particularly after the Trump administration blocked sales of its H20 chip. CEO Jensen Huang indicated a potential $50 billion opportunity in China and the possibility of selling advanced Blackwell processors there, but the H20 chip's fate remains uncertain. Despite this, Huang projected immense AI infrastructure spending, estimating $3-4 trillion by the end of the decade, reinforcing a multi-year growth runway for Nvidia. (not investment advice)</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>In President Trump's market, traditional oil and gas stocks, despite positive returns, have not been the leading energy winners, according to Paul Baiocchi of SS&C ALPS Advisors. This shift reflects a broader investor trend towards viewing energy in terms of power generation rather than solely crude oil and natural gas. The Utilities Select Sector SPDR (XLU) has seen significant inflows and tripled the performance of the Energy Select Sector SPDR (XLE) this year, driven by expectations of major changes in the U.S. electric grid. Factors like surging demand from AI data centers, a new tech arms race, and the promotion of nuclear power are transforming the sector, with projections indicating a need for 45% more electricity by 2040.

          <p>The European Union has formally proposed removing tariffs on American industrial goods, a key component of the U.S.-EU framework trade agreement, which will retroactively reduce automobile tariffs from August 1. The European Commission stated this move, along with preferential market access for some U.S. seafood and agricultural goods, aims to restore stability and predictability in transatlantic trade relations. The proposal requires approval from the European Parliament and Council. This article highlights a significant step towards de-escalating trade tensions, recalling that U.S. President Donald Trump had previously announced a 15% tariff on most European goods, including cars, underscoring the ongoing efforts to reshape global trade policies.</p>
