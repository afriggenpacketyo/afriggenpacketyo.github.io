          <p>Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy has indicated he is prepared to step down from his position once the war with Russia concludes. In a recent interview, he affirmed that his primary objective is achieving peace, not securing another presidential term. Zelenskyy also committed to holding elections if a ceasefire agreement is reached with Russia, even though martial law currently prohibits them. His original five-year term, which began in 2019, would have ended in May 2024 had the full-scale invasion not occurred.</p>

          <p>According to Raj Ganguly, co-founder of venture capital firm B Capital, the world is in the early stages of an artificial intelligence "super cycle" that could last for two decades. He believes AI will fundamentally change every industry, from drug development to the job market, creating profound global shifts. While acknowledging the current market may be "frothy" or overvalued due to immense excitement, Ganguly asserts that the long-term impact of AI is undeniable. He also highlights India as a key market for developing AI-native applications that will become global leaders. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>China is set to open the world's highest bridge to traffic this Sunday in the mountainous southwestern province of Guizhou. The new bridge spans the Huajiang Grand Canyon and its deck stands at a height of 625 meters (2,050 feet) above the river below, comparable to the height of China's tallest skyscraper. With a total length of 2,890 meters, it is also expected to become the world's longest mountain bridge.

          <p>A federal judge has given preliminary approval to a $1.5 billion settlement between the AI company Anthropic and a group of authors and publishers. The lawsuit alleged that Anthropic illegally used nearly half a million pirated books to train its AI chatbots, including its Claude model. The settlement will compensate the copyright holders of the affected books, with each receiving about $3,000. Publishing industry groups have hailed the decision as a significant step in holding AI developers accountable for copyright infringement, setting a precedent for future cases.</p>

          <p>In a significant foreign policy declaration, U.S. President Donald Trump has stated that he "will not allow" Israel to annex the occupied West Bank. The statement comes amid increasing pressure from ultranationalist factions within the Israeli government to annex the territory and a wave of Western nations formally recognizing a Palestinian state. The remarks were made ahead of a meeting with Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu and suggest a potential deal regarding Gaza is also "pretty close." This position aligns with warnings from the UK, Germany, and the UN against such a move.</p>

          <h2>California Bill Inspired by Waking Infant Aims to Lower Streaming Service Commercial Volume</h2>

          <p>A piece of California legislation, prompted by a staffer whose baby was repeatedly woken by loud commercials, seeks to regulate the volume of ads on streaming services like Netflix and Prime Video. The bill, SB 576, would extend rules similar to the federal CALM Act, which already applies to broadcast and cable television, to online streaming platforms. Because of California's large market size, the law could effectively set a new nationwide standard for the industry. The bill has passed the state legislature and now awaits the governor's signature.</p>

Operated by the Anthony Nolan charity, the facility is expected to create 1,300 new donation slots annually, addressing a global shortage and reducing delays for patients with blood cancers and disorders. Previously, only one in five donors could provide cells on the date requested by medical teams due to capacity issues. This new center aims to ensure that life-saving transplants can happen at the most critical time for patients.</p>

          <p>American country music superstar Luke Combs has noted the rapid growth of the genre's popularity in the United Kingdom, attributing it to country's universal appeal and the accessibility provided by streaming services. He observes that British fans are often "a very listening crowd" who consume entire albums rather than just radio singles, creating a different concert dynamic. Combs is in London for a special performance of Nashville's famous Grand Ole Opry at the Royal Albert Hall, marking the first time the historic show has been held outside the United States.</p>

          <p>While Tropical Storm Humberto is not expected to make landfall, forecasters are monitoring its potential interaction with another developing storm system nearby. This could lead to a rare meteorological event known as the Fujiwhara effect, where two storms orbit a common center. Depending on their relative strengths, the storms could merge, with the stronger one absorbing the weaker, or they could "dance" around each other before separating. While this interaction is considered unlikely, it could slightly alter the storms' predicted paths as they move through the western Atlantic.</p>

          <p>Approximately 200 pieces of live coral, illegally smuggled from Indonesia and seized by U.S. Fish and Wildlife officials, have found a new home at the New York Aquarium. The coral, which is protected under the Endangered Species Act, was in poor health after being in transit for five days. Aquarium staff have been nursing the animals back to health in what they describe as a "coral hospital." Many of the pieces have recovered so well they are now on public display, serving as educational ambassadors for their species.</p>

          <p>Pfizer's potential $7.3 billion acquisition of Metsera, a developer of next-generation weight-loss drugs, is anticipated to stimulate further investment in innovative obesity treatments in China. Analysts believe the major deal signals continued strong interest from global pharmaceutical giants in this lucrative market. While the move is expected to encourage existing Chinese companies to advance their research, it is unlikely to attract entirely new players to the competitive field. The acquisition highlights a strategic focus on developing drugs with better efficacy and fewer side effects than current market leaders. (not investment advice)</p>
