          <p>The French state is leading a significant investment in satellite operator Eutelsat, aiming to establish it as a European competitor to Elon Musk's Starlink. This move positions Eutelsat as a strategic asset for the EU's technological sovereignty, especially in dual-use and security-sensitive sectors. However, experts note that Eutelsat faces major challenges in competing with Starlink's massive scale, which boasts over ten times as many low-Earth orbit satellites. Significant further investment would be needed to achieve parity in the mass-market broadband segment. (not investment advice)</p>
