          <p>Columbia University activist Mahmoud Khalil was released from an ICE detention facility in Louisiana after a federal judge ordered his release while his immigration proceedings continue. Khalil, who was detained for months due to "foreign policy" concerns under the Trump administration, addressed reporters after his release, stating that the administration chose the wrong person to target. The judge determined that Khalil is not a threat to the community or a flight risk, and his bail conditions restrict his travel to specific states. Khalil, a green card holder, was initially detained in March, and his wife gave birth to their first child in April while he was in custody, now he can finally hug his wife and child without looking at the clock. The administration plans to appeal the judge's decision. </p>

          <p>A federal judge blocked the Trump administration from revoking Harvard University's ability to enroll international students, while President Trump hinted at a potential "deal" to resolve conflicts with the school. The judge's preliminary injunction prevents the government from cutting off Harvard's access to the Student and Exchange Visitor Information System. Mr. Trump claimed his administration has been "working closely with Harvard," and a deal may be announced soon, but the Department of Homeland Security criticized the ruling, stating it conflicts with the president's powers. The battle over international students could significantly impact Harvard, where approximately one in four students are from outside the United States. </p>

          <p>Rhode Island's state House has approved legislation that would ban the sale and manufacturing of many semiautomatic rifles, sending the proposal to Democratic Gov. Dan McKee, who supports assault weapons bans. If signed into law, Rhode Island would join 10 other states with similar prohibitions on high-powered firearms. The bill only applies to the sale and manufacturing of assault weapons, not possession, similar to Washington state law. Critics argue that assault weapons bans do little to curb mass shootings and only punish law-abiding citizens, with some predicting the U.S. Supreme Court would deem the law unconstitutional.</p>

          <p>A study indicates that visits by foreign tourists to locations related to manga and anime in Japan have boosted local economies, prompting more regions to capitalize on the nation's soft power reach. In 2024, approximately 3 million foreign tourists, or 8.1 percent of inbound visitors, visited places linked to movies or anime, up from 4.8 percent in 2016. Purchases of anime and manga-related goods are estimated to have totaled 54.3 billion yen last year, a 53 percent increase from 2016. The phenomenon, known as "seichi junrei," has become a popular trend among fans visiting real-life settings of popular works, like the Homangu Kamado Shrine in Fukuoka Prefecture linked to the "Demon Slayer" anime series.</p>

          <p>Due to a surge in rice prices to record highs, Japanese restaurants and food companies are turning to noodles as cost-sensitive consumers steer clear of rice. Antworks Co., which operates pork rice bowl eateries, opened its first ramen noodle restaurant in Tokyo and plans to open three more to diversify its operations. Yoshinoya Holdings Co. is also strengthening its ramen noodle business, viewing the beef bowl restaurant market as saturated. According to the Ministry of Agriculture, Forestry and Fisheries, rice prices have doubled from a year earlier, prompting consumers to seek alternatives like udon noodles and Western-style breakfast foods.</p>

          <p>Columbia University graduate and activist Mahmoud Khalil was released on bail after more than three months in detention, following a federal judge's ruling that he was not a flight risk or threat. Khalil, a prominent voice in Columbia's pro-Palestinian protests last year, was arrested on March 8, sparking demonstrations in New York and Washington DC. The government has argued his activism impedes US foreign policy and moved to have him deported, but the White House maintains that Judge Michael Farbiarz did not have jurisdiction to order Mr Khalil's release. He said he was most eager to see his wife and his son, who was born during his 104 days in detention.</p>

          <p>As summer approaches, the topic of wearing shorts to the office remains contentious, even as more companies scrap formal dress codes. Stylists agree that whether or not shorts are appropriate depends on context, with tailored shorts generally being more acceptable than beach or sports shorts. Many companies expect staff to dress professionally and comfortably, taking extra care when meeting clients. A YouGov poll indicated that 66% of Britons find it acceptable for men to wear shorts in the office, but the decision often depends on the specific workplace and the individual's role.</p>
