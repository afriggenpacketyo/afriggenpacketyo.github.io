          <p>Boeing has shown signs of a financial turnaround, significantly cutting its quarterly losses to $176 million and boosting revenue by 35% to $22.75 billion. The aerospace company delivered 150 airplanes in the second quarter, its highest number since 2018, leading CEO Kelly Ortberg to declare 2025 as a potential "turnaround year." Despite the improvements in commercial airplane sales and reduced cash burn, the company still faces challenges, including delays in certifying its 737 Max 7 and Max 10 models and potential labor strikes in its defense unit.</p>

          <p>Gold remains a significant commodity, often viewed as a safe-haven asset and a hedge against inflation, particularly during economic uncertainty. As of late July 2025, the price of gold was reported at over $3,300 per ounce, though this figure is subject to constant fluctuation. The article explains that numerous factors influence its price, including supply and demand, global economic conditions, inflation rates, and geopolitical instability. Central bank policies and currency movements, especially the strength of the U.S. dollar, also play a crucial role in determining the value of the precious metal. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>Gee-Kung Chang, a distinguished Georgia Institute of Technology professor and a pioneer in 6G network technology, has been fully cleared of all charges after a grueling four-year legal fight. In March 2021, Chang was arrested by federal agents as part of the U.S. government's China Initiative, facing accusations of wire and visa fraud that shattered his reputation. After years of legal proceedings, a judge dismissed the wire fraud charges for lack of evidence in 2024, and the final visa fraud charge was dropped in April of this year, completely exonerating the 74-year-old scientist.</p>

          <p>Apple has announced the opening of a new manufacturing academy in Detroit, a move that comes amid increasing pressure from President Donald Trump to expand the company's U.S. operations. The program, administered by Michigan State University, will offer workshops on manufacturing and artificial intelligence to small and medium-sized businesses starting in August. This initiative is part of Apple's broader public commitment to invest over $500 billion in the U.S., which also includes assembling AI servers in Texas and purchasing chips from an Arizona-based factory. The move is seen as an effort to appease the administration's demands for more domestic production.</p>

Following a meeting with British Prime Minister Keir Starmer, Trump also vowed to continue working with Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu to resolve global issues.

Total payment volume beat forecasts, and the number of active accounts grew to 438 million.

His sudden departure from WEWS, where he had worked since 1993, was unexplained by the station beyond a statement emphasizing adherence to high ethical standards.

          <p>The CNBC Investing Club has announced the sale of 25 shares of Eli Lilly, locking in a significant 220% gain on the position. This move is a direct reaction to disappointing news from Novo Nordisk, a primary competitor in the GLP-1 drug market, which slashed its sales growth outlook due to competition and slower market expansion. While acknowledging that some of Novo's issues could be company-specific, the club is acting cautiously ahead of Eli Lilly's upcoming earnings report to protect its profits from potential market contagion.

          <p>Union Pacific has made an $85 billion offer to acquire Norfolk Southern, a move that would create the first transcontinental railroad in the United States. The proposed merger aims to combine Union Pacific's extensive network in the western U.S. with Norfolk Southern's tracks in the east, which the companies claim will streamline deliveries and improve efficiency. The deal, valued at approximately $320 per share for Norfolk Southern, faces significant scrutiny from antitrust regulators due to concerns about industry consolidation.

Initially given less than a year to live, Kennedy was approved for the transplant despite his age.

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Despite warnings that President Trump's tariffs on imports would lead to significant price increases, American shoppers have yet to experience the full impact for several key reasons. Many companies anticipated the tariffs and stockpiled goods in advance, creating a buffer against immediate cost hikes. Additionally, the steepest proposed tariffs have been repeatedly delayed, giving importers more time to adjust. In many cases, retailers and manufacturers have chosen to absorb the initial tariff costs, eating into their profit margins rather than passing the full expense on to inflation-weary consumers, though this may not be sustainable long-term.</p>

The restoration project showcases the aircraft's luxurious 1950s interior and highlights the design flaws, such as its rectangular windows, that contributed to the fatal crashes.
