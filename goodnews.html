          <p>Former President Donald Trump is scheduled to host two crypto-focused dinners this month, aiming to raise millions from the crypto community. The first event, a $1.5 million-per-plate fundraiser, will feature David Sacks, who has been influential in shaping crypto and AI regulations. The second dinner offers access to Trump's inner circle based on holdings of the $TRUMP token, with the top 220 holders promised a dinner with Trump. This move highlights Trump's increasing engagement with the crypto industry, contrasting with President Biden's approach.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>The Trump administration's Department of Homeland Security (DHS) has initiated a program providing $1,000 stipends and travel assistance to undocumented immigrants who volunteer to return to their home countries. Homeland Security Secretary Kristi Noem stated that self-deportation is the "best, safest, and most cost-effective way to leave the United States to avoid arrest," costing significantly less than the average $17,121 required for arrest, detention, and removal. Participants must use the CBP Home app, and will be deprioritized for detention and removal while arranging their departure, potentially improving chances for future legal immigration. The program has already been utilized by an individual returning to Honduras from Chicago, marking its initial implementation.</p>

          <p>Five survivors of a plane crash in the Bolivian jungle, including a pilot and a 6-year-old boy, recounted their harrowing 36-hour ordeal clinging to the wreckage in an alligator-infested lagoon. The plane's engine failed mid-flight, causing it to crash into a swamp, leaving the survivors with injuries, dehydration, and insect bites. They survived by eating cassava flour and avoiding the alligators, possibly deterred by the stench of jet fuel. Rescuers eventually found them after they waved shirts and shouted, marking a rare uplifting story for the nation.</p>

He expressed optimism about nearing trade deals with various partners, including China, despite maintaining tariffs. Trump's claim that numerous countries are seeking deals with the U.S. was used to justify scaling back the reciprocal tariff plan.</p>

          <p>The Eta Aquariid meteor shower will peak tonight, offering astronomy fans a chance to see meteors streaking across the sky. NASA advises viewers to go outside around 2 a.m. local time, find an area away from lights, and lie on their backs with their feet facing east. While optimal conditions can yield about 50 meteors per hour, light from the waxing moon may reduce visibility to 10-15 meteors per hour. The Eta Aquariids are known for their speed and originate from space debris shed by Halley's comet.</p>
