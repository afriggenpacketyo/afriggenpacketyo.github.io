          <p>Defending champion Katarina Johnson-Thompson is positioned for a potential third world title in the heptathlon, currently holding third place with two events remaining. The competition saw a significant development as her main rival, Belgium's Olympic champion Nafi Thiam, unexpectedly withdrew from the event. Johnson-Thompson's performance, including a 6.42m long jump, keeps her in the hunt for a medal, though she expressed some frustration over a narrowly fouled, much larger jump. The final day's javelin and 800m events will be decisive for the podium finishers.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Companies are increasingly adopting AI tools like ChatGPT to automate tasks and reduce employee burnout, which costs U.S. businesses millions annually. Studies suggest AI can decrease emotional exhaustion by handling repetitive work, allowing for early intervention when employees are at risk. However, some research indicates that frequent AI users may experience higher rates of burnout, as the technology can lead to increased workloads and the mental strain of constant engagement. Experts caution that without proper management and boundaries, AI could simply create more capacity for work rather than alleviating pressure.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>The Liberal Democrats have proposed a plan for every police force in England and Wales to establish police counters in public venues like supermarkets and libraries. The party argues this would enhance public confidence and make it easier for citizens to report crimes, addressing a decline in traditional police station front counters. Funding for this 'police desk promise' would reportedly come from scrapping the elected Police and Crime Commissioner roles, a cost estimated at over £100 million over four years. This policy announcement marks a key initiative at the start of the party's annual conference.</p>

The couple, who had lived and run a charitable training program in Afghanistan for nearly two decades, were accused of breaking Afghan laws, though the specific reasons for their detention were never disclosed. After an emotional reunion with their daughter in Doha, they are undergoing medical checks before flying home.</p>

          <p>England's women's rugby team, the Red Roses, are preparing to face France in a high-stakes World Cup semi-final, backed by a formidable record of 31 consecutive Test wins. Despite England's statistical dominance, France has consistently proven to be their toughest opponent, often closing the score gap in recent matches through their resilient style of play. However, France enters the match significantly hampered by suspensions and injuries to key players. The match at Allianz Stadium will determine who advances to the final, with England aiming to continue their historic run and France hoping for a major upset.</p>

          <p>The return to school brings the resurgence of parent WhatsApp groups, a tool that many find both essential and overwhelming. These chats can be a valuable resource for coordinating on school events, sharing reminders, and organizing teacher gifts. However, they are also a source of stress for many parents, who cite the high volume of notifications, the spread of misinformation, and the tendency for discussions to devolve into competitive parenting or negativity. Some parents are choosing to leave the groups entirely to avoid the 'background noise' and anxiety, highlighting the dual nature of these modern communication channels.</p>

          <p>U.S. Northern Command is actively testing and evaluating various counter-drone systems to defend sensitive national security facilities from unauthorized incursions. At a recent event at Eglin Air Force Base, companies demonstrated technologies ranging from acoustic detection systems to interceptor drones that capture hostile drones with nets. This initiative comes in response to a growing number of drone intrusions over U.S. military installations, with at least 350 incidents reported in 2024. The military's goal is to establish rapid response teams capable of neutralizing any drone threat in the country within 24 hours.</p>
