          <p>Apple is requesting a court to halt a recent ruling in its legal battle with Epic Games, which would require Apple to allow developers to include web links for in-app purchases without paying commissions. Apple argues that complying with the order will cost the company significant sums, potentially billions of dollars annually, and reduce consumer choice. Epic Games CEO Tim Sweeney contends that the ruling forces Apple to compete, while Apple claims that developers are already exploiting the order to bypass in-app purchases. The judge in the case also made a criminal referral, alleging that Apple misled the court regarding its commission policies.</p>

          <p>A Standard Chartered analyst, Geoffrey Kendrick, has apologized for his earlier prediction that Bitcoin would reach $120,000 by the second quarter, stating that this target "may be too low." Kendrick's revised outlook is driven by significant inflows into U.S. spot Bitcoin exchange-traded funds and increased institutional investment. He notes that the dominant narrative around Bitcoin has shifted from correlation with risk assets to a strategic reallocation away from U.S. assets. Bitcoin has once again topped the $100,000 level, and Kendrick maintains a bullish stance on the cryptocurrency.</p>

          <p>The Bank of England has reduced interest rates to 4.25% from 4.5% and suggested that more cuts may follow in the coming months, this marks the fourth cut within the past year. The decision to lower rates was influenced by concerns that the global trade war could negatively impact UK economic growth, though a UK-US trade deal was welcomed. The Bank's base interest rate affects rates set by High Street banks and lenders, influencing borrowing costs for mortgages and credit cards, as well as returns for savers.</p>

          <h2>Weighing the Pros and Cons of Using Inheritance to Pay Off Credit Card Debt</h2>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Experts say using an inheritance to pay off credit card debt can be a wise move due to high interest rates, but it's not always the best option. Paying off high-interest debt offers an immediate and higher return compared to long-term market returns. However, it may not be the best move if your balances are low, on a 0% promotional rate, or if there are more urgent financial needs or claims against the estate. It's important to address the root cause of the debt to avoid recurring problems.</p>

          <p>Prime Minister Keir Starmer of Britain has secured a trade agreement with the United States, marking a significant political victory and validating his strategy of nurturing a relationship with President Trump. While the details of the agreement are still emerging, it positions Britain as the first country to finalize a deal with the U.S. after Trump's imposition of tariffs on other trading partners. Starmer's diplomatic outreach, including personal contact with Trump and a letter from King Charles III, has been instrumental in achieving this outcome.</p>
