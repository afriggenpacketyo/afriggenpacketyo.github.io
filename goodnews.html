          <div class="timestamp">2025-06-04 16:49:00 EDT</div>
        </div>
        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Despite efforts to reduce reliance on Russian gas and oil, the EU has increased fertilizer imports from Russia since the invasion of Ukraine, now accounting for about 30% of EU fertilizer imports. The European Parliament endorsed a proposal to introduce tariffs on fertilizers imported from Russia and Belarus, gradually increasing to 50% by 2028. This move aims to wean the EU off Russian fertilizer, potentially sourcing it from China, Oman, Morocco, Canada, or the US, or increasing the use of organic fertilizer. While fertilizer producers support the tariffs, farmers are concerned about the lack of affordable alternatives to Russian fertilizer. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>Amazon has formed a new group within its consumer product-development arm, Lab126, dedicated to agentic artificial intelligence. The team will develop an agentic AI "framework" for use in its robotics operations, enabling robots to understand and act on natural language commands. This move is part of a growing trend among companies to build AI agents capable of completing multistep, complex actions on a user's behalf. Amazon's AI lab released a web browser-based agent earlier this year, and its cloud unit has also formed its own agentic AI group.</p>

          <p>An almost 200-year-old condom is on display at the Rijksmuseum in Amsterdam as part of an exhibition on 19th Century prostitution and sexuality. The condom, dating back to 1830, is thought to be made of a sheep's appendix and features an explicit print. The museum believes it was a "luxury souvenir" from a brothel in France. The museum's curator said that the condom is in mint condition and has not been used.</p>
