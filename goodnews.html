          <p>Financial markets across the Asia-Pacific region traded mixed, showing a relatively muted reaction to the U.S. government shutdown. In Japan, the Nikkei 225 continued its losing streak, while business sentiment among large manufacturers saw a slight increase according to the Bank of Japan's Tankan survey. Elsewhere, markets in South Korea and Taiwan posted gains, and India's Nifty 50 rose after the central bank held interest rates steady. Meanwhile, spot gold prices reached a new record high amid the economic uncertainty. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>The Reserve Bank of India (RBI) has kept its key policy rate unchanged at 5.5%, aligning with economists' expectations as the central bank assesses the effects of previous rate cuts. RBI Governor Sanjay Malhotra noted that while inflation moderated in the first quarter, global trade uncertainties could slow growth in the latter half of the fiscal year. The RBI forecasts 6.8% GDP growth for fiscal year 2026 but anticipates a moderation in the third and fourth quarters due to trade headwinds. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>Starting this week, retailers in England are banned from offering multibuy promotions, such as "buy one, get one free," on food and drink products high in fat, salt, or sugar. The new restrictions apply to supermarkets and other large retailers as part of a government strategy to combat rising obesity rates, particularly among children. Public health officials have praised the long-overdue measure, arguing that such deals encourage impulsive over-consumption and do not save consumers money in the long run. The policy aims to shift promotional focus towards healthier products.</p>

          <p>China has achieved a significant milestone in its offshore energy infrastructure, with its network of subsea oil and gas pipelines now extending over 10,000 kilometers. This was accomplished with the final installation of a pipeline in Bohai Bay, one of the country's largest offshore oil production bases. The expansion is part of a broader strategy to enhance energy security by exploiting offshore resources. The state plans to extend the network to 13,000 kilometers by 2030, with new pipelines designed to also transport green fuels like hydrogen.</p>

          <p>In his first year as NATO's Secretary General, Mark Rutte has focused on navigating the challenging relationship with a re-elected US President Donald Trump and reinforcing the alliance against Russian aggression. Assuming the role in October 2024, Rutte was seen as the leader best equipped to manage Trump's skepticism towards the alliance, successfully lobbying for continued US commitment. Foreign policy experts have generally graded his performance favorably, crediting him with maintaining alliance unity and securing increased defense spending commitments, though challenges remain regarding NATO's response to external threats like drone incursions.</p>

          <h2>All GP Practices in England Now Required to Offer Online Booking</h2>

          <p>The UK government has mandated that every General Practitioner (GP) practice in England must offer online appointment booking services throughout the workday. This new requirement aims to eliminate the daily "8am scramble" where patients compete for appointments over the phone. Patients will now be able to request non-urgent appointments, ask questions, and describe symptoms online for a call back. While many practices already offered this service, the mandate ensures universal access, with ministers arguing it will modernize the NHS and free up phone lines for urgent cases.</p>

          <p>Emma Hayes, the head coach of the United States women's national soccer team, has been inducted into the National Football Museum's Hall of Fame. The former Chelsea manager described her transition to international football as "thoroughly enjoyable," comparing it to being a grandparent who sees players for short periods before sending them back to their clubs. Since taking the role, Hayes has led the USWNT to a gold medal at the 2024 Paris Olympics. She noted the new role allows her more time for strategic thinking compared to the relentless pace of club management.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>The world transfer record in women's football has been broken five times in 2025, with fees escalating dramatically as investment flows into top leagues in England and the USA. While this signals positive growth and a healthier financial ecosystem for the elite level of the sport, it also raises concerns about a widening competitive gap. Leagues like Germany's Bundesliga are struggling to keep pace with the financial power of their English and American counterparts. This financial disparity threatens to leave many clubs and leagues behind, creating a clear division between the sport's haves and have-nots.</p>

          <p>New Zealand all-rounder Melie Kerr expressed strong confidence in her team's ability to compete at the highest level for the next decade, despite being considered underdogs for the upcoming 50-over World Cup. The White Ferns enter the tournament as the surprising T20 World Cup champions from 2024, a victory that broke a long streak of T20 defeats. Kerr believes the team thrives without the pressure of being favorites, allowing them to work quietly and express themselves freely. She predicts that the current group of players will reach its peak performance over the next five to ten years.</p>

          <p>The Los Angeles Dodgers began their postseason campaign with a dominant 10-5 victory over the Cincinnati Reds in the first game of the wild-card series. The offense was powered by five home runs, including two each from Shohei Ohtani and Teoscar Hernández, providing ample support for starter Blake Snell, who pitched seven strong innings. However, the team's persistent bullpen issues surfaced in the eighth inning, when three relievers allowed three runs and created a tense situation. Despite the late-game shakiness, the Dodgers secured the win and are one victory away from advancing.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>An increasing number of young Americans are choosing careers in skilled trades like plumbing and electrical work over traditional white-collar paths. This shift is driven by concerns over high college tuition costs and the growing threat of artificial intelligence automating entry-level professional jobs. A recent survey found that 77% of Gen Z members prioritize job security from automation, viewing trades as a safer long-term career choice. This trend marks a reversal of the long-held stigma against blue-collar work, as these roles are now seen as offering stable, well-paying, and entrepreneurial opportunities.</p>
