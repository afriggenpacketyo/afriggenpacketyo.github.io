          <p>Prince Harry has returned to the United Kingdom to attend the WellChild charity awards in London, an organization for which he serves as a patron. His visit coincides with the third anniversary of Queen Elizabeth II's death, and he paid his respects by laying a wreath at her burial site in Windsor. While in the UK, the prince has several other engagements scheduled, though there is public speculation about whether he will meet with his father, King Charles. Meanwhile, other members of the Royal Family, including the Prince and Princess of Wales, also attended events to commemorate the late Queen's legacy.</p>

          <p>The ticket marketplace StubHub has revealed plans for its initial public offering, aiming to raise up to $851 million with a target valuation as high as $9.2 billion. The company intends to sell over 34 million shares at a price range of $22 to $25 each and will trade on the New York Stock Exchange under the ticker "STUB." This long-awaited IPO follows previous postponements due to market volatility and comes amid a recent resurgence in public debuts. Despite reporting revenue growth, StubHub's net loss widened in the first quarter, presenting a mixed financial picture for potential investors (not investment advice).</p>

          <p>A new mural by the anonymous street artist Banksy has emerged on an external wall of the Royal Courts of Justice in London. The artwork depicts a judge in traditional attire striking a protester, with the artist confirming its authenticity via an Instagram post. The piece appeared shortly after mass arrests at a protest, leading to speculation about its political commentary on the right to protest and the legal system. Court officials have covered the mural and stated their intention to remove it to preserve the character of the historic listed building, while police are investigating the incident as potential criminal damage.</p>

The half marathon route runs through Newcastle and Gateshead along the River Tyne, which are rivals of Sunderland, particularly in football. The Great Run Company humorously acknowledged the geographical error, calling the items a unique keepsake and a celebration of the entire region.

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>A federal appeals court has rejected Donald Trump's attempt to overturn the $83.3 million verdict awarded to writer E. Jean Carroll for defamation. The court affirmed that the jury's damages were fair and reasonable, dismissing Trump's arguments of an excessive penalty and expanded presidential immunity. This lawsuit stemmed from Trump's repeated denials of Carroll's accusation that he sexually assaulted her in a department store in the 1990s. The ruling solidifies a major legal defeat for the former president in the long-running civil case, with Carroll's attorney looking forward to the conclusion of the appellate process.</p>

          <p>Radio host Howard Stern has clarified that he is still in contract negotiations with SiriusXM, following an on-air prank that led some listeners to believe he was leaving the platform. The stunt involved fellow host Andy Cohen temporarily taking over the show's time slot before Stern returned to reveal it was a hoax. Stern, whose current contract expires at the end of the year, reassured his audience that talks with the company are ongoing and proceeding as they normally do. This follows his last five-year deal, reportedly worth $500 million, which was signed in 2020.</p>

          <p>Following Angela Rayner's resignation, the UK Labour Party is holding a sped-up election for a new deputy leader, with former deputy Harriet Harman advocating for a woman from outside London to be chosen. The contest is seen as a battle for the party's future direction, with nominations opening this week and a winner to be announced on October 25. Candidates need the backing of 80 MPs to enter the race, a high threshold that some on the party's left fear will narrow the field.
