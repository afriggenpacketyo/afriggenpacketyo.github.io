          <h2>US to Provide Ukraine with Patriot Air Defense Systems Through NATO</h2>

        </div>
        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Former President Donald Trump announced that the United States will send Patriot air defense systems to NATO, which will then distribute them to Ukraine. The decision comes after Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky's urgent requests for at least ten systems to counter a recent surge in Russian missile and drone attacks. This move aims to bolster Ukraine's layered air defense capabilities, which are critical for protecting cities and infrastructure, though concerns remain about the pace of delivery. The Patriot system is considered one of the world's most advanced and effective, but its high cost has made allies hesitant to provide them.</p>

          <div class="timestamp">2025-07-11 08:38:05 EDT</div>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>IMAX is on track for a potential record-breaking $1.2 billion global box office year, capitalizing on a resurgent film industry and consumer demand for premium experiences. The company's success is driven by films shot with its specialized cameras, such as "F1: The Movie," which generate a significant portion of their revenue from IMAX screenings. CEO Rich Gelfond notes that post-pandemic, audiences are seeking more distinguished out-of-home entertainment, contributing to a 60% rise in IMAX's stock value over the past year. The company is also expanding its global footprint with more screens and a strong slate of upcoming blockbusters. (not investment advice)</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Bitcoin's price surged to a new record high of over $118,000, driven by a significant influx of capital into cryptocurrency exchange-traded funds (ETFs). On Thursday, Bitcoin ETFs saw their largest single-day inflow of 2025, totaling $1.18 billion, which also propelled Ether back above the $3,000 mark. The rally was further fueled by large-scale short liquidations and speculation about future Federal Reserve policies. This recent price action reflects growing institutional adoption and investor confidence in the digital asset market. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>EU Commissioner Marta Kos emphasized that the European Union's enlargement is fundamentally about ensuring peace, a principle that has regained prominence since Russia's full-scale invasion of Ukraine. In an interview, she highlighted Ukraine's remarkable progress in implementing reforms and negotiating accession despite the ongoing war. Kos stated that while the process remains merit-based, geopolitical realities have added urgency to integrating countries like Ukraine, Moldova, and those in the Western Balkans. The EU is also actively helping candidate countries combat foreign disinformation campaigns aimed at undermining their European aspirations.</p>

          <p>Texas is overhauling its "Thriving Texas Families" program after an investigation revealed that tens of millions in taxpayer funds were distributed with little oversight to anti-abortion organizations. The program, which promotes alternatives to abortion, will now require organizations to document all expenses and receive reimbursement only for state-approved services. Previously, a flat-rate payment system allowed some groups to bill for more than services cost, with some using the excess funds to purchase real estate. These changes aim to increase accountability for the program, which has grown to an annual budget of $100 million.</p>

          <p>Goldman Sachs is testing "Devin," an autonomous AI software engineer developed by the startup Cognition, marking a significant milestone for AI adoption on Wall Street. The bank plans to integrate the AI agent into its workforce of 12,000 human developers to handle tasks like updating internal code, with the potential to deploy hundreds of such agents. This move to "agentic AI," which can execute complex, multi-step jobs independently, could significantly boost productivity but also raises questions about the future of human jobs in the industry. The bank's tech chief envisions a "hybrid workforce" where humans supervise AI agents. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>Tesla is set to officially launch in India with the opening of an "Experience Center" showroom in Mumbai on July 15. This marks the electric vehicle giant's first official entry into the world's most populous country after years of consideration. The company will initially import vehicles, likely from its Shanghai and Berlin gigafactories, to sell directly to Indian customers. However, Tesla will face challenges, including high import duties of around 70% and competition from established players like China's BYD and local manufacturer Tata Motors. The Indian government has offered reduced tariffs for companies that commit to local manufacturing.</p>

          <p>Researchers in China have developed a robot designed to automate the process of cotton topping, a crucial step in improving crop yields. The machine, currently in pilot testing in Xinjiang, uses advanced lidar and machine vision to identify and vaporize the plant's terminal bud with a high-powered laser. This technology aims to increase efficiency and precision in a process that has traditionally been labor-intensive and prone to damaging plants. According to its developers at Xinjiang University, the robot achieves nearly 99% accuracy in bud detection with minimal damage to the cotton plants.</p>

Police believe her van became stuck in mud shortly after she was last seen on June 29, prompting a large-scale search. Authorities described her survival in the hostile environment, which has challenging terrain and dangerous wildlife, as a "remarkable story" and a "miracle."</p>

          <p>Astronomers have identified a new interstellar object, named 3I/Atlas, which could be the oldest comet ever seen, potentially predating our solar system by three billion years. It is only the third such object detected visiting our system from interstellar space. Researchers from Oxford University believe it originated in the Milky Way's "thick disk," a region of ancient stars. Based on its likely composition of water ice, scientists predict it may develop a glowing tail as it approaches the Sun later this year, possibly becoming visible with amateur telescopes.</p>

          <p>Iconiq Capital, the wealth management firm backed by tech billionaires like Mark Zuckerberg, is pioneering a new approach to philanthropy through collaborative funds called "co-labs." These funds pool capital from multiple wealthy families to make large, multiyear grants to nonprofits focused on specific causes like youth mental health or climate equity. The model aims to make giving more efficient and impactful, especially for busy founders who may lack the time to manage their own foundations. By fostering peer learning and directing funds quickly, Iconiq hopes to counter the trend of money sitting in donor-advised funds without being disbursed.</p>
