          <p>Japan's economy expanded by 0.3% in the second quarter of 2025, surpassing economists' expectations amid trade pressures from the United States. This growth was primarily driven by strong net exports, which contributed significantly to the GDP increase. Despite this positive quarterly performance, year-over-year growth slowed compared to the first quarter. The Bank of Japan has upgraded its fiscal year forecast but remains cautious about the impact of global trade policies on the nation's corporate profits. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>The city of Youngstown, Ohio, once a symbol of industrial decline after the collapse of the American steel industry, is undergoing a steady revitalization. Local entrepreneurs are repurposing old industrial buildings, such as abandoned factories, into new businesses like breweries and flea markets, injecting new life into the community. While the comeback is not dramatic, the city's population has stabilized and its unemployment rate has improved significantly. This gradual progress demonstrates a story of resilience and forging a new identity beyond its steel-producing past.</p>

          <p>During an appearance on the "New Heights" podcast, Taylor Swift shared a lighthearted story about proving to Jason Kelce's young daughters that cats are not "poisonous," a white lie he had told them. Swift explained that she successfully challenged this notion by introducing them to her docile Ragdoll cat, Benjamin Button, and now the children enjoy spending time with her pets. The conversation also hinted that Jason Kelce's family might be considering getting a "barn cat" of their own in the future.</p>

        </div>
        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>A recent CBS News/YouGov poll indicates that a significant majority of Americans, roughly two-thirds, believe that expectations for tipping have grown in recent years. Many respondents view this trend negatively, often seeing it as an additional cost rather than a way to show appreciation or compensate service workers. The sentiment appears linked to broader public concerns about rising prices and the cost of living. The survey suggests a cultural shift in tipping norms that is not being well-received by the public.</p>

          <p>The British government is collaborating with medical influencers on TikTok to raise awareness about the dangers of traveling abroad for cosmetic surgery. This campaign addresses growing concerns over UK citizens seeking cheaper procedures like hair implants and dental work overseas, which can lead to life-altering injuries. The influencers will advise their followers to consult with a UK doctor, purchase proper travel insurance, and avoid package deals that include surgery. The initiative aims to protect patients and reduce the burden on the NHS, which often has to correct botched procedures.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Four years after famously adopting an entirely plant-based menu, the three-Michelin-star restaurant Eleven Madison Park is reintroducing animal products. Chef Daniel Humm, who had previously championed the vegan menu as an ethical and creative imperative, cited a desire for inclusion and business realities for the reversal. He noted that the all-vegan concept was difficult for corporate event bookings and that wine sales had declined without traditional meat pairings. The decision reflects the broader challenges of high-end, plant-based dining in a market where consumer demand for luxury meat dishes remains strong.</p>

          <p>At 45 years old, tennis icon Venus Williams is set to make history as the oldest competitor in the U.S. Open singles tournament since 1981. Williams, a two-time U.S. Open champion, received a wild card invitation to participate in what will be her 25th appearance at the event. Despite a current low ranking due to recent injuries, her participation highlights her remarkable longevity in a demanding sport. This milestone follows her recent victory at the DC Open, where she became the oldest player to win a WTA singles match since 2004.</p>

          <p>CNBC's Jim Cramer advised investors not to exit the stock market, even if it appears "frothy" with speculative behavior. He contrasted the current environment with the dot-com bubble, arguing that today there are enough "rational" stories in strong companies like Amazon and Eli Lilly to balance out the "irrational" rallies in some recent IPOs and speculative stocks. Cramer suggested that while there is clear speculative excess, the underlying strength of major corporations provides a solid foundation, making it unwise to sell off well-founded positions.

          <p>Ford CEO Jim Farley has announced a major strategic shift to counter the threat from affordable, high-tech Chinese electric vehicles (EVs). The company is retooling its Louisville, Kentucky, factory to produce a new electric truck starting at $30,000, set for release in 2027. This initiative involves a complete redesign of the manufacturing process, inspired by Tesla, to use fewer parts and a more efficient "assembly tree" system. The move is a direct response to the existential threat Ford perceives from Chinese EV makers like Xiaomi and BYD.</p>

Ouattara scored nine goals in 37 appearances for Bournemouth last season. The move comes after Brentford's previous bid for another winger, Omari Hutchinson, was rejected by Ipswich.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>As economic growth slows and spending moderates in China's major metropolitan areas, smaller county-level cities and towns are becoming a crucial engine for consumption. Consumers in these lower-tier markets often face lighter economic burdens and have faster-growing incomes, leading to a greater willingness to spend on items like imported foods and electric vehicles. This "consumption upgrade" is seen by experts as a vital, yet previously untapped, source of growth for China's economy. The trend is supported by the country's extensive e-commerce networks, which make a wide range of goods accessible nationwide.</p>

          <p>A federal judge in Maryland has struck down two Trump administration actions that aimed to eliminate diversity, equity, and inclusion (DEI) programs at schools and universities. The ruling found that the Department of Education acted unlawfully when it threatened to cut federal funding for institutions with DEI initiatives. Judge Stephanie Gallagher, a Trump appointee, stated the administration's guidance initiated a "sea change" in regulation without following proper procedure. This decision is a significant victory for educational and civil rights groups that had challenged the anti-DEI measures in court.</p>

OpenAI has built a substantial enterprise sales team to capture this market, even as it faces intense competition and high operational costs.

Her lawyers filed a lawsuit arguing the action was illegal, as expedited removal is legally restricted to immigrants who have been in the country for less than two years. After a judge temporarily halted the deportation, the government agreed to move her to regular proceedings, which grant the right to a court hearing.
