          <p>Communities worldwide are celebrating Pride Month with parades and festivals, marking the ongoing struggle for LGBTQ+ rights and inclusion. These events trace their origins to the 1969 Stonewall Uprising in New York City, a pivotal moment that sparked the modern LGBTQ+ rights movement. From Washington, D.C., to Kathmandu, participants have gathered throughout June, wrapped in rainbow flags and carrying signs of protest and celebration. The article highlights the global nature of these commemorations, with major events like New York's annual march continuing the tradition.</p>

          <p>The Eastern Kentucky Remembrance Project (EKRP) is a community coalition dedicated to uncovering and memorializing the history of racial lynchings in the region. The group recently placed a historical marker for Fred Shannon, a Black musician who was lynched by a mob in 1924 after being falsely accused of murder. By collecting soil from lynching sites and erecting markers, the EKRP aims to confront a painful and often-ignored part of local history. The project's members, some with personal connections to the violence, see their work as a vital form of remembrance and reconciliation, especially amid current political attacks on teaching Black history.</p>

          <p>In an unusual business move, Trader Joe's has opened a new, larger store in Sherman Oaks, California, just across the street from one of its existing locations that has been operating since 1973. The original plan was to close the older, smaller store, but the company decided to keep both open due to tremendous business in the area. The new store offers more space, a wider product selection, and a more convenient underground parking garage, which has been a major draw for customers. While some shoppers have quickly embraced the new location, others remain loyal to the "cozy" feel of the original store.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>In a significant policy shift, Germany is planning a massive increase in defense spending with the goal of building the most powerful military in Europe. This historic move, spurred by a new Trump presidency and the war in Ukraine, involves a constitutional change to allow for increased borrowing for defense. The government plans to spend 3.5% of its GDP on its military, a dramatic increase for a country that has long been hesitant to expand its armed forces due to its history. The decision reflects a new sense of urgency among Germany's leaders to meet NATO commitments and respond to geopolitical threats. (not investment advice)</p>

          <h2>Opinion Piece Argues the True Spirit of Pride Lies in Progress and Diversity, Not Respectability</h2>

        </div>
        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>This opinion column argues against the "respectability politics" being promoted by some conservative gay figures, such as Richard Grenell, who seek to distance the LGBTQ+ community from its more flamboyant and gender-nonconforming members. The author asserts that the very foundation of the gay rights movement, from the Stonewall Riots to early political candidacies, was built by drag queens and gender-nonconforming individuals. The piece contends that trying to appeal to the mainstream by policing the community's diversity is a betrayal of its history and core values. It celebrates the movement's strength as a diverse, non-monolithic coalition.</p>

          <h2>Huntington Beach Voters Reject Conservative Proposals Targeting Public Libraries</h2>
          <div class="timestamp">2025-06-28 06:00:00 EDT</div>
        </div>
        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>In a significant local political development, voters in Huntington Beach, California, overwhelmingly passed two ballot measures to protect their public library system. The measures successfully defeated a conservative-led city council's initiatives, which included creating a parent review board to control children's book selections and considering the privatization of the libraries. This victory for library advocates in a city known for its strong MAGA-leaning politics is being seen as a grassroots rebuke of overreach. Organizers believe their nonpartisan message, focused on the common good of the library, resonated across the political spectrum.</p>

The event created a unique acoustic and visual experience as guests ambled through the serpentine space at sunset, with sounds from different ensembles blending and shifting. The performance was seen as a spectacular demonstration of the new building's potential as a versatile space for art and performance.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>This opinion piece reflects on President Trump's recent use of an expletive while publicly discussing the long-standing conflict between Israel and Iran. The author notes that while it may be the first time a president has deliberately used the F-word in such a public forum, the moment came across as authentic and reflected a frustration shared by many. The article suggests that in an era of scripted political spin, such moments of raw, unpolished language can paradoxically make a leader seem more human and trustworthy. It argues that judicious use of such language can be a powerful tool for communication.</p>

          <p>President Trump is navigating a momentous week, balancing major domestic policy pushes with significant foreign policy developments. At home, his "one big beautiful bill," a massive tax and spending package, faces a crucial test in the Senate. Abroad, his administration is managing the aftermath of U.S. strikes on Iran and a subsequent ceasefire, while also facing a deadline on numerous trade deals. The week was also marked by a favorable Supreme Court ruling that limits the power of lower courts to block his executive actions, capping a period of wins and unresolved challenges for his presidency.
