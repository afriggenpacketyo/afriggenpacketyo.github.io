          <p>In his debut with the Indianapolis Colts, quarterback Daniel Jones delivered a commanding performance, leading his team to a 33-8 victory against the Miami Dolphins. Jones completed 22 of 29 passes for 272 yards and a touchdown, and also scored two rushing touchdowns himself. The Colts' defense capitalized on two turnovers by the Dolphins, converting both into touchdowns and establishing a dominant 20-0 lead by halftime. This strong showing affirms coach Shane Steichen's decision to name Jones the starting quarterback over Anthony Richardson to begin the 2025 NFL season.</p>

          <p>England's manager, Thomas Tuchel, has expressed a desire for the national team to utilize long throw-ins and long-ball tactics more frequently ahead of the next World Cup. Despite England's successful qualifying campaign so far, Tuchel noted that these direct patterns of play are becoming prominent again and will be important at the tournament. He acknowledged the limited training time available during international breaks but emphasized that such tactical elements will be discussed and integrated. This strategic shift aims to add more versatility to England's attacking options for the global competition.</p>

          <p>Kevin Hassett, Director of the National Economic Council and a potential candidate for Federal Reserve Chair, stated that the central bank's monetary policy must remain "fully independent of political influence." His comments come amid President Trump's public pressure on the Fed to cut interest rates and his consideration of Hassett to replace current Chair Jerome Powell. Hassett warned that political control over central banks historically leads to inflation and economic misery. This statement reinforces the traditional view of central bank autonomy, even as the current administration challenges that norm. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>Aryna Sabalenka successfully defended her U.S. Open title, defeating Amanda Anisimova in a display of newfound emotional control and strategic maturity. The victory marks her fourth major title and underscores the lessons she learned from a difficult loss in the French Open final earlier in the season. Sabalenka reflected that her previous mindset was flawed, and she has since focused on managing her emotions and respecting her opponents' fight. This win solidifies her status as one of the most consistent top players, having reached the semifinal or better in 11 of the last 12 Grand Slam tournaments.</p>

          <p>The Oasis reunion tour, which played a sold-out show at the Rose Bowl, has become a major cultural event, notable for the powerful emotional connection it forges with the audience. The concert review highlights how the band's performance of classic hits like "Wonderwall" and "Champagne Supernova" created a cathartic, communal experience for tens of thousands of fans. While the Gallagher brothers sounded strong and engaged in some lighthearted stage banter, the show's core appeal was its focus on the shared act of singing along. This emphasis on the crowd's participation has positioned the tour as a significant real-world gathering.</p>

          <p>While Max Verstappen secured a dominant victory for Red Bull at the Italian Grand Prix, a controversy involving McLaren's team orders took center stage. Lando Norris finished second after the team instructed his teammate, Oscar Piastri, to let him pass, a decision that has sparked debate. The situation arose after a slow pit stop for Norris, caused by a team error, dropped him behind Piastri, who was then asked to relinquish the position to restore the pre-stop order. The incident highlights the delicate balance of intra-team competition and fairness as the two drivers battle for the championship.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>As the Powerball jackpot recently soared to nearly $1.8 billion, a new analysis shows significant disparities in lottery spending across the United States. Residents of Massachusetts spend the most on average, at $915 per year, followed by Rhode Island at $573. In contrast, North Dakotans spend the least, averaging just $50 annually, which may be partly due to less accessibility in rural areas. Lottery sales represent a notable source of state revenue, accounting for an average of 1% of a state's general funds and as much as 3% in some states. (not investment advice)</p>

Known as "God's influencer," Acutis was a devout Catholic who used his computer programming skills to create websites documenting miracles and spreading the faith online. The canonization ceremony, led by Pope Leo XIV in St. Peter's Square, recognized Acutis as a modern role model for young people. His body, dressed in jeans and sneakers, lies in a tomb in Assisi and has become a major pilgrimage site.</p>
