          <p>Charlotte Edwards and Nat Sciver-Brunt began their leadership roles with a clean sweep against the West Indies. While this victory provides a positive start, similar successes have occurred before, only to be followed by disappointments on the bigger stage. England has historically dominated home bilateral series but struggled in major tournaments. Tougher challenges lie ahead, including a series against India and the 50-over World Cup in India and Sri Lanka. The question remains whether this "new" England team can perform under pressure when it truly matters, or if this series win is just another false dawn.</p>

          <p>Despite the recent fallout between Donald Trump and Elon Musk, the "Department of Government Efficiency" (DOGE), which Musk led, continues its work. The team, comprised of members embedded in various government agencies, is focused on transforming government operations. According to one official, DOGE's approach is becoming "institutionalized," indicating a lasting impact. This suggests that even without Musk's direct involvement, the efforts to streamline and improve government efficiency are ongoing and potentially long-term.</p>

          <p>Amid ongoing parliamentary deadlock in France, politicians are turning to remembrance policy, addressing historical injustices through symbolic initiatives. Parliamentarians have adopted texts that reclassify historical events or offer reparations, including the posthumous promotion of Alfred Dreyfus and recognition for returnees from Indochina. A resolution addressing a "double debt" to Haiti has also been adopted, though it lacks concrete steps. While some view these initiatives as social maturity, others see them as easier to pass than structural reforms.</p>
