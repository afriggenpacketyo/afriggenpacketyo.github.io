          <p>Carly Simon has voiced her support for Sabrina Carpenter amidst criticism of Carpenter's album cover for "Man's Best Friend," which depicts Carpenter on her hands and knees with a man appearing to grab her hair. Simon argues that the cover is relatively tame compared to past instances of bold artistic expression in the music industry, citing The Rolling Stones' "Sticky Fingers" as a more sexually suggestive example. Carpenter has faced backlash for the cover, with some finding it uncomfortable or disgusting, while others defended her artistic freedom. Simon also referenced her own controversial 1975 album cover for "Playing Possum," where she posed in a lacy black dress on her knees, noting the reactions it garnered at the time, and this article is about the public's reaction to a controversial piece of art.</p>

          <p>The film "28 Years Later," a reboot of the zombie franchise, presents a story set nearly three decades after a viral pandemic isolated the British Isles. The plot centers on a community living on Lindisfarne, where a young boy named Spike embarks on a journey to find a medical practitioner for his sick mother. The movie blends philosophical moments with violence, creating a tonally complex experience, and the editing incorporates archival footage and poetry to emphasize themes of struggle and division. The film explores the idea that humanity's natural state is conflict, contrasting it with the idealism of modern society, and this movie explores the balance between good and evil.</p>

          <h2>Study Shows Plastic Bag Bans and Fees Effectively Reduce Litter</h2>
          <div class="timestamp">2025-06-19 15:57:03 EDT</div>
        </div>
        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>A new study published in the journal Science reveals that state and local policies regulating plastic bag use have significantly reduced plastic bag litter along U.S. shorelines. Researchers reviewed over 600 bag policies and 45,000 shoreline cleanups between 2017 and 2023, finding that areas with bag regulations saw a 25% to 47% decrease in plastic bag litter compared to unregulated areas. The study, which analyzed data from the Ocean Conservancy's global shoreline cleanup initiatives, indicates that fees on plastic bags are more effective than partial bans in limiting shoreline litter. The findings highlight the effectiveness of these policies in curbing plastic pollution and its threats to marine environments.</p>

Mojica, who maintained his innocence and claimed he was brutally attacked by law enforcement, was facing eight years in federal prison. The U.S. attorney's office also dismissed charges against a second protester arrested at the same time, and civil rights advocates had scrutinized the prosecutions, alleging misrepresentation of events and criminalization of free speech. Mojica expressed relief and stated that the truth prevailed, emphasizing the importance of fighting intimidation and standing up for one's rights.</p>

He noted that Hollywood productions were not sending messages that he could be himself in projects where he could see himself reflected in the roles.

          <p>President Donald Trump has extended the deadline for TikTok's sale in the US for an additional 90 days, marking the third such delay. The video-sharing app has faced scrutiny over national security concerns due to its Chinese parent company, ByteDance, and lawmakers have required the app to be banned unless sold. Trump, who previously vowed to save TikTok, signed an executive order delaying the enforcement of the law until September 17, and TikTok expressed gratitude for Trump's support and ongoing collaboration with Vice President Vance's Office. The extension allows for continued negotiations for the sale of TikTok in the US.</p>
