          <h2>Ruling Party Lawmakers Say No-Confidence Motion Against Ishiba Cabinet Unlikely</h2>

          <p>Yoshihiko Noda, head of Japan's main opposition party, has ruled out submitting a no-confidence motion against Prime Minister Shigeru Ishiba's Cabinet. This decision makes same-day elections for both chambers of parliament in July unlikely, as the ruling bloc led by Ishiba's Liberal Democratic Party does not hold a majority in the House of Representatives. Noda cited concerns over higher U.S. tariffs and rising tensions in the Middle East as reasons to avoid a political vacuum. The House of Councillors election is expected to be held on July 20, with Ishiba's government struggling to bridge differences with the United States over tariffs imposed by President Donald Trump. The opposition party would need support from others for a no-confidence motion to pass.</p>

The company anticipates the C929, similar in design to the Airbus A350 and Boeing 787, will be certified in China by 2032. The C929 will carry up to 440 passengers and have a maximum range of 12,000km, positioning it to compete on long-haul routes.</p>

          <p>The Democratic Republic of Congo and Rwanda are scheduled to sign a peace agreement on June 27, facilitated by the United States, aiming to end fighting in eastern Congo. The agreement, drafted by technical teams from both countries, includes provisions for respecting territorial integrity, prohibiting hostilities, and disarming non-state armed groups. US Secretary of State Marco Rubio will attend the signing ceremony, building on principles agreed upon in April. This deal seeks to attract Western investment to the mineral-rich region, but the commitment of the Congo River Alliance, including the M23 rebel group, remains uncertain, as previous ceasefires have been broken.</p>

          <p>Japanese Prime Minister Shigeru Ishiba faces a dilemma in balancing "Japan first" policies with U.S. President Donald Trump's tariff demands ahead of a critical national election. Ishiba aims to protect key sectors like autos while avoiding the perception of yielding to Trump's "America First" agenda. Negotiations have been ongoing since April, with Trump imposing tariffs on steel, aluminum, and autos, threatening further levies on Japanese imports. While Ishiba and Trump agreed to accelerate negotiations during a meeting in Canada, gaps remain, particularly over auto tariffs, complicating efforts to reach a mutually beneficial agreement.

          <p>Japan's policy to make high school tuition free, even for private institutions, is causing concern among educators who fear it will accelerate a shift away from public schools. While intended to ease financial burdens on households, the policy lacks adequate support for struggling public schools, potentially deepening inequalities. Public schools, which serve as safety nets for diverse student populations, face challenges like shrinking enrollment and budget shortfalls. Critics argue the government needs to provide more resources to public schools to compete with private institutions and maintain their vital role in the education system. (not investment advice)</p>

The team is still searching for a missing fragment bearing the artist's name, as the art reveals local plants such as mistletoe and a classical idea which incorporates a North West European twist.
