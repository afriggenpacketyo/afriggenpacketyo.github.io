          <p>Former U.S. President Joe Biden, 82, has been diagnosed with an aggressive form of prostate cancer after experiencing urinary symptoms. The cancer, characterized by a Gleason score of 9 with metastasis to the bone, is hormone-sensitive, which may allow for effective management. Biden and his family are currently reviewing treatment options with his physicians. The diagnosis came after doctors found a small nodule that required further evaluation, and the former president's office indicated that the cancer can likely be managed.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Rafal Trzaskowski, the liberal mayor of Warsaw, narrowly won the first round of Poland‚Äôs presidential election, according to exit polls. Trzaskowski, a member of Prime Minister Donald Tusk‚Äôs Civic Platform, secured 30.8 percent of the vote, slightly ahead of Karol Nowrocki, backed by the hard-right Law and Justice party, who received 29.1 percent. A runoff election is scheduled for June 1. The Polish presidency, while largely ceremonial, holds veto powers that can influence the government's agenda, making the election a crucial test for Tusk's efforts to reverse policies implemented by the previous administration.</p>

          <p>Exit polls indicate that Portugal's ruling Democratic Alliance (AD) is likely to win the most votes in the recent election, but will fall short of a majority. The AD is projected to secure between 29% to 34% of the vote, necessitating coalition deals with smaller parties to achieve a majority in the 230-seat parliament. The center-left Socialist party and the far-right Chega party are trailing closely behind. This marks the third election in as many years for Portugal, highlighting ongoing political instability, with issues such as housing and immigration dominating the campaign.</p>
