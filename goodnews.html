          <p>A coalition of countries planning a post-ceasefire stabilization mission in Ukraine has agreed to establish a headquarters in Paris. The decision was made during a meeting in Rome, which was attended for the first time by a U.S. delegation including President Trump's special envoy, Keith Kellogg. The multinational force aims to provide logistical support, training, and security for Ukraine's skies and the Black Sea after the war with Russia ends.

          <p>Three Merseyside Police officers have been honored for their courage in confronting knife attacker Axel Rudakubana during the tragic Southport stabbings last year. Sgt Gregory Gillespie, PC Luke Holden, and PCSO Timothy Parry were the first responders at the scene where Rudakubana murdered three young girls. Armed with only a baton and a Taser, they entered the building and successfully subdued the attacker, who was holding a large knife. The officers received their honors at the 2025 Police Federation bravery awards for their selfless actions.</p>

          <p>Tesla is experiencing continued sales growth in Norway, with a 54% year-on-year increase in June, defying a slump across much of Europe. This success is largely attributed to the popularity of its revamped Model Y, which meets Norwegian consumer demands for space, all-wheel drive, and value. The trend persists even as Tesla faces a backlash in other European markets, partly due to CEO Elon Musk's political activities. A recent survey showed many Norwegians disapprove of Musk's politics, but it has not significantly impacted the company's strong market share.</p>

          <p>In a significant environmental effort, China has demolished approximately 300 dams and closed hydropower stations along the Red River, a key tributary of the upper Yangtze.

For decades, the dense network of dams has blocked fish migration routes and drastically altered the river's ecosystem.

Driven by government subsidies and a fast-growing charging infrastructure, sales of new energy trucks are estimated to have surged 175% in the first half of the year. This boom, primarily in short-haul vehicles, has prompted analysts to revise down diesel demand forecasts and accelerate projections for when China's oil consumption will peak.
