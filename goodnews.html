Chinese observers highlight that solidifying ties with Latin America would be "unstoppable" if the U.S. continues its current policies. Infrastructure is likely to remain a key sector for Beijing's engagement, playing a crucial role in countering U.S. influence in the region. President Xi Jinping pitched China as "a good friend and partner" to Latin American and Caribbean nations, offering a US$9.2 billion credit line to support development.</p>
