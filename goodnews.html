          <p>House Republicans have released their tax plan, a key component of President Trump's economic agenda, aiming to make the 2017 Tax Cuts and Jobs Act (TCJA) permanent to prevent tax increases for millions of Americans. The legislation includes provisions such as an increased child tax credit, a higher threshold for estate tax liability, and a boosted deduction for qualified business income. However, the plan omits details on state and local tax deduction caps and a new millionaires‚Äô tax bracket, which remain points of contention within the party, with House Republicans holding a slim majority, they face challenges in passing the bill without Democratic support. The legislation is expected to advance through the Ways & Means Committee, marking significant progress for House GOP leaders after delays.</p>

          <p>India and Pakistan have agreed to a full and immediate ceasefire, mediated by the United States, following escalating tensions and cross-border fire. The agreement was announced by President Trump and confirmed by officials from both countries, marking a significant diplomatic achievement. Tensions had risen following an attack on Indian-controlled Kashmir, leading to retaliatory strikes and troop movements. The ceasefire aims to de-escalate the situation and prevent further civilian casualties, with both countries expressing a commitment to non-escalation, provided it is reciprocated.</p>

          <p>Kosmos 482, a Soviet-era spacecraft launched in 1972 with the intent of reaching Venus, has re-entered Earth's atmosphere after 53 years in orbit due to a rocket malfunction. The European Union Space Surveillance and Tracking confirmed the uncontrolled reentry, with the spacecraft likely landing in an unknown location. Experts had predicted that some parts of the half-ton spacecraft, built to withstand Venus's harsh conditions, might survive the descent. The event highlights the legacy of the Cold War space race and the challenges of managing space debris, with scientists emphasizing the low probability of debris harming anyone.</p>

          <p>Elliott Investment Management and Charles River Laboratories have entered into a cooperation agreement, appointing four new directors and initiating a strategic review to enhance shareholder value. Charles River, a leader in pre-clinical drug research and development, has faced challenges due to a post-pandemic pullback in research demand and uncertainty around animal testing. Elliott's involvement aims to address these issues, with potential strategies including evaluating the Manufacturing Solutions business, acquiring smaller competitors, or even exploring a sale of the entire company. Elliott, already the company's largest shareholder, believes that a strategic review process could unlock significant value for Charles River.</p>

          <p>The article argues that declining birth rates and family formation are becoming increasingly partisan issues, which poses a significant threat to societal well-being. The author challenges the notion that fewer people automatically benefit the environment and highlights the economic risks associated with aging and shrinking populations. She also notes that current pronatalist discussions are often dominated by right-wing perspectives, leading many liberals to dismiss the issue, and argues for a progressive approach to supporting family formation through policies like affordable housing and universal pre-K. The author emphasizes that addressing population decline is essential for ensuring a stable and prosperous future and should not be ceded to political extremes.</p>

          <p>A bone spear tip, dating back 80,000 years, has been discovered in Russia, indicating that Neanderthals, not modern humans, created this sophisticated hunting weapon. The discovery challenges previous assumptions about Neanderthal technological capabilities, suggesting they independently developed bone-working techniques. The spear tip, found in Mezmaiskaya Cave, shows evidence of successful use and craftsmanship, adding to a growing body of evidence that Neanderthals were more advanced than previously thought. The find supports the idea that Neanderthals had developed specific techniques for working with bone, using techniques that, until recently, had only been credited to our species.</p>

          <p>A family from Ohio found hope in a clinical trial testing an investigational gene therapy for LAD-1, a rare disorder that severely compromises the immune system. The Langenhop family had three children diagnosed with the disease, and they enrolled them in a clinical trial led by Dr. Donald Kohn at UCLA. The gene therapy involved extracting stem cells, correcting the genetic defect, and reintroducing the modified cells, resulting in improved immune function and a better quality of life for the children, with all nine patients producing healthy immune cells capable of fighting infections. The therapy is now under review with the Food and Drug Administration, with the Langenhops honored that their children could help create a medication that may be used to treat others.</p>

Swift's representatives stated she had no involvement in casting or creative decisions and never reviewed the film's edits. The legal dispute stems from accusations of sexual harassment and defamation, with Baldoni counter-suing Lively and Reynolds, claiming civil extortion and invasion of privacy.</p>

          <p>Chargers coach Jim Harbaugh is using a unique rookie minicamp approach, focusing on individual drills to evaluate talent and find hidden gems. Eschewing traditional 11-on-11 periods, Harbaugh aims to provide a fair way for rookies to compete and showcase their pure abilities, with the coaching staff teaching drills directly related to the Chargers' scheme. The system is designed to allow coaches to "mine for gold" and assess each player's capabilities without the influence of system knowledge. The minicamp provides opportunities for drafted and undrafted players alike to make a strong first impression, while the team experiments with offensive line configurations during organized team activities.</p>
