          <p>The article discusses the potential monthly income one could receive from a $400,000 fixed annuity purchased at age 65, noting that payments can range from approximately $2,246 to $2,590 depending on gender and payout options. Higher interest rates create a favorable environment for annuity buyers, potentially maximizing lifetime income. The article emphasizes that annuities offer guaranteed monthly income, providing financial security, but also come with trade-offs such as illiquidity and giving up potential for higher investment returns. Careful consideration of retirement strategy, health status, and liquidity needs is crucial before deciding to invest in an annuity. (not investment advice)</p>
