          <p>Overdose deaths in the United States decreased by nearly 30,000 last year, signaling progress in combating the drug crisis. The CDC credited Trump's declaration of a public health emergency in 2017 for the improvement. However, this data was released as the administration proposed cuts to federal health programs addressing the drug crisis. Experts express concern that these cuts could undermine the progress made, despite the fact that drug fatalities remain high with 80,391 deaths in 2024. Optimism score is 60.</p>

          <p>In honor of Asian American and Pacific Islander Heritage Month, this article looks back at how unfair representation in early Hollywood led to the creation of one of the first Chinese American film studios in the country. Frustrations with one-dimensional and demeaning characters led to the founding of the Great Wall Film Company in 1921. The streets of the city can look almost unrecognizable more than 100 years later, but researchers say I.S. 281 Joseph B. Cavallaro along Cropsey Avenue in Gravesend now stands on the site of the former studio. The studio eventually moved to Shanghai, producing around two dozen films in a decade.
