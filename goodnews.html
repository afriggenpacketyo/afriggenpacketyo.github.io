        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>A new bill supported by President Trump proposes to increase tax credits for semiconductor manufacturers from 25% to 35%, aiming to incentivize the construction of more fabrication plants in the United States. This legislation builds upon the 2022 CHIPS and Science Act, further encouraging companies like Intel and TSMC to onshore their advanced manufacturing operations. The bill reflects Washington's ongoing strategy to strengthen the domestic chip supply chain and reduce dependency on Asia, representing a continued focus on bolstering the nation's technology sector. The measure has passed the Senate and now awaits further action in the House. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>Liverpool has turned down a formal approach from German club Bayern Munich for their forward, Luis Diaz. Bayern's director of sport was informed that the Premier League club has no intention of selling the 28-year-old Colombian international and will not engage in discussions. This follows a similar rebuff to an approach from Barcelona earlier in the summer. Liverpool considers Diaz a key player, especially after he scored 22 goals for his club and country last season, and they remain adamant that he is not for sale at any price.</p>

          <p>Germany and the United Kingdom are reportedly finalizing a significant defense treaty that includes a mutual assistance clause, scheduled to be signed on July 17. The agreement stipulates that a strategic threat to one country will be considered a threat to the other, formalizing closer cooperation on security and defense matters. This pact underscores a broader European trend of strengthening intra-continental alliances, partly in response to concerns about the reliability of the U.S. security guarantee under President Donald Trump. The move signals a strategic shift towards greater European self-reliance in defense and security policy.</p>

          <p>The 14th Dalai Lama, Tenzin Gyatso, has announced that the centuries-old Tibetan Buddhist institution will continue after his death, ending years of speculation that he might be the final one.

The decision is politically significant for Tibetans who oppose Chinese rule and is expected to be contested by Beijing, which insists it has the sole authority to approve the next leader.

          <p>Spanish banking giant Santander has announced a ¬£2.65 billion deal to acquire British bank TSB from its current owner, Sabadell. If approved by shareholders and regulators, the takeover would create the UK's third-largest bank by personal current account share. Santander intends to fully integrate TSB into its UK group, which likely means the TSB brand name will disappear from the High Street, following the path of previous acquisitions like Abbey and Alliance & Leicester. The deal is expected to result in efficiency savings and will involve job cuts and branch closures where there is overlap. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>China's top leadership, led by President Xi Jinping, has explicitly targeted "disorderly low-price competition" as a problem that requires government regulation. The statement, made at a high-level economic meeting, marks a more direct characterization of the intense price wars affecting many Chinese industries. Beijing views this phenomenon as a threat to the economy because it harms innovation, reduces efficiency, and hinders industrial upgrading. The focus on this issue signals a potential policy shift to guide companies toward improving product quality rather than simply slashing prices to gain market share. (not investment advice)</p>
