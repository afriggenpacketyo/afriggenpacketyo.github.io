          <p>President Trump is pressuring Apple to manufacture iPhones in the United States or face tariffs, a challenge given the company's established supply chain in Asia. While Apple could theoretically produce iPhones in the U.S., experts say it would be expensive and difficult, potentially doubling prices due to higher labor costs and automation needs. The article notes that Apple has shifted some production to India to avoid tariffs and leverage the country's growing engineering talent, but remains heavily reliant on China for complex components and skilled labor.</p>

          <p>A record number of Americans applied for British citizenship and the right to live and work in Britain indefinitely in the first three months of this year, according to U.K. government data. Immigration lawyers attribute the surge to the political climate in the United States, with inquiries from Americans about relocating to Britain increasing after President Trump's reelection. The rise in applications is part of a broader trend, but the rate from the U.S. significantly outpaces the global increase.</p>
