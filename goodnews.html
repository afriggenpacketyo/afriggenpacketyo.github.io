        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>The European Court of Justice (ECJ) has outlawed Malta's "golden passport" program, the last of its kind in the EU, which offered citizenship to foreign investors. The court ruled that such programs reduce nationality to a "mere commercial transaction" and undermine the solidarity and mutual trust between member states. While Malta's Prime Minister defended the scheme, saying it had raised millions for charitable causes, he said the government would rework the system to align with the court's decision. Although purchased passports are now prohibited, "golden visas," which offer residence permits for investments, remain a point of concern, with Transparency International advocating for increased due diligence and background checks.</p>

The facility serves as the launch site for SpaceX's rocket program, under contract with the Department of Defense and NASA, aiming to send astronauts to the moon and Mars. While SpaceX has received local support for its investment, critics are concerned about Musk's increasing control over the area, including potential authority to close a popular beach and state park for launches.</p>

          <p>A recent survey in Japan reveals that nearly 30% of individuals in common-law relationships cite the country's surname law as a reason for not marrying. This law requires couples to adopt the same surname upon marriage, leading many to avoid legal marriage. The survey, conducted by Asuniwa, found that the rate is higher among people in their 20s, with over 60% of that group willing to marry if separate surnames were allowed. Common-law couples in Japan do not have access to the same benefits as legally married couples, such as tax deductions and inheritance rights.</p>

While the market expands, Starbucks' market share in China has declined significantly, from 34% in 2019 to 14% in 2024, as new entrants with innovative business models and flavors gain traction. The growth is concentrated in second-tier and "new first-tier" cities, indicating a shift in coffee culture beyond major metropolitan areas.</p>
