        </div>
        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>The D.C. city council has reached an amended stadium agreement with the Washington Commanders, moving forward despite President Trump's threats to block any deal unless the team reverts to its former name. Council chairman Phil Mendelson characterized the president's comments as an unhelpful distraction from the negotiations. The deal, which includes $950 million in revenue benefits for the district, aims to bring the NFL team back to a new stadium at the RFK site. The council is scheduled to vote on the proposal in August, which still faces challenges related to the transfer of the federal land.</p>

          <p>When automated systems at the U.S. Postal Service cannot read a handwritten address, the mail is not returned to sender but instead sent digitally to a specialized facility in Utah. The Remote Encoding Center in Salt Lake City employs hundreds of 'keyers' who work around the clock to decipher poor penmanship, processing images of about one billion pieces of mail annually. These data conversion operators can key in the correct address in seconds, ensuring the mail continues to its destination. This human intervention serves as a crucial final step in the mail delivery process.</p>

          <p>The 2026 North Carolina Senate race is taking shape, with Republican National Committee chairman Michael Whatley and former Democratic Governor Roy Cooper both expected to announce their candidacies. Sources indicate Whatley, who has received President Trump's endorsement, will declare his run in the coming days. Cooper is also anticipated to launch his bid next week for the seat being vacated by Republican Senator Thom Tillis. The contest is expected to be a major political battleground, drawing significant national attention as both parties vie for control of the coveted open seat.</p>

          <p>President Trump has signed an executive order aimed at creating new rules for the evolving landscape of college athletics, targeting what the White House calls an "out-of-control, rudderless system." The order seeks to ban third-party, pay-for-play payments while allowing brand endorsements and directing that any revenue-sharing plans do not harm non-revenue and women's sports. It also mandates that schools with high athletic revenues cannot reduce, and in some cases must increase, scholarship opportunities for sports other than football and basketball. The order directs federal agencies to develop an enforcement plan.</p>

          <p>The Roman Catholic Archdiocese of Los Angeles has launched a Family Assistance Program to deliver food, groceries, and medicine to parishioners who are afraid to leave their homes due to ongoing ICE enforcement raids.

The program, funded by donations, will leverage existing parish networks to support vulnerable families across its nearly 300 parishes. The initiative has already received significant contributions, including a $50,000 donation from businessman Rick Caruso.</p>

          <p>Four traders convicted of rigging the Libor inter-bank interest rate are now appealing to have their convictions overturned. Their move follows a landmark Supreme Court decision that quashed the convictions of two other traders, Tom Hayes and Carlo Palombo, who were prosecuted in the same scandal. The scandal, which emerged after the 2008 financial crisis, involved banks manipulating benchmark interest rates for profit. With the Supreme Court having set a new precedent, the four additional traders are seeking acquittal, arguing they were wrongly prosecuted for what they considered normal commercial practices.</p>

          <p>Prominent Democrats are already making strategic media appearances, signaling the unofficial start of the 2028 presidential primary. Figures like Rahm Emanuel, Pete Buttigieg, and Gavin Newsom are engaging with non-traditional and ideologically diverse outlets, a shift from typical Democratic campaign strategy. This new approach appears to be a course correction following the 2024 loss, with candidates adopting a more centrist tone and directly addressing controversial topics like gender identity. Analysts suggest this is an effort to reach new voters and avoid being perceived as too extreme by the general electorate.</p>

          <p>CNBC's Jim Cramer has asserted that major tech companies are not overspending on artificial intelligence, but are in fact "underspending." He argues that the race for AI dominance is a "winner-take-all" situation, and companies must invest heavily to secure a leading position. Citing Alphabet's strong quarterly earnings and increased capital expenditures for its cloud and AI services, Cramer believes the spending is justified. He suggests that the company that develops the most accurate AI chatbot could achieve a near-monopoly, similar to Google's dominance in search. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>As the U.S. moves to phase out artificial food colorings like Red Dye No. 3, technology and food science companies are racing to develop stable, vibrant, and natural alternatives. Firms like Fermentalg are using microalgae to create blue pigments, while others source colors from specially grown carrots and potatoes. The shift presents challenges, as natural colors can be more expensive and have a shorter shelf life than their synthetic counterparts. Major food giants, including Kellogg's and Nestlé, have pledged to reformulate their products to comply with the new health-focused regulations.</p>
