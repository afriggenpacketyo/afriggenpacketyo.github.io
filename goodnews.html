          <h2>Finding Daily Joy Through Simple, Intentional Acts</h2>
          <div class="timestamp">2025-07-25 16:49:00 EDT</div>
        </div>
        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>This article explores the concept of infusing everyday life with small, intentional moments of happiness, similar to those experienced on vacation. It suggests that rather than pursuing grand, intimidating goals, individuals can find more consistent contentment through simple rituals. The author shares personal examples, such as enjoying a mocktail and reading, and collects tips from colleagues, which range from tending to houseplants and journaling about gratitude to starting a daily poetry habit. These small acts are presented as an accessible way to improve overall mood and mental well-being, making regular life feel a bit more special.</p>

          <h2>Trump Considers Issuing Rebate Checks to Americans Funded by Tariff Revenue</h2>
          <div class="timestamp">2025-07-25 16:44:57 EDT</div>
        </div>
        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>President Trump announced that he is considering a plan to issue rebate checks to Americans, potentially funded by the significant revenue generated from his administration's new tariffs. He suggested the rebates could be targeted toward individuals below a certain income level, though specific details were not provided. The administration has collected around $100 billion in tariff revenue this year, which is paid by U.S. importers. While Trump also mentioned using the funds to pay down the national debt, the proposal for direct payments echoes previous pandemic-era stimulus checks and would likely require new legislation from Congress to authorize them.

          <p>Several notable restaurants are opening or reopening across Los Angeles, adding to the city's diverse food landscape. In Silver Lake, the popular poke shop Ohana Superette has returned after a five-year absence, offering traditional Hawaiian-style poke bowls in its own dedicated space. Chinatown's Filipino restaurant, Lasita, has launched a weekend daytime cafe called Kapé, serving specialty coffee and pastries. Additionally, the Sogo Roll Bar has expanded with a second location in Highland Park, and the acclaimed sandwich shop Bread Head has opened a new branch in Manhattan Beach. These openings highlight a period of vibrant growth and culinary innovation in the area.</p>

          <p>Following recent flooding in Texas, the veteran-led disaster response organization Team Rubicon has been instrumental in the recovery efforts. More than 60 volunteers from the nonprofit were among the first responders on the ground, providing crucial assistance to affected communities. Their work has focused on clearing large amounts of debris and mucking out homes that were severely damaged by the floodwaters. By leveraging the skills and experience of military veterans, Team Rubicon offers rapid and effective aid in the immediate aftermath of natural disasters, helping residents begin the difficult process of rebuilding their homes and lives in the affected region.</p>

          <p>Data analytics firm Palantir has achieved a significant financial milestone, with its market capitalization surging to $375 billion, making it one of the 20 most valuable companies in the United States. The company's stock has more than doubled in 2025, driven by strong investor confidence in its artificial intelligence capabilities and its expanding contracts with the U.S. government. In its most recent quarter, Palantir reported a 45% increase in revenue from its government business. This rapid growth has pushed its valuation ahead of established giants like Home Depot and Bank of America, though it trades at a very high forward earnings multiple. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>Tesla is planning to begin testing its robotaxi service in the San Francisco Bay Area, potentially launching an invite-only program as soon as this weekend, according to an internal memo. This move would place Tesla in direct competition with established players like Waymo and Zoox in a key market for autonomous vehicles. The expansion comes as CEO Elon Musk increasingly focuses on self-driving technology and robotics to shape the company's future amid declining electric vehicle sales. The robotaxis, which are currently being tested in Austin with human co-pilots, face a competitive landscape and ongoing scrutiny from regulators over the safety and marketing of Tesla's self-driving features.</p>

          <p>The Trump administration is releasing more than $5 billion in federal grant funding to states that had been withheld for review, a decision that had left many school districts in a difficult position ahead of the new school year. The grants support a wide variety of programs, including professional development for teachers, services for English language learners, and adult education. The initial freeze of the funds, which had been previously approved and appropriated, drew bipartisan criticism and legal challenges from several states. Following intense lobbying, the Office of Management and Budget directed the Department of Education to disperse the funds to states starting next week.</p>

          <h2>Opinion Piece Argues Public Laughter at Infidelity is a Sign of Healthy Social Norms</h2>

          <p>This opinion article defends the widespread public humor surrounding the viral "kiss-cam" video of a CEO and his HR head, who were not married to each other, at a Coldplay concert. The author argues that rather than being a sign of a cruel "participatory sport" of public shaming, the laughter is a healthy societal reaction. It reflects that society still takes marriage vows seriously and recognizes the relatable, flawed aspects of human nature. The piece draws a parallel to George Orwell's analysis of crude postcards, suggesting that such lowbrow humor reinforces basic moral standards, making the incident's ridicule a positive social sign.</p>

          <p>English cricketer Joe Root has surpassed Ricky Ponting to become the second-highest run-scorer in the history of Test cricket, now trailing only India's Sachin Tendulkar. During a flawless century against India at Old Trafford, Root methodically climbed the rankings, moving past both Rahul Dravid and Jacques Kallis before overtaking the Australian legend. At 34 years old and in excellent form, Root is now within striking distance of Tendulkar's record of 15,921 runs, a feat once considered unbreakable. The article analyzes his current scoring rate and England's future schedule, speculating that he could potentially claim the top spot within the next few years.</p>
