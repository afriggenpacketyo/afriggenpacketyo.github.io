          <p>The Supreme Court has granted the Trump administration's emergency request to allow the president to fire members of independent agency boards, specifically those heading the National Labor Relations Board and the Merit Systems Protection Board. The vote was 6-3, with the court's liberal justices dissenting. This decision marks a notable shift in the balance of power between the executive branch and independent agencies, potentially allowing for greater presidential control over these entities.</p>

          <p>In this New York Times article, David Brooks challenges the populist narrative that America's economic woes stem from neoliberal globalization policies implemented in the 1990s and early 2000s. Brooks argues that this narrative is historically inaccurate, pointing out that top marginal tax rates were higher in 2016 than in 1992, and federal spending on social programs increased. He contends that the decline in manufacturing jobs primarily resulted from increased productivity, not globalization, and that the so-called era of neoliberal globalism has actually produced significant economic growth in America.</p>

          <p>A new observational study suggests that GLP-1 agonists, popular weight loss drugs like Ozempic and Wegovy, may modestly reduce the risk of obesity-related cancers, particularly colorectal cancer. The study compared GLP-1s to dipeptidyl peptidase-4 (DDP-4) inhibitors, another type of diabetes medication without the same weight loss effect. Researchers found that patients taking GLP-1 receptor agonists had a 7% lower risk of developing an obesity-related cancer and an 8% lower risk of death from any cause, particularly among women.</p>

It also mandates companies to provide prior written notice of the use, sale, or lease of genetic information during bankruptcy, and requires the deletion of any genetic information not subject to a sale or lease.</p>

          <p>This article from The Atlantic emphasizes the importance of defending academic freedom, even when the ideas in question are wrongheaded or harmful. Referencing Joseph Alsop's 1953 defense of academic freedom during the McCarthy era, the article argues that freedom of thought necessarily means the freedom to think bad thoughts as well as good. It notes the relevance of this principle today, as the Trump administration cancels visas of foreign students for viewpoints it deems ‚Äúbad‚Äù and as institutions of higher education investigate and discipline members of their communities for expressing views that run afoul of various progressive social-justice orthodoxies.</p>

          <div class="timestamp">2025-05-22 16:12:26 EDT</div>
