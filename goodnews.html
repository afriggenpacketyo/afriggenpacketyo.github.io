          <p>One year after the largest dam removal project in U.S. history on the Klamath River, the ecosystem is showing remarkable signs of recovery, with salmon returning to headwaters for the first time in a century. A group of 28 Indigenous teenagers celebrated this milestone by becoming the first to kayak the river's full 310-mile length in over 100 years. This journey, part of the "Paddle Tribal Waters" program, not only reconnected the youth with their heritage but also inspired other Indigenous-led river conservation movements worldwide. The project serves as a powerful example of successful environmental restoration and collective action.</p>

          <p>Located near the White House, The Octagon is one of Washington D.C.'s oldest homes, completed in 1801 for the prominent Tayloe family. The building temporarily housed President James Madison and First Lady Dolley Madison after the White House was burned by the British in 1814; it was here that Madison signed the Treaty of Ghent, ending the War of 1812. The house, which gets its name from its octagonal entrance room, has a storied past that includes serving as a school and tenement housing. It is also known for reports of paranormal activity, with tales of unexplained events and a supposed visit from Jackie Kennedy Onassis before she became first lady.</p>

          <p>U.S. Customs and Border Protection (CBP) specialists at the Port of San Luis, Arizona, have made the first-ever interception of the Osbornellus salsus leafhopper in the United States. The insect was discovered during a routine inspection of a radicchio shipment from Mexico. Leafhoppers are known to pose a significant risk to agriculture, as they feed on plant sap and can transmit diseases. The contaminated shipment was immediately contained and returned to Mexico, preventing a potential infestation and highlighting the role of agricultural inspections in protecting the nation's crops from invasive species.</p>

          <p>Australia secured a decisive 26-6 victory over England in the first Rugby League Ashes match since 2003, held at Wembley. The Kangaroos demonstrated superior quality, particularly in the second half, extending their long-standing dominance in the rivalry. A standout performance from full-back Reece Walsh, who scored the opening try, highlighted the skill gap between the two sides. Despite a consolation try from England's Daryl Clark, the hosts were unable to overcome Australia's well-oiled machine. The series will continue in Liverpool, where England faces the challenge of winning its first Ashes series in 55 years.</p>

          <p>Catherine Connolly, a left-wing independent lawmaker, is set to become the next president of Ireland after her main rival, Heather Humphreys of the Fine Gael party, conceded defeat. While vote counting was still ongoing, polls had consistently shown strong support for Connolly for the largely ceremonial role. Connolly, a former barrister known for her criticism of Israel's actions in Gaza, gained the backing of several left-leaning parties, including Sinn Féin. She will succeed Michael D. Higgins, who served the maximum two seven-year terms, becoming Ireland's 10th president and the third woman to hold the office.</p>

          <div class="timestamp">2025-10-25 11:00:01 EDT</div>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>The popular investment strategy of passively buying S&P 500 index ETFs, like Vanguard's VOO, is facing scrutiny from some financial experts who argue it no longer offers sufficient diversification. With the technology sector now comprising a record 35% of the index, defensive sectors such as energy and healthcare are at an all-time low weight. As a result, some investors are looking toward small-cap stocks for broader market exposure, evidenced by the Russell 2000 index recently hitting an all-time high and outperforming the S&P 500 over the past six months.

          <p>Scientists at China's Northwestern Polytechnical University have created a bionic jellyfish robot designed for stealthy underwater operations. Described as an "underwater phantom," the small, lightweight drone is made from a transparent hydrogel material that closely mimics a real jellyfish. Its design allows for near-silent operation and low power consumption, making it ideal for covert monitoring, inspecting underwater structures, and observing fragile marine ecosystems without causing disruption. The development showcases China's advancements in bionic and drone technology for both scientific and potentially military purposes.</p>

Other key strategies include explaining the reasoning behind rules, offering choices to give children a sense of control, and maintaining consistency.
