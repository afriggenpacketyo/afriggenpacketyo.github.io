          <p>President Trump met with Senate Republicans to garner support for the "One Big Beautiful Bill Act," a legislative package advancing his agenda, with the Senate Finance Committee playing a key role in shaping the tax policy components, including the extension of the 2017 tax cuts. The House-passed version includes increased spending for the military and border security, alongside cuts to Medicaid and SNAP, potentially adding $2.4 trillion to the deficit over the next decade, according to the Congressional Budget Office. While some Republicans express concerns, Senate Majority Leader John Thune aims to pass the bill, coordinating closely with Trump, who faces criticism from Elon Musk, adding complexity to the bill's passage. The President's direct involvement seeks to sway hesitant senators amidst internal and external pressures. Optimism remains for passage despite challenges, but the final form of the bill is uncertain. </p>

          <p>Egypt's Foreign Minister assured Greece that Egypt will safeguard the spiritual and religious significance of Saint Catherine's Monastery, a part of the Greek Orthodox Church, amidst a land dispute. The assurance came after an Egyptian court ruling raised concerns among Orthodox Christian leaders about the monastery's fate, but the Egyptian Foreign Ministry clarified that the ruling affirms the monks' right to use the monastery and its religious sites. The monastery, established in the sixth century at the base of Mount Sinai, is the world's oldest continually inhabited Christian monastery, holding immense religious and historical importance. Both Egypt and Greece have agreed to collaborate to protect the monastery's rights and legal status, ensuring its continued value as a place of Greek Orthodox worship. </p>

          <p>Education Secretary Linda McMahon has expressed a desire for Harvard University to resume negotiations with the Trump administration amid ongoing disputes over alleged discrimination, including DEI and antisemitic activity. Despite Harvard's lawsuit against the administration, McMahon stated that the school has complied with some demands to end discrimination and has taken steps to address antisemitism. The conflict stems from the administration's joint task force on antisemitism, which froze over $2 billion in federal funding from Harvard. McMahon emphasized that antisemitism is a civil rights violation, and the administration aims to provide a safe environment for Jewish students on campus. </p>
