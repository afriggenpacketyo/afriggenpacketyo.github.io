          <p>Elon Musk refuted a New York Times report alleging frequent ketamine use during the 2024 campaign, calling it false reporting and referencing the Times' past Russiagate coverage. This denial followed the Times' report citing unnamed sources claiming Musk used ketamine as often as once a day, affecting his bladder, and also used ecstasy and magic mushrooms at times. Musk stated he tried prescription ketamine a few years ago but hasn't taken it since. The article also details Musk's role in the Trump administration as overseer of the Department of Government Efficiency, or DOGE, where he aimed to cut federal spending, but also notes some errors in DOGE's calculations and criticisms of his approach. (not investment advice) The author's tone is neutral, providing a factual account of the events and statements. </p>

          <p>Approximately 14 million bees escaped after a commercial truck carrying them overturned in Whatcom County, Washington. The incident prompted authorities to close the road and advise the public to avoid the area, especially those allergic to bee stings. Beekeepers worked to recover the hives and save as many bees as possible, with the goal of re-hiving them and reuniting them with their queen. The road was closed for about 24 hours during the rescue operation, and officials corrected the initial estimate of 250 million bees escaping, citing a beekeeper's assistance in providing a more accurate count.</p>

This incident follows a similar injury to Freddie Freeman, who missed games after slipping in the shower. Betts is currently having a relatively down year, batting .254 with eight home runs and 31 RBIs, while Freeman noted the team had overcome injuries in the past and hoped to do so again.</p>
