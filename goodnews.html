          <p>China is currently drafting its 15th five-year plan, a crucial blueprint that will guide the nation's development for the next half-decade. This plan is expected to inform high-level policy priorities and shape the evolution of infrastructure spending and investment. While past projects, like the 2009 stimulus, spurred growth, some also contributed to local government debt. Economists anticipate future infrastructure investments will be more technology-driven and people-focused, aiming for sustainable growth.</p>

          <p>China has launched a commercial underwater data center in Hainan, aiming to boost its digital services and attract foreign investment. However, this article suggests China faces significant challenges in achieving global AI leadership due to rapid data center expansion in the UAE and the US. The Trump administration has facilitated multi-billion dollar chip supply deals with the UAE, fostering a robust US-tech-driven data ecosystem. The US also benefits from greater corporate investment and government support for semiconductor companies, accelerating data center production and potentially hindering China's near-term leadership bid.

          <p>Nottingham Forest is reportedly considering Sean Dyche as a potential replacement for head coach Ange Postecoglou, whose future at the club is increasingly uncertain. Postecoglou's reign has seen a seven-match winless start, with last Sunday's 2-0 loss to Newcastle further jeopardizing his position. Dyche, known for his work at Burnley and Everton, is a well-placed candidate, should Forest decide to part ways with the Australian manager. The club is currently struggling in the Premier League.</p>

          <p>Steven Gerrard has rejected the chance to return for a second managerial stint at Rangers, citing timing as the reason for his decision. The former Liverpool captain held talks with the Scottish Premiership club after Russell Martin's dismissal but withdrew from the process. Gerrard, who led Rangers to a Scottish title in 2021, has recently expressed a desire to return to management after less successful spells elsewhere. The club's hierarchy continues its search for a new head coach to revitalize the team, which currently sits eighth in the league.</p>

          <p>Southern California is anticipating an early season storm next week, with widespread and beneficial rainfall expected to peak on Tuesday. The National Weather Service predicts 0.5 to 1.5 inches of rain for Los Angeles and Ventura counties, with higher amounts in mountainous areas. While minor road flooding is possible, significant flooding is not anticipated, though burn scar areas face some flash flood risk. This unusually deep low-pressure system will also bring strong winds and a significant drop in temperatures, but is unlikely to end wildfire season.</p>

          <p>Rabin Medical Center in Israel is meticulously preparing to receive the 20 hostages expected to be released from Gaza, developing a new field termed "captivity medicine." Head nurse Dr. Michal Steinman emphasizes the need for medical teams to act as "medical detectives" to understand the long-term effects of captivity, which can manifest weeks later. The hospital has created a hotel-like environment with private rooms, soft furnishings, and dedicated spaces for families, prioritizing space and time for the hostages' physical and psychological recuperation. This approach reflects lessons learned from previous hostage releases.</p>
