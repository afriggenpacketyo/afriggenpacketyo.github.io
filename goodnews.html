        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Experts suggest homeowners should carefully consider several factors before borrowing against their home equity in June, particularly in the current high-interest rate environment. Key considerations include ensuring affordability, having a clear purpose for the funds (such as home improvements or debt consolidation), choosing the right home equity option (loan vs. HELOC), limiting financial risk by borrowing conservatively, and confirming stable income. Experts caution against using home equity for non-essential expenses like vacations and highlight the importance of understanding the terms and potential risks of home equity products. Home equity loans and HELOCs are tied to your home, and the lender could foreclose if you fall behind on payments (not investment advice).</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>According to new research from Vanguard, having at least $2,000 in an emergency savings account is the top predictor of financial well-being, surpassing the impact of higher income or assets. The survey of over 12,000 Vanguard investors revealed that $2,000 in savings increased financial well-being by 21%, compared to 12% for a $500,000 income and 18% for $1 million in assets. This finding highlights the importance of preparedness for unexpected expenses, with the median cost of an emergency being around $2,000. Having readily available cash provides confidence and reduces financial anxiety, as those with emergency savings spend less time worrying about their finances (not investment advice).</p>

          <p>CNBC is recommending "Hope for Cynics" by Stanford psychology professor Jamil Zaki as the top business book to read in June. The book explores whether it is foolish to believe that people remain fundamentally decent and argues that a more optimistic view is supported by science and leads to better outcomes. Zaki suggests that a mindset shift towards "hopeful skepticism" can be learned by anyone. The book challenges the notion that success requires cynicism, highlighting that cynics tend to be unhealthier, unhappier, poorer, and more often wrong.</p>

          <p>Shares of Abercrombie & Fitch experienced a 25% surge despite the retailer slashing its profit outlook due to tariffs, which are expected to impact its business by $50 million.

However, Abercrombie's first-quarter results exceeded Wall Street's expectations, with record sales and revenue growth, particularly driven by the Hollister brand. While the Abercrombie brand experienced a sales decline, the company raised its full-year sales guidance, anticipating continued growth.</p>

          <p>Harvard University has reached a settlement in a six-year legal battle with Tamara Lanier, who claimed that two 175-year-old daguerreotypes of enslaved people were of her ancestors.

Lanier sued Harvard in 2019, arguing that the school was profiting from the images, which were used to promote racist theories.
