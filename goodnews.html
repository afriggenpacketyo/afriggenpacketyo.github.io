          <p>The "Bitcoin Family," known for selling all possessions in 2017 to invest in Bitcoin, has revamped their security measures following increased kidnapping threats targeting cryptocurrency executives. Didi Taihuttu, the family's patriarch, implemented a hybrid analog-digital system, encrypting and splitting seed phrases, storing them through blockchain encryption or physically hiding them across four continents. This overhaul comes after a series of high-profile kidnappings targeting crypto holders, highlighting the growing need for enhanced security in the cryptocurrency world. The family no longer uses hardware wallets, opting instead for decentralized storage to mitigate risks. The family has shifted to a fully decentralized system, decentralizing not just their finances but their personal risk profile.</p>

        </div>
        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Warner Bros. Discovery will divide into two publicly traded companies, with one focusing on cable networks like CNN and TNT Sports, and the other on streaming and studios, including HBO Max and Warner Bros. Television. CEO David Zaslav will lead Streaming & Studios, while CFO Gunnar Wiedenfels will head Global Networks; the split is expected by mid-2026. The move aims to allow each company to pursue investment opportunities and drive shareholder value, effectively reversing the 2022 merger. Analysts question whether the restructuring will succeed in driving growth amidst the shift to streaming and shrinking broadcast viewership, as legacy networks face poor growth prospects. The market is mixed on whether this split will be beneficial to the company as a whole.</p>

          <p>Former Reform UK chairman Zia Yusuf dismissed a controversy over a social media post criticizing an MP's call for a burka ban as a "storm in a teacup." Yusuf, who initially resigned after criticizing MP Sarah Pochin, returned to the party in a different role, leading the Doge unit, which is inspired by President Donald Trump and Elon Musk's Department of Government Efficiency. Yusuf expressed regret over his post, attributing it to exhaustion, and clarified his views on banning face coverings in public. The incident began when Pochin questioned Prime Minister Starmer about banning the burka, leading to Yusuf's critical response and subsequent resignation before his return to the party. The event shows a divide within the party.</p>

          <p>Glastonbury Festival has reduced its ticket sales by a few thousand to alleviate overcrowding, according to organizer Emily Eavis. The festival, set to take place in Somerset, will not utilize its full 210,000 capacity this year, as Eavis hopes to improve the dynamics on site during peak times. Additional space has been created at the Other Stage, and the Shangri-La nightlife area has been expanded with newly acquired land. Eavis emphasized the importance of communicating alternative routes to festival-goers to ease congestion, noting changes in crowd movement since the COVID-19 pandemic. The festival is still expected to be a success.</p>

          <p>Chipotle Mexican Grill is launching Adobo Ranch, a new dipping sauce, on June 17, aiming to boost sales after a sluggish start to the year. The adobo-flavored ranch is the first new dip since the 2020 release of queso blanco, and it will cost an extra 75 cents. The launch comes as Chipotle seeks to rebound from its first same-store sales decline since 2020, attributed to consumer concerns about the economy. The company hopes the new dip will attract cautious diners back to its restaurants, adding a spicier twist to the popular condiment. The addition of the ranch is not guaranteed to improve sales, but the company hopes that it will.</p>

          <p>A woman on Reddit shared her frustration with being the sole cook in her household, leading to criticism from her husband for not preparing "fancier" meals. She described a system of repeating 10 dishes to ease her mental load, which her husband challenged, wanting more variety and meat dishes. However, when she attempted to buy new ingredients, her husband protested due to the cost, leaving her with limited options. Commenters online largely supported the woman, suggesting she stop cooking for her husband altogether, highlighting the imbalance of responsibility and lack of support.

          <p>Las Vegas is implementing a strategy to combat rising temperatures by increasing the number of trees, particularly in urban heat island neighborhoods. The city, county, and nonprofits are collaborating to plant more trees, aiming to lower temperatures by at least 10 degrees in affected areas. Research indicates that lower-income neighborhoods are disproportionately affected by heat due to older homes and a lack of tree canopy. The Southern Nevada Heat Resilience Lab studies the impact of heat on communities and recommends data-driven solutions, including planting drought-tolerant trees to provide shade and cooling. There is some optimism in the program due to the success of the program.</p>
