          <p>BYD and other Chinese electric vehicle (EV) manufacturers are entering the European market, posing a challenge to established automakers like Volkswagen and Renault. BYD's Dolphin Surf compact hatchback, priced competitively, is seen as a potential disruptor in the small car segment. Experts believe that the arrival of Chinese EVs offers European consumers more choices, but it also presents a wake-up call for European manufacturers struggling to produce competitive small cars. This development marks a significant shift in the global automotive landscape, with Chinese companies gaining a stronger foothold in the European market. The analysis is based on the market conditions and the implications for both consumers and manufacturers.</p>

        </div>
        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>During Indira Gandhi's Emergency in the mid-1970s, India considered adopting a presidential system to centralize power. Historian Srinath Raghavan's book reveals how Gandhi's government reimagined India as a centralized state, with proposals for a directly elected president and a curtailed judiciary. While the idea never fully materialized, it influenced the Forty-second Amendment Act, which expanded Parliament's powers and limited judicial review. This period reflects a significant moment in India's political history, where the country flirted with authoritarianism. The assessment is based on the historical context and the lasting impact of the Emergency.</p>
