          <p>In an effort to address both its declining birth rate and the need to expand its scientific talent pool, Shanghai has launched a new subsidy program. The initiative provides a one-time research grant of 50,000 yuan (US$7,010) to female researchers under 40 who are returning to work after having a child. Initially rolling out at the Shanghai branch of the Chinese Academy of Sciences, the program aims to ease the transition back into demanding research careers for new mothers. While the initial scope is limited, some academics view it as a significant and positive step toward supporting women in science and technology fields.</p>

        </div>
        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>The California legislature has passed a bill that would prohibit most law enforcement officers, including federal agents, from wearing masks that obscure their identities while on duty. The measure was proposed in response to recent immigration raids where federal agents covered their faces, causing public fear and confusion. Proponents argue the ban is necessary for transparency and accountability, especially after a Supreme Court ruling allowed raids targeting migrants based on race or language. Opponents, including law enforcement agencies, contend that face coverings are essential for protecting officers from harassment and ensuring their safety. The bill now awaits Governor Gavin Newsom's signature.</p>

Despite organizers moving start times earlier, temperatures still climbed to 30°C with over 90% humidity, which one competitor described as "absolutely brutal." The host nation celebrated an early victory as Hayato Katsuki secured a bronze medal in the men's 35km race walk, marking a poignant moment for local fans who were unable to attend the 2020 Olympics due to pandemic restrictions. The event marks a full-circle return of major athletics to the city, with nearly 500,000 tickets sold for the nine-day competition.</p>

Although Mater Dei staged a dramatic comeback to briefly take the lead in the third quarter, Centennial rallied in the fourth to secure the historic win.

          <p>Michele Kang, the owner of the London City Lionesses, is making significant waves in women's football with her hands-on approach and multi-club ownership model, which also includes Washington Spirit and Lyon. In an interview, she detailed her philosophy of investing heavily in infrastructure, female-specific research, and top-tier talent to elevate the sport. Kang argues that her model is a necessity for growth in women's football, as it creates the scale needed to build commercial resources that are not yet on par with the men's game. Since her acquisition, the club has been promoted to the Women's Super League and attracted high-profile international players.</p>
