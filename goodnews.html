          <p>A 78-year-old retired education professor, who has authored over 175 books, attributes his sharp memory to five daily practices. He emphasizes regular social interaction, lifelong learning by reading outside his expertise, and maintaining a personal organizational system. Additionally, he stresses the importance of daily physical activity, such as swimming and walking, to increase blood flow to the brain. A healthy diet, adequate hydration, and at least seven hours of sleep each night complete his regimen for cognitive health.</p>

          <p>Jamie, Ewan, and Lachlan Maclean, three brothers from Scotland, have set a new world record by rowing unsupported across the Pacific Ocean in 139 days. They completed the 9,000-mile journey from Peru to Australia, becoming the first team to row the full distance non-stop. The trio overcame severe weather and personal challenges, including one brother being swept overboard, while raising over £700,000 for clean water projects. Their journey broke the previous record of 160 days set by a solo rower in 2014.</p>

          <p>The tradition of a single wedding dress is evolving, with many modern brides now buying multiple outfits for a series of events spanning months. Influenced by social media and increasingly extravagant wedding seasons, brides are purchasing an average of 12 looks for occasions like bachelorette parties, bridal showers, and rehearsal dinners. This trend has prompted retailers like David's Bridal to create dedicated collections of "Little White Dresses" and accessories. Some brides spend thousands of dollars to ensure a unique look for every photographed moment, reflecting a broader shift towards more elaborate and prolonged wedding celebrations.</p>

          <p>As Saudi Crown Prince Mohammed bin Salman (MBS) marks ten years in power, his leadership has brought profound changes to the kingdom, fundamentally rewiring its society and economy. Key reforms include significantly advancing women's rights, such as allowing them to drive and increasing their workforce participation to 36%, and sidelining the religious police to open up social spaces. Economically, his Vision 2030 plan aims to diversify away from oil through massive investments in technology and mega-projects like NEOM. While these rapid changes have been accompanied by tight political control and suppression of dissent, they represent a historic transformation of the conservative nation.</p>

          <p>Despite recent shifts in American college life due to AI, political pressures, and economic realities, the core coming-of-age experience remains a constant. This article reflects on the enduring aspects of college, such as building friendships, navigating newfound independence, and the round-the-clock culture of social togetherness. It compiles several past essays that explore these formative moments, from lessons learned at a 30th reunion to how the parent-child relationship evolves when a student leaves for school. The piece suggests that while the context of higher education changes, its fundamental role in personal growth and development persists across generations.</p>

          <p>Elliott Investment Management, a prominent activist firm, has acquired a significant stake in Rexford Industrial Realty, a REIT specializing in Southern California industrial properties. Rexford's stock has underperformed recently, trading at a discount to its net asset value, which is attributed to concerns over corporate governance, bloated expenses, and a strategy focused on asset growth over shareholder value. Elliott is expected to advocate for improved governance and capital allocation, and its involvement could make Rexford a more attractive acquisition target for strategic or private equity buyers.

          <p>The perception of Indian food in the United States is undergoing a significant transformation, moving beyond "cheap food and curry houses" to sophisticated, upscale dining. Restaurateurs like Vikas Khanna, whose restaurant Junoon earned a Michelin star, are leading a new wave of establishments that explore the depth and regional diversity of Indian cuisine. This trend is fueled by younger consumers' growing interest in global flavors and an increasingly affluent Indian American population. As a result, investor interest is growing, with private equity firms now backing popular Indian restaurant chains looking to expand in the U.S. market.</p>

        </div>
        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>In his new book "Breakneck," author Dan Wang posits that a key difference between China and the U.S. is that China is an "engineering state" while America is a "lawyerly society." He argues that China's leadership, often composed of trained engineers, approaches societal problems as technical challenges to be solved, resulting in rapid, large-scale infrastructure projects like high-speed rail and massive bridges. In contrast, America's legalistic culture, while protecting pluralism, often leads to procedural gridlock and paralysis, slowing down construction and development. This framework helps explain why a poor Chinese province can have better infrastructure than America's wealthiest states.</p>

          <p>Major coffee chains such as Costa Coffee are facing challenges as consumer tastes, particularly among younger generations, evolve. The rise of trendy alternatives like matcha, offered by newer chains like Blank Street Coffee, is capturing the "matcha generation" that seeks novel and aesthetically pleasing drinks as an affordable luxury. Compounded by the cost of living crisis and the popularity of home coffee machines, legacy brands are struggling to compete. Analysts suggest that chains that fail to innovate and respond to these shifting consumer behaviors, which favor artisanal experiences and unique offerings, risk becoming irrelevant in a crowded market.</p>

        </div>
        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>This article defends the efficacy of direct cash transfers as a primary tool for poverty reduction, pushing back against recent interpretations of new pilot programs that showed lackluster results on secondary metrics like health and employment. The author argues that decades of research have consistently shown that giving people money successfully lifts them out of poverty, even if the effects are muted during periods of high inflation and widespread government stimulus. While acknowledging that cash transfers cannot solve supply-side problems like the high cost of housing and childcare, the piece concludes they remain a superior, simpler, and more effective anti-poverty policy than more complicated interventions.</p>
