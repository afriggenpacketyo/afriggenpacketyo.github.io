          <p>Honeywell announced third-quarter financial results that surpassed market expectations, with significant growth in its aerospace segment. The industrial conglomerate reported a 7% year-over-year revenue increase to $10.41 billion and raised its full-year guidance for sales and earnings per share. This positive performance comes as the company prepares to spin off its Solstice Advanced Materials business, a move intended to unlock greater shareholder value and allow for more focused operations across its divisions. The company's record backlog and strong order growth indicate sustained momentum moving forward. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>A U.S. Commerce Department official has refuted claims that the Trump administration is negotiating to take equity stakes in quantum computing companies like IonQ and Rigetti Computing. This denial follows a Wall Street Journal report suggesting such talks were underway, which caused a temporary surge in the stocks of several quantum firms. While the administration has recently taken stakes in other sectors deemed vital to national security, such as semiconductors, the spokesperson clarified that no such discussions are currently happening with quantum technology companies. The development of quantum computing remains a national security interest. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>The UK government has stated that its planned digital ID scheme will not be applied retrospectively to the current workforce. Instead, it will only be mandatory for individuals starting a new job after the system is implemented, which is expected by 2028. Prime Minister Keir Starmer emphasized that the digital ID will not be compulsory for accessing essential services like healthcare and is intended to streamline processes like renting a home. Despite these assurances and aims to "cut the faff," the proposal has faced significant public opposition, with a petition to scrap it garnering nearly three million signatures amid privacy concerns.</p>

          <p>The U.S. Senate has unanimously passed the IRS MATH Act, a bill designed to make Internal Revenue Service notices for simple tax return mistakes clearer and more understandable for taxpayers. The legislation, which now heads to the President's desk, addresses concerns that current "math error" notices are often confusing and do not adequately explain how to correct mistakes or the consequences of not responding within the 60-day deadline. While the act will not reduce the number of errors made on returns, proponents argue it will help taxpayers resolve issues without needing to hire expensive legal help.</p>

          <p>With U.S. credit card debt reaching a record $1.21 trillion, many consumers are exploring debt forgiveness options beyond making minimum payments. One primary method is working with a debt relief company, which negotiates with creditors to settle debts for a lump sum, often reducing the total balance significantly. Alternatively, borrowers facing temporary hardship can contact their credit card issuers directly to enroll in hardship programs that may lower interest rates or pause payments. Other strategies include working with a credit counseling agency for a debt management plan or, for those with good credit, using a debt consolidation loan to simplify payments.</p>

          <p>Southwest Airlines, long known as a discount carrier, is implementing significant changes to attract premium travelers. The airline will introduce assigned seating in 2026, ending its decades-old open boarding policy, and will offer new fare bundles that include options for extra legroom. These changes follow the recent introduction of fees for checked bags and are part of a broader industry trend where even budget carriers are adding premium perks to compete for a wider range of customers. The strategic shift aims to enhance the passenger experience with amenities like in-seat power and better Wi-Fi, though it will likely mean fewer low-cost options for flyers.</p>

          <p>Shares of luxury group Kering surged after the company reported a narrower sales decline in the third quarter, signaling a potential turnaround for its flagship brand, Gucci. While overall sales were down 5%, this marked a significant improvement from the 15% drop in the previous quarter. Sales at Gucci, though still down 14%, showed sharp sequential improvement from a 25% plunge, beating analyst expectations. This performance, coupled with Kering's recent decision to sell its beauty unit to focus on core fashion businesses, has built investor optimism that the company's recovery strategy is beginning to take hold.

          <p>Ford Motor is scheduled to release its third-quarter earnings, with Wall Street analysts expecting adjusted earnings of 36 cents per share on $43.08 billion in automotive revenue. While many analysts predict Ford will beat these estimates, there are concerns that the company's guidance for the rest of the year may be disappointing. Key issues weighing on the outlook include the impact of tariffs, ongoing cost-cutting and quality improvement efforts, and supply chain disruptions, such as a recent fire at a key aluminum supplier's plant.

          <p>This article delves into the complex connection between wealth and well-being, suggesting that money can increase happiness, but only when it is not pursued for that purpose. Citing psychological research, the author argues that materialism and earning money for motives like social comparison or seeking power are negatively correlated with life satisfaction. In contrast, acquiring money for security or to support family does not harm well-being. The piece concludes that true wealth is found by interrogating financial motives, practicing modesty in consumption, and spending quietly on experiences with loved ones rather than on status-signaling possessions.</p>

          <p>Actor Jeremy Strong, known for his intensive character preparation, discusses his recent roles as Roy Cohn in 'The Apprentice' and Bruce Springsteen's manager Jon Landau in 'Springsteen: Deliver Me From Nowhere.' For the Springsteen film, Strong had direct access to Landau and Springsteen on set, which he described as having an "oracle" to consult. He contrasts this with the darker experience of portraying Cohn, which he found emotionally taxing. Strong explains his process, which he calls "identity diffusion," as a way to create an "anechoic chamber" where the role can take possession of him, allowing for a more authentic performance.</p>

          <p>A certified financial planner advises families to maximize their paychecks by first evaluating their spending to distinguish between intentional and unintentional expenses. Instead of traditional, restrictive budgeting, he recommends a "reverse budget" or investment-first approach. This involves allocating a set percentage of income towards financial goals like retirement and college savings before any other spending. The remaining funds can then be spent with more freedom. The article stresses the importance of periodically re-evaluating expenditures to ensure they align with the family's values and to eliminate wasteful spending, such as unused subscriptions.</p>
