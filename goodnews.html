          <p>China's anti-corruption campaign is now targeting key tech sectors, including big data and semiconductors, as part of its broader strategy to achieve self-reliance and compete with the United States. Recent investigations in Guizhou province have led to the downfall of several officials connected to the region's big data industry, raising concerns about the balance between state-led innovation and accountability. The investigations highlight the Chinese government's focus on industries deemed strategically important amid increasing rivalry with the US, suggesting a shift towards greater scrutiny of these sectors.</p>

          <p>Financial planners recommend carrying some cash for situations where digital payments are not viable, such as power outages or vendor minimums. While Americans carry an average of $67 in their wallets, experts suggest keeping $50 to $100 to cover typical expenses or emergencies. Cash can be particularly useful during tech failures or natural disasters when ATMs and internet services are unavailable. Some planners emphasize the importance of having enough cash to get home in case of a lost phone or declined credit card.</p>

          <p>A new parenting framework called "emotionally safe parenting" focuses on being deeply attuned to a child's emotional needs, building emotional resilience, and fostering trust through open communication. This approach involves accepting a child's emotions without judgment, responding without shame, and viewing "bad" behavior as a signal for support. Emotionally safe parents prioritize self-awareness and inner healing to create an environment where children feel safe expressing themselves. This style encourages parents to set boundaries with empathy and reconnect after conflicts, modeling healthy repair.</p>

The radio signals will travel at the speed of light, eventually reaching beyond NASA's Voyager 1 spacecraft.

          <p>Julie Moore, an Army wife, played a pivotal role in changing the military's protocol for notifying families of service member deaths. Outraged by the impersonal telegrams used during the Vietnam War, Moore led efforts to ensure families were notified in person and offered support. She made a deal with the local Western Union office to be alerted to telegrams, enabling her to comfort other Army wives. Her efforts led to a fundamental change in Army culture, with service members now personally notifying families and providing ongoing support, and in 2023, Ft. Benning was renamed Ft. Moore to honor her and her husband.</p>

The report said the Fujian would "greatly enhance" the abilities of the Chinese navy in offshore defence as well as long-distance sea escort operations once it entered service.
