          <p>Iran launched missiles at the Al-Udeid US military base in Qatar, claiming it was retaliation for American strikes on Iranian nuclear facilities. The US reported that most missiles were intercepted, with minimal damage and no casualties, as Iran had provided early warning of the attack. President Trump announced a ceasefire between Israel and Iran following the exchange, signaling a potential de-escalation. Qatar, while acknowledging the attack, deemed it a violation of its sovereignty, while Iran's supreme leader stated that his country would not submit to anyone's violation, though Israel warned of a forceful response to any ceasefire violation. </p>

          <p>The UK's Competition and Markets Authority (CMA) is investigating Google for potentially holding too much power in the online search market and is considering changes to give consumers more choice. Google accounts for over 90% of UK searches, and the CMA is exploring options such as choice screens for users to select different search providers and increased transparency for publishers. Google argues that the proposed changes could negatively impact its business and innovation in the UK. The CMA's investigation follows similar actions in the EU, raising concerns about unintended consequences for businesses and consumers. </p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Sean "Diddy" Combs' defense team's decision not to call any witnesses in his federal trial for sexual assault is viewed by legal experts as a calculated risk. The defense appears to be relying on the prosecution's burden of proof and highlighting reasonable doubt, as calling witnesses could expose them to potentially damaging testimony. Experts suggest that Diddy's decision not to testify himself aims to prevent the prosecution from reiterating their case and subjecting him to a potentially humiliating cross-examination. Closing arguments are expected to begin soon, with the defense emphasizing the complexity of the relationships and the absence of a clear criminal enterprise. </p>

          <p>New Yorkers are voting in a mayoral primary election that could have significant implications for the Democratic party. The race features a contest between progressive democratic socialist Zohran Mamdani and former governor Andrew Cuomo. Mamdani has gained momentum, especially among young voters, with a progressive platform including rent freezes and free buses. Cuomo, who resigned in 2021 following sexual harassment accusations, has relied on attacks against Mamdani, and the winner of the primary will likely become the next mayor given the city's Democratic lean. </p>

The park's emergency team, including trained firearms staff, and police were deployed, but the bears remained calm and did not breach any public areas. An investigation has been launched to determine how the bears escaped, as there were no signs of enclosure damage, and the park reopened the following day. </p>

          <p>Jeff Bezos has reportedly moved his Venice wedding celebrations to a more secure location after residents threatened protests, including filling canals with inflatable crocodiles. The protests stemmed from accusations that the wedding was effectively shutting down the city. The event will now be held at the Arsenale, a historic complex of boat yards, basins, and warehouses, which is easier to secure. Concerns about potential terrorist threats and the presence of members of the Trump family also contributed to the decision to relocate the wedding. </p>

          <p>As the planet warms and deadly heat waves worsen, cities are appointing "heat officers" to build resilience through urban greening and the creation of cool zones. These officers analyze local conditions, develop plans, and implement protective measures, such as heat-repellent sidewalks and reforestation. The concept, initiated by the Atlantic Council, recognizes that extreme heat could impact billions by 2050. These heat officers aim to proactively prepare cities for extreme heat, not just react during crises, and these are long-term strategies and comprehensive planning, making them challenging to implement. </p>

          <p>At the NATO summit in The Hague, Germany's military, the Bundeswehr, faces increased demands to boost defense spending and troop numbers. NATO aims to set a target of 5% of member states' GDP for defense, posing a significant financial challenge for Germany. The country must also increase its troop numbers to contribute to NATO's enhanced military capabilities in Europe. While Chancellor Merz supports the initiative, there is debate within the government and opposition regarding the feasibility and necessity of such high spending targets. </p>

          <p>Over 100 Labour MPs are backing an effort to block the government's planned changes to the benefits system. The MPs have signed an amendment that would give them an opportunity to vote on a proposal to reject the welfare reform bill in its entirety, because dozens of Labour MPs have expressed concerns about the plans to cut disability and sickness-related benefits payments to save ¬£5bn a year by 2030. Cabinet Office minister Pat McFadden said ministers were "happy to talk" to MPs with concerns, but defended the bill as "a really important package of benefit reform". The vote on the government's bill is currently due to take place a week from tomorrow ‚Äì on Tuesday 1 July. </p>
