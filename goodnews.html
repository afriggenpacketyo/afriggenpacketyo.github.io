This change aligns Southwest with competitors who generate substantial revenue from baggage fees, totaling nearly $7.3 billion for U.S. airlines last year. In addition to charging for checked bags, Southwest is implementing other significant changes to its business model, including assigned seating and basic economy tickets.

These khipus, preserved in remote villages, hold potential clues to understanding Inca society, administration, and possibly even literature. The process involves analyzing cord colors, fiber types, and knotting patterns, drawing on linguistic insights and advanced technologies like AI. Despite challenges such as the lack of a Rosetta stone and questions about whether khipus represent true writing, researchers remain optimistic about uncovering new knowledge about the Inca civilization and the origins of writing itself.</p>

European auto stocks, particularly sensitive to U.S. trade policies, rebounded after initial losses. Trump's decision to postpone the tariffs, initially scheduled for June 1, followed a call with EU Commission President Ursula von der Leyen, providing a temporary respite in trade tensions.

          <p>British businesses are reportedly "rebranding" diversity, equity, and inclusion (DEI) initiatives to avoid unwanted political attention amid a right-wing backlash. Companies are reframing policies as "wellbeing," "belonging," and "culture" to maintain their commitment to equality without attracting controversy. Experts believe a full-scale rollback is unlikely in the UK due to the Equalities Act, but US-headquartered firms are scaling back commitments and public celebrations of inclusion work.
