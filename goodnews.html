          <p>China has acknowledged considering initiating trade negotiations with the United States, following overtures from Washington. A spokesperson for the commerce ministry emphasized that the U.S. must demonstrate sincerity by correcting its practices and removing tariffs imposed on China. The article underscores the need for mutual trust and concrete actions from the U.S. to facilitate meaningful discussions. If the U.S. fails to address these issues, it would undermine the potential for progress and raise questions about its commitment to resolving the trade war. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>Japan and the United States have agreed to hold intensive ministerial-level discussions around mid-May to reach a mutually beneficial tariff deal. Japan's chief negotiator, Ryosei Akazawa, stated that the talks made "progress" and deepened discussions on nontariff barriers, bilateral trade, and economic security cooperation. Akazawa is expected to offer a package of proposals to U.S. officials, including increased purchases of U.S. corn and soybeans, as well as simplifying the safety and environmental screening process for imported cars. The Trump administration has prioritized striking early tariff deals with strategically important countries like Japan to gain an upper hand over China in the Indo-Pacific region.</p>

Nicholson, who has a background in dance, filmed her three-episode arc in a single week, finding the physical demands surprisingly challenging. She also discusses her role as Sinatra in "Paradise," contemplating whether the character is a monster and reflecting on her childhood memories of living off the grid.</p>
