Analyzing ancient DNA from 60 individuals, the team found evidence of a Neolithic society that traced its descent through the female line for 250 years. This discovery supports the hypothesis that early matrilineal systems could emerge and persist in communities without strong mechanisms for wealth accumulation. The findings shed light on the diverse forms of social organization in early human societies.</p>
