          <p>During the U.S. state visit to the United Kingdom, the fashion choices of First Lady Melania Trump, the Princess of Wales, and Queen Camilla drew significant attention as a form of diplomatic expression. Style experts analyzed the ensembles, from Melania Trump's wide-brimmed hat and British-designed trench coat to the coordinated colors worn by the royals, as intentional messages of support and national identity. These sartorial decisions are considered a key element of statecraft, conveying subtle political signals and respect between nations during high-profile events. The outfits provided a visual narrative complementing the formal political discussions.</p>

          <p>With U.S. household debt reaching record levels, many Americans are finding it impossible to keep up with payments. This article outlines several strategies for individuals whose debt obligations exceed their income, moving beyond simple budgeting. Key options include debt consolidation to secure a lower interest rate, negotiating with creditors for a debt settlement, or entering a structured debt management plan through a credit counseling agency. For situations where repayment is completely unmanageable, filing for Chapter 7 or Chapter 13 bankruptcy is presented as a final resort for achieving a financial fresh start.

        </div>
        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>The Federal Reserve has lowered its benchmark interest rate by 0.25 percentage points, setting the new range between 4% and 4.25% in an effort to support a slowing economy. This marks the first rate reduction since December 2024 and comes amid concerns over a stalling labor market, even as inflation remains above the central bank's target. Officials are projecting two additional cuts in 2025 but only one in 2026, signaling a cautious approach to monetary easing. Fed Chair Jerome Powell described the move as a risk management measure to counter rising downside risks to employment. (not investment advice)</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>A new study involving nearly 34,000 veterans suggests that nicotinamide, a form of Vitamin B3, is linked to a reduced risk of developing non-melanoma skin cancers. The most significant benefit was observed in individuals who began taking the supplement after their first skin cancer diagnosis, showing a 54% lower risk of recurrence. This research provides stronger evidence for dermatologists who often recommend the over-the-counter supplement as a protective measure against UV radiation damage. Experts note the supplement has minimal side effects and may be most effective when initiated early as a secondary prevention strategy.</p>

          <h2>Wreckage of Fishing Boat That Sank a Century Ago Discovered Off Nantucket Coast</h2>

          <p>A dive team has successfully identified a shipwreck located 200 feet underwater off the coast of Nantucket as the ST Seiner, a fishing vessel that sank during a storm in 1929. The ship went down with 21 crew members aboard, and previous attempts to locate the wreckage had been unsuccessful. Using sonar scans and examining distinctive features like its steam engine and trawl winch, the expedition confirmed the vessel's identity. The discovery by Atlantic Wreck Salvage is considered a significant historical find that may provide a sense of closure to the descendants of the lost crewmen.</p>

          <p>The promotional press conference for the boxing rematch between Chris Eubank Jr. and Conor Benn became a forum for relentless arguments and accusations. Eubank Jr. claimed that Benn's team, along with promoter Eddie Hearn, actively tried to "sabotage" him before their first fight by meddling with his weight cut and creating biased conditions. Hearn dismissed the allegations as "waffle," while Benn largely remained quiet, letting his promoter handle the verbal sparring. The tense exchange sets a hostile tone for their upcoming November bout, as both sides continue the rivalry that defined their first encounter.</p>

          <p>The state banquet held at Windsor Castle for President Trump was a meticulously planned diplomatic event designed to impress the visiting leader. The guest list was notably heavy on political figures and technology executives, such as Apple CEO Tim Cook and OpenAI CEO Sam Altman, but lacked prominent celebrity attendees. Seating arrangements placed President Trump between King Charles and the Princess of Wales, with the event featuring trumpet fanfares and a curated musical selection. The banquet serves as a prime example of soft power, using hospitality and pageantry to strengthen international relations.</p>

          <p>A bipartisan bill aimed at combating the financial abuse of older adults is gaining momentum in Congress. The Financial Exploitation Prevention Act would empower financial institutions, including mutual funds, to temporarily delay transactions they suspect are part of a scheme to defraud a senior or vulnerable individual. The proposal comes as reports indicate that adults over 60 lose over $28 billion annually to financial theft, often perpetrated by someone they know. The bill has been unanimously approved by the House Financial Services Committee, signaling strong cross-party support for protecting vulnerable populations.</p>

          <p>Chrysler is recalling 163,735 Jeep Wagoneer and Grand Wagoneer SUVs from model years 2022 to 2025 due to a potential safety issue. According to the National Highway Traffic Safety Administration, the trim on the driver and passenger doors can detach while the vehicle is moving, creating a road hazard for other drivers. The issue is reportedly related to vehicle assembly rather than a defective part. Dealers will inspect and replace the trim for free, and Chrysler has stated it is unaware of any accidents or injuries related to the flaw.</p>

          <p>World Trade Organization Director-General Ngozi Okonjo-Iweala has offered an optimistic perspective on the trade disruptions caused by President Donald Trump's unilateral tariffs. She suggested that these challenges create an opportunity to rebalance supply chains, open new markets, and foster a new phase of "reglobalisation." Speaking at a WTO forum, she pushed back against claims that the organization has become irrelevant, noting that nearly three-quarters of global commerce still operates under its rules. She framed the current turmoil not as a crisis, but as a chance to reform and strengthen the global trading system.</p>

          <p>Frontier Airlines CEO Barry Biffle publicly refuted comments from United Airlines CEO Scott Kirby, who recently declared the ultra-low-cost carrier model in the U.S. is dead. Biffle responded by stating Kirby's assessment ignores the current flight oversupply issue in the domestic market, which favors carriers with lower operating costs like Frontier. The exchange highlights the intense competition and differing strategies among U.S. airlines, as legacy carriers adopt basic economy fares to compete with discounters, who are in turn struggling with rising costs and a saturated market.</p>
