        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>The United States is experiencing a significant decline in drug overdose deaths, with provisional data from the CDC showing 27,000 fewer deaths in 2024 compared to 2023, marking the steepest single-year decline in 45 years. This widespread trend is evident in 45 states, particularly in Ohio and West Virginia, and is largely attributed to the increased availability of naloxone, telehealth access to addiction treatment, and opioid-settlement cash. While synthetic opioid deaths are falling rapidly, deaths from stimulants like meth and cocaine are on the rise, and some regions remain highly vulnerable. Concerns remain over proposed cuts to naloxone distribution, which could hinder further progress.</p>

          <p>The Trump administration is reportedly considering several policy changes to expand access to in vitro fertilization (IVF), including requiring insurers to cover the procedure, declaring it an ‚ÄúEssential Health Benefit‚Äù under the Affordable Care Act, and pushing Congress to pass a law mandating private insurance coverage. White House officials have been meeting with infertility doctors, industry leaders, and conservative policy groups to discuss these proposals. However, the American Society for Reproductive Medicine has criticized the White House for not including them in the discussions. The administration aims to address infertility issues holistically, balancing the interests of various groups within its base.</p>

          <p>Juan Soto, now with the New York Mets after signing a 15-year, $765 million contract, faced a hostile reception from Yankees fans during his return to Yankee Stadium. Despite his previous popularity with the Yankees, fans booed him at every at-bat, with some altering his old jerseys to show their displeasure. The Subway Series game, a clash between two first-place teams, saw the Yankees defeat the Mets 6-2, although Soto had a decent performance with three walks, a stolen base, and a run scored. The Yankees used the money that could have gone to Soto to instead fill holes around the roster with additions from baseball's B list.</p>

          <p>Prime Minister Sir Keir Starmer has signaled that a youth mobility scheme could be part of a new deal with the EU, allowing young people to work abroad for up to two years. The scheme, similar to existing agreements with countries like Australia, aims to provide opportunities for young people post-Brexit. While details regarding age eligibility and quotas are yet to be specified, the proposal has faced criticism from Conservative Party leaders who describe it as "free movement through the back door." The agreement is expected to be announced at a summit in London.</p>

          <p>Chinese scientists have developed plasma excitation technology that could significantly enhance the aerodynamic performance of high-altitude drones. Wind tunnel tests show that plasma generated by high-voltage currents can boost an aircraft wing‚Äôs lift-to-drag ratio by nearly 88 per cent, which indicates a superior flight efficiency. This technology has the potential for extending the endurance of high-altitude, long-endurance (HALE) drones, allowing them to fly longer than before. The research was conducted by the State Key Laboratory of Aerodynamics under the China Aerodynamics Research and Development Centre.</p>

          <p>Sierra Prindle, a military veteran and avid runner, experienced years of worsening calf pain before being diagnosed with popliteal artery entrapment syndrome (PAES), a rare condition where the popliteal artery is compressed by muscles and tendons. Misdiagnosed for half a decade, Prindle underwent a bypass surgery that proved unsuccessful, leading her to seek treatment from Dr. Sean Lyden at the Cleveland Clinic. Lyden performed a surgery to remove portions of Prindle's gastrocnemius and popliteus muscles, correcting the condition in both legs and allowing her to return to a more normal life. She hopes her story inspires others to persist in seeking answers when they know something is wrong.</p>

The Magna Carta, first issued in 1215, declared that all people, including royalty, had personal rights and was reissued by subsequent monarchs.

While increasing local production is a long-term strategy, automakers are hesitant without knowing how long the tariffs will remain. Nissan plans to focus on boosting sales of U.S.-manufactured models to cushion the tariff's effect. The U.S. market remains crucial for Japanese automakers despite the challenges.
