          <p>Florida's Operation Dragon Eye, led by the U.S. Marshals Office and supported by the state Attorney General's Office, rescued dozens of children from child sex trafficking operations. The initiative involved 20 agencies locating 60 critically missing children and arresting suspects linked to trafficking, drugs, and child endangerment. The recovered children, aged 9 to 17, received immediate medical evaluations and psychological support. Officials emphasized the operation's focus on providing follow-up assistance to prevent re-victimization. Florida remains a high-risk state for human trafficking, prompting increased funding and legislative efforts to combat it.</p>

          <p>President Donald Trump announced that Israel and Iran have agreed to a ceasefire after a week of aerial attacks.

Trump stated that the Iranian attack caused minimal damage and thanked Iran for providing early notice, which allowed for the prevention of casualties. Diplomatic sources indicate that the Iranian counterattack was expected and calibrated, with U.S. and Qatari officials preparing for it over the weekend.</p>

          <p>RBN Energy executive Rusty Braziel stated that Iran is unlikely to close the Strait of Hormuz, a vital oil shipping passage, despite recent tensions. He explained that Iran has too much to lose, exporting 1.7 million barrels a day through the strait. Braziel noted that the market reflects this assessment, as oil prices dropped on Monday. He also cautioned that U.S. restrictions on ethane trade to China pose issues for exporters, potentially damaging the U.S.'s reputation as a trustworthy energy supplier.

          <p>Jeff Bezos and Lauren S√°nchez's upcoming wedding in Venice faces potential disruptions, including threatened blockades of the city's canals by activists protesting the event.

Protests could disrupt traffic, and banners criticizing Bezos have appeared around the city. The couple's wedding planners aim to minimize disruption, but the event has already impacted local reservations and sparked debate about wealth and tourism in Venice.</p>

If the damage from Iran's attack is limited and no further attacks occur, Trump may hold his fire. This approach mirrors the 2020 Soleimani killing, where the U.S. chose not to escalate after Iran's retaliatory strikes.
