          <p>Writer and director Lena Dunham's new Netflix series, "Too Much," offers a modern take on the London romantic comedy, inspired by her own experiences moving to the city. The show, starring Megan Stalter and Will Sharpe, contrasts the fantasized, historical image of England with the contemporary reality of city life. Dunham explains that the series explores the social and linguistic challenges of an American workaholic relocating to London. The show also features an extensive list of celebrity cameos, including Andrew Scott, Stephen Fry, and Jennifer Saunders, who Dunham credits as a major comedic influence.</p>

          <p>China has successfully completed an 1,856-kilometer (1,153-mile) green belt in Inner Mongolia, effectively enclosing the Badain Jaran, Tengger, and Ulan Buh deserts. This significant environmental project aims to combat desertification and control the movement of sand in the Alxa league region. The method involves using straw checkerboards to stabilize shifting sands, which are then followed by the planting of drought-resistant vegetation like sacsaoul trees. This long-term strategy is part of China's broader "green great wall" initiative, designed to build a robust ecological barrier and mitigate the effects of desert expansion on the country.</p>

          <p>AI server manufacturer Super Micro is planning a significant expansion of its European operations, including increased manufacturing capacity, to capitalize on the region's rapidly growing demand for artificial intelligence hardware. CEO Charles Liang stated that the company, which builds servers using Nvidia chips essential for AI models, sees tremendous long-term growth potential globally and specifically in Europe. This move follows a recent European tour by Nvidia's CEO encouraging the continent to bolster its computing infrastructure.

          <p>Milwaukee Brewers' rookie pitcher Jacob Misiorowski delivered a stunning performance, striking out 12 batters over six innings to lead his team to a 3-1 victory over the Los Angeles Dodgers. Despite an early leadoff home run by Shohei Ohtani, the Dodgers' lineup struggled against the 23-year-old's powerful pitching, which included 21 pitches exceeding 100 mph. The loss marked the fifth consecutive defeat for the Dodgers, a season-long losing streak. Dodgers players and manager Dave Roberts praised Misiorowski's "unbelievable" and "super impressive" stuff, acknowledging that his command and velocity were simply too much to overcome on the night.</p>

          <p>At 80 years old, rock legend John Fogerty gave an energetic and powerful two-hour performance at the Hollywood Bowl as part of his "Celebration Tour." The concert heavily featured classic songs from his time with Creedence Clearwater Revival (CCR), whose rights he recently reacquired after a long legal battle. Despite his age, Fogerty's signature raspy voice remained remarkably consistent, and he performed with vigor, playing lead guitar and moving emphatically throughout the show. The setlist included iconic hits like "Bad Moon Rising," "Born on the Bayou," and "Fortunate Son," demonstrating the enduring power and relevance of his music to the large audience.</p>

          <p>An opinion article posits that Hong Kong is uniquely positioned to become a new hub for global public goods as the United States scales back its international development efforts. The piece contrasts the dismantling of USAID as an independent agency under an "America first" policy with China's launch of the International Organisation for Mediation (IOMed) in Hong Kong. The author argues that the U.S. is ceding its soft power, creating a vacuum that China is eager to fill, with support from the Global South. This shift presents an opportunity for Hong Kong to leverage its cosmopolitan status and enhance its prominence on the world stage.</p>

          <p>Mandonna “Donna” Kashanian, a 64-year-old Iranian mother who has lived in the U.S. for 47 years, was released from ICE detention following advocacy from Republican House Majority Leader Steve Scalise. Kashanian was detained last month at her New Orleans home despite having no criminal record and regularly checking in with immigration authorities as required. After a surge of community support, Scalise requested that the Department of Homeland Security review her case, leading to her release. Her attorney noted that while her long-term legal status is still uncertain, the intervention from a high-ranking politician was crucial in securing her freedom.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>With forecasters predicting an above-average 2025 Atlantic hurricane season, homeowners on the U.S. East and Gulf Coasts are increasingly investing in climate-resilient home designs. For example, some are choosing round houses, whose aerodynamic shape can reduce wind pressure by 30% and are built with reinforced materials to withstand Category 5 winds. Companies like Deltec Homes specialize in these resilient structures, which may cost more upfront but can lead to long-term savings, including on insurance. Research institutions are also testing building methods to make all homes more storm-ready, emphasizing reinforced roofs and wind-rated garage doors as critical lines of defense.</p>
