          <p>Mahmoud Khalil, a Columbia University graduate and pro-Palestinian activist, has been released on bail after being detained for over three months, with a federal judge ruling he is not a flight risk or threat. Khalil, a prominent voice in Columbia's protests, was arrested in March, sparking demonstrations against what his supporters claim is the Trump administration's crackdown on student protesters. The government argued that his activism impedes on US foreign policy and sought his deportation. Khalil criticized the administration for targeting him for protesting Israel's military actions in Gaza and expressed eagerness to reunite with his wife and son, whom he had limited contact with during his detention.</p>

He stated that he met Hudson randomly on a flight in 2021 and that she contributed creatively to his book, "The Art of Winning." Belichick also addressed reports about Hudson being copied on his emails, clarifying that she assists him with personal media and has no involvement in the UNC football program.</p>

Stylists suggest that tailored shorts are generally acceptable, but beach, sports, cargo, and denim shorts are not. A 2022 YouGov poll indicated that 66% of Britons found it acceptable for men to wear shorts in the office, a significant increase from 2016.</p>

          <p>This article satirically discusses the lack of a clear dress code for ICE agents and questions how people are supposed to identify them as acting under the color of law. The author sarcastically suggests that agents should avoid wearing anything that might indicate their official capacity, such as badges or uniforms. The piece humorously explores the idea that ICE agents should look like ordinary people, making it difficult for individuals to distinguish them from kidnappers or rogue criminals. The goal is to encourage agents to express themselves through clothing, as long as it doesn't reveal their official role.</p>
