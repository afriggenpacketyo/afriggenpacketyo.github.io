        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Tattoos have become increasingly mainstream, with a third of American adults now having at least one, reflecting a broader societal shift towards individuality. Despite this growing acceptance and their recognition as an art form, some negative perceptions remain, as studies show people with tattoos are sometimes viewed as less trustworthy or hirable. The trend is particularly popular among millennials, with over 40% having tattoos, and it spans across political affiliations, indicating a significant cultural evolution from past generations.</p>

          <p>A school district in DeKalb County, Georgia, is observing positive outcomes from its "Disconnect to Reconnect" program, which bans student cellphone use during the school day. Teachers at Lakeside High School report that the ban has significantly reduced distractions, leading to more engaged students and an improved learning environment, with a notable decrease in disciplinary issues. This local initiative is part of a growing national trend, as more states enact laws to regulate phone use in schools to combat declining grades and attention spans.</p>

          <p>Markets in the Asia-Pacific region are set for a mixed opening after the U.S. president formalized a reduction in import tariffs on Japanese automobiles from 27.5% to 15%. This move, part of a broader agreement that includes $550 billion in Japanese investments into U.S. projects, is expected to influence trading, with Japan's Nikkei 225 poised for gains. Meanwhile, U.S. equity futures remained stable as investors await the August jobs report, which could influence the Federal Reserve's decisions on interest rates. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>Notes discovered in David Bowie's locked New York study have revealed his final, secret project: an 18th-century musical titled "The Spectator." The detailed notes, now part of the V&A Museum's archive, show Bowie's deep fascination with the art, satire, and criminal underworld of 1700s London, including figures like the thief Jack Sheppard. This previously unknown project offers a new glimpse into the artist's creative ambitions in his final months, reflecting his lifelong desire to write for the theater.</p>

          <p>OpenAI is significantly expanding its operations in India, which has become its second-largest market by user base for its ChatGPT product. The company is responding to the country's rapid AI adoption by launching a low-cost subscription plan, advertising local job roles, and reportedly planning a major data center. This strategic push aims to capture the price-sensitive yet vast Indian market, though OpenAI faces challenges from local competitors, legal battles over copyright, and potential geopolitical tensions.</p>

          <p>Bryan Hooper Sr. has been released from a Minnesota prison after his murder conviction was vacated, having spent nearly 27 years incarcerated for a crime he did not commit. His 1998 conviction was based largely on the testimony of a woman who has now confessed to the murder herself. The Hennepin County Attorney's office supported Hooper's release after this key witness recanted, stating it is a prosecutor's duty to correct such grave mistakes and ensure justice is served for the innocent.</p>

Jones stated that the substantial draft picks received in the trade and the resulting salary cap space will allow the team to afford multiple top-tier players, improving the team's overall depth and on-field availability.</p>

          <p>The Los Angeles City Council is considering a new measure that would require landlords to provide a means for tenants to keep their rental units at or below 82 degrees. This proposal follows a similar law passed for unincorporated areas of the county and aims to address the growing public health risks posed by extreme heat waves driven by climate change. While advocates emphasize the life-saving potential of the rule, landlord associations have expressed concerns about the high costs of implementation and the potential for increased rents.</p>

Her recent White House event on AI in education is an example of this targeted approach, which builds on her previous "Be Best" initiative. Observers note she is taking a more business-oriented and legislative approach, as seen with her instrumental role in passing the "Take It Down Act," signaling a selective but substantive engagement on issues she prioritizes.</p>
