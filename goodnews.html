          <p>A powerful geomagnetic storm is forecasted to make the northern lights visible across parts of the U.S., potentially reaching as far south as northern California and Alabama. The storm, spurred by a coronal mass ejection, could disrupt power systems, satellite operations, and radio communications. Space weather officials detected a solar flare associated with the storm, which is expected to last through late Monday. The northern lights are caused by solar wind hitting Earth's magnetic field and atmosphere and are best viewed in dark settings late at night or early in the morning.</p>

          <p>According to Angela Zhang, US tariffs can affect the Chinese tech sector in two main ways: direct and indirect effects. Higher tariffs make it harder for Chinese tech products to compete in the US market, but modest tariffs may be absorbed by Chinese suppliers. As Chinese companies face more trade barriers, they'll need to work harder on cutting costs and scaling up, which could lead to more innovation. Chinese companies are expected to look more aggressively to other markets and deepen trade with Europe, offering technology transfers in exchange for market access.</p>
