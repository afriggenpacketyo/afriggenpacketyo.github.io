          <h2>Alaska Airlines Announces New Nonstop Flights to Rome Starting Next Year</h2>
          <div class="timestamp">2025-06-03 09:07:54 EDT</div>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Alaska Airlines is set to launch its inaugural flights to Europe, offering nonstop service from Seattle to Rome beginning next May. This new route is made possible by Alaska's acquisition of Hawaiian Airlines, which provided the necessary long-haul jets for the expansion. The service will operate four times a week using Boeing 787-9 Dreamliner jets, already part of the combined fleet, and tickets will go on sale this fall. Alaska Airlines intends to expand its long-haul international destinations from Seattle throughout the decade, solidifying its position as a global gateway. </p>

          <p>According to a recent survey by Morning Consult, favorable views of China have surpassed those of the United States globally for the first time since tracking began in 2020. The shift occurred between January and late April, with China achieving a net favorability rating of 8.8 compared to the US's -1.5. The US's standing has diminished in 38 of the 41 markets tracked, while China's standing improved in 34, except for Russia, where views of the US improved under President Trump's new term. This change marks a significant blow to US soft power, with 16 countries switching from pro-US to pro-China during the surveyed period.</p>

          <p>Meta has entered into a 20-year agreement with Constellation Energy to purchase 1.1 gigawatts of nuclear power from the Clinton Clean Energy Center in Illinois. Beginning in 2027, Meta will utilize the energy to support its data centers' clean electricity goals, ensuring the continued operation and relicensing of the plant. The agreement will also expand Clinton's output by 30 megawatts, with the power contributing to the regional grid rather than directly powering Meta's facilities. Constellation Energy's shares experienced a 15% rally following the announcement of the partnership.</p>

          <p>A new report by the Pensions and Lifetime Savings Association (PLSA) indicates that lower energy prices have reduced the amount of money needed for a basic standard of living in retirement. The estimated cost for a minimum retirement living standard for a one-person household has decreased by ¬£1,000 a year to ¬£13,400. However, the report also notes that those desiring a better retirement lifestyle will require a higher income than before. The PLSA's calculations are intended as a guide for individuals planning their retirement savings, and varying lifestyles are taken into account.</p>

          <p>Luang Prabang, in northern Laos, has experienced an economic boom driven by tourism, leading to a significant reduction in poverty within the city. Officials report that over 16,000 families have moved out of poverty, representing 98.3% of the city's population. The city's success has raised hopes that the entire country could follow suit, but challenges remain, including high public debt and reliance on agriculture. Some analysts caution that not all tourism brings economic benefits to the local population, citing the prevalence of "zero-dollar" tour groups that bypass local businesses.</p>

          <p>Millennials entering their 40s are experiencing a unique midlife crisis shaped by economic instability, evolving values, and a different set of milestones compared to previous generations. Unlike the traditional stereotype involving drastic life changes, millennials often grapple with a sense of being in a "generational waiting room," facing financial setbacks and societal pressures. While economic factors play a role, many millennials are reevaluating their careers, relationships, and personal identities, seeking fulfillment and meaning in new ways. The reevaluation is a result of economic and lifestyle changes which have defined the millennial experience, leading to a shift in perspective on what constitutes a successful and fulfilling life.</p>
