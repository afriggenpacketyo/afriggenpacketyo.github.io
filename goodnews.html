          <p>Bubba Wallace secured a historic victory at the Brickyard 400, becoming the first Black driver to win a NASCAR Cup Series race on the Indianapolis Motor Speedway's oval. The win, his third career victory, snapped a 100-race winless streak and marked his first triumph in one of NASCAR's crown jewel events. Wallace overcame a late rain delay, two overtime restarts, and fuel concerns to hold off a charging Kyle Larson by just 0.222 seconds. The achievement is a significant moment for Wallace and the 23XI Racing team, co-owned by Michael Jordan and Denny Hamlin.</p>

          <p>Ichiro Suzuki, the first Japanese player elected, was inducted into the Baseball Hall of Fame, receiving 99.7% of the vote from the Baseball Writers' Association of America. He was enshrined alongside six-time All-Star pitcher CC Sabathia and dominant reliever Billy Wagner, who was elected in his final year of eligibility. Suzuki, known for his record-setting 3,089 MLB hits and 10 Gold Gloves, delivered a speech that humorously noted the one writer who left him off the ballot. The ceremony in Cooperstown also posthumously honored Dave Parker and Dick Allen, celebrating a diverse class of baseball legends.</p>

          <p>The United States and the European Union have reached a significant trade agreement, averting the threat of higher tariffs. The deal, finalized after negotiations between President Donald Trump and European Commission President Ursula von der Leyen in Scotland, establishes a 15% tariff on most EU goods imported into the US. As part of the agreement, the EU has committed to increasing its investment in the US by $600 billion and purchasing $750 billion in American energy, aiming to reduce European reliance on Russian sources. Both leaders hailed the deal as a victory that will foster stability. (not investment advice)</p>

The film, set in a retro-futuristic 1960s, stars Pedro Pascal, Vanessa Kirby, Joseph Quinn, and Ebon Moss-Bachrach as the titular heroes. Its strong performance, alongside the recent success of "Superman," challenges the narrative of so-called "superhero fatigue" in the film industry.</p>
