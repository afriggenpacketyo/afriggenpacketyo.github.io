          <p>Japan's chief tariff negotiator, Ryosei Akazawa, met with U.S. Commerce Secretary Howard Lutnick to advocate for a reconsideration of higher import duties imposed by the U.S. Akazawa emphasized the need for a win-win deal during the discussions in Washington, D.C., and is preparing for further talks with U.S. Treasury Secretary Scott Bessent. Japan is seeking either the elimination or a reduction of the tariffs, which include a baseline duty of 10 percent and an additional 14 percent country-specific tariff. These tariffs, implemented under President Trump's reciprocal tariff regime, also include a 25 percent tariff on automobiles and other sectors affecting national security. (not investment advice)</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>A U.S. judge issued a temporary restraining order, preventing the Trump administration from enforcing a ban that would have prohibited Harvard University from admitting international students. Judge Allison Burroughs, based in Massachusetts, cited the "immediate and irreparable injury" that Harvard would face if the ban were to take effect. Harvard filed a lawsuit accusing President Trump of a "government vendetta" aimed at stifling free speech, arguing the ban was retaliation for the university exercising its First Amendment rights. Trump has claimed the ban is necessary due to national security concerns and allegations of antisemitism on campus.</p>

        </div>
        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Consumers are increasingly seeking food products with fewer ingredients, driven by concerns about ultra-processed foods (UPF) and a desire for simpler, more recognizable ingredient lists. Retailers and food brands are responding by offering more low-ingredient items, though some nutritionists caution against prioritizing fewer ingredients over nutritional value. The shift has led to a rise in marketing efforts to promote the virtues of less processed foods and justify their higher price points. The trend reflects a broader debate about the health implications of processed foods and the importance of balanced nutrition.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>China has tested the core components of quantum-based network in space to build an integrated space-ground system for ultra-secure communications. A laser module and phase encoding device were tested on a rocket flight reaching 2.5km to assess their robustness against vibration and radiation. This marks a step towards constructing a quantum secure direct communication (QSDC) network, which sends messages directly through a quantum channel without encryption keys. QSDC is considered complementary to quantum key distribution (QKD), offering potentially more efficient and secure communication.</p>

          <p>Harvard University has asked a judge to block President Trump's order that bars foreign students from enrolling. The university claims the order is an escalation of a legal battle between Harvard and the Trump administration. The move is a response to the president's proclamation targeting international students seeking to enroll at Harvard. The university's legal challenge underscores the tensions between academic institutions and the government over immigration policies.</p>

          <p>The California Department of Motor Vehicles (DMV) is cautioning social media users against falling for a fraudulent online advertisement offering discounted vehicle registration renewal services. The deceptive ad requests personal information and payment through Cash App, which is not an official DMV channel. The DMV emphasizes that it never asks for personal information or payment through unofficial channels and advises residents to renew their vehicle registration only through the official DMV website, at a DMV kiosk, or by making an appointment at a DMV office.</p>

          <p>Newly unearthed documents reveal Winston Churchill's concern and frustration over the slow progress in securing penicillin supplies ahead of D-Day. The notes show Churchill's disappointment that the UK was behind the US in producing the "wonder drug," despite it being a British discovery. The Prime Minister's urgency underscored the importance of penicillin in treating expected casualties from the Normandy landings. Despite his efforts, penicillin was not fully available to the general public until 1946, highlighting the wartime prioritization of military needs.</p>

The show pays homage to black performers who were segregated from the country scene, blending Beyonc√©'s biggest hits with tracks from her new album. While the performance was flawless, some fans felt that the stadium setting may not have been the best venue for her new music.</p>
