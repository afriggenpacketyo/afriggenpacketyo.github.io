          <p>A section of a 20-story public housing building in the Bronx, New York City, collapsed Wednesday morning, leaving a corner of the structure in rubble from the roof to the ground floor. The incident, believed to be caused by a gas explosion in an incinerator shaft, resulted in no reported injuries as no residential units were directly affected. City officials, including Mayor Eric Adams, responded to the scene and advised the public to avoid the area while a full assessment is conducted.</p>

          <p>Ford Motor Company reported an 8.2% increase in its third-quarter U.S. sales, largely driven by strong consumer demand for its electric vehicles and larger SUVs. Sales of all-electric models surged by over 30% to a new quarterly record, with the Mustang Mach-E seeing a 51% year-over-year increase. The growth in EV sales was partly attributed to consumers purchasing vehicles ahead of the expiration of federal EV incentives at the end of September.</p>

          <p>Internet connectivity was restored across Afghanistan on Wednesday, ending a nationwide blackout imposed by the Taliban government that lasted more than 48 hours. The unexplained shutdown had crippled the country's communications, banking services, and air traffic control systems. The restoration came as a surprise, following weeks of the Taliban restricting high-speed internet in some provinces to prevent what it termed "immoral activities," and after the UN warned of the outage's severe humanitarian and economic impact.</p>

          <p>A federal judge in Idaho has ruled that a public charter school violated the First Amendment rights of Truth Family Bible Church by terminating its lease for Sunday services. The school, Sage International, canceled the agreement while applying for state-backed bonds, fearing the lease would violate a state amendment preventing public funds from benefiting religious groups. However, the judge determined the cancellation was discriminatory, as the church received no direct funds and the move unconstitutionally stifled its religious speech.</p>

          <p>A major retrospective at the Tate Britain museum in London is celebrating the pioneering work of American photographer Lee Miller (1907-1977). The exhibition traces her remarkable journey from a sought-after Vogue model in New York to a key collaborator in the Parisian surrealist movement alongside Man Ray. It also highlights her groundbreaking role as one of the few female war correspondents during World War II, where her surrealist eye captured the conflict's profound human impact, including her famous photo in Hitler's bathtub.</p>

          <p>To combat the daily "8am scramble" for appointments, every general practitioner's practice in England is now mandated to provide online booking services throughout the workday. The new government rule requires surgeries to allow patients to request non-urgent appointments, ask questions, and describe symptoms online between 8:00 a.m. and 6:30 p.m. on weekdays. While ministers argue the change will modernize the NHS and free up phone lines, the British Medical Association has warned of a potential "online triage tsunami" without proper safeguards.</p>

          <p>In an economy with persistent inflation, certificates of deposit (CDs) offer a way for savers to earn returns that can outpace the inflation rate and preserve buying power. This article provides an overview of current national average CD yields for various terms and lists some of the top rates available, which are significantly higher than the averages. To secure the best rates, it suggests looking at online banks, which have lower overhead, and considering short-term CDs, as the current inverted yield curve means they often offer higher returns than long-term options.
