          <p>Despite a sharp policy divide with the US President Donald Trump dismissing climate change, Chinese President Xi Jinping has unveiled ambitious national strategies to address the issue. China aims to cut its emissions by 7-10% from peak levels by 2035 and increase the share of non-fossil fuels in its energy mix to over 30%, focusing on wind and solar power. Driven by escalating risks of floods, heatwaves, and extreme weather, Beijing is actively re-engineering its urban landscapes and infrastructure to enhance resilience against a hotter and more unpredictable climate future. This proactive approach makes economic sense for the country's long-term stability.</p>

          <p>The fifth episode of "The Celebrity Traitors" saw contestants mired in self-doubt and frustration as they continued to fail in identifying the "Traitors." Following the elimination of another faithful, host Claudia Winkleman sternly criticized the celebrities for their repeated failures. Internally, tensions rose among the Traitors—Alan Carr, Jonathan Ross, and Cat Burns—with Burns expressing suspicions about Ross. The episode culminated in a dramatic tied vote at the roundtable, leaving the next banishment to fate and intensifying the desperate search for the hidden deceivers. Social media users also voiced their exasperation, particularly regarding Jonathan Ross's continued presence in the game.</p>

          <p>Southwest Airlines posted a surprise profit for the third quarter, reporting 11 cents adjusted earnings per share against an anticipated loss, with revenue reaching $6.95 billion, exceeding Wall Street expectations. The carrier further projected record sales for the current fourth quarter, anticipating a 1% to 3% rise in unit revenue, driven by robust travel demand and increased fares. Despite a year-over-year profit decrease, Southwest reaffirmed its full-year earnings outlook and is actively working to boost sales by abandoning long-standing policies like open seating. These strategic shifts aim to improve competitiveness and capitalize on the current strong travel market. (not investment advice)</p>

          <h2>White House Defends East Wing Demolition by Citing Historical Presidential Renovations</h2>

        </div>
        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>The White House is actively pushing back against criticism of President Trump's East Wing demolition by drawing parallels to significant renovations undertaken by previous presidents throughout history. The article details how leaders like Thomas Jefferson, James Monroe, and Theodore Roosevelt all initiated major construction projects, such as colonnades and the West Wing, often facing contemporary scrutiny for cost or design. Franklin D. Roosevelt added the original East Wing, and Harry Truman famously oversaw a complete structural overhaul. By contextualizing Trump's $200 million ballroom project, which is privately funded, the administration aims to frame it as a long-standing tradition of adapting and modernizing the historic presidential residence.</p>

          <p>NFL Commissioner Roger Goodell has confirmed that Bad Bunny will headline the Super Bowl LX halftime show, dismissing criticism from President Donald Trump and his supporters. Goodell defended the choice, emphasizing the Grammy-winning Puerto Rican artist's immense global popularity and the NFL's confidence in delivering a "great show." Bad Bunny, who performs in Spanish and has been vocal in his opposition to Trump's policies, represents a significant cultural moment for the league. Goodell acknowledged that selecting any artist for such a massive platform inevitably draws public scrutiny, but reiterated that the decision was carefully considered to ensure an exciting and unifying entertainment experience.</p>

          <h2>Former Biden Officials Advocate for US Focus on Strategic High-Tech Over Broad Manufacturing Revival</h2>

          <p>Former Biden administration officials advocate for a US industrial policy focused on strategic, cutting-edge technologies rather than a broad manufacturing revival, particularly where the nation lacks competitive advantages. Gina Raimondo, former Commerce Secretary, highlighted the importance of initiatives like the Chips Act for national security, but expressed disagreement with the current Trump administration's ambition to "make everything in America." This discussion is framed by the intensifying US-China competition, prompting a debate on whether the US should emulate parts of China's state-led approach to advanced manufacturing and future industries like AI and biotech. The article underscores a significant policy debate regarding America's economic future.</p>

          <p>Banc of California is significantly expanding its footprint in downtown Los Angeles by leasing 40,000 square feet and securing the prominent naming rights atop a 35-story skyscraper. This strategic move occurs while downtown office landlords are struggling with high vacancy rates, signaling the bank's strong belief in the city's business environment. Now recognized as the largest independent bank headquartered in Los Angeles, Banc of California plans to relocate its downtown offices by the end of summer. This expansion, coupled with recent growth in Beverly Hills and New York City, is designed to elevate the bank's visibility, particularly with the upcoming 2028 Olympics offering a global platform.</p>

          <p>IBM announced third-quarter results that exceeded Wall Street estimates, with revenue climbing 9% to $16.33 billion and adjusted earnings per share reaching $2.65. The company also raised its full-year revenue guidance to "more than" 5% growth and increased its free cash flow estimate to $14 billion, attributing this success to ongoing artificial intelligence tailwinds. Despite these robust financial indicators and CEO Arvind Krishna's report of a rapidly growing AI book of business, the stock surprisingly dropped 5% in extended trading. This reaction may indicate investor caution or profit-taking after a period of strong performance. (not investment advice)</p>

        </div>
        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Data from the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation (FDIC) highlights that traditional savings accounts yield essentially nonexistent returns, averaging only 0.40%, meaning savers are effectively losing money against inflation. Conversely, high-yield savings accounts continue to offer competitive rates, typically in the 4.20% to 4.30% range, with even higher rates potentially available online. This article demonstrates how even modest deposits can accrue hundreds of dollars in interest over a year, with compounding significantly boosting returns over time. Despite variable rates and potential future cuts, these accounts remain a considerably more lucrative option for storing savings compared to their traditional counterparts.

          <h2>Wholesale Turkey Prices Soar Ahead of Thanksgiving Due to Supply Shortages</h2>
          <div class="timestamp">2025-10-22 16:13:00 EDT</div>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Wholesale turkey prices are projected to surge by 40% to $1.32 per pound this Thanksgiving, a substantial increase driven primarily by reduced supply. Avian flu outbreaks have significantly impacted over 3 million turkeys this year, contributing to a 3% decrease in the total number of birds raised by farmers compared to 2024. Despite this wholesale price hike, major retailers such as Walmart and Aldi are proactively offering discounted Butterball turkeys and comprehensive meal deals to attract budget-conscious consumers. Economists predict that while consumer prices might see an uptick, the increase will likely be less dramatic than the wholesale surge, as retailers traditionally use turkeys as "loss leaders" to draw shoppers.</p>

          <h2>Economic Study Predicts Larger Tax Refunds for Americans in 2026 Due to New Tax Law</h2>
          <div class="timestamp">2025-10-22 16:10:49 EDT</div>
        </div>
        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>An economic study by Oxford Economics predicts that many Americans could see significantly larger tax refunds next year when filing their 2025 tax returns. This anticipated increase is attributed to new provisions within the Republicans' "one big, beautiful bill" act, which are retroactive to the start of the current year. Total taxpayer savings could amount to an additional $50 billion, marking an 18% increase from the previous year's refunds. The new law extended tax reductions from 2017 and introduced new breaks, including the elimination of taxes on some overtime and tipped income, and a raised cap on the state and local tax (SALT) deduction. However, analyses indicate that a "disproportionate share" of these benefits will primarily accrue to higher-income households. (not investment advice)</p>
