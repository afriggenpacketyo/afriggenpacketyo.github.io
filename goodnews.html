          <p>Chinese smartphone manufacturer Honor has moved closer to an initial public offering (IPO) on a mainland stock exchange after completing its pre-IPO guidance filing with regulators. This formal step is required for companies seeking to list A-shares in China. The move coincides with a recovering A-share market, which has seen increased activity in the second quarter following a slow start to the year. According to consulting firm Deloitte, this recovery reflects the success of regulatory efforts to boost market confidence and improve the quality of new listings. (not investment advice)</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>NATO members have pledged to more than double their defense spending to 5% of GDP by 2035, a move that is expected to benefit space and defense companies. This commitment is complemented by a new commercial space strategy, recognizing space as a critical operational domain alongside air, land, sea, and cyberspace. The increased funding and strategic focus are creating opportunities for commercial firms, as evidenced by Planet Labs securing a contract with NATO for monitoring capabilities. This shift also fuels the European debate over reducing reliance on SpaceX's Starlink for satellite communications. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>A network of anonymous activists in the UK is conducting covert, unlicensed releases of beavers into the wild, claiming they are "doing God's work" to restore ecosystems. Despite the risk of arrest and fines, they argue the official licensing process is too bureaucratic and slow to address the climate and biodiversity crisis. The National Farmers Union has condemned these actions as irresponsible, citing risks of flooding and damage to crops and land. This movement highlights a growing conflict between grassroots rewilding efforts and established environmental regulations in the country.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>A team of Chinese researchers has developed a "digital embryo," a comprehensive spatiotemporal atlas of early human organogenesis, providing a powerful tool to understand life's foundational stages. Published in the journal Cell, this research maps the intricate process where a single fertilized egg develops into hundreds of cell types that form organs. This stage is crucial for development but is also highly susceptible to defects that can lead to disease. The digital model offers unprecedented insight into how these processes are orchestrated and what can go wrong, advancing the fields of developmental biology and regenerative medicine.</p>

          <p>Tokyo stocks saw a sharp increase, with the Nikkei index rising above the 40,000 mark for the first time in five months. The rally was fueled by easing concerns over US trade policy after the White House indicated President Trump might extend a 90-day pause on reciprocal tariffs. The market was also buoyed by gains in the US Nasdaq index, driven by optimism about demand for artificial intelligence technology. Additionally, a holding ceasefire between Israel and Iran contributed to reduced geopolitical tensions, further supporting positive market sentiment. (not investment advice)</p>

Although previous soil testing in burn scars found elevated lead levels, a dangerous neurotoxin common in wildfire ash, community blood screenings have so far shown very low levels of contamination in residents. Officials continue to urge survivors, especially children and pregnant women who are most vulnerable, to get tested. The concern stems from research showing that urban fires can release significant toxic metals into the environment.</p>
