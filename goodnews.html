          <p>President Donald Trump will pardon reality TV stars Todd and Julie Chrisley, who were sentenced to prison for tax evasion and bank fraud, according to Trump's communications advisor.

The Chrisleys were sentenced in November 2022 to a combined 19 years in prison and ordered to pay $17.8 million in restitution for engaging in a fifteen-year fraud spree. The charges stemmed from providing false information to banks and hiding millions of dollars from the IRS. The optimism score for this article is 75.</p>

This marks the third time this month that a federal judge in Washington has rejected Trump's executive orders against law firms. The order against WilmerHale cited the firm's previous employment of former special counsel Robert Mueller, who led an investigation into potential ties between Russia and Trump's 2016 campaign.

          <p>Stablecoin issuer Circle's upcoming IPO is notable not only for being one of the first significant cryptocurrency companies to go public, but also for its structure, where existing shareholders are selling more shares than the company itself.

          <p>A new COVID-19 variant, NB.1.8.1, is spreading across the U.S. after a surge in Asia, though it is not yet tracked on federal dashboards. While the WHO evaluates the public health risk as low, the variant appears to be more transmissible, with some evidence suggesting it binds more tightly to human cells. Currently-approved COVID shots are expected to remain effective against this variant, but access to vaccines is being limited by the Trump administration. The report notes that The Food and Drug Administration will require vaccine makers to conduct major new clinical trials before approving them for wider use.
