          <p>The Navy reversed its decision to remove 381 books from its libraries after a Pentagon review using standardized search terms for diversity, equity, and inclusion (DEI) titles. The initial removal was based on the Navy's own search terms, which identified a broader range of titles, including works by Maya Angelou and Ibram X. Kendi. However, the Pentagon's review found only about 20 books requiring removal pending further assessment by a Department of Defense panel. Most of the originally pulled books have been returned to circulation, aligning the Navy's policy with the Pentagon's standardized approach.</p>

          <p>Homeowners insurance costs are rising dramatically in states within Tornado Alley, with hail, not tornadoes, being the primary driver of increased premiums. Insurance companies are raising rates due to the growing expenses associated with extreme weather disasters. While tornadoes pose a significant threat to life, hail causes widespread damage across larger areas, breaking windows, tearing off siding, and damaging roofs. Climate change is contributing to more extreme weather, including the potential for larger hailstones, prompting insurers to scale back coverage and increase rates to mitigate risks.</p>

The ship was transporting marble when it likely sprung a leak and sank off the coast of Brigantine Shoal, resulting in the deaths of all five crew members.
