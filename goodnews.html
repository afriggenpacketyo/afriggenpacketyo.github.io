          <p>Silver futures surged to $36.27 per troy ounce, marking the highest price since early 2012, driven by the ongoing rally in gold and increased investor interest in precious metals. The price increase reflects a broader trend of investors seeking safe-haven assets amid economic uncertainty and inflation concerns. The rise in silver prices could impact various industries, including electronics, solar energy, and jewelry, where silver is a key component. The continued demand for silver as both an investment and an industrial metal suggests further price volatility in the near term, although this could be tempered by increased mining output.</p>

          <p>Aaron Rodgers is reportedly ending his time in the wilderness by signing a one-year contract with the Pittsburgh Steelers, according to multiple sources. The move would bring the veteran quarterback to a team in need of an established starter. Rodgers's decision comes after mixed signals about his desire to continue his career, but his arrival in Pittsburgh could significantly impact the team's prospects. The Steelers, without Rodgers, would likely start Mason Rudolph, who recently rejoined the team from the Tennessee Titans, which would be a downgrade from Rodgers.</p>
