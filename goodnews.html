          <p>Novo Nordisk is ending its partnership with Hims & Hers due to concerns about the telehealth company's sales and promotion of cheaper, unapproved versions of Wegovy. Novo Nordisk claims that Hims & Hers has failed to adhere to laws prohibiting mass sales of compounded drugs under the guise of personalization, with deceptive marketing that endangers patient safety. The company's CEO, Andrew Dudum, stated that they believe it's important to maintain independence in treatment choices for patients. Novo Nordisk will continue offering branded Wegovy through telehealth organizations committed to safe and effective medical treatments.</p>

          <p>An analysis suggests that Americans are overwhelmed by choice, contributing to the appeal of leaders who offer relief from decision-making burdens. The concept of "choice idolatry" is explored, questioning whether freedom has become synonymous with an endless number of options. The historical development of choice is traced from the 17th century to the present, highlighting the moral costs and anxieties associated with it. The piece argues for a reevaluation of choice, suggesting that it may be a distraction from what truly matters, such as the common good and moral principles.</p>
