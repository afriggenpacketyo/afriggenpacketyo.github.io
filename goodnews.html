          <h2>Cyber Attack Disrupts Exam Revision for Edinburgh Students</h2>

          <p>An attempted cyber attack on Edinburgh Council's education department disrupted pupils' revision ahead of key exams, leading to password resets for all users across the education service. Staff identified a suspicious meeting invitation as a spear-phishing attempt and took immediate precautionary measures. While the council assures that no data was compromised and students sitting exams will receive priority support, the incident caused considerable disruption as students were temporarily unable to access school learning resources. The council provided alternative arrangements for students to access their revision materials by visiting their school on Saturday to obtain a new password.</p>

          <p>EPA Administrator Lee Zeldin, the first Jewish head of the agency, affixed a mezuza to his office door, prompting praise and criticism. While many Jewish religious leaders lauded Zeldin for celebrating his identity, Jewish environmental activists questioned his role in weakening environmental regulations. They argue that his actions contradict the Jewish value of tikkun olam, the obligation to repair the world. Zeldin defended his policies, stating they are based on law, obligations, and science, not religious interpretations, while others defended Zeldin's actions and dismissed the criticism by Jewish environmental leaders.</p>
