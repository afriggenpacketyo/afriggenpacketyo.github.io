          <p>China's J-20 stealth fighter has reportedly tripled its radar detection range due to advancements in silicon-carbide semiconductor technology led by scientist Xu Xiangang. The development, according to Shandong University, allows Chinese radars to swiftly detect enemies and gain a strategic advantage. This "Chinese chip" is crucial for national security, enhancing radar range, missile accuracy, and laser weapon power. The J-20, a twin-engine stealth fighter, entered active service in March 2017 and is viewed as China's counterpart to the American F-22 Raptor.</p>
