          <p>President Trump announced that May 8 will be recognized as World War II "Victory Day" in the United States, aligning with the "Victory in Europe Day" already celebrated by many allies since the German surrender in 1945. Trump emphasized America's significant role in achieving victory and noted that November 11 will also be recognized as World War I "Victory Day." Former President Harry Truman had previously declared August 14 as "Victory Over Japan Day" in 1946, but the U.S. currently lacks specific public holidays commemorating World War II. This move aims to celebrate and remember the country's victories in both World Wars, according to Trump. Optimism in this context is measured by the value of reflection and remembrance, even in times of discord.</p>

          <p>More than 90 countries, including Japan, have called for preserving the memories of the atomic bombings during a U.N. meeting in preparation for the upcoming nuclear disarmament review conference. Led by Japan, the joint statement emphasizes the importance of testimonies from those who experienced the devastation caused by nuclear attacks, highlighting the contributions of the atomic bomb survivors' group Nihon Hidankyo. The statement warns that as time passes, firsthand accounts become increasingly rare, making each remaining testimony more precious. The initiative encourages all members of the Nuclear Non-Proliferation Treaty (NPT) to ensure these stories are preserved and passed on to future generations.</p>

          <p>China is showing signs of easing its unofficial ban on K-pop acts, potentially signaling a shift to boost domestic consumption and foster regional goodwill. Analysts suggest K-pop is viewed as a tariff-proof sector, with revenue drivers like streaming, concerts, and fan content being digital and intangible. The move could also be a diplomatic strategy to restore ties with neighboring countries, including South Korea. K-pop stocks may benefit from China's reopening, with the country potentially accounting for a significant portion of concert revenue if restrictions are lifted. This article discusses the economic and diplomatic implications of China's changing stance on K-pop.</p>

          <p>Temu, owned by PDD Holdings, is revising its US business model in response to tariffs imposed by President Trump and the end of the "de minimis" duty exemption policy. The platform is shifting to a "local fulfilment model," with all sales to American customers now handled by locally-based sellers. Temu has been actively recruiting US sellers to join the platform, and the company states that the operational change will not affect pricing for US consumers. This adjustment comes amid speculation that Temu may phase out China-based merchants, requiring them to establish operations in the US or cease selling to American shoppers.</p>

          <p>Shell reported stronger-than-expected first-quarter profit and announced another $3.5 billion share buyback program. The company's adjusted earnings for the first three months of the year were $5.58 billion, surpassing analyst expectations. Despite earnings falling compared to the same period last year, Shell's CEO, Wael Sawan, described the results as "another solid set of results." The buyback program marks the 14th consecutive quarter of at least $3 billion in buybacks, reflecting Shell's commitment to increasing shareholder returns and cutting spending, particularly in its liquified natural gas (LNG) push.

          <p>A federal judge has permanently barred the Trump administration from using the Alien Enemies Act to deport Venezuelans deemed criminals from the Southern District of Texas, calling the White House's use of the statute illegal. Judge Rodriguez's ruling rejects the attempt to apply the 1798 law, intended for times of war or invasion, to modern immigration policy. The judge determined that the act's language does not align with Trump's claims about the activities of the Tren de Aragua gang. While the ruling applies only to Venezuelan immigrants in the Southern District of Texas, it could influence other cases involving the use of the Alien Enemies Act.</p>

The tariff, implemented by President Trump, led customers to rush purchases of hybrid and sport-utility vehicles. While this last-minute buying boosted sales, the outlook for the auto market remains uncertain as it may reduce future demand.
