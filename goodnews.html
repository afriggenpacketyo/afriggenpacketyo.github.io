          <h2>Mark Cuban Shares Lessons from His First Failed Business Venture</h2>
          <div class="timestamp">2025-07-28 09:15:02 EDT</div>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Renowned investor Mark Cuban shared insights from his first business venture, a powdered milk sales operation launched at age 24 with less than $20, which failed within a month. Despite the setback, Cuban learned a crucial lesson: success requires only being right once, regardless of prior failures. He advises aspiring entrepreneurs lacking capital to prioritize "sweat equity" by offering services that align with their skills and market demand. Cuban also highlighted artificial intelligence as a key area, suggesting one could learn prompt engineering with free AI chatbots and then teach small businesses to enhance profitability. This approach emphasizes resourcefulness and adaptability in starting a venture.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>U.S. Trade Representative Jamieson Greer has set a cautious tone for the ongoing third round of trade talks with China in Sweden, indicating that no "enormous breakthrough" is expected. Greer views China's participation as a positive sign, but stated the primary focus would be on monitoring and implementing existing agreements. A key point of discussion is the potential extension of the current 90-day tariff pause, which is set to expire on August 12. Despite the measured expectations, Greer affirmed the U.S. desire to move forward constructively, reiterating President Trump's willingness to maintain tariffs if favorable deals are not achieved.</p>

          <h2>Current Mortgage and Refinance Interest Rates Overview</h2>
          <div class="timestamp">2025-07-28 09:10:38 EDT</div>
        </div>
        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>As of July 25, 2025, the national average for a 30-year mortgage stands at 6.79%, with 15-year mortgages averaging 6.01%. Refinance rates are slightly higher, at 6.84% for 30-year and 6.17% for 15-year terms, according to Bankrate data. While current interest rates are higher than in previous years, the article advises that borrowers with strong credit profiles can still secure favorable options, particularly if the Federal Reserve's rate hikes stabilize. Key strategies include improving credit scores, comparing offers from multiple lenders, and carefully assessing loan terms and fees to optimize long-term costs. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>Thailand and Cambodia have reached an agreement for an "immediate and unconditional" ceasefire, effective midnight July 28, aimed at ending the deadly border clashes that have claimed at least 35 lives and displaced over 260,000 people. Malaysian Prime Minister Anwar Ibrahim facilitated the crucial talks, with both Cambodian Prime Minister Hun Manet and Thai Acting Prime Minister Phumtham Wechayachai expressing commitment to de-escalation and peace. The resolution was significantly influenced by direct pressure from U.S. President Donald Trump, who had warned of potential repercussions on trade deals if the conflict persisted. This accord represents a vital initial step towards restoring stability and security along the long-disputed frontier.</p>

          <p>As of July 25, 2025, the national average savings account interest rate is 0.38%, as reported by the FDIC, though high-yield savings accounts offer substantially higher returns, typically between 4.11% and 4.30%. The article strongly recommends choosing high-yield accounts, particularly those offered by online banks, which often provide better rates due to reduced operating costs. These accounts are generally accessible with low minimum deposit requirements and no monthly fees, making them ideal for emergency funds. Thoroughly comparing various online high-yield options is essential to ensure maximum interest earnings for one's savings. (not investment advice)</p>
