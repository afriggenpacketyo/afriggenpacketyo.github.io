The company has seen significant success with its Pavilia Forest project, a joint venture with Far East Consortium, generating over HK$4.2 billion from the sale of more than 600 flats. Additionally, NWD has sold 500 units across its Deep Water Pavilia projects, accumulating nearly HK$8.8 billion in sales. These results highlight robust demand for high-end properties in the region, bolstering the developer's financial position. (not investment advice)</p>

The company is proceeding with another $3.5 billion in share buybacks, continuing a consistent trend of shareholder returns for the 15th consecutive quarter. This performance follows a strategic update in March aimed at prioritizing value creation, cost savings, and simplifying operations, which has been well-received by investors. Shell's stock has consequently outperformed several of its major U.S. and European competitors this year. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>The crew of China's Shenzhou-19 mission revealed that their record-breaking spacewalk included an unexpected and challenging repair task outside their spacecraft. Astronaut Cai Xuzhe stated that a payload adaptor, a critical docking mechanism for external experiments and maintenance, became jammed during a cargo installation procedure. Lacking specialized tools and with limited time, the astronauts had to collaborate with the ground team to devise and execute an unrehearsed solution. This successful improvisation highlights the crew's resourcefulness and the robustness of China's crewed spaceflight operations.</p>

The aircraft, which belonged to a Navy squadron that trains F-35 pilots, went down on Wednesday evening, and the cause of the incident is now under investigation. The crash resulted in a small grass fire that burned approximately a dozen acres but did not affect any other personnel.

          <p>Shares of South Korean shipbuilder Hanwha Ocean surged over 16% to their highest point since 2015 after the announcement of a new trade deal between the U.S. and South Korea. The deal sets a 15% tariff on Korean exports, and Hanwha Group, which acquired Philly Shipyard last year, is expected to play a key role in revitalizing U.S. shipbuilding. The stock's rise was also fueled by a strong second-quarter operating profit of 371.7 billion won, a significant turnaround from a loss a year ago. The company also announced new orders and initiatives to enhance its global competitiveness. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>Despite President Trump imposing 25% duties on Indian imports, New Delhi has not rushed to finalize a trade agreement with Washington. India's resistance is rooted in protecting its agricultural sector, a critical domestic political issue, from increased U.S. market access, a concession it also avoided in a recent deal with the U.K. Analysts suggest the U.S. has a strategic interest in not alienating India, viewing it as a key partner in the Indo-Pacific and a manufacturing alternative to China. India is pursuing a "multi-alignment" strategy, advancing trade talks with other partners like the EU to diversify its economic relationships and strengthen its negotiating position.

The attacking midfielder, who first trained with the senior squad at 14, has shown significant potential in friendlies against AC Milan and Newcastle. His performance against Newcastle was particularly noteworthy, as he won a decisive penalty after a skillful dribble, securing a 3-2 victory for Arsenal. Manager Mikel Arteta praised the young player's special talent and composure against a top-tier opponent, signaling a bright future for the England youth international.</p>

          <p>The Los Angeles Dodgers initiated their trade deadline activity with a minor three-team deal involving the Cincinnati Reds and Tampa Bay Rays. The Dodgers acquired pitching prospect Adam Serwinowski from the Reds, along with reliever Paul Gervase and catcher Ben Rortvedt from the Rays, while sending minor league catcher Hunter Feduccia to Tampa Bay. Serwinowski, a 21-year-old left-hander, is considered the most promising asset from the trade. Despite this move, the team is reportedly still actively pursuing more significant additions, prioritizing bullpen help and a defensive upgrade in the outfield before Thursday's deadline.</p>

          <p>The United States and South Korea have finalized a trade agreement that sets a 15% tariff on South Korean exports, a reduction from the 25% rate President Trump had previously threatened. As part of the deal, South Korea will invest $350 billion in key U.S. industries and purchase $100 billion in American liquefied natural gas. However, interpretations of the deal differ, with U.S. officials claiming 90% of investment profits will go to Americans, a point contested by Seoul. South Korean President Lee Jae Myung framed the investment as a way to boost his country's companies in U.S. markets like shipbuilding and semiconductors.</p>

          <p>California Governor Gavin Newsom has signed into law a controversial bill that increases penalties for soliciting 16- and 17-year-old minors for sex. The new law, AB 379, allows prosecutors the discretion to charge offenders who are at least three years older than the minor with a felony on a first offense. The legislation faced debate among Democrats, with some raising concerns that related provisions could be used to profile minority groups. The final version represents a compromise and also establishes a support fund for survivors, financed by increased fines on offenders.</p>

A source close to Harris indicated that while she seriously considered the run, her heart wasn't in it, and she feels she can have more impact on a national stage.
