          <p>Excel Parking, a UK car park operator, has been ordered to pay £10,240 to the Access to Justice Foundation charity after losing a court appeal for a second time against Hannah Robinson. The firm had relentlessly pursued Miss Robinson for thousands of pounds, based on its controversial "five-minute payment rule" which was widely criticized and eventually banned by the private parking sector. The district judge found Excel's conduct in the litigation to be "unreasonable and out of the norm," dismissing their claims and mandating the payment of legal costs to the charity as Miss Robinson had free representation. This case serves as a significant victory for consumer rights, encouraging others to challenge unfair parking charges and stand up against aggressive practices.</p>

          <p>A federal judge has issued an indefinite halt to new construction and barred any new detainees from being transferred to Florida's "Alligator Alcatraz" immigration detention facility, siding with environmental groups. The ruling, a significant setback for the Trump administration's hardline immigration agenda, emphasizes the critical need to uphold environmental protections for the ecologically sensitive Everglades and its diverse wildlife. Despite the Department of Homeland Security criticizing the judge as an "activist" and asserting the land was already developed, the court underscored that the order merely upholds existing environmental legislation. Florida's state government has already filed an appeal, signaling a continued legal and political dispute over the facility's operations and expansion.</p>

          <p>Ether (ETH) has reached a new record high, marking its first since 2021, following Federal Reserve Chair Jerome Powell's dovish speech from Jackson Hole, Wyoming, which hinted at potential interest rate cuts. This announcement triggered a "panicked repositioning" within the crypto market, resulting in approximately $120 million in short liquidations for ETH within an hour, as traders were compelled to buy back the asset, further escalating its price. Shares of companies focused on accumulating ether experienced significant jumps, reversing recent declines. This development underscores ether's growing leadership in the crypto market, a trend catalyzed by favorable regulatory tailwinds and increasing institutional interest in stablecoins, a majority of which operate on the Ethereum blockchain.

          <p>The Consulate General of India has officially signed a 10-year lease for a full floor within downtown Los Angeles' AON Center, marking the establishment of its second consulate office in California. This strategic move signifies a deliberate effort to expand cooperation and strengthen ties between Los Angeles and India, especially in anticipation of Southern California hosting major global events such as the 2028 Olympics and portions of the 2026 FIFA World Cup. The new diplomatic presence aims to enhance accessibility for the more than half a million Indian Americans residing in the region and to foster increased trade, investment, and cultural connections, even in the context of recent US tariffs on Indian imported goods.</p>

This announcement signifies a substantial advancement in Meta's ambitious push into augmented reality and wearable technology, even though the company is setting modest sales expectations due to the device's inherent complexity and slightly increased weight. The accompanying wristband, developed by Meta's CTRL Labs, will utilize sEMG sensor technology for intuitive gesture control, a crucial input method for future, more advanced full AR glasses. Meta is actively engaging with generative AI developers to create experimental applications, aiming to generate excitement for these new devices and further propel its Reality Labs unit.</p>

He was elected to Parliament in a 1982 by-election following the assassination of his predecessor, Rev Robert Bradford. Remembered for his unwavering principles, staunch conservative views, and quiet yet profound influence, he commanded immense respect within the unionist community. Mike Nesbitt, the UUP leader, affirmed that Smyth's "imprint will last forever" on local politics.</p>
