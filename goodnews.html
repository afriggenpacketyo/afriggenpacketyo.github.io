          <p>Two men have been sentenced to jail for stealing a ¬£4.8 million gold toilet from an art exhibition at Blenheim Palace in September 2019. James 'Jimmy' Sheen pleaded guilty to burglary and related charges, while Michael Jones was found guilty of burglary; they received sentences of four years and two years and three months, respectively. Sheen's DNA was found at the scene, along with incriminating messages on his phone detailing the sale of the stolen gold. The messages used coded language, including Romany slang and cockney rhyming slang, to discuss the valuable toilet, which Sheen confirmed he possessed, and he referred to the gold as "car," and the messages indicated that the car (gold) is as good as money. The audacious heist involved smashing into the palace and ripping out the functional, 18-carat solid gold toilet. The article highlights the investigative work required to decipher the criminals' code and bring them to justice.</p>

          <p>The IPO market is showing signs of a strong rebound in June 2025, with successful public debuts from companies like Chime, Voyager Technologies, and Circle. This resurgence is encouraging more companies to consider going public, leading to potential upside for investment banking divisions within firms like Goldman Sachs and Wells Fargo. While geopolitical tensions, such as Israel's attack on Iran, and unpredictable trade policies could cause volatility, the IPO market is on track to outpace May's activity. A better second half of 2025 would be welcome news for banks that rely heavily on dealmaking revenues, the growing capital markets business at Wells Fargo may also benefit. The article suggests that while risks remain, the IPO market is gaining momentum after a rocky start to the year (not investment advice).</p>

          <p>A 28-year-old student missed her Air India flight due to heavy traffic, only to later discover that the flight crashed shortly after takeoff, killing almost everyone on board. Bhoomi Chauhan, who was visiting western India, said airline staff didn't allow her to check in despite having checked in online, because she arrived less than an hour before departure. Frustrated, she left the airport and later received a call informing her about the plane crash, calling it a miracle. The jet, carrying 242 people, crashed into buildings in Ahmedabad, killing all but one person, and the cause of the crash is under investigation.</p>

          <p>Simone Biles apologized for making personal remarks about Riley Gaines in an online exchange regarding transgender athlete participation in sports, even as conservative media figures continued to attack the gymnast. Biles had initially criticized Gaines for misgendering a transgender softball player, but later expressed regret for singling out an underage player and stated that empathy and respect are needed. The apology came after Gaines lashed out at Biles for her comments, leading to a clash between the two. Despite the apology, the backlash from the American right continued, with some criticizing Biles' mental health advocacy and calling her "mentally weak," but Biles stood by her broader point that sports organizations have a responsibility to create inclusive rules while maintaining fair competition.</p>

          <p>Archer Aviation's stock dropped as much as 15% after the air taxi maker announced it sold $850 million worth of shares. The company plans to use the financing to support new infrastructure, an AI-based aviation software platform, and its Launch Edition program, including an air taxi service for the 2028 Olympics in Los Angeles. Archer said the funding round gives the company a pro forma liquidity position of roughly $2 billion, and the stock offering follows President Trump's executive order creating a pilot program to support eVTOL vehicle development. Archer has partnered with United Airlines to roll out an airport air taxi service, and the United Arab Emirates will be the company's first launch market (not investment advice).</p>

          <p>Sen. Josh Hawley has announced that reauthorization and expansion of the Radiation Exposure Compensation Act (RECA) will be included in the Senate's version of the "One Big Beautiful Bill." This expansion would allow individuals in regions of Missouri, Tennessee, Kentucky, and Alaska, as well as "downwinders," to be compensated for exposure to toxic waste. The proposal also allows for claims to be used for increased levels of atmospheric testing and adds uranium mine workers who worked in the mines from 1971-1990 to be eligible for benefits, and Hawley calls the inclusion a "huge step forward" in securing compensation for affected individuals. The Senate still needs to maneuver these provisions through the Senate's procedural rules test as well as the finnicky Senate GOP conference.</p>

          <p>Consumer sentiment rebounded in early June as pessimism about the economy and inflation eased, according to a University of Michigan survey. The headline index of consumer sentiment was at 60.5, exceeding expectations, and the one-year inflation outlook tumbled from levels not seen since 1981. Consumers appear to have adjusted to the shock of high tariffs announced in April, although concerns about the impact of tariffs on prices and geopolitical issues persist. The Michigan survey had been an outlier on inflation fears, with other indicators showing a more contained outlook, and economists still largely expect the tariffs to show impact in the coming months (not investment advice).</p>

Some readers said that payment would prevent them from donating, while others suggested better ways to attract more donors, such as convenient locations and opening times, and the majority of respondents said they were happy to donate for free.</p>
