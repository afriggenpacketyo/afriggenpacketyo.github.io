          <p>A bronze statue of Melania Trump, erected near her hometown of Sevnica, Slovenia, has been stolen, with only the hacked-off feet remaining. The life-size sculpture, a replacement for a wooden statue that was set on fire in 2020, stood in a field outside Sevnica. Residents suspect vandalism or melting for cash, but do not believe it was politically motivated. The statue was commissioned by American artist Brad Downey as an interrogation of President Trump's stance on immigration, but was derided by locals as unesthetic. </p>

          <p>A new genetic study has traced the migration of the first people to colonize the Americas from modern-day Russia 20,000 to 30,000 years ago. The study, published in Science, suggests that the languages and traditions of Indigenous groups living in the Americas today can be traced back to these early settlers. Researchers sequenced the genomes of 1,537 individuals from 139 ethnic groups in northern Eurasia and the Americas, revealing insights into population history, migration, and adaptation over thousands of years. The study also found that early settlers split into distinct groups that became isolated in different environmental settings, affecting the health of modern South Americans.</p>

Hatton, after pulling his tee shot into a creek, was heard swearing at his driver. Both golfers are likely to face fines for their behavior, and it is not the first time Hatton's temper has been seen on the course.</p>

This potential move follows the company's earlier announcement of shutting down seven vehicle plants and cutting 20,000 jobs globally after reporting a net loss of 670.90 billion yen for fiscal 2024. The plants under consideration include the main Oppama plant, a pioneer in electric vehicle production, and the Shonan plant of Nissan Shatai Co., which manufactures commercial vehicles.

The UAE is looking to diversify its economy away from fossil fuels and sees Africa as an essential part of the plan.
