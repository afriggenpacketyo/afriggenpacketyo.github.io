          <p>Los Angeles Dodgers pitcher Blake Snell delivered a commanding performance, striking out ten batters over five scoreless innings in a 9-1 victory against the Toronto Blue Jays. This outing marks a strong return for the two-time Cy Young winner, who has now accumulated 18 strikeouts in 10 innings since rejoining the team from the injured list. The Dodgers' offense was powered by home runs from Max Muncy and Shohei Ohtani, who hit his 40th of the season. The win solidifies the Dodgers' rotation, which now appears to be at full strength heading toward the postseason.</p>

          <p>Los Angeles Rams quarterback Matthew Stafford completed an extensive workout, throwing over 60 passes as he recovers from a back injury. Coach Sean McVay described the session as a positive step, noting that Stafford threw without limitations and felt good afterward. The 37-year-old quarterback, who is dealing with an aggravated disc issue, is expected to gradually return to practice next week, initially participating only in individual drills. The team remains hopeful for his return, though his participation in a now-canceled joint practice with the Chargers had already been ruled out as a precaution.</p>

          <p>Dallas Cowboys star receiver CeeDee Lamb was inadvertently leveled by a field official during a preseason game against the Los Angeles Rams, despite not playing in the game. While standing on the sidelines in street clothes, Lamb was struck from behind by a sprinting official who was watching the play unfold. Although Lamb was uninjured and laughed off the incident, the Cowboys received a 15-yard unsportsmanlike conduct penalty for a non-player making contact with an official. The penalty negated part of a long gain Dallas had acquired on the same play.</p>

          <p>The luxury fashion industry is pivoting from the subtle "quiet luxury" trend back to more conspicuous, logo-driven "loud luxury" in an effort to re-energize consumer interest. Following a post-COVID slowdown, brands like Gucci, Burberry, and Versace are introducing new creative directors and bolder designs to combat soft sales and shopper fatigue. While ultra-high-end brands like Hermes and Loro Piana have remained resilient, many others are struggling to justify pandemic-era price hikes. This strategic shift aims to reignite brand desirability and capture a broader market by making luxury more visible and statement-oriented. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>Jen Pawol made Major League Baseball history on Saturday, becoming the first woman to umpire a regular-season game. She served as the first-base umpire in the matchup between the Atlanta Braves and the Miami Marlins, receiving a warm ovation from the crowd. The 48-year-old, who has been umpiring in the minor leagues since 2016, enjoyed a relatively quiet debut with no controversial calls. Following the game, Pawol donated the cap she wore during her historic debut to the National Baseball Hall of Fame and Museum to commemorate the milestone.</p>

          <h2>Experts Question Health Claims of Booming Wellness Drink Market</h2>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>The market for functional wellness drinks, which promise benefits like stress relief and relaxation, is booming, but experts are skeptical about their efficacy. An advertisement by Trip, a popular brand, was recently banned for making unsubstantiated health claims about stress and anxiety. Nutritionists and dietitians argue that the small amounts of supplements like Lion's Mane mushroom or L-theanine in these beverages are unlikely to produce significant effects. A psychologist suggests that any calming effect may be a placebo, resulting from the ritual of taking a moment for oneself rather than the ingredients in the can.</p>

          <p>Ali Akbar, believed to be the last newspaper hawker in France, is set to receive the National Order of Merit, one of the country's highest honors. For over 50 years, the 72-year-old has been a beloved figure in Paris's Saint-Germain neighborhood, selling newspapers on the street. Akbar has witnessed the decline of his trade firsthand, from selling 80 papers an hour in the pre-internet era to around 30 per day now, but continues for the joy and independence it brings. President Emmanuel Macron, who once bought papers from Akbar as a student, will present the award.</p>

          <p>A recent comment by singer Ed Sheeran, who described himself as "culturally Irish" despite being born and raised in England, has ignited a conversation about the complexities of cultural identity in 2025. Sheeran defended his connection, citing his Irish grandparents, passport, and formative musical experiences in Ireland. The debate touches on the evolving nature of Irishness, especially for the diaspora in Britain, where identity is no longer a simple binary choice. Experts note that for many second-generation individuals, cultural identity is a deeply personal feeling that transcends citizenship or birthplace, reflecting a blend of heritages.</p>

          <p>Six months after the Chinese AI app DeepSeek-R1 shocked Silicon Valley with its impressive capabilities and low development cost, its long-term impact remains a topic of debate. The app's release challenged the "bigger is better" philosophy of AI development, suggesting that smarter engineering could rival massive computational power. While DeepSeek forced a reevaluation of American AI dominance and is still used by some cash-strapped startups, the industry's major players appear to have returned to a strategy of massive spending on data centers and talent. Security concerns regarding DeepSeek's Chinese origins also continue to limit its widespread adoption in the West.</p>
