        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>A significant heat wave is predicted to affect much of the eastern United States, bringing several days of record high temperatures. The National Weather Service has issued extreme heat alerts for over 140 million Americans, with the total number affected by heat advisories reaching 200 million. Potential daily record highs are expected in the Rockies and Plains before the heat shifts to the Midwest and East Coast. Authorities are urging residents to stay indoors with air conditioning and to avoid strenuous outdoor activities to prevent heat-related illnesses, as extreme heat can be deadly. The National Weather Service has warned of major to extreme heat risk in the Midwest and East Coast. </p>

          <h2>Experts Claim U.S. Sunscreens are Less Effective Than Those Abroad</h2>
          <div class="timestamp">2025-06-21 10:00:11 EDT</div>
        </div>
        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>As a heatwave impacts the U.S., experts suggest that American sunscreens may not be as effective as those available in other countries, particularly in blocking UVA rays. This is attributed to regulatory differences, as the FDA has not approved new UV-filters for sunscreen in over 20 years. Countries like France and South Korea have approved a wider range of UV-filtering ingredients, allowing for more advanced sunscreens. A bipartisan bill in Congress aims to modernize sunscreen regulations, but dermatologists still stress the importance of wearing sunscreen daily with an SPF of 30 or higher. The FDA maintains that many sunscreens available in the U.S. provide excellent broad-spectrum coverage. </p>

          <p>Photographer Miora Rajaonary is raising awareness of female genital schistosomiasis (FGS), a neglected tropical disease affecting millions of women and girls in Africa, through a photo exhibit titled "Sahy Rano." The exhibit features portraits of women who have contracted FGS, which is spread by parasitic worms in contaminated water. The women in the portraits wear traditional Malagasy face masks to emphasize their courage in breaking taboos and speaking publicly about the disease. The images aim to highlight the disease's impact on women's sexual and reproductive health and the stigma associated with its STD-like symptoms. The work was supported by the End Fund, a philanthropy that works to prevent the spread of neglected tropical diseases.</p>

          <p>A federal appellate court has blocked a Louisiana law requiring the Ten Commandments to be posted in public school classrooms, deeming it unconstitutional. Civil liberties groups argued the mandate violates the separation of church and state and would isolate non-Christian students. The ruling stems from a lawsuit filed by parents from various religious backgrounds, challenging the law's constitutionality under the First Amendment. Louisiana plans to appeal the ruling, potentially taking it to the U.S. Supreme Court. Similar laws have been challenged in other states, including Arkansas and Texas.</p>

          <p>Vox highlights five reasons to be grateful for air conditioning, emphasizing its importance beyond mere comfort. Air conditioning saves lives by preventing heat-related deaths, keeps people productive at work and school, and improves sleep quality. It has also enabled the development of energy-intensive industries and allowed millions to live and travel in hot climates. While acknowledging the environmental impact of air conditioning, the article argues for better, more efficient units powered by cleaner energy, rather than eliminating it altogether. The piece suggests that air conditioning has become a necessity, especially in a warming world.</p>

          <p>Sue Baker, a patient with a failing heart and an LVAD, underwent a first-of-its-kind heart-liver transplant to address high antibody levels that increased the risk of organ rejection. The liver transplant was performed alongside the heart transplant to lower the risk of rejection, a solution that had not been attempted before in someone with an LVAD. After a long recovery, Baker resumed her life, but faced tragedy when her husband died suddenly. Despite financial challenges, Baker hopes her participation in the surgery will pave the way for more patients to receive lifesaving treatment. Another surgery like Baker's was already conducted, and that another is in the works.</p>

          <p>China has successfully tested its home-grown operating system, OpenHarmony, in space, marking a significant step towards reducing reliance on foreign software. The in-orbit testing was conducted aboard the Dalian-1 Lianli CubeSat, which delivered faster data updates and improved stability compared to previous setups. The mission achieved a fully home-grown hardware-software solution, offering a new option for spacecraft operating systems. Following the Lianli mission, national technical standards have been proposed to guide the broader adoption of OpenHarmony in small satellites. The development is spurred by US sanctions on Huawei, leading China to seek technological self-reliance.</p>
