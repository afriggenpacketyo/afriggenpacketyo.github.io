          <p>Washington Nationals center fielder Jacob Young made two extraordinary defensive plays that were instrumental in his team's 3-2 victory over the New York Mets. In the fifth inning, Young prevented an extra-base hit with a juggling, "hacky-sack" style catch where he kicked the ball back into the air with his foot after it was jarred from his glove. He followed this in the ninth inning with a leaping grab at the wall to rob Francisco Álvarez of a potential game-tying home run, dealing a significant blow to the Mets' wildcard playoff hopes.</p>

          <p>South Korean President Lee Jae Myung has indicated he would support a deal between Donald Trump and Kim Jong Un that involves freezing North Korea's nuclear weapons production as an interim step. In an interview with the BBC, Lee described such a freeze as a "feasible, realistic alternative" to the stalled long-term goal of complete denuclearization, given Pyongyang's ongoing weapons development. He expressed hope that the mutual trust between Trump and Kim could be leveraged to resume negotiations and reduce regional tensions.</p>

          <p>Week 3 of the NFL season featured several dramatic finishes, including a wild 33-26 Philadelphia Eagles victory over the Los Angeles Rams sealed by a blocked field goal returned for a touchdown as time expired.

          <p>A security camera at a high school in Summersville, West Virginia, captured the moment the school's principal, James Marsh, discovered a black bear trapped inside a dumpster. The video shows Marsh unlocking the container, startling both himself and the bear, which quickly climbs out and flees in the opposite direction. The incident serves as a reminder of the increasing frequency of human-wildlife encounters as natural habitats shrink, highlighting the importance of securing food and trash to avoid attracting animals into urban areas.</p>

          <p>The Los Angeles Police Department has announced it will increase its presence around synagogues and other Jewish community centers during the High Holy Days, which begin with Rosh Hashana. The move is intended to deter crime and provide reassurance amid a rise in antisemitic attacks across the country following the start of the Israel-Hamas war. Mayor Karen Bass stated that antisemitism is unacceptable in the city and thanked the LAPD for taking proactive measures to protect Jewish Angelenos during this important period.</p>

          <p>Manchester City manager Pep Guardiola adopted an uncharacteristically defensive 5-5-0 formation that nearly secured a victory against Arsenal, but a 93rd-minute equalizer from Gabriel Martinelli resulted in a 1-1 draw. After taking an early lead through Erling Haaland, City ceded possession and focused on defense, a tactic that frustrated Arsenal for most of the match. The result leaves both teams trailing league leaders Liverpool, with analysts noting that City's fatigue from a packed schedule likely influenced Guardiola's conservative strategy.</p>

The deal is being negotiated to comply with a U.S. law requiring TikTok's Chinese parent company, ByteDance, to divest its American arm due to national security concerns.</p>

          <p>Max Verstappen's dominant victory at the Azerbaijan Grand Prix has intensified the Formula 1 championship race, while McLaren's drivers faced a challenging weekend. Lando Norris managed a seventh-place finish but could not fully capitalize on teammate Oscar Piastri's uncharacteristic errors, which included a crash in qualifying and another in the race. Analysts suggest that while Norris did his best under difficult circumstances, a qualifying misjudgment may have cost him a better result, narrowing the points gap but leaving him with an uphill battle for the title.</p>
