          <p>Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing Company (TSMC) reported a record-breaking second-quarter profit, surging by nearly 61% year-on-year, primarily fueled by the sustained strong demand for artificial intelligence chips. The world's largest contract chip manufacturer also projected a substantial 38% year-over-year increase in third-quarter revenue, underscoring its pivotal position in the AI industry. TSMC's high-performance computing division, encompassing AI and 5G applications, contributed a dominant 60% to its second-quarter revenue. However, the company acknowledges potential challenges from U.S. trade policies, including proposed tariffs and existing export controls that could impact its business, particularly with China.</p>

          <p>Andre Correa do Lago, Brazil's chief negotiator for the upcoming UN climate talks (COP), highlights the increasing challenge of maintaining climate change's relevance amidst global conflicts, trade disputes, and right-wing political shifts. He asserts that despite these distractions, climate change continues to advance, manifesting in intensified heatwaves, wildfires, and floods worldwide. Correa do Lago's objective for the summit, held in the Amazon, is to mainstream climate action into broader economic and financial policies, believing it can spur growth and employment. While acknowledging the complexity, he maintains optimism that the 1.5 degrees Celsius warming limit remains achievable with collective international effort.</p>

          <h2>Volvo Cars Shares Jump Despite Profit Decline Amid Tariff Challenges</h2>

          <p>Shares of Sweden's Volvo Cars climbed over 10% after its second-quarter operating profit surpassed analyst forecasts, despite a substantial year-on-year decline to 2.9 billion Swedish kronor. The automaker, owned by China's Geely Holding, attributed the profit drop partly to a non-cash impairment charge and a difficult industry landscape. In response to U.S. tariffs, Volvo Cars is re-evaluating its American market strategy, planning to shift XC60 SUV production to its South Carolina plant by late 2026 and discontinue certain sedan and station wagon models. CEO Håkan Samuelsson emphasized the company's long-term commitment to the U.S. market, aiming to maximize factory utilization.</p>

          <p>Kai Trump, the granddaughter of former President Donald Trump, has verbally committed to play college golf at the University of Miami starting in 2026, expressing a 100% desire to become a professional golfer. Having begun playing at age two, she is dedicated to rigorous practice, participating in more events, and physical training to reach the next level. Despite her significant social media presence, Trump prioritizes golf above all else once she enters college. She recently secured an NIL partnership with Accelerator Active Energy, becoming their first golf NIL partner and an equity partner, attributing her competitive drive to a “family gene” that she believes is crucial for her professional aspirations.</p>

          <h2>Former Official Predicts US-China Trade Deal May Mirror Trump's Phase One Agreement</h2>

          <p>Stephen Biegun, who served as Deputy Secretary of State under Donald Trump, anticipates that a future US-China trade agreement will broadly mirror the “phase one” deal from 2020. That prior agreement stipulated China's commitment to purchasing an additional $200 billion worth of American goods and services over two years, though it was largely unfulfilled due to the pandemic. US Treasury Secretary Scott Bessent, leading current negotiations, views the phase one deal as a “road map,” acknowledging China's need to “pay a certain price” to rebalance the trade relationship. This aligns with the US president's emphasis on trade balance as a primary indicator of economic fairness.</p>

          <p>Las Vegas Sands has initiated construction on an $8 billion “ultra luxurious” integrated resort in Singapore, significantly expanding the city's iconic Marina Bay Sands. This new development, though often called the “fourth tower,” is a distinct building featuring a 55-story all-suite resort, high-end retail, gaming amenities, and 200,000 square feet of meeting space. A prominent feature will be the 76,000 square-foot rooftop Skyloop, offering public observation decks, restaurants, and exclusive infinity pools for hotel guests. Designed by Safdie Architects, this project aligns with Singapore's “Tourism 2040” strategy, aiming to triple tourism revenue by attracting both business and leisure travelers.</p>

          <p>Elon Musk's ventures in India, Tesla and Starlink, are finally gaining significant traction, with Tesla opening its first Mumbai showroom and Starlink securing regulatory approval for commercial services. This strategic pivot offers Musk new growth opportunities amidst complicated relationships in China and the U.S., while aligning with India's “Make in India” initiative. Tesla is initially targeting the premium vehicle market, with potential future investments in local EV manufacturing. Starlink aims to provide internet access to underserved rural areas, likely through government and institutional partnerships due to its higher cost. This renewed focus on India follows Musk's recent public disagreements with Donald Trump, suggesting a broader global diversification strategy.</p>

          <p>Rihanna stars as Smurfette in the new animated musical film “Smurfs,” drawing attention to the “Smurfette principle,” a long-standing pop culture trope. Coined in 1991, this principle describes the common pattern of a single female character surrounded by an otherwise all-male cast, observed across various popular universes. While the new film aims to empower Smurfette, previous attempts to address her original sexist backstory and introduce more female characters have drawn criticism for potentially reinforcing gender stereotypes. Beyond gender issues, the Smurfs brand is also confronting challenges from its unauthorized use by far-right groups in Germany, prompting the rights holder to issue a strong public condemnation.</p>

          <p>Nvidia CEO Jensen Huang has stated his intent to sell more advanced chips to China, beyond the recently unbanned H20 AI chip, emphasizing that technology's continuous evolution should permit increasingly sophisticated products for the Chinese market. Nvidia has been caught in the crosshairs of U.S.-China trade and tech tensions, which previously forced it to develop export-compliant chips like the H20, leading to a significant $4.5 billion inventory writedown. Huang consistently advocates for American companies to engage in China's burgeoning AI market, which he estimates could reach $50 billion, warning that Chinese competitors like Huawei are poised to fill any void left by U.S. restrictions.</p>

          <p>Emirates Flight EK382, originating from Dubai, was diverted to Kaohsiung International Airport in Taiwan after its crew encountered difficulties and was unable to successfully land in Hong Kong. Flight data reveals that the Boeing 777-31H(ER) aircraft executed at least two unsuccessful landing attempts and circled the Hong Kong area before being rerouted. All passengers and crew spent the night in Kaohsiung before completing their journey to Hong Kong the next day. Aviation observers suggest that adverse weather conditions, specifically sustained winds of around 12 knots, were a likely contributing factor to the landing challenges experienced by the article's flight.</p>

          <p>Prince Harry has visited Angola to support the Halo Trust, a landmine clearance charity, following directly in the footsteps of his mother, Princess Diana, whose iconic 1997 visit raised global awareness for the cause. The Duke of Sussex emphasized that “children should never have to live in fear of playing outside or walking to school,” as he met families living near a minefield and observed educational sessions on avoiding explosives. The Halo Trust has successfully cleared 120,000 landmines in Angola, a legacy of years of civil war, yet approximately a thousand minefields still pose a threat. Harry's visit underscores the ongoing humanitarian effort and his commitment to this vital work.</p>
