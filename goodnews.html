          <h2>US Trade Court Blocks Trump's Tariffs, Prompting Immediate Appeal</h2>
          <div class="timestamp">2025-05-28 22:05:54 EDT</div>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>A US federal court has blocked President Donald Trump's sweeping tariffs, ruling that the emergency law invoked by the White House does not grant the president unilateral authority to impose tariffs on nearly every country. The court stated that the US Constitution reserves the power to regulate commerce with other nations for Congress. The Trump administration immediately lodged an appeal. The lawsuit was filed by the nonpartisan Liberty Justice Center on behalf of five small businesses that import goods from countries targeted by the duties, marking the first major legal challenge to Trump's "Liberation Day" tariffs. The New York attorney general welcomed the decision, asserting that no president has the power to unilaterally raise taxes. Optimism surrounding this ruling is tempered by the understanding that the Trump administration is appealing the ruling.</p>

          <p>A Salvadorian immigrant family made three attempts to cross the Rainbow Bridge into Canada, seeking asylum from potential US deportations. Despite initial rejections due to document discrepancies, they eventually succeeded with legal assistance. The family's story highlights a rise in asylum seekers fleeing not only their homelands but also President Trump's immigration policies. While the number of people attempting to cross into the United States from Canada has decreased, the number of asylum seekers being denied entry into Canada from the US has increased, with stricter border policies and increased removals being implemented by the Canadian government. Despite this, the CBSA maintains that their policies and processes have not changed.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>A federal court has ruled that President Donald Trump exceeded his authority with his reciprocal tariffs, dealing a blow to a major tenet of the president's economic agenda. The U.S. Court of International Trade found that the International Emergency Economic Powers Act does not grant the president the power to unilaterally implement the sweeping duties. The Trump administration swiftly appealed the ruling. The court stated that the tariffs exceeded any authority granted to the president by the emergency powers law, and the ruling triggered retaliatory measures, inflated prices on essential goods, and placed an unfair burden on American families and small businesses (not investment advice).</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>The government has announced that two major new reservoir projects in East Anglia and south Lincolnshire will be fast-tracked to shore up England's water supplies. The projects have been declared "nationally significant," allowing them to speed through the planning process, though they could still be over a decade away from completion. The government intends to pass legislation to automatically make the other seven proposed reservoirs "nationally significant" too. Some experts warn that managing how we use water needs to take greater precedence in a warming climate, and like any major project, the new reservoirs could prove unpopular with local communities.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>A federal court has ruled that President Donald Trump's tariffs are illegal, citing constitutional limits on Congress's ability to empower the president to impose tariffs. The US Court of International Trade argued that Trump surpassed these limits and that several federal trade laws place rigid constraints on Trump‚Äôs ability to continue his trade war. The decision is broad, arguing that the Constitution places fairly strict limits on Congress‚Äôs ability to empower the president to impose tariffs in the first place. The three-judge panel unanimously agreed that Trump‚Äôs tariffs, as they stand now, are illegal, and the decision can be appealed up to the Supreme Court.</p>

          <p>Golden eagles are venturing back into England from the south of Scotland after years of absence, raising hopes they might nest. A young male named Talla was spotted in Northumberland, marking a significant milestone. The resurgence is thanks to the South of Scotland Golden Eagle Project (SSGEP), which has translocated juveniles and sub-adults from the Scottish Highlands. Golden eagles were wiped out in England and Wales by the mid-19th Century due to persecution, and the SSGEP hopes to establish a population in areas like the Lake District or the Northumberland Uplands.</p>

Trump has also taken a harsher approach to Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu, and officials are increasingly optimistic about brokering a nuclear agreement with Iran.

          <p>A federal judge in Massachusetts has ordered the Trump administration to lift a pause it imposed on various immigration applications, saying it was not in the public interest for hundreds of thousands of immigrants to lose their legal status in the U.S. The ruling is a reprieve for many immigrants from Afghanistan, Latin America, Ukraine and other parts of the world whose ability to remain and work in the U.S. lawfully had been threatened by several Trump administration actions. Talwani directed the Trump administration to end a pause it quietly enacted in February to suspend the processing of immigration benefit applications filed by immigrants allowed into the U.S. under several Biden administration programs that relied on the parole authority.</p>
