          <p>Following his death at age 91, industry experts are highlighting Giorgio Armani's dual legacy as both a revolutionary designer and a masterful business leader. Armani was celebrated for creating the "power suit," which redefined professional attire for both men and women, and for pioneering the use of celebrity endorsements on the red carpet. By maintaining full ownership of his multibillion-dollar empire, he ensured a consistent and sophisticated vision across all his brand extensions, from haute couture to home furnishings.</p>

          <p>A federal judge has dismissed Newsmax's antitrust lawsuit against Fox News, labeling it an impermissible "shotgun complaint" for its structure. The suit alleged that Fox News engaged in monopolistic practices to suppress conservative media competitors. Judge Aileen Cannon's ruling allows Newsmax to refile an amended complaint by next week, making the dismissal a procedural setback rather than a final judgment on the merits of the case.</p>

          <p>An employment tribunal in the UK has ruled that spending less than an hour of work time on personal online shopping is not a valid reason for dismissal. An accountancy administrator, who was fired after spyware tracked her browsing on sites like Amazon, was awarded over £14,000. The judge determined her personal use was not "excessive" and noted that the employer had no clear policy against it and that the business owner also used work computers for personal reasons.</p>

          <p>A financial advice article outlines strategies for protecting an inheritance from becoming community property in the event of a divorce. The columnist explains that funds from an inheritance should be kept in separate accounts and not commingled with marital assets. Specific caution is advised regarding retirement accounts like IRAs and 401(k)s, as rules under the Employee Retirement Income Security Act (ERISA) and state community property laws can vary and may grant a spouse rights to those funds.

          <p>Four-time Super Bowl champion Rob Gronkowski believes that rookie quarterbacks today are more prepared to start immediately in the NFL than in previous eras. He attributes this readiness to the advanced knowledge and training they receive at the collegiate level, which allows them to quickly adapt to professional playbooks. However, Gronkowski also noted the value of learning behind an experienced veteran, citing the situation of rookie Jaxson Dart, who will be backing up Russell Wilson, as beneficial for long-term career development.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>With the Federal Reserve expected to continue cutting interest rates, savers with maturing certificates of deposit (CDs) face a less favorable environment. Financial advisors suggest exploring several alternatives to simply rolling over a CD at a lower rate. Options include moving funds to a high-yield savings account or a money market account, which offer competitive rates and more liquidity, or locking in a new long-term CD to secure a fixed rate against future market declines.

          <p>Broadcom's stock increased by nearly 11% after the company reported strong earnings and announced it had secured a fourth major customer for its custom AI chips, widely believed to be OpenAI. CEO Hock Tan also revealed over $10 billion in new orders for AI racks and extended his contract through 2030, boosting investor confidence. This new business was not factored into previous forecasts, meaning that even as the stock price rises, its valuation relative to future earnings remains attractive. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>Following a weaker-than-expected August jobs report, the average rate for a 30-year fixed mortgage fell significantly to 6.29%, its lowest point since October of the previous year. This 16-basis-point drop is the largest one-day decrease since August 2024, providing some relief to prospective homebuyers facing high property prices. A lower rate can reduce a monthly mortgage payment by a notable amount, though it remains uncertain if this decline will be substantial enough to reinvigorate housing market demand.
