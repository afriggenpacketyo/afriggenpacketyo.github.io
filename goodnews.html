An official stated that Putin expressed a desire to meet, and Trump is reportedly open to the idea, provided that Putin also meets with Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky. This development comes as a US-imposed deadline for a ceasefire in Ukraine approaches, with the administration still considering sanctions against Russia.</p>

          <p>Following pressure from President Donald Trump regarding tariffs on foreign-made goods, Apple has announced plans to increase its investment in the United States by an additional $100 billion. This new commitment, which will be formally announced at the White House, is intended to encourage more of the company's supply chain to operate domestically. The move is seen by analysts as a strategic effort by Apple to avoid significant tariffs on its products, particularly as the administration continues to emphasize reshoring manufacturing to the U.S. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>Two decades after Hurricane Katrina devastated New Orleans, a report revisits the city's public defender system, finding vast improvements born from the storm's wreckage. Before the hurricane, the system was already broken, and the storm's aftermath caused a total collapse of the city's courts, leaving incarcerated individuals in limbo. However, this catastrophic failure created an opportunity for a complete overhaul, leading to changes that had been needed for decades and ultimately resulting in a significantly improved system for providing legal defense to the indigent.</p>

          <p>Shopify's stock soared 21% after the e-commerce company reported second-quarter results that significantly beat analyst expectations and offered strong guidance for the upcoming quarter. Revenue grew 31% year-over-year to $2.68 billion, and the company projects continued growth in the mid-to-high twenties percentage range. The positive performance suggests Shopify is effectively navigating the turbulent macroeconomic environment, with its CFO noting that a feared negative impact from U.S. tariffs on its merchants "did not materialize" as consumer demand remained strong.

          <p>Amazon's self-driving vehicle unit, Zoox, has cleared a significant regulatory hurdle, receiving an exemption from certain federal motor vehicle safety standards from the National Highway Traffic Safety Administration (NHTSA). This is the first time such an exemption has been granted to a U.S.-built vehicle under a newly expanded program designed to accelerate autonomous vehicle deployment. The decision also closes a safety probe into Zoox's self-certification, paving the way for the company to expand its robotaxi demonstrations and move closer to commercial service.</p>

          <p>A zoo in the Czech Republic has announced the birth of four rare Barbary lion cubs, a subspecies that is extinct in the wild. The cubs—three females and one male—are part of an international endangered species program aimed at preserving the breed in captivity with the long-term goal of reintroducing them to their native habitat in North Africa. While officials say a reintroduction is still a distant prospect, preliminary talks have begun with Moroccan authorities to explore the feasibility of returning the majestic lions to the Atlas Mountains.</p>
