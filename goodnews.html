          <p>Treasury Secretary Scott Bessent indicated that U.S.-China trade talks have stalled, necessitating direct engagement between President Trump and President Xi Jinping. Bessent noted that further discussions are expected in the coming weeks, possibly including a call between the leaders. Despite a recent agreement in Switzerland to roll back tariff increases for 90 days, disagreements persist over tech restrictions on Beijing and China's limitations on rare earths. Bessent expressed confidence that China would engage constructively once President Trump communicates his preferences, emphasizing the importance of the leaders' relationship in resolving the complex trade issues. Optimism for a resolution remains contingent on high-level intervention. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>Bernard Kerik, the former New York City police commissioner who gained prominence after 9/11, has died at the age of 69 after battling an illness.

President Donald Trump pardoned Kerik in 2020, after which Kerik became a vocal critic of the criminal justice system and an ally of Trump, working with Rudy Giuliani to investigate claims of election fraud after the 2020 election.</p>

          <p>Coastal rail service connecting Orange and San Diego counties is scheduled to resume on June 7 after nearly six weeks of repairs to reinforce tracks vulnerable to landslides and coastal erosion. The California Coastal Commission approved emergency construction, involving the placement of 5,900 tons of boulders and 240,000 cubic yards of sand to stabilize the rail line. The Orange County Transportation Authority (OCTA) estimates the project's total cost at approximately $300 million. The OCTA acknowledged the repeated disruptions to passenger rail service due to eroding bluffs, which have forced closures of the line for over 125 years, and work will continue daily until the reopening date.</p>

          <p>China has developed the world's first AI nuclear inspector, a technology disclosed in a peer-reviewed paper by researchers at the China Institute of Atomic Energy (CIAE). The project aims to enhance Beijing's position in international disarmament talks but faces challenges including training the AI with sensitive nuclear data, ensuring the system does not leak technological secrets, and persuading other nations to abandon Cold War-era verification methods. The AI's development is based on a protocol proposed by Chinese and American scientists over a decade ago. The CIAE team acknowledged the classified nature of nuclear warheads, preventing the disclosure of specific data used in the AI's development.</p>

Shigeoka, who lost a split decision to Pedro Taduran, suffered a right subdural hematoma and began losing consciousness after the fight. The Japan Boxing Commission rules prevent a boxer who has had a craniotomy from holding a professional license, meaning Shigeoka will have to retire from the sport.

          <h2>Costco Exceeds Earnings Estimates Amid Tariff Challenges</h2>

          <p>Costco reported earnings and revenue that exceeded expectations, with sales jumping 8% year-over-year, although shares dipped slightly. The company's leaders discussed challenges and higher costs related to tariffs, which are raising economic worries and potentially consumer prices. Costco has looked for ways to reduce tariff costs while keeping prices low, such as rerouting goods, sourcing more items locally, and negotiating with suppliers. The retailer is also absorbing some tariff-related cost differences while raising prices on more discretionary items. (not investment advice)</p>
