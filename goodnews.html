          <p>An article discusses the significant decline in cancer death rates in the United States since 1991, attributing it to advancements in treatment, earlier screening, and anti-smoking policies. The age-adjusted death rate for cancer has decreased by approximately one-third, resulting in an estimated 4 million fewer cancer deaths, which the article attributes in large part to the HPV vaccine. Breakthroughs in treatments such as autologous stem-cell harvesting and CAR-T therapy have also contributed to increased survival rates, even for difficult cancers like multiple myeloma. While challenges remain, the future of cancer treatment is improving, offering patients more hope and a better quality of life.</p>

          <p>Morgan Stanley upgraded MP Materials, a rare earth miner, due to its strategic importance to the U.S. amid geopolitical tensions with China. The investment bank believes that MP Materials, which owns the only operating rare earth mine in the U.S., is well-positioned to benefit from government support and the development of a fully domestic rare earth supply chain. The article notes that Beijing has imposed export restrictions on rare earth elements, and that MP Materials plans to begin commercial production of magnets used in electric vehicles and humanoid robots.

While delaying Social Security can result in higher monthly payments, the article cautions that this strategy overlooks the opportunity cost of 401(k) investments and the potential for compounding returns. It suggests that for some individuals, taking Social Security early and allowing their 401(k) to continue growing may be a more advantageous approach.

          <p>The article explores the debate around time limits for federal rental assistance, using the Delaware State Housing Authority as a case study. Delaware's program includes a seven-year time limit, a work requirement, and a savings incentive, with tenants able to save money and build a savings account. However, housing policy experts warn that time limits and work requirements may not boost employment or help people move off subsidies, while the severe lack of affordable housing complicates the case for time limits. The success in Delaware hinges on the savings accounts and extra support provided to tenants, rather than the time limit itself.</p>
