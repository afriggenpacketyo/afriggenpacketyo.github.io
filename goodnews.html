          <div class="timestamp">2025-06-28 22:59:52 EDT</div>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>The UK government has announced a new partnership with food retailers and manufacturers in England to encourage healthier eating habits and combat rising obesity rates. Under the voluntary plan, businesses will be asked to find ways to make healthy options more appealing, such as through promotions, loyalty point incentives, or product reformulation. The initiative, which is part of a broader 10-year NHS plan, will require major retailers to report on healthy food sales to increase accountability. Critics note that the success of past voluntary schemes has been mixed and stress that the higher cost of healthy food remains a significant barrier for many families.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>In response to China's halt on rare earth exports, international efforts to establish alternative production sources are gaining momentum, though they face significant financial and technical hurdles. US-based firm REalloys is collaborating with a Canadian research council on a project to produce high-performance magnet materials using ore from Brazil, aiming to reduce reliance on China's dominant market position. Analysts suggest that building out a competitive, non-Chinese supply chain will be a costly and lengthy process. This move may ultimately require government subsidies and tariffs to protect new production facilities from the established scale of Chinese competitors. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>A new pilot program in Kent, England, is teaching primary school children as young as five about sun safety to help reduce future skin cancer cases. The initiative, which is planned for a nationwide rollout, educates pupils on reading UV indexes and applying sunscreen, aiming to instill lifelong protective habits. Health experts emphasize the importance of early education, as sunburn in childhood significantly increases the risk of melanoma, the most serious skin cancer, later in life. The program comes as Cancer Research UK projects a rise in melanoma diagnoses, highlighting the urgent need for preventative public health measures.</p>

          <p>Japan has successfully launched its 50th and final H2A rocket, marking the end of a 24-year era for the country's space program. The rocket, developed by Mitsubishi Heavy Industries and JAXA, lifted off from Tanegashima Island, placing a government satellite for monitoring greenhouse gases into orbit. The H2A series, which had a 98% success rate over its career, has been a reliable workhorse for Japan's space exploration efforts. It is now being replaced by the next-generation H3 rocket, which is designed to be more cost-competitive in the increasingly crowded global satellite-launch market.</p>

          <p>An estimated crowd of over 100,000 people participated in the Budapest Pride march, turning the event into a significant display of defiance against Prime Minister Viktor Orban's government. The turnout was substantially larger than in previous years, with many attendees motivated by the government's recent attempts to ban the event under a controversial "child protection" law. Budapest's mayor, Gergely Karacsony, addressed the crowd, framing the successful march as a victory for freedom over a "hateful power." The event celebrated LGBTQ+ rights while also serving as a broader protest for human rights and solidarity in Hungary's restrictive political climate.</p>

          <p>Top trade negotiators from Japan and the United States have agreed to continue discussions on tariffs, though significant differences reportedly persist. The talks, held in Washington, aim to forge a mutually beneficial trade deal, but key areas of disagreement include the U.S. treatment of Japan's automotive industry, a critical component of the Japanese economy. Both sides described the discussions as "fruitful" and covered topics such as trade expansion, non-tariff barriers, and broader economic security cooperation. However, a final agreement has not yet been reached as a July deadline looms. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>Israel's ambassador to Japan, Gilad Cohen, has confirmed that he will attend the upcoming peace ceremony in Nagasaki, which commemorates the 1945 U.S. atomic bombing of the city.

Ambassador Cohen stated that he received a direct invitation from Nagasaki's mayor and that his attendance is intended to show respect for the Japanese people and a mutual understanding of the importance of peace. The decision signifies a mending of relations between Israel and the city's organizers regarding the highly symbolic annual remembrance event.</p>

He notably unleashed a 101.7-mph fastball, the fastest of his MLB career, demonstrating that his arm strength is returning to an elite level.

          <p>According to renowned computer scientist Harry Shum, China is rapidly closing the technology gap with the United States in artificial intelligence algorithms, despite still lagging significantly in advanced chip technology. The former head of AI at Microsoft stated that while the U.S. maintains a clear lead in AI chips, a gap that will take years to bridge, Chinese firms are making major strides in algorithm engineering. He cited the Chinese start-up DeepSeek, which has achieved results comparable to top Western competitors at a fraction of the cost and with far less computing power, as a key example of this innovative progress.</p>

          <p>Bain, a member of the K-pop group Just B, has become one of the few idols in the industry to come out as gay, doing so publicly during a concert in Los Angeles. In an interview, the 24-year-old star discussed the personal toll of hiding his identity in South Korea's conservative entertainment world and the risk he took by coming out. While attitudes in South Korea are slowly changing, homosexuality remains a taboo subject, and few celebrities have been public about their sexuality. Bain's announcement has been largely celebrated by international fans and the LGBTQ community, marking a potentially significant moment for representation in K-pop.</p>
