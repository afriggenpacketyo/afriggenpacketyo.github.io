          <p>Ximena Arias Cristobal, a 19-year-old college student, was released from ICE custody after being detained following a mistaken traffic stop in Georgia. Despite the local charges being dismissed, ICE initiated deportation proceedings against her, arguing she is in the U.S. illegally. Community members and a Republican lawmaker supported her release, citing her time in the U.S. since age four and lack of a criminal record. While released on bond, Arias Cristobal still faces deportation to Mexico, highlighting the Trump administration's broader immigration crackdown that targets undocumented immigrants regardless of criminal history.</p>

          <p>Justin Halstenberg was convicted of purposefully igniting the Line fire in Southern California, which burned 44,000 acres and injured six firefighters. He was found guilty of aggravated arson and possession of flammable materials, facing a life sentence. Halstenberg became a suspect after his truck was linked to the fire's origin, and prosecutors accused him of deliberately starting three fires within an hour. The Line fire forced over 11,000 residents to evacuate and damaged multiple properties. Prosecutors presented evidence that Halstenberg practiced starting fires using an ignition device similar to one found at the fire's start.</p>

The Bank of Japan is considering pausing its rate hike posture to assess the impact of U.S. tariffs. Governor Kazuo Ueda has signaled intentions to raise rates based on price trends but acknowledges the need to monitor tariff effects. Economists expect core inflation to ease in the coming months due to lower crude oil prices and yen appreciation. The core inflation figure excludes volatile fresh food prices.</p>
