          <h2>Euro Zone Economy Shows Slight Growth in Second Quarter, Exceeding Expectations</h2>
          <div class="timestamp">2025-07-30 05:23:10 EDT</div>
        </div>
        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>The euro zone's economy grew by a modest 0.1% in the second quarter, narrowly avoiding stagnation and surpassing economists' expectations for a flat performance. This slow growth comes as Germany, the bloc's largest economy, experienced a slight 0.1% contraction during the same period, influenced by lower investment in machinery and construction. The data reflects a complex economic environment, with factors like U.S. tariffs creating uncertainty for European industries. Despite the better-than-expected overall figure, the sharp slowdown from the previous quarter's 0.6% expansion highlights ongoing economic challenges facing the region. (not investment advice)</p>

          <h2>The Importance of Federal Reserve Independence Amid Presidential Pressure</h2>
          <div class="timestamp">2025-07-30 05:01:00 EDT</div>

          <p>Recent public pressure from President Trump on the Federal Reserve to cut interest rates has highlighted the critical importance of the central bank's independence. This article explores the historical context of presidential influence on the Fed, contrasting Trump's unprecedented tactics with past examples like President Nixon's pressure on then-Chair Arthur Burns, which some economists believe contributed to the high inflation of the 1970s. Experts emphasize that the Fed's ability to make unpopular but necessary decisions, such as raising rates to curb inflation, is essential for long-term economic stability. An independent Fed maintains credibility with financial markets and avoids politically motivated policies that could lead to negative economic outcomes.</p>

          <h2>Opinion: White House Plan to Use Artificial Intelligence for Immigration Enforcement is a Necessary Weapon</h2>
          <div class="timestamp">2025-07-30 05:00:48 EDT</div>
        </div>
        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>A new White House action plan positions artificial intelligence as a key tool for enhancing U.S. immigration enforcement and national security. This opinion article argues that AI can accelerate the processing of cases, improve identity verification, and help clear bureaucratic backlogs, thereby strengthening border security and enabling mass deportations. The author contends that integrating AI is an operational necessity to modernize a system still reliant on paper files. The piece also stresses the need for statutory guardrails to ensure these technologies are permanently tied to enforcement outcomes, rather than being used to facilitate mass entry under a different administration.</p>

          <h2>New Report Finds No Evidence of Widespread Noncitizen Voting in US Elections</h2>

          <p>Despite persistent claims from political figures, new research confirms that voting by non-U.S. citizens is extremely rare and not a significant threat to the integrity of American elections. A comprehensive review by the Center for Election Innovation & Research found that state-level investigations, even in regions actively searching for such cases, have uncovered only a minuscule number of instances. The report details how allegations of widespread noncitizen voting often stem from misunderstandings of voter data or are politically motivated fabrications. Experts note that the severe legal consequences, including deportation, serve as a powerful deterrent for noncitizens considering voting illegally.</p>

          <h2>The Surprising and Evolving History of the Word 'Dude'</h2>
          <div class="timestamp">2025-07-30 05:00:00 EDT</div>
        </div>
        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>The word 'dude' has a rich and complex history stretching back over 100 years, far from its modern surfer-skater connotations. Linguists trace its origins to 1880s New York City, where it was a somewhat derogatory term for young, fashion-obsessed men who emulated a flamboyant, Anglophile lifestyle. The term later evolved to describe East Coast city dwellers visiting western 'dude ranches' in elaborate cowboy attire. In the mid-20th century, it was adopted by African American and Mexican American communities as a marker of solidarity before eventually entering mainstream culture. Today, the word has largely lost its gendered and stylistic specificity, serving as a familiar term of address.</p>

          <h2>Study Finds Some European Songbirds 'Divorce' After Breeding Season</h2>
          <div class="timestamp">2025-07-30 05:00:00 EDT</div>
        </div>
        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>New research on the Great Tit, a European songbird, reveals that some avian couples effectively 'divorce' by separating after the breeding season. Using radio tags to track the birds' social interactions at feeders, scientists at the University of Oxford observed that while many pairs remained together through the winter, others began to drift apart. These 'divorcing' birds associated with each other less and less as winter progressed, suggesting they were forming new social bonds ahead of the next breeding season. The study highlights the complex and significant role of social behavior in the animal kingdom, showing that pair-bond dynamics are not exclusive to humans.</p>

The EU code aims to outline how companies can meet the requirements of the landmark AI Act regarding safety, transparency, and security. While Google expressed hope that its endorsement would promote access to new AI tools, it also shared concerns that the regulations could slow innovation and harm Europe's competitiveness. Meta had previously criticized the code as an overreach that would stifle the industry, highlighting a growing split among Big Tech companies on how to approach AI regulation.</p>

Shaw stated that for much of his time at United, the atmosphere has been 'extremely negative.' He believes Amorim's insistence on 100% effort and his willingness to sideline any player not meeting his standards, regardless of their status, is what the team needs. Shaw emphasized that senior players must also step up to reinforce these new standards to foster a more positive and successful team culture.</p>

          <p>South Korean battery manufacturer LG Energy Solution has secured a major $4.3 billion contract to supply batteries to an undisclosed major corporation. According to a filing, the deal will run until the end of July 2030, with the customer's identity remaining confidential for business reasons, though reports have suggested the counterparty is Tesla. The contract value is larger than the company's entire revenue for the second quarter of this year. This deal is expected to be one of LG's largest for lithium iron phosphate batteries, likely tied to its new manufacturing hub in Michigan, signaling growing traction in the U.S. energy storage market.

          <p>Australia's headline inflation rate fell to 2.1% in the second quarter, its lowest level since March 2021 and just within the Reserve Bank of Australia's (RBA) target range. The slowdown was more significant than economists had predicted and strengthens the case for the RBA to cut its policy interest rate at its upcoming meeting. The figures showed that price rises in housing and food were partially offset by a fall in transport costs. Analysts believe this data provides sufficient evidence for a rate cut, especially given a weaker global growth backdrop and a rising domestic unemployment rate. (not investment advice)</p>
