          <p>A federal judge has issued a preliminary injunction against the Trump administration, preventing them from revoking Harvard University's ability to enroll international students. The ruling bars the government from cutting off Harvard's access to the Student and Exchange Visitor Information System, a federal database for student visa applications. The Department of Homeland Security had previously threatened to revoke Harvard's certification, citing alleged failures in addressing campus antisemitism. This legal battle is part of a broader conflict between Harvard and the Trump administration, including demands for policy changes and threats to cut off billions in grants. </p>

          <p>A federal judge in New Jersey ordered the release of Columbia University activist Mahmoud Khalil from Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE) detention. The judge determined that Khalil is not a threat or flight risk, deeming his detention "highly unusual".

CEO Rick Cardenas noted that consumers are still spending on casual dining and that Darden is gaining market share from fast food and fast casual restaurants.

          <p>The interest-earning potential of CDs and money market accounts is similar, but not identical, particularly in the current rate environment. CD rates vary based on the lender and term length, while money market accounts have variable rates. Currently, money market account rates top out around 4.32%, while the highest rates on CDs are topping out around 4.49% for 6-month CDs, while declining slightly for longer terms. Savers should consider the guaranteed interest of a CD versus the potential for higher earnings with a money market account, or split their funds between both. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>The average monthly Social Security benefit for retired workers has surpassed $2,000 for the first time, reaching $2,002.39 this summer.

While COLA aims to keep pace with inflation, experts note that it may not fully cover rising expenses, such as healthcare and insurance. Factors like Medicare premiums, taxes, and income brackets can also reduce the actual amount retirees receive. </p>

          <p>The trend of adding protein to virtually every food product has reached extreme levels in America, from protein-infused ice tea to protein-fortified pale ale. Food companies are capitalizing on the perception that protein is synonymous with health, even if the added protein provides dubious benefits and introduces health risks. This trend has led to the proliferation of protein-enhanced versions of everyday foods, with the average American adult regularly exceeding the recommended daily protein intake. While some experts believe a higher protein intake is beneficial, others caution against excessive consumption, noting that many protein-enhanced products are simply unhealthy items with added protein. </p>
