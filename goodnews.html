          <p>At a state banquet at Windsor Castle, King Charles praised President Trump's commitment to resolving global conflicts and urged continued US support for Ukraine. In response, President Trump lauded the "special relationship" between the two nations, stating the term doesn't fully capture its strength. The event, part of Trump's historic second state visit, aimed to reinforce diplomatic, cultural, and economic links, attended by political figures and tech industry leaders. The day included traditional royal pageantry, a private meeting with the Prince and Princess of Wales, and the exchange of official gifts.</p>

          <p>The state visit of President Donald Trump and First Lady Melania Trump to the UK has highlighted the role of "fashion diplomacy," with the attire of the principal figures drawing significant attention. Melania Trump's choices, including a dramatic wide-brimmed hat and a bold yellow gown for the state banquet, were noted for their style and potential messaging. Similarly, the Princess of Wales wore a striking gold couture gown and the historic Lover's Knot Tiara, while Queen Camilla's sapphire blue dress coordinated with King Charles's attire. These carefully selected outfits are seen as a form of soft power, sending diplomatic signals and contributing to the pageantry of the high-profile visit.</p>

          <p>Nscale, a London-based AI infrastructure startup that emerged from stealth only last year, has rapidly become a central player in Europe's AI development with significant new partnerships and funding. The company announced a $6.2 billion agreement with Microsoft to develop hyperscale AI infrastructure and received a £500 million equity investment from Nvidia, whose CEO praised the startup as a potential "national champion." Nscale is focused on addressing Europe's computing capacity shortage and is a key partner in the continent's push for "sovereign AI." The announcements coincided with President Trump's state visit to the UK, highlighting major US tech investment in the region. (not investment advice)</p>

The announcement, which includes a £90 billion commitment from private equity firm Blackstone, is intended to showcase the economic benefits of the US-UK relationship and placate critics of the visit. The investment is projected to create over 7,600 jobs in sectors like clean energy and technology. This focus on economic partnership serves as the government's primary justification for hosting the controversial US leader for a second time. (not investment advice)</p>

The company priced its shares at $23.50, raising $800 million and valuing the company at $8.1 billion, but the stock closed at $22. The IPO follows a resurgence in the live events market post-pandemic, which has boosted the company's revenues from major concert tours and sporting events. StubHub's public debut is the latest in a recent series of tech offerings, indicating a potential rebound in the IPO market after several slow years. (not investment advice)</p>

          <h2>Analysis Questions Value of Lavish, Isolated UK State Visit for President Trump</h2>

          <p>An analysis of President Trump's UK state visit likens the event to "The Truman Show," a lavish and isolated spectacle carefully shielded from the public and potential protesters. The elaborate pageantry at Windsor Castle, while appearing to impress the president, lacked the public engagement typical of such visits due to security concerns. The article questions whether the significant effort and expense will yield tangible benefits for the UK in terms of trade, tech deals, or foreign policy concessions. The true return on this investment in royal diplomacy will become clearer as the business and political discussions of the visit conclude.</p>

          <h2>Federal Reserve Enacts Quarter-Point Interest Rate Cut Amid Slowing Labor Market</h2>
          <div class="timestamp">2025-09-17 16:20:47 EDT</div>
        </div>
        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>The Federal Reserve has lowered its benchmark interest rate by 0.25 percentage points to a target range of 4% to 4.25%, the first reduction since December 2024. The move is a response to a cooling U.S. labor market and slower economic growth, signaling that supporting employment has become a more pressing concern than inflation. Projections from Fed officials indicate two more cuts may occur in 2025, though opinions within the committee are divided. The decision was made with one dissenting vote from new governor Stephen Miran, who favored a larger half-point cut. (not investment advice)</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>A new study involving nearly 34,000 veterans suggests that taking a form of Vitamin B3, known as nicotinamide, is linked to a reduced risk of non-melanoma skin cancers. The research, published in JAMA Dermatology, found the most significant benefit among individuals who began taking the supplement after their first skin cancer diagnosis. This group saw a 54% lower risk of developing another skin cancer compared to those who did not take it. The findings provide stronger evidence for a practice already common among dermatologists and may lead to more rigorous recommendations for its use as a preventive measure.</p>

          <p>A dive team has successfully identified a shipwreck discovered 200 feet underwater off the coast of Nantucket as the ST Seiner, a fishing vessel that sank nearly a century ago. The ship was last seen in January 1929 and was lost in a storm with 21 crew members aboard. The salvage company located the wreck site in 2022 and confirmed its identity during dives this past July, matching distinctive features like its winch and steam engine. The discovery provides historical closure regarding the long-lost vessel and the fate of its crew.</p>
