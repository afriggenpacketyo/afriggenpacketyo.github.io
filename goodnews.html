          <p>The struggling Chinese city of Hegang, located in the country's rust belt, is embarking on an ambitious infrastructure project to reverse its economic fortunes. Faced with a declining population and shrinking GDP, the city will begin construction on the 1.2 billion yuan Luobei Airport, scheduled to open in 2027. This investment is part of a broader strategy to leverage Russian trade and new infrastructure to stimulate growth. Experts view this as a significant effort by a smaller city to improve connectivity and overcome the economic challenges posed by inadequate transportation links.</p>

          <p>Despite facing years of stringent U.S. trade restrictions, Chinese technology firm Huawei has successfully pivoted and expanded its business to become a dominant player in the artificial intelligence industry. The company has diversified into numerous complex sectors, including AI chips, data centers, smart cars, and large language models, positioning itself as a formidable competitor to U.S. firms like Nvidia. This strategic shift, initially forced by external pressures, has ironically been bolstered by Chinese state support, turning Huawei into a national champion in the global tech race.</p>

          <p>Toluca secured the Campeón de Campeones 2025 trophy with a 3-1 victory over Club América at Dignity Health Sports Park. Despite an early goal from América's Alejandro Zendejas in the first minute, Toluca responded with goals from Agustín Romero and Paulinho to claim the title. The match, which pitted the winners of the Apertura 2024 and Clausura 2025 tournaments against each other, saw América reduced to ten men after Igor Lichnovsky was sent off. This win continues Toluca's recent success against their rivals, whom they also defeated in the Clausura 2025 final.</p>

          <p>A class of popular weight loss and diabetes drugs, known as GLP-1s like Ozempic and Wegovy, are showing potential as a breakthrough treatment for Polycystic Ovary Syndrome (PCOS). This common hormonal disorder affects millions of women and is linked to metabolic issues, but current treatments have been limited. Anecdotal reports and small clinical studies suggest that these drugs can improve symptoms like irregular periods, hair loss, and weight gain by enhancing insulin sensitivity and reducing testosterone levels. While more research is needed, experts see this as a promising development for a condition with massive unmet needs.</p>

          <p>Adolfo "Fito" Macias, the infamous leader of Ecuador's "Los Choneros" gang, has been extradited to the United States to face federal charges including cocaine distribution and conspiracy. The extradition marks a significant moment, being the first time Ecuador has sent one of its citizens to a foreign country for trial. Macias was recaptured in June after a high-profile prison escape in January that prompted Ecuador's president to declare a state of "internal armed conflict." His removal is a major step in the country's fight against powerful drug trafficking organizations that have fueled widespread violence.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>This article presents a bullish outlook on the stock market, arguing that fears over looming trade tariffs are overshadowing numerous positive economic drivers. The analysis points to strong corporate earnings, significant tax relief for consumers and businesses in President Trump's "big beautiful bill," and a coming boom in infrastructure spending for data centers and the energy grid. It also suggests that increased bank lending, a resurgence in the U.S. energy sector, and a primed IPO market will continue to buoy stocks, creating circumstances for growth that many commentators are overlooking.

          <p>The UK government has announced it will hold a national inquiry into the "Battle of Orgreave," one of the most violent confrontations of the 1984-85 miners' strike. The incident involved thousands of police officers and striking miners clashing outside a coking plant in Rotherham, leading to numerous injuries and the arrests of 95 miners. Those criminal cases later collapsed amid allegations that South Yorkshire Police had falsified evidence. After decades of campaigning, the inquiry aims to finally provide answers and truth for the miners and their communities affected by the historic event.</p>

        </div>
        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>This article presents advice from a parenting expert who has studied over 200 parent-child relationships, identifying "self-connection" as the most crucial skill for a child's success. Self-connection is defined as the ability to understand and trust one's own emotions, needs, and inner voice. The expert argues that this skill builds emotional resilience, fosters healthy boundaries, and protects mental health. Parents are advised to foster this by validating their child's feelings, welcoming their full personality, and modeling their own emotional awareness, rather than dismissing or micromanaging their child's inner world.</p>
