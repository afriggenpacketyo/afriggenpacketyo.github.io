          <p>The Chinese central government is requiring local authorities to justify any year-on-year increases exceeding 20% in fines imposed on private companies. This initiative aims to curb arbitrary inspections and profit-seeking behaviors targeting private enterprises, which are part of broader economic recovery efforts that began in March. The order addresses issues like inconsistent enforcement standards and abuse of power, with the Justice Ministry employing real-time statistical analysis to detect unusual spikes in punitive fees. Hu Weilie, China‚Äôs vice-minister of justice, emphasized that the success of this campaign hinges on correcting these widespread and harmful problems.</p>

          <p>New York City's subway system is implementing artificial intelligence to improve security and reduce crime by analyzing real-time camera feeds to detect suspicious behavior. The AI system focuses on identifying patterns indicative of potential threats rather than individual recognition, alerting transit police to respond quickly. While about 40% of subway cameras are currently monitored by staff, the AI aims to expand coverage without additional personnel, with the MTA emphasizing that facial recognition will not be used to protect rider privacy. This initiative is part of a broader strategy to enhance subway safety, which includes the deployment of 1,000 National Guard members, in response to fluctuating crime rates, including an increase in assaults.</p>

          <p>President Trump has claimed credit for a recent surge in military recruitment, stating that enlistments are the highest in 30 years, but this claim is misleading. While enlistments have increased, they began rebounding before his election and remain below recent peaks. Experts attribute the improvements to recruitment reforms and compensation changes implemented during the previous administration. Data shows that military recruitment began to recover after COVID-era declines in fiscal year 2023 and continued to grow in 2024.</p>

          <p>A contributor to the Los Angeles Times argues that President Biden's cognitive decline was apparent for years, becoming undeniable after his debate with Donald Trump in June 2024. The author suggests that the real scandal is the collective inertia and lack of concern from elites, rather than a conspiracy to hide the truth. While acknowledging policy fumbles during Biden's presidency, the author credits his administration with stability and effectiveness, despite Biden's communication challenges. The piece posits that loyalty, fear of Trump, and the media's focus on drama over Biden's perceived boringness contributed to the underreporting of his decline.</p>

          <p>Dissident Iranian filmmaker Jafar Panahi returned to the Cannes Film Festival after more than two decades to present his latest film, "It Was Just an Accident," which premiered to an emotional standing ovation. Panahi, who has faced a 20-year ban on filmmaking and international travel since 2010, continues to create films in secret, often confronting state violence and repression. His new film tells the story of ex-prisoners seeking revenge on their torturer, drawing inspiration from Panahi's own experiences in prison and conversations with other inmates. Despite the challenges, Panahi remains committed to filmmaking and has no plans to leave Iran.</p>

          <p>American buyout firm RedBird Capital has reached an agreement to acquire control of the Daily and Sunday Telegraph, ending a two-year period of ownership uncertainty. The titles were put up for auction by Lloyds Bank after being seized from the Barclay family due to unpaid debts. RedBird's founder, Gerry Cardinale, plans to expand the Telegraph's reach and subscriber base in the US, identifying a gap in the market. IMI, owned by Sheikh Mansour bin Zayed Sultan al-Nahyan, will retain a minority stake in the newspapers.</p>
