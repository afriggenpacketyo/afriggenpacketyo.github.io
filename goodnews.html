          <p>A German woman has returned the top of an ancient column to Greece more than half a century after she stole it from the Leonidaion guesthouse in Olympia. The limestone artifact was handed over to the University of Muenster, which facilitated its return. The Greek culture ministry commended the woman's "sensitivity and courage," highlighting the act as an example of responsible cultural heritage stewardship. This event marks the third time the university has repatriated artifacts, reinforcing a message that it is never too late to rectify past wrongs.</p>

          <div class="timestamp">2025-10-13 08:12:04 EDT</div>
        </div>
        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Despite soaring sticker prices for college, author Ron Lieber highlights that most families do not pay the full amount due to widespread "behind-the-scenes" tuition discounting. Private colleges, on average, offer a discount of around 56%, often in the form of merit aid, as part of a "high-tuition, high-aid" model. This practice, however, creates a lack of transparency that can deter families who see daunting six-figure costs without knowing their potential aid package. While a college degree is still widely seen as a worthwhile investment, financial concerns now heavily influence students' choices.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>An author reflects on a bet made in 2018 with political scientist Charles Murray, co-author of "The Bell Curve," regarding the genetic basis of intelligence. Murray wagered that by 2025, the genetic mechanisms of IQ would be largely understood, but the author argues this has not come to pass. Despite advances like genome-wide association studies, science has not uncovered a clear genetic map for intelligence, and the relationship between DNA and IQ appears far more complex and less deterministic than predicted. The article concludes that intelligence is influenced by a complex interplay of genetics and environment.</p>

          <h2>The Challenge of Eliminating Ultra-Processed Foods from Family Diets</h2>
          <div class="timestamp">2025-10-13 08:00:00 EDT</div>
        </div>
        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>The article argues that completely avoiding ultra-processed foods is an unrealistic and frustrating expectation for many working parents, despite widespread health warnings. While acknowledging the correlation between these foods and negative health outcomes, it points out that the category is overly broad, lumping nutritious items like bran flakes with junk food. The author highlights the significant barriers of time, cost, and convenience that make unprocessed diets difficult to maintain for average families. Ultimately, the article suggests a harm-reduction approach, focusing on minimizing the worst offenders rather than striving for an impossible ideal.</p>

        </div>
        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>U.S. Middle East envoy Steve Witkoff has publicly praised the "tireless efforts" of the UK's National Security Adviser, Jonathan Powell, in helping to secure the recent Gaza ceasefire. This commendation contrasts with comments from the U.S. ambassador in Israel, who downplayed the UK's contribution. Witkoff's specific praise for Powell provides a political boost for the adviser, who is currently facing scrutiny over a separate issue involving a collapsed spy case. The strong working relationship between Powell and Witkoff, developed during their work on the Russia-Ukraine conflict, is seen as a key diplomatic asset.</p>

          <p>Science journalist Mindy Weisberger's book, "Rise of the Zombie Bugs," explores the real-world phenomenon of parasites that manipulate their hosts' behavior for their own benefit. Examples include fungi that force flies into "death grips" and flatworms that make snails' eyestalks resemble caterpillars to attract birds. Understanding the mechanisms behind this "zombification," such as how parasites bypass host immune systems, could have significant scientific applications. Researchers are investigating these processes for potential insights into developing immunosuppressive drugs for humans and creating more targeted methods of agricultural pest control.</p>

        </div>
        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>According to an economist at Soochow Securities, the current global bull market is primarily supported by a weakening U.S. dollar, which should help Chinese stocks remain resilient despite new tariff threats from the Trump administration. He suggests that while trade tensions can cause market corrections, they are unlikely to have a major long-term impact on the market's trajectory. The analyst argues that investors have grown "immune" to the prospect of higher duties, as market jitters are driven by more fundamental concerns like U.S. fiscal policy. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>Following the initial release of all living hostages by Hamas in exchange for Palestinian prisoners, the Gaza peace plan is set to enter its next phases. The first stage included a ceasefire and increased aid, with Israeli troops withdrawing to control 53% of Gaza, monitored by a multinational force. Subsequent negotiations will address contentious issues like the full demilitarization of Gaza, its future governance by a reformed Palestinian Authority, and the extent of further Israeli withdrawals. Key sticking points remain, including Hamas's refusal to disarm and disagreements over the post-war political landscape.</p>
