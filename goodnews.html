          <h2>Gen Z Sparks Debate with Trend of Adding Ice to Beer</h2>
          <div class="timestamp">2025-09-06 11:55:58 EDT</div>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>A new trend among Gen Z drinkers, adding ice to beer, is causing a stir online and in pubs, challenging traditional beverage customs. Proponents on platforms like TikTok claim it makes the drink more refreshing, especially lighter beers in warm weather, and reflects a broader preference for personalization over tradition. However, beer purists and some industry veterans are critical, arguing that ice dilutes the beverage and mutes its intended flavor profile. Despite the mixed reactions, some bar owners report seeing the trend firsthand and are choosing not to judge customers' personal preferences.</p>

          <p>Red Bull's Max Verstappen claimed pole position for the Italian Grand Prix at Monza, setting the fastest lap in Formula 1 history with a time of one minute and 18.792 seconds. His performance, at an average speed of over 164 mph, narrowly beat McLaren's Lando Norris, who had momentarily held the top spot. Verstappen's lap surpassed the previous record set by Lewis Hamilton in 2020. McLaren's Oscar Piastri qualified third, followed by the Ferraris, while Hamilton will start 10th due to a five-place grid penalty, promoting Mercedes' George Russell to fifth.</p>

          <p>Former President Joe Biden has chosen Delaware, the state central to his political career, as the location for his presidential library and museum. A 13-person governance board, including former Secretary of State Antony Blinken and chaired by fundraiser Rufus Gifford, has been established to oversee the project. The library aims to be a center for history, learning, and civic engagement. The fundraising effort for the library faces challenges, as the costs for such projects have escalated significantly, with the Obama Presidential Center setting a goal of $1.6 billion, though Biden's team anticipates a more moderate budget.</p>

          <p>A new conservation chapter is beginning at California's Point Reyes national seashore after a landmark deal resulted in the buyout of 12 organic dairy and cattle operations. The agreement, mediated by The Nature Conservancy, opens over 16,000 acres for a five-year restoration effort aimed at reviving native ecosystems. The plan controversially includes using new herds of cattle for targeted grazing to control invasive plants and promote the regrowth of native species, a method intended to create a more resilient landscape. While the transition is painful for the multi-generational ranching community, conservationists see it as a vital opportunity to enhance biodiversity.</p>

          <p>The Trump family is expanding its presence in the cryptocurrency industry with a series of moves that suggest a more mature business strategy. Eric Trump's crypto-mining company, American Bitcoin, recently went public on the Nasdaq, while the family's firm, World Liberty Financial, has launched a stablecoin and governance tokens that have significantly increased their paper wealth. These ventures, including a new crypto treasury for the company behind Truth Social, represent a shift from earlier, more flamboyant projects like NFTs. This evolution aims to add a veneer of legitimacy to their crypto empire while continuing to capitalize on the Trump brand. (not investment advice)</p>

          <h2>LGBTQ+ Catholics Report New Sense of Acceptance During Holy Year Pilgrimage in Rome</h2>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Hundreds of LGBTQ+ Catholics made a historic Holy Year pilgrimage to Rome, celebrating a newfound feeling of acceptance within the Church, a change many attribute to the late Pope Francis. A senior Italian bishop celebrated a Mass for the pilgrims, emphasizing that the Jubilee is a time to restore dignity to all, especially those who have been denied it. This event, officially listed on the Vatican's calendar, marks a significant shift from 25 years ago when similar groups faced detainment. Participants expressed hope that Pope Leo will continue Francis's legacy of a more inclusive and welcoming message for the LGBTQ+ community.</p>

          <p>American tennis player Taylor Townsend has become a fan favorite at the US Open, capping a strong tournament with a runner-up finish in the women's doubles. Her journey has been marked by resilience, having faced criticism and a lack of support from the USTA early in her career over her fitness and body type. Now a 29-year-old mother, Townsend has balanced her professional career with raising her son, launching her own clothing line, and speaking candidly about the financial struggles of players outside the top ranks. Her graceful handling of on-court confrontations and sportsmanship has further solidified her status as an inspiring figure in the sport.</p>

          <p>School districts across the United States are implementing the use of Yondr pouches, a lockable magnetic case, to enforce new statewide bans on cellphones in classrooms. Students are required to place their phones in the pouches, which they carry with them but can only be unlocked at magnetic stations located at school entrances. While educators and some students report positive changes like increased social interaction and focus, the system has faced resistance from other students who have found ways to circumvent it. The measure reflects a growing effort to reduce classroom distractions, with at least 2.5 million students nationwide now using the technology.</p>

          <p>China is intensifying its anti-corruption campaign within the financial sector, a move that an analyst suggests will ultimately bolster long-term confidence and attract foreign investment. While the immediate effects may be muted by current economic uncertainties, the drive is seen as a necessary step toward cleaner governance. The investigation of a high-profile figure from the country's sovereign wealth fund indicates the campaign is expanding from banking into the stock market. This effort aligns with the demands of international institutions for transparent and clean government practices in markets where they operate.</p>

          <p>Archaeologists in Camden, South Carolina, have uncovered the remains of 14 soldiers from the 1780 Battle of Camden, one of the American Revolution's most brutal clashes. To identify these forgotten soldiers, experts are now employing forensic genealogy, treating it as an "ultimate cold case." By building genetic profiles from the 240-year-old bones, a forensic team has found thousands of living genetic matches, far more than in typical cases. They have already narrowed the search for one teenage soldier to a few family names and are asking potential descendants to submit DNA to help restore the identities of these first American soldiers.</p>

The system is designed to warn the public of life-threatening events like extreme weather or terror attacks. During the test, compatible mobile phones will vibrate and emit a siren sound for about ten seconds, accompanied by a test message. This follows a previous test in April 2023 that experienced technical issues, which the government says have since been addressed.

The proposal suggests refranchising the bottling network for its North American beverage business, a move that would reverse a costly 2010 decision and align it more with competitor Coca-Cola. Elliott also recommends divesting underperforming brands like Quaker, reducing the number of products to cut costs, and reinvesting the freed capital into core brands such as Pepsi and Mountain Dew.

These characteristics include imagination, synthesis (connecting old and new ideas), and intense focus on core goals without dabbling in unimportant ventures. Other key traits are doggedness in the face of difficulty, sustained passion, reverence for their craft, and a deep commitment that requires sacrificing other options. The article uses Swift's career as a case study to illustrate how these qualities, from turning small details into entire song concepts to prioritizing her music above all else, lead to exceptional success.</p>

While known for her street photography, Model captured the complex emotions of jazz musicians like Duke Ellington and Miles Davis, revealing a wariness that may have stemmed from a shared experience of persecution. Her project, intended to be a book with an essay by Langston Hughes, was abandoned due to McCarthy-era suspicion of her politics. The images reflect the paradox of jazz luminaries who were celebrated abroad but faced racism and violence at home.</p>
