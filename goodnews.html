This positions South Korea as a potential first mover in deploying a compact, drone-optimized asset tailored to near-sea operations.

This shift in consumer behavior is reshaping investment strategies, with fund managers increasingly focusing on understanding the preferences of younger consumers. The rise of these new consumer stocks is occurring amid a sluggish broader consumer industry, highlighting the growing influence of Gen Z on China's economy. </p>
