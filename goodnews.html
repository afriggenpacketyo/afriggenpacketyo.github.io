          <p>Treasury Secretary Scott Bessent and U.S. Trade Representative Jamieson Greer are scheduled to meet with their Chinese counterparts in Switzerland to discuss economic and trade matters, signaling a potential move towards resolving the ongoing trade war. The meetings follow President Trump's recent tariff increases on Chinese imports, which prompted retaliatory measures from China. Bessent stated that the U.S. aims to rebalance the international economic system to better serve American interests, while Greer seeks to achieve reciprocity and open new markets, both highlighting the administration's focus on economic and national security.

Education minister Stephen Morgan stated that it's 'high time exam records were brought into the 21st century'.</p>

          <p>Sovereignty, the winner of the Kentucky Derby, will not participate in the Preakness Stakes, ending any chance of a Triple Crown winner for the seventh consecutive year. Trainer Bill Mott indicated that the horse will instead be entered in the Belmont Stakes, prioritizing the horse's long-term interests. This decision marks the fifth time since 2018 that the Preakness will proceed without a Triple Crown contender. The two-week turnaround between the Kentucky Derby and Preakness has fueled debate about spacing out the races, with some proposing changes to the Triple Crown schedule.</p>

          <p>President Trump adopted a more conciliatory tone during a meeting with Canada's new Prime Minister Mark Carney, despite previously criticizing Canada and suggesting it become the 51st U.S. state. While Trump expressed his affection for Canada, the meeting was still marked by underlying tensions and awkwardness stemming from Trump's past remarks. Carney firmly stated that Canada is 'not for sale', and Trump touched on various unrelated topics during the meeting. Trump's approach contrasted sharply with his treatment of other foreign leaders, particularly Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy.</p>

Despite the tensions, Carney maintained a polite and firm stance, defending Canada's sovereignty while engaging with Trump's unconventional style.

The relationship between the neighbors has been at a historic low since Mr. Trump‚Äôs re-election, but Trump struck a more conciliatory tone once the two leaders sat down in the Oval Office.</p>
