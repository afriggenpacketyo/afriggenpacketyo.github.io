          <p>Fundstrat's Tom Lee has launched a new exchange-traded fund, the Fundstrat Granny Shots US Large Cap ETF (GRNY), which has seen remarkable success since its debut. The fund has attracted $1.5 billion in assets in just eight months and is outperforming its benchmark index, placing it in the top percentile of its category. Its strategy involves selecting stocks that align with multiple long-term investment themes, such as AI and millennial-driven trends, to ensure consistent performance. This thematic, rules-based approach has resonated with investors, though its long-term sustainability remains to be proven. (not investment advice)</p>

        </div>
        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>As the Trump administration promotes policies to boost the U.S. birth rate, including support for IVF, a significant aspect of the fertility equation is being ignored: male infertility. Despite male factors contributing to roughly half of infertility cases among heterosexual couples, evaluation and treatment for men are often overlooked, placing a disproportionate burden on women. While conservatives debate IVF versus alternative methods like restorative reproductive medicine, neither side has prioritized policies to improve access to male-infertility care. Experts argue that addressing this gap is a viable path to improving fertility outcomes without the political friction surrounding IVF.</p>

          <h2>Experts Recommend 'Bridge Strategy' to Maximize Social Security Retirement Benefits</h2>
          <div class="timestamp">2025-07-11 10:37:44 EDT</div>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Financial experts are highlighting the significant long-term advantages of delaying Social Security retirement benefits until age 70. While eligibility begins at 62, waiting increases monthly payments by up to 8% per year, offering an inflation-protected income stream that is difficult to match elsewhere. To cover the financial gap during these interim years, a new report from the Bipartisan Policy Center suggests using a 'bridge strategy,' such as working longer or drawing from other retirement assets like investment portfolios or annuities. This approach helps maximize lifetime benefits and provides a crucial buffer against longevity risk. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>Kansas City Chiefs quarterback Patrick Mahomes has become a major investor and brand ambassador for Throne Sport Coffee, a ready-to-drink coffee designed as a healthier alternative. Mahomes, a daily coffee drinker, was drawn to the brand for its low sugar content, added protein, and clean ingredients. He stated his coffee habit began in his first year in the NFL as a functional need but evolved into a genuine appreciation. The investment places him in the rapidly expanding ready-to-drink coffee market, which saw Americans spend over $17 billion in 2023. The article also notes his lack of enthusiasm for a potential 18-game NFL season.</p>

          <p>Nvidia CEO Jensen Huang has sold approximately $36.4 million worth of the company's stock, part of a pre-disclosed plan to sell up to 6 million shares this year. The sale coincides with a massive surge in Huang's personal wealth, which has grown by over $29 billion in 2025, briefly placing his net worth ahead of legendary investor Warren Buffett. This financial milestone reflects Nvidia's soaring market performance, as the chipmaker recently became the first company to exceed a $4 trillion market capitalization. The continued investor confidence is fueled by the company's dominance in the booming artificial intelligence sector.</p>

These small cameras, mounted on a referee's ear, have been successfully trialed by FIFA and could be tested in the Premier League's US Summer Series with a view to implementation next season. The technology is seen as a way to bring viewers closer to the action, showcasing player speed and skill in real time. Ifab approval and agreement from the clubs would be required before the cameras could be used in official league matches.</p>

          <p>Bitcoin's price has soared to a new all-time high, exceeding $118,000, driven by a massive influx of institutional investment into bitcoin ETFs. On Thursday, these funds recorded their largest single day of inflows for 2025, totaling $1.18 billion. The rally was also fueled by a significant wave of short liquidations and expectations of a more dovish Federal Reserve policy in the future. This upward trend reflects growing confidence from corporate treasuries and anticipation of clearer crypto legislation, reinforcing bitcoin's strong performance in the second half of the year.

          <p>Rory McIlroy has weighed in on the possibility of Keegan Bradley serving as a playing captain for the U.S. Ryder Cup team, a scenario he previously deemed flawed. McIlroy noted that the American team appears more player-led, contrasting it with Europe's structure, which relies on a single, empowered figurehead like captain Luke Donald. He suggested that during their difficult start in Rome, the U.S. team lacked a central figure to turn to for direction. While praising Bradley's performance, McIlroy's comments highlight a fundamental difference in team philosophy between the two Ryder Cup rivals.</p>

          <p>A comprehensive new study reveals that emergency vaccination programs for five major infectious diseases have been highly effective, reducing both deaths and infections by approximately 60% over a 23-year period. The research, which analyzed 210 outbreaks in 49 countries, suggests that swift vaccine deployment prevented much larger crises from diseases like Ebola, cholera, and measles. Beyond the significant public health impact, the study highlights substantial economic benefits, estimated at $32 billion, primarily from averting deaths and disability. The findings underscore the critical role of well-funded, rapid vaccination responses in managing global health threats.</p>

          <p>Levi Strauss has raised its full-year sales and earnings guidance, signaling strong consumer demand for its products. The denim maker plans to absorb some initial costs from higher U.S. tariffs but acknowledges that its forecast could change depending on the evolution of President Trump's trade policies. The company's fiscal second-quarter results beat expectations, driven by strong direct-to-consumer sales and growth in its women's apparel and tops categories. CEO Michelle Gass credited a focus on a direct-to-consumer mindset and new product innovation for the company's resilient performance amid economic uncertainty. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>FDA Commissioner Marty Makary announced that the agency will now consider drug affordability as a key criterion when granting new national priority vouchers, which can reduce drug review times to as little as one month. This move aligns with the Trump administration's goal of lowering drug prices for Americans. The program aims to incentivize companies to address U.S. national interests, such as developing innovative cures and increasing domestic manufacturing. While the plan is intended to speed up access to critical treatments, questions remain about how affordability will be assessed and the potential risks of such rapid approvals.</p>

          <p>In a notable development, the Shanghai branch of China's state-asset watchdog (SASAC) is urging state-owned enterprises to study the potential role of stablecoins and other digital assets. The regulator called on these firms to research digital currencies and explore using blockchain technology for cross-border trade, supply chain finance, and asset tokenization. This pronouncement is extraordinary given Beijing's long-standing ban on most crypto-related activities on the mainland. It aligns with recent calls from state media to consider legislation for stablecoins and their potential to help internationalize the yuan.</p>
