          <p>Questions surrounding Novak Djokovic's fitness have intensified ahead of his Wimbledon semi-final match against Jannik Sinner after the 24-time Grand Slam champion canceled a scheduled practice session. Djokovic had an awkward fall during his quarter-final victory, and while he completed the match, his preparation for the upcoming high-stakes encounter is now under scrutiny. His opponent, Sinner, is also managing an elbow injury, adding a layer of physical uncertainty for both top players. Djokovic has acknowledged the increasing physical demands of competing at the highest level at age 38.</p>

          <p>The OPEC International Seminar convened at Vienna's Hofburg palace, bringing together energy ministers and top CEOs to discuss oil markets, investment, and the green transition. The high-profile event, led by Saudi Energy Minister Prince Abdulaziz bin Salman, occurred amidst a backdrop of protests concerning the conflict in Gaza and calls for an oil embargo. While key figures from Russia and Iran were physically absent, the Iranian oil minister delivered remarks via video, stressing the need for peace to ensure market stability. The conference provided a rare opportunity for in-person dialogue as many OPEC+ meetings have shifted to virtual formats.</p>

          <div class="timestamp">2025-07-11 02:09:04 EDT</div>
        </div>
        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Actor Ewan McGregor's application to replace the roof of his £2 million historic mansion in Scotland has been rejected by the local council. His architects argued the existing lead roof was 'beyond repair' and that a modern single-ply membrane would be a more secure and sustainable alternative, also mitigating the risk of lead theft. However, Perth and Kinross Council denied the request, stating the proposed changes would not preserve the C-listed building's special architectural character. McGregor purchased the 18th-century, ten-bedroom villa near his birthplace in 2023.</p>

          <p>A coalition of nations committed to a post-ceasefire stabilization mission in Ukraine has agreed to establish a headquarters in Paris for rapid deployment once hostilities with Russia end. The decision was made during a meeting in Rome, which was attended for the first time by a U.S. delegation including President Trump's special envoy, Keith Kellogg. This 'reassurance force' aims to provide logistical support, help rebuild Ukraine's military, and secure its skies and maritime routes. While no specific troop commitments were made, the move signals a concrete step in long-term planning for Ukraine's security.</p>

          <p>Tesla is experiencing a significant sales boom in Norway, defying a broader slump for the electric vehicle maker across much of Europe. New Tesla sales in the country jumped 54% year-on-year in June, largely driven by the immense popularity of its revamped Model Y SUV. This success contrasts sharply with falling sales in key markets like Germany and France, where CEO Elon Musk's political activities have reportedly impacted the brand's appeal. According to local experts, the Model Y's value, large luggage space, and all-wheel drive capabilities perfectly match the demands of Norwegian consumers.</p>

          <p>In a significant environmental restoration effort, China has demolished approximately 300 dams and shut down hydropower stations along the Red River, a key tributary of the upper Yangtze. This action aims to save the habitats of numerous rare and endemic fish species that have been severely impacted by decades of river fragmentation. The dams had blocked migratory routes and altered water flows, drastically reducing spawning grounds and even causing sections of the river to dry up. The project is designed to restore the natural ecosystem of what ecologists consider the last major refuge for native fish in the region.</p>

          <p>China is experiencing a boom in the adoption of electric-powered heavy trucks, which is significantly reducing the nation's diesel consumption and overall oil demand. Driven by government subsidies and a rapid expansion of charging infrastructure, sales of new energy trucks are estimated to have surged 175% in the first half of the year. This shift, combined with the rise of LNG-powered trucks, has led analysts to revise down diesel demand forecasts. The trend is accelerating predictions for when China's oil consumption will peak, with some now expecting it to happen this year. (not investment advice)</p>

This decision pauses one of the administration's priority immigration policies and challenges its constitutionality under the 14th Amendment.
