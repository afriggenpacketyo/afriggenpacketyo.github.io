          <h2>Micro-Robots Show Promise in Treating Sinus Infections Without Antibiotics</h2>
          <div class="timestamp">2025-07-07 13:00:58 EDT</div>
        </div>
        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Scientists have developed microscopic robots capable of treating sinus infections by directly targeting and eliminating bacteria within the nasal cavity. These dust-sized micro-robots, made of magnetic particles and copper atoms, are guided by magnets to the infection site. Once in position, a fiber optic light heats the particles, enabling them to break through mucus and destroy the bacteria, offering a precise, drug-free alternative to traditional antibiotics. While animal trials in pigs and rabbits have been successful and shown no tissue damage, further research is needed to ensure the technology's safety and efficacy for human use, which could help combat antibiotic resistance.</p>

          <div class="timestamp">2025-07-07 12:52:24 EDT</div>
        </div>
        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Block CEO and Twitter co-founder Jack Dorsey has launched a new peer-to-peer messaging app called Bitchat, which operates entirely over Bluetooth mesh networks without needing an internet connection. The app is designed for ephemeral, encrypted communication between nearby devices, which form local clusters to pass messages along, making it resistant to censorship and internet shutdowns. This project reflects Dorsey's ongoing interest in decentralized technologies that prioritize user privacy and control, as Bitchat requires no personal identifiers like phone numbers or emails. A beta version is currently available, with future updates planned to enhance its functionality and range.</p>

        </div>
        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>The film "F1," produced by Apple and distributed by Warner Bros. Discovery, has become Apple's most successful theatrical release ever, surpassing $293 million at the global box office. This achievement overtakes the company's previous top earner, "Napoleon," and marks a significant milestone for Apple's growing presence in the entertainment industry. The movie's success has been greatly boosted by a strategic partnership with IMAX, which accounted for over 20% of its total gross. While the high-budget film still has a way to go to reach profitability, its box office performance demonstrates Apple's ability to produce and market a mainstream blockbuster.</p>

          <p>This article provides a detailed timeline of the Karen Read murder case, from the death of her boyfriend, Boston police officer John O'Keefe, in January 2022 to the conclusion of her second trial. Read was accused of striking O'Keefe with her SUV, but her defense argued she was framed in an elaborate cover-up involving law enforcement. The case drew national attention due to its dramatic twists, including allegations of a conspiracy, a federal investigation, and the firing of the lead state police investigator. After her first trial ended in a hung jury, a second trial concluded with her acquittal on the most serious charges of murder and manslaughter.</p>

          <p>Authorities in Pakistan's Punjab province have confiscated eighteen lions that were being kept illegally as pets in a densely populated area. The crackdown was initiated after a lion escaped from a home in Lahore and attacked a woman and two children, who sustained non-life-threatening injuries. Keeping exotic animals is seen as a status symbol among some wealthy Pakistanis, despite the legal requirements and potential dangers. Officials report there are over 500 lions and tigers in private homes and breeding farms in the province, and they plan to inspect all of them to ensure compliance with wildlife regulations.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Wimbledon officials have modified their electronic line-calling system to prevent a repeat of a controversial incident caused by human error. During a fourth-round match, an operator accidentally deactivated the Hawk-Eye ball-tracking technology for a game, leading to a missed call on a crucial point. In response, the All England Lawn Tennis Club announced it has removed the ability for operators to manually turn off the system. While the umpire involved followed existing protocols, the event has sparked discussion about implementing a video review system, similar to those used in other major tournaments, to provide an additional layer of accuracy.</p>

          <p>South Africa's interim cricket captain, Wiaan Mulder, chose not to pursue the world record for the highest individual score in a Test match, declaring his team's innings while he was 33 runs short of the milestone. Mulder finished with 367 not out, opting to prioritize his team's strategic advantage over breaking the record of 400 set by West Indies legend Brian Lara in 2004. He stated that the decision was made both for the team and out of respect for Lara, believing that such a special record should remain with a player of his stature. The act of sportsmanship has been highlighted as a positive moment for the sport.</p>

          <p>This analysis contrasts Apple's recent major success in entertainment with its ongoing challenges in artificial intelligence. While the company's blockbuster movie "F1" became its highest-grossing theatrical release, highlighting its strength in long-term services growth, its AI announcements have been met with a muted response. The company's AI assistant, Siri, has seen few significant improvements in an era dominated by advanced conversational AI from competitors like Google and OpenAI. This disparity showcases a potential vulnerability for Apple, as its lag in a key technological race could become a problem, even as other divisions like its entertainment studio achieve significant milestones.</p>
