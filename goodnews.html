          <p>Modular homebuilder Fading West is addressing the nationwide housing affordability crisis by constructing homes in a factory, reducing costs by up to 20% and halving construction time compared to traditional methods. This article highlights their innovative manufacturing approach, which produces a 10-ton house in about seven days. The company successfully deployed 82 modular homes for Lahaina wildfire victims and is expanding its efforts to provide affordable housing for various communities, including teachers and first responders. Experts suggest modular construction offers a sustainable, less expensive, and quicker solution to the persistent housing shortage, which could restore the American Dream of homeownership.

          <p>The UK government will underwrite a £1.5 billion loan guarantee for Jaguar Land Rover (JLR) to support its supply chain following a cyber attack that halted production for weeks. This article explains the Export Development Guarantee aims to protect skilled jobs in the West Midlands, Merseyside, and across the UK, as JLR faces significant financial losses of £50 million per week and suppliers risk collapse. The loan will boost JLR's cash reserves for a backlog of supplier payments, while the company continues efforts to safely restart production after the August 31 hack.</p>

          <p>President Trump has directed his administration to declassify any federal records pertaining to Amelia Earhart's 1937 disappearance, a mystery that has captivated the public for decades. This article reports Trump's Truth Social announcement, acknowledging the enduring fascination with the aviator's fate. While experts largely believe she ran out of fuel and crashed near Howland Island, various unproven theories, including one of her being captured by the Japanese, have circulated. The move follows a lawmaker's push for declassification, though it's unclear what new information, if any, classified documents might hold, as previous FBI reviews found no evidence of a spy mission.</p>

          <p>A new study published by Science reveals that wild chimpanzees regularly consume significant amounts of alcohol from fermented fruit, equivalent to about one small bottle of beer for humans daily. Researchers observed chimps in Uganda and the Ivory Coast ingesting fruit pulp with an average alcohol content of 0.3%. This article highlights that the findings suggest regular alcohol consumption may have deeper evolutionary roots, not solely being a human cultural phenomenon, echoing a previous study on chimpanzees in Guinea-Bissau. The research contributes to understanding the prevalence of alcohol in the natural world and its potential role in primate behavior.</p>
