          <p>According to sources close to the negotiations, Hamas and other Palestinian factions are leaning towards accepting a U.S.-proposed plan to end the war in Gaza. The 20-point proposal, presented by President Trump, calls for an immediate ceasefire, the release of all hostages in exchange for Palestinian prisoners, and increased humanitarian aid. The plan also outlines a future for Gaza under an interim administration of technocrats, overseen by an international board, with Israel maintaining perimeter security. Several key Muslim-majority nations have already issued a joint statement welcoming the initiative, signaling broad regional support for the peace effort.</p>

          <p>Since Son Heung-min's arrival at Los Angeles Football Club, he and teammate Denis Bouanga have formed the most lethal attacking partnership in Major League Soccer. The pair have scored 17 consecutive goals between them, a new league record for a duo, propelling LAFC on a four-game winning streak. Bouanga, who is now the club's all-time top scorer, credits Son's presence and reputation for inspiring him to elevate his own performance. Their on-field chemistry has quickly silenced concerns about their similar playing styles, positioning LAFC as a strong contender for the MLS Cup in what is coach Steve Cherundolo's final season.</p>

          <p>Safety concerns have been raised at Munich's Oktoberfest after the festival grounds had to be temporarily closed due to severe overcrowding. On Saturday, an estimated 300,000 visitors created bottlenecks, particularly during the 5 p.m. tent shift change, leading to chaotic scenes and feelings of panic among some attendees. While no major injuries were reported, the incident has sparked questions about crowd control management at the world-famous event. Organizers noted that despite the surge, overall visitor numbers are slightly down from last year, while consumption of non-alcoholic beverages, especially water, has significantly increased due to warm weather.</p>

The show, titled "One For The Road," will be their first performance together since 2019 and follows a positive public reaction to their recent documentary. The members, including Ronan Keating and Shane Lynch, emphasized that this is a celebration of their career and not a reunion tour with new music. They plan to perform all their major hits and acknowledged that it will be emotional to perform on such a large stage without their late bandmate, Stephen Gately.</p>

          <p>Arsenal's key centre-back, William Saliba, has signed a new five-year contract, ending speculation linking him to other top European clubs. The 24-year-old French international credited manager Mikel Arteta and his coaching staff as a major reason for his decision, stating they can help him become one of the best defenders in the world. Since his debut in 2022, Saliba has become a vital part of the team's defense, making over 100 league appearances. The club's leadership and teammates have praised the move as a significant step in securing Arsenal's core talent for their ambition of winning major trophies.</p>

          <p>A U.S. government shutdown occurs when Congress fails to pass funding legislation, leading to the closure of all nonessential federal agencies and programs. This article explains that while essential services like the military, air traffic control, and law enforcement continue to operate, their employees must work without pay until the shutdown ends. Mandatory spending programs such as Social Security and Medicare are unaffected. However, hundreds of thousands of federal employees are furloughed, national parks and museums may close, and the release of important economic data is halted, causing disruptions and potential economic damage the longer the impasse continues.</p>

          <p>The U.S.-led proposal to end the war in Gaza represents the most serious diplomatic effort to date, backed by key Arab nations and European allies. The plan calls for an immediate ceasefire and the release of all hostages within 72 hours, in exchange for hundreds of Palestinian prisoners and a surge in humanitarian aid. A key component is the establishment of a transitional governing body for Gaza, led by former UK Prime Minister Tony Blair, with a vague pathway toward future Palestinian self-determination. However, significant hurdles remain, as Hamas may reject terms like disarmament, and Israeli Prime Minister Netanyahu faces pressure from his far-right coalition partners.</p>

          <p>A Chinese national, Zhimin Qian, has been convicted in the UK in a case connected to the world's largest-known seizure of cryptocurrency, involving 61,000 bitcoin valued at over £5 billion. Qian pleaded guilty to illegally acquiring the cryptocurrency, which was the proceeds of a massive investment scam in China that defrauded over 128,000 victims between 2014 and 2017. After fleeing China, she attempted to launder the funds in the UK by purchasing property before her arrest. The seven-year investigation by London's Metropolitan Police unraveled a global money laundering network, highlighting the increasing use of crypto by organized crime.</p>

          <p>High-net-worth individuals are increasingly holding larger portions of their portfolios in cash and alternative assets, moving away from traditional stocks and bonds due to market volatility and inflation fears. A 2024 Capital Group survey found that 78% of wealthy investors globally have high cash positions, reflecting a broader trend towards seeking stability. This strategic shift is driven by the desire for safer returns from options like government bonds or alternative investments such as fine art and real estate.

          <p>Chinese AI startup DeepSeek has launched an experimental new model, DeepSeek-V3.2-Exp, which aims to significantly increase efficiency and reduce the cost of running large language models. The key innovation is a feature called DeepSeek Sparse Attention (DSA), which allows the AI to handle large amounts of information more effectively by focusing only on the most relevant data for a given task. While this approach promises to make powerful AI more accessible, some experts raise questions about its reliability and potential for bias if it incorrectly discards important information. The company's open-source approach allows others to build on its technology, furthering competition in the AI space.</p>

The case has heightened concerns across the European Union about China's espionage activities. Krah, who is now a member of the German parliament, claimed he was unaware of his aide's activities, though he himself is currently under a separate investigation for corruption.</p>

          <p>Sales of electric vehicles in the U.S. surged dramatically as buyers rushed to finalize purchases before the September 30 expiration of federal EV tax credits worth up to $7,500. The deadline, part of a Republican tax and spending package, created a powerful incentive that boosted the entire auto market for the third quarter. Automotive data firms reported that EV market share hit a near-record high in August. However, analysts now predict a potential "EV hangover" in the coming months, as the sales rush may have pulled forward demand, potentially leading to a temporary slowdown for the rest of the year.

          <p>Facing uncertainty over the future of U.S. military assistance, Ukraine is rapidly expanding its domestic arms industry to become more self-sufficient in its war against Russia.

This strategic shift is driven by necessity, as Ukrainian tech entrepreneurs leverage their expertise to build a robust defense sector. While still reliant on Western partners for its most powerful systems, Ukraine aims to become a key military technology partner for NATO and Europe.</p>
