        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>In England's recent Test victory over India, fast bowler Josh Tongue's performance in dismissing the lower-order batsmen was a crucial factor. The analysis in this article highlights that effectively removing the 'tail' is a specialized skill, and Tongue's aggressive, intimidating style proved highly successful, as he took three of the last four wickets in each of India's innings. His ability to unsettle tailenders with short-pitched bowling before delivering a decisive good-length ball was showcased in a triple-wicket maiden. This skill could be vital for England's success in upcoming series, including the Ashes, by preventing late-inning runs that can shift a match's momentum.</p>

          <p>A coalition of major Democratic groups, including the DNC, is launching a new initiative called "Organizing Summer" to boost voter engagement ahead of the 2026 midterm elections. The program will focus on registering voters and connecting with them through non-traditional channels like community groups and social media, particularly in key districts and states. With an initial six-figure investment planned to scale to seven figures, the effort aims to rebuild the party's grassroots support following losses in 2024. The initiative will also mobilize volunteers to campaign against President Trump's legislative agenda, framing it as harmful to working families.</p>

The order will lift broad sanctions while maintaining targeted penalties on former president Bashar al-Assad, his associates, and those linked to human rights abuses, terrorism, and chemical weapons. This action follows months of lobbying by Syria's new leadership, which argues that sanctions have crippled the nation's ability to rebuild after its 13-year civil war.

          <p>After a difficult start to the season, Dodgers slugger Max Muncy has experienced a dramatic turnaround at the plate, transforming into one of baseball's most productive hitters. Muncy attributes his resurgence to two key changes: wearing glasses to correct an astigmatism and a mechanical breakthrough with his swing during a May 9 game. Since that date, he is hitting .313 with 12 home runs and a league-leading 47 RBIs over his last 43 games. The adjustments have allowed him to rediscover the form that made him a top power hitter from 2018-2021, re-establishing him as a crucial part of the Dodgers' lineup.</p>
