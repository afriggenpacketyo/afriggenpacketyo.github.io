          <p>The United States has lifted its export restrictions on crucial chip-design software to China, as announced by leading semiconductor software firms Synopsys and Cadence. The companies confirmed that the U.S. Department of Commerce reversed a policy implemented in May that had required them to obtain special licenses for such exports. Both firms, along with Siemens EDA, dominate the global electronic design automation (EDA) market, which is essential for designing modern semiconductors. They are now working to restore access for their affected customers in China, signaling a potential de-escalation in tech-related trade tensions. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>Armenia is actively looking to deepen its relationship with China and elevate bilateral ties to a strategic partnership, according to its foreign minister, Ararat Mirzoyan. During his first official visit to Beijing, Mirzoyan stated there are no obstacles to strengthening relations and expressed a mutual interest in formalizing their strategic nature. This diplomatic outreach is part of Armenia's broader effort to diversify its foreign policy and move beyond its traditional reliance on Russia. The shift comes in the wake of the 2020 Nagorno-Karabakh war, after which Armenia expressed deep dissatisfaction with Moscow's role as a security guarantor.</p>

          <p>With a razor-thin Republican majority in the House, the possibility of a tie vote on major legislation has become a significant factor in legislative battles. Unlike the Senate, where the Vice President can cast a tie-breaking vote, a tie in the House of Representatives means the motion or bill in question automatically fails. According to House rules, if the votes are equal, the question is lost. This procedural reality was highlighted during a 2024 vote on impeaching a cabinet secretary, which initially tied before a member switched their vote to allow for reconsideration, demonstrating how fragile legislative majorities can be.</p>

          <p>Hong Kong's market for initial public offerings (IPOs) has seen a dramatic resurgence, with fundraising volumes reaching their highest first-half level since 2021. New listing volumes surged to $14 billion, an eightfold increase from the same period last year, positioning the city to potentially become the world's top listing destination. This boom is fueled by a wave of Chinese companies seeking to raise capital, driven by supportive policies from Beijing, a slower pace of listings on the mainland, and concerns about delisting from U.S. exchanges. The renewed activity signals a significant turnaround for the city's financial markets. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>A federal judge in Washington, D.C., has blocked a Trump administration policy that severely restricts the ability of migrants who cross the southern border to seek asylum. U.S. District Judge Randolph Moss ruled that the president does not have the unilateral authority to create an alternative immigration system that supplants laws passed by Congress. The judge's 128-page order grants a nationwide injunction against the policy, which was implemented via an executive order on President Trump's first day in office. The decision has been praised by civil liberties and immigrant rights groups as a critical affirmation of existing U.S. asylum law.</p>

          <p>A new Pew Research Center study reveals a significant shift in the Latino electorate, with Donald Trump securing 48% of the Latino vote in the 2024 presidential election, a substantial increase from 36% in 2020. Political analysts suggest this trend is not necessarily an ideological move to the right but rather a populist shift. Experts interviewed in the article theorize that many Latino voters, particularly working-class and naturalized citizens, are driven by economic concerns and feel that the Democratic party has failed to address their priorities, leading to disillusionment and a search for alternatives.</p>
