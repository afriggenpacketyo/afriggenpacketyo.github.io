          <p>Certificates of deposit (CDs) currently offer significantly higher interest rates compared to traditional savings accounts, making them a more attractive option for savers. While CD interest rates are not as high as in previous years, they remain substantially higher than traditional savings account rates. CD rates are fixed, providing guaranteed returns even if interest rates decline during the CD term. The article provides a comparison of potential earnings between CDs and traditional savings accounts, demonstrating the superior returns offered by CDs.

          <div class="timestamp">2025-06-23 12:44:18 EDT</div>
        </div>
        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Federal Reserve Governor Michelle Bowman indicated she would favor an interest rate cut at the next policy meeting in July if inflation pressures remain contained. Bowman's comments align with those of fellow Governor Christopher Waller, suggesting a potential shift in the Fed's monetary policy. Trump has been pressuring the Fed to lower rates to alleviate the national debt burden, but the Federal Open Market Committee (FOMC) voted to hold rates steady at its last meeting. Bowman believes the impact of tariffs on inflation may be less significant than initially anticipated, opening the door for rate adjustments. The FOMC is scheduled to meet in late July, but the likelihood of a rate cut at that time is uncertain. (not investment advice)</p>

        </div>
        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>When facing both medical and credit card debt, determining which to pay off first requires careful consideration. Credit card debt can damage credit scores more quickly due to monthly reporting and high interest rates, while medical debt often has a longer grace period. Credit card debt also compounds faster, making it crucial to prioritize to avoid escalating balances. Both types of debt can end up in collections, but credit card issuers are generally more aggressive. The article suggests prioritizing credit card debt to protect credit scores and avoid compounding interest, while exploring options like financial assistance and payment plans for medical debt. Managing both types of debt proactively is essential for financial well-being. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>The Vera C. Rubin Observatory in Chile has released its first images, marking a significant milestone in astronomical observation. The observatory, designed as a survey telescope, aims to create a comprehensive, 4-D map of the cosmos, cataloging billions of astronomical objects over a 10-year period. Its data pipeline connects the observatory to SLAC National Accelerator Laboratory in California, enabling the analysis and distribution of images to astronomers worldwide. The observatory is expected to amplify the capabilities of existing observatories and potentially detect near-Earth objects and evidence of alien intelligence. The project represents a remarkable feat of human coordination and engineering, pushing the boundaries of what is possible with Earth's resources.</p>

          <p>A powerful new telescope in Chile, the Vera C Rubin observatory, has released its first images, showcasing its ability to peer into the depths of the universe. The telescope detected over 2,000 new asteroids and seven space objects close to Earth in just 10 hours. The telescope will capture an image roughly every 40 seconds for ten years, every three days, for a Legacy Survey of Space and Time. The observatory's big goals, she adds, is to "understand the history of the Universe" which means being able to see faint galaxies or supernova explosions that happened "billions of years ago". The images are expected to transform our understanding of the universe and help detect potentially dangerous objects near Earth.</p>

The move comes amid a resurgence of interest in nuclear power, driven by increasing electricity demand from data centers and the electrification of industries.

The door latches may remain locked after a driver or front seat passenger exits the vehicle and shuts the door, potentially trapping a child or other passenger who is unable to use the interior door releases. The recall affects model years 2021-2025. Ford will notify owners of the safety risk, and dealerships will fix the problem by updating the vehicles' software. The remedy is expected to be available by late September. This recall addresses a potential safety concern for rear seat passengers.</p>

Chinese exports of batteries, laptops, smartphones, and solar panels to the EU have reached unprecedented levels in some countries. Lithium-ion battery exports across the EU surged by 52 per cent from a year earlier. This shift has resulted in a notable increase in the EU's trade deficit with China.</p>

          <p>US Soccer's new National Training Center (NTC) is under construction in Trilith, Georgia, with the goal of creating the best training facility in the world. The project, funded in part by Arthur M Blank, aims to consolidate the country's 27 national teams in one central hub. The facility will include numerous grass and artificial pitches, indoor facilities, and locker rooms. The NTC is expected to be a gamechanger for football in the US, fostering connections between youth and senior players and serving as a hub for coaching education and referee certification. The location in Atlanta was chosen for its climate, proximity to Europe, and corporate support.</p>

          <p>Death Stranding 2, a video game written and directed by Hideo Kojima, casts the player as a delivery man in a post-apocalyptic world, exploring anxieties about technology and human intimacy. The game invites players to consider how technology can alienate us, both from one another and from our physical selves. The game's premise involves delivering essential items to isolated communities, connecting them to a fictional version of the internet. While the game emphasizes the benefits of an interconnected society, it also highlights how technology can strip interactions of humanity. The game emphasizes the importance of physical bonds and tangible experiences in a world increasingly dominated by digital connections.</p>
