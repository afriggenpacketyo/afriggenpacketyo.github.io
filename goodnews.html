          <p>The UK government has committed ¬£14.2 billion to build the Sizewell C nuclear plant in Suffolk, aiming to create 10,000 direct jobs and power six million homes. Chancellor Rachel Reeves described the decision as a landmark move to kickstart economic growth, while Energy Secretary Ed Miliband emphasized its necessity for a 'golden age of clean energy'. The investment is part of a broader strategy to eliminate fossil fuels from the UK's energy grid by 2030, although the plant will take at least a decade to complete. Concerns remain about the project's cost and potential impact on consumer bills.</p>

          <p>Fatal drug overdoses among young Americans have plummeted, with a significant reduction in overdose risk among Gen Z, particularly ages 20 to 29. The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) data indicates a substantial drop in drug deaths among people under 35. Experts attribute the decline to factors such as wider distribution of Narcan, less deadly fentanyl being sold, increased addiction healthcare access, and a shift towards less risky drug use. Despite the positive trend, challenges remain for those struggling with severe addiction, and potential cuts in funding for addiction services could jeopardize the progress.</p>
