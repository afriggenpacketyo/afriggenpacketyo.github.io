          <p>A gambling expert provides betting trends for the Kentucky Derby, highlighting that irregular bettors often seek better value in horses rather than betting on favorites. Creative bets like exactas, trifectas, and superfectas are popular due to their potential for high payouts. DraftKings is offering a promotion where new users can split a $1 million pot by correctly picking the winner with their first $5 bet. The current favorites are Journalism at 3-1, Sovereignty at 9-2, and Sandman at 5-1. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>Five people were rescued after surviving 36 hours in an alligator-infested swamp in Bolivia following an emergency landing. The pilot and four passengers, including three women and a child, were found atop the capsized plane in good condition. The plane lost altitude and was forced to land in a swamp near a lagoon. The survivors faced dangers from alligators and an anaconda, and they survived by eating cassava flour. Local fishermen spotted the group, leading to their rescue by helicopter.</p>

          <p>Germany is debating a nationwide smartphone ban in schools, with some states already implementing pilot programs. One high school in North Rhine-Westphalia is testing a ban, requiring students to leave their phones off in their bags during the school day. Supporters argue that the ban reduces distractions, increases social interaction, and mitigates cyberbullying. However, some student representatives and unions are skeptical, arguing that students should learn responsible smartphone use instead.</p>

          <p>Two major US scientific societies, the American Meteorological Society (AMS) and the American Geophysical Union (AGU), are collaborating to produce peer-reviewed research on the climate crisis. This effort follows the Trump administration's dismissal of contributors to the National Climate Assessment. The collaboration aims to sustain momentum on climate research and provide science-based support for solutions. The project intends to create a mechanism for ongoing research on the impacts of climate change.</p>

          <p>Anthony Albanese of Australia has won a second term as Prime Minister, defying expectations and securing a larger parliamentary majority for the Labor Party. The victory came amid global uncertainty stemming from the Trump administration and concerns over the cost of living. Albanese emphasized that Australians had chosen 'to face global challenges the Australian way', distancing himself from international influences. The election saw the defeat of opposition leader Peter Dutton, whose association with Trump's policies may have contributed to his loss.</p>
