          <p>A new mural attributed to the street artist Banksy has appeared on an external wall of the Royal Courts of Justice in London. The artwork depicts a judge in traditional attire striking a protester on the ground, a piece that seems to comment on protest rights. Banksy claimed the work on Instagram, his typical method of authentication. Despite public interest, court officials stated the mural would be removed to maintain the character of the listed building, and police are investigating it as criminal damage.</p>

The Great Run Company acknowledged the error, which also appeared on T-shirts, calling it a unique keepsake. They admitted that despite many people reviewing the design, no one noticed the geographical mistake before the event.</p>
