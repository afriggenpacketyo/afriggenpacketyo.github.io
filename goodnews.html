          <h2>CATL Shares Surge in Hong Kong Debut Amidst EV Boom</h2>
          <div class="timestamp">2025-05-20 02:49:12 EDT</div>
        </div>
        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Shares of Contemporary Amperex Technology, the world's largest battery manufacturer, experienced a significant surge of over 18% during their Hong Kong debut, driven by investor confidence in the company's capacity to capitalize on the booming electric vehicle market. The IPO successfully raised HK$35.7 billion ($4.6 billion), making it the largest offering globally this year, and the funds will be directed towards constructing a new factory in Hungary to cater to European automotive clients such as Stellantis, BMW, and Volkswagen. CATL's expansion into Europe is strategically timed, given the anticipated slowdown in growth within China due to high sales penetration and increased scrutiny from the U.S. and EU, who have placed punitive tariffs on EVs made in China due to unfair trade practices. The company aims to solidify its position as a key player in the global EV battery supply chain. </p>

          <p>Iga Swiatek, known as the 'Queen of Clay' for her dominance at the French Open, is seeking her fourth title in five years at Roland Garros, although she faces considerable doubts this year. The 23-year-old Pole arrives in Paris without winning a WTA tournament in the first five months of the season, leading to a drop in her world ranking to fifth. This marks the first time since 2020 that Swiatek enters the tournament without a title win beforehand, raising questions about her ability to continue her reign on the clay court. Despite the challenges, her past success and expertise on clay make her a formidable contender. </p>

          <p>A memorial bust of Jim Morrison, the lead singer of The Doors, that was stolen from his grave in Paris's P√®re-Lachaise cemetery 37 years ago has been recovered by French police during an unrelated fraud investigation. The statue, carved by Croatian artist Mladen Mikulin, was stolen in 1988, seven years after it was placed at the site to mark the 10th anniversary of Morrison's death. The police made the discovery while investigating a case of fraud, but it remains unclear whether the bust will be returned to the grave. The grave of Jim Morrison has long attracted fans of the rock band, with graffiti sprawling across neighboring gravestones. </p>

          <p>Manchester United's Europa League final against Tottenham is portrayed as a pivotal moment for the club, with the potential to generate over ¬£100 million through Champions League participation. The match's outcome could significantly impact the club's finances and future prospects, given their disappointing domestic campaign and substantial debt. While qualification for the Champions League would benefit both teams, it is argued that United needs it more due to their larger financial deficit. Failure to win could lead to a further decline, while victory would free up funds for player acquisitions. </p>

          <p>The Senate has confirmed Charles Kushner as the ambassador to France and Monaco by a vote of 51-45, following President Trump's announcement of his intention to nominate him. Kushner, who was pardoned by Trump for previous federal tax evasion and FEC violations, stated before the Senate Foreign Relations Committee that he had made "very, very, very serious mistakes." Despite his past, he asserted that his mistakes have made him more qualified for the job, and he is the father of Trump's son-in-law and former advisor, Jared Kushner. </p>
