          <h2>Japanese Doctors Criticize Continued COVID Restrictions in Hospitals</h2>

          <p>Despite much of the world moving past the COVID-19 pandemic, many hospitals in Japan still maintain strict visitation policies, causing distress for families wanting to see loved ones, especially those terminally ill. A group of physicians and social workers is now protesting these restrictions, calling them a violation of human rights. They argue that there is no scientific evidence to support the effectiveness of these measures in preventing infection spread, with some hospitals even allowing pets but not grandchildren to visit. The health ministry has recommended flexibility but leaves the final decision to individual facilities, leading to inconsistent policies across the country.</p>

          <p>Yosemite National Park's eastern entrance, Tioga Road, will reopen on Memorial Day, marking an earlier opening than in previous years, much to the delight of many visitors.

Visitors planning to enter Yosemite during peak hours over the holiday weekend or during the summer will need a reservation and should expect potential delays. Park officials are also urging visitors to be patient and courteous due to potential staffing shortages resulting from budget cuts at the National Park Service.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>A recent study indicates that dog owners who frequently ruminate about work-related stress may inadvertently pass their anxiety onto their canine companions. The research found a correlation between owners with high job stress and increased stress-related behaviors in their dogs, such as whining and restlessness. This "crossover" of stress is attributed to emotional contagion, where dogs pick up on human feelings through subtle cues. The article suggests that employed dog owners should try to avoid dwelling on work problems at home to protect the well-being of their pets.</p>

          <p>Chinese military scientists have revealed a technological breakthrough in electromagnetic coilgun technology, achieving a firing rate of 3,000 rounds per minute. This rate significantly surpasses traditional firearms and US commercial models. The advancement centers on eliminating capacitors, which are devices that store electrical energy, from the coilgun's design. By powering the coilgun directly with lithium batteries, the scientists have overcome the recharging lag time that previously limited the firing rate of electromagnetic weapons.</p>

          <p>Juan Soto's two-run double in the fourth inning propelled the New York Mets to a 5-2 victory over the Los Angeles Dodgers, exploiting the Dodgers' already taxed pitching staff. The Dodgers' starter, Tony Gonsolin, struggled with command after a solid start, issuing consecutive walks that loaded the bases for Soto. With the bullpen fatigued from the previous night's extra-inning game, the Dodgers were unable to effectively respond to Soto's hit. David Peterson, the Mets' starter, pitched effectively, going deep into the game and securing the win for New York.</p>

          <p>The Japanese government plans to improve working conditions for chefs at its overseas diplomatic missions in response to increasing competition for talent amid the global popularity of Japanese cuisine. The new scheme, set to begin in January, will offer chefs annual salaries of over 6 million yen, an increase from the current average. The chefs will also be allowed to opt for government-covered rented accommodation, and improvements include adding funds to the chefs' salaries for them to use in bringing their spouses to countries where they work.</p>

          <p>South Western Railway (SWR) has been renationalized, marking the first train company to transfer to public ownership under the Labour government, though part of the inaugural route will use a rail replacement bus service. The government has hailed the move as a "new dawn for rail" but stopped short of promising lower fares, focusing instead on improving services and reinvesting profits into infrastructure. Unions have voiced concerns about outsourcing to private companies, while the opposition Conservatives have called on Labour to deliver on their promises. SWR trains will now be integrated into Great British Railways (GBR), which will oversee all railway infrastructure.</p>

While the midges do not bite, dead ones can cause allergic reactions if inhaled, prompting officials to advise those with asthma to wear face masks. The expo organizer is taking action by spraying insecticide, treating areas with growth inhibitors, and installing insect repellent lights to combat the infestation.</p>

          <p>Susan Brownmiller, the influential feminist author of "Against Our Will: Men, Women and Rape," passed away at the age of 90. Her groundbreaking book redefined sexual assault as a crime of power and violence rather than passion, influencing laws and societal attitudes. While celebrated for her contributions, Brownmiller also faced criticism for some of her views, particularly her stance on pornography and the responsibility of women in preventing sexual assault. Her work sparked debate and transformed the conversation around sexual violence.</p>
