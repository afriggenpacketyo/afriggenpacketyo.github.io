          <p>Israel has reportedly paused its offensive military operations in the Gaza Strip to create an opportunity for Hamas to organize the release of hostages. An Israeli official clarified this is not a formal ceasefire or the beginning of a withdrawal, but a tactical adjustment to protect troops and allow negotiations to proceed. This development comes as U.S. envoys travel to Egypt to finalize details of a peace deal proposed by President Trump, with indirect talks between Israel and Hamas expected to begin Sunday. The pause is intended to test Hamas's readiness to accept the proposed terms.</p>

          <p>The Evangelical Lutheran Church in America (ELCA) has formally installed Reverend Yehiel Curry as its first Black presiding bishop. This marks a significant milestone for the predominantly white denomination, which has seen declining membership in recent years. Curry, who previously served as a regional bishop in Chicago, aims to foster a more connected and welcoming church, addressing challenges common to mainline Protestant denominations. His installation is viewed as a hopeful step toward greater diversity and representation within American Lutheranism.</p>

While denying some specific comments attributed to her, she announced a new committee to review officiating and confirmed that discussions for a new collective bargaining agreement are scheduled. Engelbert affirmed her commitment to remain as commissioner and work towards shared goals like increasing player salaries.</p>

          <p>Costco is partnering with drugmaker Novo Nordisk to sell GLP-1 medications, including Ozempic and Wegovy, to its members for approximately $499 for a four-week supply. This price represents a roughly 50% discount compared to the typical out-of-pocket cost and is available to members with a valid prescription who are not covered by insurance. The move aims to provide access to authentic versions of the high-demand weight-loss drugs amid soaring prices and the proliferation of cheaper, unregulated compounded alternatives. This could significantly increase accessibility for the popular medications.</p>

          <p>After two decades of extensive restoration work, Egypt has opened the tomb of Pharaoh Amenhotep III to the public in Luxor's Valley of the Kings. The tomb, dating back over 3,000 years, is one of the largest in the valley and features exquisitely decorated wall paintings. The complex, Japanese-led restoration project involved over 260 specialists who worked to save the site from severe deterioration. The tomb includes a main burial chamber for the king and two additional chambers for his queens, offering visitors a new glimpse into the art and history of the Eighteenth Dynasty.</p>

          <p>Hamas has announced its agreement to several key components of the Gaza peace plan proposed by President Trump, including the release of all hostages and handing over Gaza's administration to an independent Palestinian body. While accepting these core tenets, the group indicated that other parts of the 20-point proposal require further negotiation within a broader Palestinian framework. Following the announcement, President Trump urged Israel to halt its bombing of Gaza to facilitate the process, and the Israeli Prime Minister's office stated it is preparing to implement the first phase of the plan.</p>

          <p>The U.S. stock market demonstrated resilience, with the S&P 500 achieving another record high this week despite the ongoing federal government shutdown. The rally was partly driven by a strong performance in the healthcare sector, following a deal exempting Pfizer from certain tariffs, which lifted stocks like Danaher and Eli Lilly. The technology and utilities sectors also performed well, fueled by continued enthusiasm for artificial intelligence and its power demands. Despite a modest dip on Friday, both the S&P 500 and Nasdaq have had a strong start to the month. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>Despite U.S. stock markets trading near record highs, some financial experts are advising investors to diversify by increasing their exposure to overseas markets. Analysts argue that American investors exhibit a strong "home bias," potentially missing out on better value and long-term growth opportunities abroad, particularly in emerging markets like China and India. The iShares MSCI Emerging Markets ETF recently hit a 52-week high, signaling growing strength. India, in particular, is highlighted for its large population, strong demographics, and rapid economic growth, which is driving consumption. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>A civil rights alliance in Pakistan-administered Kashmir has called off days of violent protests after reaching an agreement with Pakistani authorities. The demonstrations, which left at least 10 people dead, were sparked by demands for cheaper wheat, reduced electricity tariffs, and an end to lavish benefits for the political elite. The regional government has agreed to the protesters' demands, prompting the alliance's leader to ask demonstrators to disperse. The breakthrough came after Pakistan's Prime Minister Shehbaz Sharif sent a delegation to negotiate with the protest leaders.</p>
