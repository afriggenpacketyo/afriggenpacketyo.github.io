          <p>Steel stocks experienced a surge following President Trump's decision to double tariffs on steel imports to 50%. Cleveland-Cliffs shares jumped by approximately 25% in premarket trading, while Steel Dynamics and Nucor both saw increases of over 10%. The VanEck Steel ETF (SLX) also rose by 1.9% as a result of the tariff hike. This move by the Trump administration has reignited trade tensions and has drawn criticism from various global partners, who are concerned about the potential impact on international trade and economic relations.

          <p>Tulsa's mayor, Monroe Nichols, has proposed a $100 million private trust to address the lingering effects of the 1921 Tulsa race massacre, offering scholarships and housing assistance to descendants. This initiative, framed as a "road to repair," aims to revitalize North Tulsa's Greenwood district, which was destroyed in the massacre, with a significant portion of the funds allocated to improving buildings and infrastructure. While the plan does not include direct cash payments, it acknowledges the economic devastation inflicted on the Black community and seeks to restore Greenwood's commercial prominence. The proposal faces a challenging political climate, but Nichols emphasizes the importance of addressing historical injustices and fostering economic opportunity in Tulsa.</p>

          <p>Nvidia is reportedly developing a new artificial intelligence (AI) chip tailored for the Chinese market, designed to comply with U.S. export regulations. The chip, known as B30, will allow users to connect multiple units, creating high-performance computing clusters. Nvidia plans to produce over one million units of the B30 chip this year in an effort to maintain its market share in China. The new GPU is expected to be introduced in July and is likely based on Nvidia's Blackwell platform.</p>

          <p>In 2013, Stephen Curry made a surprising move by signing with Under Armour, an upstart athletic company, over industry giant Nike. The decision was influenced by Curry's Golden State Warriors teammate, Kent Bazemore, and a botched Nike presentation. Under Armour offered Curry a $4 million annual deal, while Nike declined to match the offer of $2.5 million. Curry's partnership with Under Armour has evolved, with Curry becoming president of the Curry Brand in 2023. The brand invests a portion of its revenue in under-resourced communities.</p>

          <p>A new treatment for PTSD called Reconsolidation of Traumatic Memories (RTM) claims to be painless, with patients reimagining their trauma through mental exercises to fade its emotional charge. RTM follows a manualized 89-step protocol, where patients reimagine their trauma through a series of specific mental exercises meant to fade its emotional charge. A large-scale clinical trial of RTM found that 89% of patients completed RTM, compared with a 73% completion rate for prolonged exposure, and after treatment, nearly 70% of RTM patients no longer met the criteria for a PTSD diagnosis, compared with 61% of prolonged-exposure patients. Despite skepticism from some researchers, RTM offers a potentially gentler way of addressing past trauma.</p>

          <p>Despite declining church attendance, charismatic Christianity is flourishing, showcasing the paradox of the secular age where secularism has supercharged religion's extraordinary elements. Charismatic Christians, believing in the power of the Holy Spirit, are the fastest-growing group of Christians. Eighty-seven percent of Americans subscribe to at least one New Age belief, such as karma, reincarnation, or telepathy. This cultural landscape reflects a desire for tangible contact with divine power and trust in personal experience over experts, which also influences politics, as seen in the rise of leaders like Donald Trump.</p>

          <p>The UK government plans to modernize flight paths to reduce journey times, delays, and aviation emissions. The UK Airspace Design Service (UKADS) will redesign routes, focusing initially on London's airspace. The changes, expected in the 2030s, aim to allow planes to climb and descend more smoothly. While ministers emphasize climate benefits, some residents fear new flight paths over previously unaffected areas. The changes are the largest to UK airspace since the 1950s, reflecting a significant increase in air traffic.</p>
