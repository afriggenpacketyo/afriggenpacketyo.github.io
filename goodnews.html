        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Author Philippa Langley, known for discovering King Richard III's remains, claims the two young princes allegedly murdered in the Tower of London actually survived. Her new book argues that the narrative of their murder was Tudor propaganda created to delegitimize Richard III. Langley's "Missing Princes Project" reportedly uncovered documents suggesting the elder prince, Edward V, lived on under a different identity. While the theory challenges a long-held historical belief, some experts remain skeptical, arguing it was too risky for Richard III to have left the legitimate heirs alive.</p>

          <p>A 72-year-old man, Mark Sanfratello, has been extradited to Oregon to face a murder charge in the 1983 death of his then-girlfriend, Teresa Peroni. Peroni, 27, disappeared after a party, and her skull was found years later. The case was reopened in 2024, and investigators used new DNA evidence and modern forensic testing to obtain new evidence and secure an indictment. The arrest brings a long-awaited development in the 41-year-old cold case, highlighting the role of technological advancements in delivering justice for victims and their families.</p>

          <p>The price of ether surged as the U.S. Congress passed the GENIUS Act, a major piece of stablecoin legislation, sending it to the president for signature. For the first time, daily inflows into ether-tracking ETFs surpassed those for bitcoin ETFs, signaling a potential shift in crypto market leadership. This legislative milestone, the first of its kind in the U.S., is seen as a significant symbolic victory for the crypto industry, providing regulatory clarity. The bill's passage has fueled a strong rally for ether, which is trading at multi-month highs. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>American Express saw a 7% jump in overall card spending in the second quarter, driven by its affluent customer base, which has insulated it from a broader slowdown. However, a notable exception was in travel, where spending on airline tickets remained flat compared to the previous year, specifically in domestic economy fares. Despite beating profit and revenue expectations, the company's stock fell due to investor concerns about the high costs of its rewards programs amid increasing competition. The slowdown in airfare spending presents a potential headwind for the credit card giant. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>The annual royal "swan upping" survey on the River Thames has found a promising increase in the number of young swans, signaling a potential recovery for the population. The five-day count found 115 cygnets, a notable rise from the 86 counted last year, offering hope after a steep decline over the past two years due to avian flu and human cruelty. The centuries-old tradition, led by the King's swan marker, now serves primarily as a conservation and educational effort. While the numbers are still below previous highs, the results provide an optimistic outlook for the iconic birds.</p>

          <p>Chevron has successfully completed its $53 billion acquisition of Hess Corporation, gaining access to significant oil assets in Guyana. The deal was finalized after an international arbitration panel ruled in Chevron's favor, defeating a challenge from Exxon Mobil. Exxon had claimed a right of first refusal over Hess's stake in the lucrative Stabroek Block oil development off the coast of Guyana. The resolution of this dispute removes a major uncertainty that had been weighing on Chevron's stock and affirms that such rights do not typically apply to corporate-level mergers.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>U.S. consumers' expectations for future inflation have dropped significantly, returning to levels seen before recent tariff announcements, according to the latest University of Michigan survey. The one-year inflation forecast fell to 4.4% in July from 5% in June, while the five-year outlook also declined. This suggests that while consumers remain wary, they believe the inflationary impact of tariffs will be temporary. The easing of inflation fears is an encouraging sign for the Federal Reserve, though overall consumer sentiment remains below its long-term average. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>Despite leading the National League, the Los Angeles Dodgers face significant challenges as they enter the second half of the season. Key questions revolve around the health and stability of their pitching staff, which has been plagued by injuries to key players like Tyler Glasnow and Blake Snell. Another major uncertainty is how Shohei Ohtani will be utilized as a pitcher and how his body will hold up to the two-way demands. The team also needs its star hitters, Mookie Betts and Freddie Freeman, to break out of slumps to ensure the offense performs to its potential.</p>

          <p>For retirees on a fixed Social Security income, managing credit card debt can be particularly challenging, but relief options are available. While being on Social Security does not disqualify individuals from debt relief programs, eligibility often depends on demonstrating financial hardship and having some capacity to make payments. Strategies such as debt management plans, credit card hardship programs, and debt settlement can be viable options for seniors. It is important for retirees to choose an approach that aligns with their fixed income, and consulting a debt relief expert can help. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>Delta and United Airlines are increasingly distinguishing themselves from competitors, capturing over 86% of the profits among the seven largest U.S. airlines last year. Analysts attribute their success to strong brand loyalty, extensive international networks, and a strategic focus on premium travel, which insulates them from weaker domestic demand. While the industry faces challenges like falling airfares for economy seats, both airlines have leveraged their premium cabins and loyalty programs to maintain profitability. This performance gap is expected to widen as they invest in high-margin offerings. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>Andrea Gibson, the poet laureate of Colorado who died this week, built a powerful career on making poetry accessible and emotionally direct.

Their work prioritized a clear, open-hearted connection with the audience, beloved by many for its empathy and gentleness. By leaning into the spoken word and universal themes, Gibson created a platform to spread a message of kindness and understanding to a broad and devoted following.</p>

          <p>The UK government's spending on hotels for asylum seekers decreased by nearly a third in the last fiscal year, falling from £3 billion to £2.1 billion. This reduction was primarily driven by moving asylum seekers into cheaper accommodations, such as shared housing, and renegotiating contracts. However, the number of people housed in hotels at the end of March 2025 was higher than the previous June. Experts warn that the recent surge in small boat crossings could reverse these savings, and £270 million paid to Rwanda for the scrapped deportation scheme will not be refunded.
