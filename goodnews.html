          <p>At a major Shanghai Cooperation Organization (SCO) summit in Tianjin, Chinese President Xi Jinping called for members to strengthen cooperation in artificial intelligence while rejecting a "Cold War mentality." Against a backdrop of ongoing US trade tensions and global conflicts, Xi positioned China as a global peacemaker, highlighting billions in investments in other SCO countries. The summit, attended by leaders like Russia's Vladimir Putin and India's Narendra Modi, was an opportunity for China to promote a new phase of high-quality development and regional partnership.</p>

          <p>China's manufacturing sector showed surprising expansion in August, with the private RatingDog purchasing managers' index rising to 50.5, marking its fastest growth in five months. This result, which sharply beat economists' estimates, was driven by a recovery in new export orders amid a trade-war truce with the U.S. However, this optimistic private survey contrasts with China's official manufacturing PMI, which reported a fifth consecutive month of contraction, suggesting that domestic demand remains soft and the recovery may be fragile.

          <p>At a summit in Tianjin, Chinese President Xi Jinping expressed his ambition to elevate the Shanghai Cooperation Organisation (SCO) into a new model for international relations that challenges the U.S.-led global order. Addressing world leaders including Russia's Vladimir Putin, Xi positioned the security-focused bloc as an alternative that opposes hegemonism and external interference. The gathering is being viewed as a major demonstration of Global South solidarity and a key part of China's strategy to build a new global security framework.</p>

          <p>A government-commissioned report has found that Australia's proposed social media ban for children under 16 is technically possible to enforce, but all available methods come with significant risks or shortcomings. The report analyzed various age verification technologies, including government ID checks and facial assessment, highlighting concerns about data privacy and accuracy. Despite these challenges, the government remains committed to the policy, urging large tech companies to implement a layered system of age assurance methods before the ban takes effect in December.</p>

          <p>Alibaba Group's Hong Kong-listed shares surged by nearly 19% after the company released a better-than-expected earnings report for its fiscal first quarter. The strong performance was primarily fueled by accelerated sales in its cloud-computing division, which saw a 26% year-over-year revenue increase driven by robust demand for artificial intelligence services. This growth in the cloud unit, along with a revival in its e-commerce business, overshadowed a slight miss on overall revenue estimates and boosted investor confidence. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>This article revisits the storied history of the American Volunteer Group (AVG), famously known as the "Flying Tigers," who served as mercenaries for China before the U.S. officially entered World War II. These American pilots and mechanics are credited with destroying hundreds of Japanese planes and are still revered in China today as heroes who helped save the country. Despite current U.S.-China tensions, their legacy endures as a powerful symbol of past cooperation between the two nations.</p>

          <p>An article in The Guardian provides a detailed look at the significant decorative changes President Donald Trump has made to the Oval Office, applying what he calls "Trump touches." The room's decor now features extensive gold trimming on the ceiling, door frames, and fireplace, along with a proliferation of gold trophies and vases. This aesthetic, reportedly inspired by the Palace of Versailles and paid for by Trump personally, has drawn polarized reactions, with some calling it fitting for a "golden age" and others deeming it "vulgar."</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>A global surge in demand for matcha, driven by its superfood status and social media popularity, has led to skyrocketing prices and supply shortages, even in Japan. The boom has strained Japan's aging farming communities, who struggle with the labor-intensive process of growing the specific tea leaves, called tencha, required for high-quality matcha. As a result, tencha auction prices have jumped 170%, and many retailers in Tokyo and online have been forced to implement purchase limits to manage their dwindling stock.</p>
