          <p>Kenan Yildiz scored two goals, leading Juventus to a 4-1 victory over Wydad in their Group G match at Lincoln Financial Field in Philadelphia. The win puts Juventus on the verge of qualifying for the last 16 of the Club World Cup. Yildiz contributed to the opening goal, forcing an own goal from a Wydad defender, and later scored a spectacular goal from outside the box. Juventus will secure their spot in the next round if Al Ain fails to defeat Manchester City in their match. </p>

          <p>As war spreads, local Iranians in Los Angeles are finding comfort in Persian restaurants and community spaces, such as Azizam in Silver Lake and Tehrangeles in Westwood.

Many Iranian Americans, while critical of the Iranian regime, express fear for their families in Iran and hope for a peaceful resolution. Restaurants like Azizam are hosting events to foster community and provide a safe space for Iranians to gather. </p>

          <p>Vice President JD Vance stated that the United States is not at war with Iran, but rather with "Iran's nuclear program," following U.S. strikes on three of the country's nuclear sites. Vance's remarks came after Defense Secretary Pete Hegseth claimed Iran's "nuclear ambitions have been obliterated." Vance emphasized that the U.S. desires peace, but only in the context of Iran not possessing a nuclear weapons program. White House officials touted the success of the mission in destroying the nuclear facilities, but the extent of the damage was still being assessed. </p>

          <p>Ben Stokes made a crucial breakthrough for England after Harry Brook's impressive 99 on the third day of the first Test against India at Headingley. India was building a lead when Stokes dismissed Sai Sudharsan, leaving India at 90-2 with a 96-run advantage. Brook, dropped twice during his innings, looked set for a century until he was caught out. The match is delicately poised, with both teams vying for control. </p>

          <p>Middle Eastern markets mostly ended higher on Sunday after the United States struck three key Iranian nuclear sites. Stocks in Tel Aviv reached an all-time high, driven by expectations that Washington's involvement would help resolve the conflict with Tehran. Saudi Arabia's Tadawul closed slightly down, while Qatar and Bahrain saw gains. Egypt's EGX30 was the major gainer in the region. Analysts suggest the Gulf's call for appeasement and condemnation of Israeli aggression has helped insulate it from significant short-term market impact. (not investment advice)</p>

        </div>
        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Based on studies of over 200 parent-child relationships, certain phrases can instantly make children refuse to listen. Instead of using threats, bribes, or harsh consequences, parents can use language that encourages cooperation. Avoiding phrases like "Because I said so," "If you don't listen, you'll lose [X privilege]," and "Stop crying. You're fine" can improve communication. Instead, parents can explain their reasoning, give children agency over their behavior, and validate their emotions to foster a more cooperative environment. </p>

          <p>Spain has reached an agreement with NATO to be exempt from the alliance's 5% defense spending target. Prime Minister Pedro Sanchez stated that such spending would be disproportionate and unnecessary for Spain. While respecting other countries' desires to increase defense investment, Spain plans to meet its NATO commitments by spending only 2.1% of its GDP. This decision follows Sanchez's earlier letter to NATO chief Mark Rutte expressing his country's intention to opt out of the new spending target. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>NATO members have reached an agreement to increase defense spending to 5% of their countries' GDP, a goal long advocated by President Trump. Spain, however, secured an exemption from this target after staunch opposition. The agreement requires member nations, excluding Spain, to reach the 5% goal by 2035, with at least 3.5% allocated to core military needs and 1.5% to related expenditures. Spain's Prime Minister Sanchez cited that such spending would be unreasonable and counterproductive. (not investment advice)</p>
