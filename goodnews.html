          <p>Despite ongoing trade tensions between the US and China, Chinese companies are determined to expand their global presence, with the US remaining a key market. Camera company Insta360, recently listed on Shanghai's STAR board, considers the US one of its largest markets, accounting for over 23% of its revenue. Other companies, such as Hisense and Bc Babycare, are also expanding into the US, unfazed by geopolitical risks. This trend reflects a shift towards Chinese companies building international brands with local offices and employees, moving beyond manufacturing for foreign brands or joint ventures.

          <p>China is making strides in the production of high-performance photonic chips, which could lead to significant advancements in artificial intelligence (AI), 6G, and quantum computing. Shanghai Jiao Tong University Chip Hub for Integrated Photonics Xplore (CHIPX) has initiated production of 6-inch wafers for thin-film lithium niobate (TFLN) photonic chips, utilizing light instead of electrical signals for data transmission. While Europe and the US are already established in this field, China's pilot production line is demonstrating gains in technical performance. TFLN's ultra-fast electro-optic effect, high bandwidth, and low power consumption make it an emerging high-performance optoelectronic material.</p>
