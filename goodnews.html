          <p>United Airlines is planning to return to New York's John F. Kennedy International Airport through a new partnership with JetBlue Airways. The partnership, called Blue Sky, will allow the airlines to sell seats on each other's sites and offer reciprocal loyalty benefits. JetBlue's leaders have long expressed the need for partnerships to compete against larger airlines like United and Delta. This new partnership differs from JetBlue's former alliance with American Airlines, which was struck down on antitrust grounds, and the financial details of the deal have not been disclosed.</p>

          <p>This article explores the shift away from collective child-rearing norms in America and argues for the benefits of allowing other adults to correct children's behavior in public. The author recounts an experience in Prague where a stranger gently corrected her daughter, highlighting how this sort of intervention is less common in the United States. Historically, child-rearing was a more communal endeavor, with neighbors, teachers, and even strangers feeling empowered to correct a child's misbehavior. While acknowledging the potential drawbacks of collective discipline, the author suggests that it can reinforce lessons parents are trying to impart and help children understand the needs and boundaries of others.</p>

          <p>Markets around the world rose on Thursday after a panel of U.S. judges blocked President Trump from imposing some of his steepest tariffs. Futures for the S&P 500 index jumped more than 1 percent, suggesting that stocks will open higher in New York. Nvidia, the chip giant, was also pulling the market higher, after it reported strong earnings growth on Wednesday. Investors sold U.S. government bonds, and the yield on the 30-year Treasury note rose back above 5 percent. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>A Chinese paraglider, Peng Yujiang, survived an accidental flight to 8,500m above sea level after being pulled into a cloud formation by a strong updraft. The incident occurred over the Qilian mountains while Peng was testing new equipment. He narrowly avoided death due to thin oxygen levels and extremely low temperatures at that altitude. Chinese authorities are investigating the incident, and Peng has been suspended for six months because the flight was unauthorized.</p>

          <p>This article discusses the evolving role of Google in the age of AI, as the company faces competition from AI chatbots like ChatGPT and Perplexity. Google is attempting to reinvent itself with AI Overviews and AI Mode, which provide summarized search results and chatbot-based search experiences. However, these AI-powered tools can be unreliable and may lead to publishers seeing declines in traffic as users bypass traditional websites. The author explores whether Google can maintain its dominance in a future where the traditional list of blue links may no longer be the primary way people find information online.</p>

          <p>Vice President JD Vance addressed the Bitcoin 2025 conference, stating that the Trump administration does not view stablecoins as a threat to the U.S. dollar. Vance emphasized the administration's pro-crypto agenda and highlighted the potential benefits of stablecoin legislation, such as the GENIUS Act. David Sacks, President Trump's top crypto advisor, has said that a legal framework for stablecoins could create trillions of dollars of demand for U.S. Treasuries. Democrats have previously raised concerns about potential conflicts of interest due to President Trump's personal cryptocurrency ventures. (not investment advice)</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>This article examines the movement to modernize U.S. building codes to allow single-stair housing for buildings up to six stories, a common practice in many other countries. Advocates argue that this reform could significantly reduce construction costs and encourage the development of more affordable "missing middle" housing. While facing opposition from fire safety officials, the single-stair movement has gained traction, with several states considering or implementing changes to allow this design. The article explores the historical reasons for the U.S.'s double-staircase standard and the potential benefits of allowing more flexible unit layouts.</p>
