          <h2>Trump Administration Sues Colorado and Denver Over Sanctuary Policies</h2>
          <div class="timestamp">2025-05-05 02:28:31 EDT</div>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>The Department of Justice has filed a lawsuit against the state of Colorado and the city of Denver, alleging that their "sanctuary laws" interfere with federal immigration enforcement. The lawsuit argues that these policies violate the Supremacy Clause of the Constitution and have allowed criminal elements, such as the Venezuelan gang Tren de Aragua, to operate within the state. Local officials dispute the extent of the gang's control, but the Justice Department contends that the policies hinder the enforcement of federal immigration laws. Colorado officials maintain they are not a sanctuary state and cooperate with law enforcement agencies. </p>

          <p>The finance chiefs of the Association of Southeast Asian Nations, Japan, China, and South Korea have cautioned about the potential global economic fallout from protectionist trade policies following the announcement of higher import tariffs by U.S. President Donald Trump. They expressed concerns that escalating trade protectionism could weigh on global trade, leading to economic fragmentation and affecting trade, investment, and capital flows across the region. This warning highlights the growing international concern over the impact of protectionist measures on the global economy and the importance of multilateral cooperation in addressing trade challenges. The statement was adopted during a meeting on the sidelines of the Asian Development Bank's annual meeting in Milan, Italy. </p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>President Donald Trump has directed the Bureau of Prisons, along with the Department of Justice, FBI, and Homeland Security, to reopen and substantially enlarge Alcatraz, the infamous former prison on an island near San Francisco. Trump stated that this action would serve as a "symbol of law, order, and justice" to house America's most ruthless and violent offenders. Leading Democrats have dismissed the proposal as unserious, while experts question the necessity and cost-effectiveness of reopening the facility, citing the current federal prison system's underutilization. Alcatraz, closed in 1963 due to high operating costs, currently functions as a popular tourist site. </p>

          <p>New evolutionary genetic analysis by Chinese and Dutch researchers has revealed that the first roses were likely yellow, challenging the common association of roses with pink and red colors. The study, published in Nature Plants, examined domesticated and wild rose samples to determine the traits of their common ancestor. The findings indicate that the ancestral rose likely had single-petal flowers with a yellow color and seven leaflets. Roses are known as the "queen of flowers" and a symbol of love and beauty from antiquity to modern times. </p>

Japan views ODA as a crucial diplomatic tool amid China's growing influence. The OECD report also showed an overall decline in ODA by Development Assistance Committee members, marking the first decrease after five years of growth. </p>

Japan used to have more trash bins in public spaces, but many were removed in recent years partly due to safety concerns.
