          <h2>Arsenal Nears Completion of Transfer Deal for Sporting Striker Viktor Gyokeres</h2>
          <div class="timestamp">2025-07-22 14:38:58 EDT</div>
        </div>
        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Arsenal is reportedly on the verge of finalizing a deal to sign Swedish striker Viktor Gyokeres from Sporting, with negotiations over add-on payments causing a slight delay. The transfer, valued at approximately £63.5 million, will see the 27-year-old forward join the Gunners on a five-year contract. Gyokeres has been a highly sought-after player after a prolific season where he scored 54 goals in 52 games for the Portuguese club. His signing is expected to bolster Arsenal's attacking options as manager Mikel Arteta seeks to add an elite center-forward to the squad for the upcoming season.</p>

          <p>President Donald Trump has announced that the United States has reached a trade and military agreement with the Philippines, although Manila has not yet confirmed the deal. According to Trump, the arrangement includes a 19% tariff on goods imported from the Philippines, while U.S. goods will face no tariffs. The announcement followed a meeting with Philippine President Ferdinand Marcos Jr., who stated his country is modernizing its military with U.S. assistance due to regional tensions. This development is part of Trump's broader strategy of using tariff letters to negotiate new bilateral trade deals with various nations.</p>

          <h2>Comparing Potential Earnings on a $20,000 CD Now Versus One Year Ago</h2>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>This article analyzes the potential interest earnings from a $20,000 certificate of deposit (CD), comparing current rates to those available a year prior. It demonstrates that while CD rates have decreased, they still offer substantial returns; for instance, a 2-year CD opened in 2024 at 5.72% would earn nearly $700 more than one opened in 2025 at 4.10%. Despite the decline from last year's peaks, current rates are significantly higher than those from the early 2020s. The analysis suggests that CDs remain a predictable and secure savings vehicle for those looking to avoid market volatility (not investment advice).</p>

          <p>Running back Nyheim Hines is set to make his return to the NFL after reaching a contract agreement with the Los Angeles Chargers. The 28-year-old missed the last two seasons after tearing his ACL in a jet ski accident in July 2023 while he was with the Buffalo Bills. Hines, known for his dual-threat capabilities as both a rusher and a receiver, will compete for a backup role on the team. His return adds depth to the Chargers' backfield, especially as veteran Najee Harris is expected to start training camp on the non-football injury list after a fireworks mishap.</p>

          <p>Coca-Cola has announced plans to introduce a version of its classic cola made with cane sugar for the U.S. market this fall. This move follows a social media post by President Trump claiming he had encouraged the company to make the switch from high-fructose corn syrup, which has been used in U.S. Coke since the 1980s. The new product is designed to expand consumer choice, complementing the existing portfolio that includes the popular imported "Mexican Coke," also made with cane sugar. The announcement came as the company reported its second-quarter earnings, highlighting its efforts to adapt to evolving consumer preferences.</p>

The move reflects a growing consumer trend towards healthier, low-sugar alternatives to traditional sodas, a market that has seen significant growth in recent years as people seek out functional food and drinks.</p>

          <p>A new student loan repayment option, the "Repayment Assistance Plan" (RAP), was created by recent legislation signed by President Trump and will be available by July 2026. This income-driven plan calculates payments based on a borrower's adjusted gross income, with payment percentages ranging from 1% to 10% as income rises. The plan features a $10 minimum monthly payment and offers loan forgiveness after 30 years. As other repayment plans are phased out, RAP may become one of the few affordable choices for new borrowers, who will only have this and a standard 10-year plan as options (not investment advice).</p>

Howard Phillips offered to provide personal information about former UK Defence Secretary Sir Grant Shapps to individuals he believed were Russian intelligence agents.

Phillips, who reportedly dreamed of being like James Bond, was arrested after offering his "100% loyalty and dedication" and attempting to secure a job with the UK Border Force as part of his plan to assist a foreign power.</p>

          <p>For the first time in eight years, the number of working Americans with a side hustle is shrinking, according to a new survey from Bankrate. The report found that 27% of Americans have a second income stream, a significant drop from 36% in the previous year and the lowest level since 2017. Analysts attribute this decline to a solid job market and wage growth that has outpaced inflation, reducing the economic anxiety that drove many to take on extra work. This shift suggests that more people are now using extra income for discretionary spending rather than covering basic living expenses.</p>

          <p>Dottie Dorion, a 91-year-old athlete and avid Peloton user, has successfully campaigned for the fitness company to add new age categories for its oldest riders. After discovering that the age brackets topped out at 60-plus, Dorion felt it was unfair to compete against much younger riders and launched a 14-month campaign, which involved legal assistance, to request a change. In response, Peloton has now created new 90-plus and 100-plus age categories for its leaderboards. Dorion, a veteran of approximately 250 marathons and triathlons, continues her active lifestyle with daily rides, yoga, and weight workouts.</p>
