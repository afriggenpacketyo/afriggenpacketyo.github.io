          <p>Severe drought conditions in Iraq have caused water levels in the Mosul Dam reservoir to drop significantly, leading to the discovery of approximately 40 ancient tombs. Archaeologists believe the tombs date back over 2,300 years to the Hellenistic period. While the ongoing drought has had devastating effects on Iraq's agriculture and water supply, it has inadvertently created a rare opportunity for researchers to access and excavate historical sites that are typically submerged.</p>

While Palace is open to selling Guehi, who has indicated he will not sign a new contract, Liverpool is unwilling to part with Gomez on a temporary basis. The negotiations highlight the complexities of player transfers as the window closure approaches, with Palace actively seeking defensive reinforcements.</p>

          <p>Intel will no longer be required to meet certain performance milestones or share a portion of its cash flow under the CHIPS Act after the U.S. government opted to take a 10% equity stake in the company. This new arrangement converts a planned $5.7 billion grant and adds funds from another program to create an $8.9 billion direct investment in Intel's common stock. The revised deal removes many of the original restrictions, though it still prohibits the use of government funds for stock buybacks and dividends. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>Photographer Zed Nelson's new book, 'The Anthropocene Illusion,' critically examines humanity's increasingly detached relationship with the natural world. Nelson's work captures the contrived and hyper-managed versions of nature people now experience, from staged safari scenes to zoo enclosures with painted backdrops. The project argues that as we destroy genuine ecosystems, we create artificial substitutes that provide a false sense of reassurance, ultimately becoming monuments to what has been lost.</p>

          <p>The tradition of a single wedding dress is expanding as modern brides purchase multiple outfits for a series of wedding-related events, from engagement parties to farewell brunches. Experts say this trend is fueled by social media's emphasis on photogenic moments and the transformation of weddings into multi-day celebrations. Retailers like David's Bridal have responded to the demand by creating entire collections of "little white dresses" and accessories for every occasion, with some brides spending thousands on their bridal wardrobes.</p>
