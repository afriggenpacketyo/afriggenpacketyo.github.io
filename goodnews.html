          <p>Chile and Google have signed an agreement to install the first-ever submarine fiber optic cable connecting South America, Asia, and Oceania by 2027. The "Humboldt Project" involves building a 14,800-kilometer cable from Valparaiso, Chile, to Sydney, Australia, via French Polynesia, and aims to improve connectivity and provide a faster alternative to existing routes. Google is investing between $300 million and $550 million in the project, with the Chilean government contributing $25 million. The new cable is expected to benefit other South American countries and reduce signal latency, which will significantly impact telemedicine.</p>

          <p>Italians will vote in a referendum proposing to halve the legal residency requirement for non-EU adult foreigners to apply for citizenship, from 10 to five years. The referendum, put to the people after a grassroots organization gathered half a million signatures, is a rare chance to make the country's bureaucracy more benevolent amid tightening citizenship rules. Prime Minister Meloni and other high-profile ministers are encouraging citizens to skip the vote, hoping for low turnout and failure to reach quorum. The referendum's outcome has cultural implications, potentially recognizing the dignity and diversity of millions of residents and enriching the national story.</p>

          <p>The Washington Department of Natural Resources used a firefighting helicopter to remove abandoned boats from Squaxin Island, an uninhabited island in Puget Sound. The operation, funded by a federal grant, removed 14 vessels that had drifted with the currents and landed in hard-to-reach coves. The state agency opts to airlift boats to avoid disrupting the marine bed and surrounding environment, and since the boat removal program began in 2002, over 1,200 derelict vessels have been removed. The Squaxin Island Tribe supports the clean-up to maintain clean beaches and water for future generations.</p>

          <p>A Chinese study of dinosaur feathers found in Burmese amber has provided new insights into the evolution of flight feathers, an essential step that allowed early birds to surpass dinosaurs in conquering the skies. Researchers conducted a detailed structural study of feathers dating back 99 million years to the Cretaceous period, revealing how feathers evolved during this era. The development of feathers that generated thrust and lift was a critical feature of bird evolution. Scientists believe that most feathered dinosaurs in the ancient world did not have the same ability to fly.</p>

          <p>UK scientists have discovered that the first bacteria our bodies encounter after birth can protect us from dangerous infections. The study shows that good bacteria can halve the risk of young children being admitted to hospital with lung infections. Researchers at University College London and the Sanger Institute collected stool samples from newborns and tracked their health for two years. The presence of Bifidobacterium longum, in particular, seemed to have a protective effect, reducing the likelihood of hospital stays due to lung infections.</p>

          <p>Health and Human Services Secretary Robert F. Kennedy Jr. has requested that the FDA review the latest data on mifepristone, raising questions about the drug commonly referred to as the abortion pill. Experts say concerns about the drug's safety are misguided, fueled in part by a report from an advocacy group that promotes religious traditions. Mifepristone was first approved by the FDA in 2000 after a thorough review determined it was safe and effective. Since its approval, mifepristone has been taken by more than 5 million patients, and medication abortions made up more than half of all abortions in the United States health care system in 2023.</p>
