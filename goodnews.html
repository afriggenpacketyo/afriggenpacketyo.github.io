          <p>Byron Allen is putting his broadcast TV stations up for sale, having retained investment bank Moelis & Co. to sell his group of 28 owned and operated broadcast TV stations.

A sale of the stations would significantly reduce Allen Media Group's debt load. Allen has also expressed interest in buying various media assets, including a bid for Paramount Global in 2024.</p>

The program has raised over $100 million, primarily from private donors, and has distributed roughly $10 million to more than 2,200 families.

          <p>Paris Saint-Germain‚Äôs Champions League final win was a victory for youth, adventure, and coherent team-building, but also for sportswashing. The club's ownership by Qatari Sports Investments, supported by the state, gives them an advantage over traditionally financed clubs. While PSG's on-pitch success is admirable, it's difficult to ignore Qatar's human rights record, including the exploitation of workers and restrictions on freedom of expression. Inter have lost in two of the last three Champions League finals, both defeats have been to state-owned clubs.</p>

          <p>Tesla's sale of new cars in Norway skyrocketed 213% in May, bucking a downward trend across Europe. The increase was primarily driven by sales of the firm's revamped Model Y compact sport utility vehicle. Industry groups reported significantly lower May sales for new Tesla vehicles in Spain, Portugal, Denmark and Sweden. Norway's EV incentives and the popularity of the Model Y, which meets Norwegians' needs for space and all-wheel drive, contributed to the surge.</p>
