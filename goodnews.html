          <h2>California Regulators Clarify Tesla's Ride-Hailing Service Must Include Human Drivers</h2>
          <div class="timestamp">2025-07-25 21:18:01 EDT</div>
        </div>
        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Despite Tesla's plans to expand its robotaxi service, California regulators have clarified that the company is not authorized to operate autonomous passenger vehicles on public roads. According to the California Public Utilities Commission, Tesla's current permit only allows for a private car service with human drivers, similar to a traditional limousine or taxi company. The company can test autonomous vehicles with a safety driver present but cannot charge fees for such rides. This regulatory stance complicates Tesla's ambitions for a fully autonomous ride-hailing network in the state.</p>

          <p>A Leicester-based salon owner is preparing for a key hearing in her long-running trademark dispute with the global cosmetics giant L'Oréal. The conflict began when Rebecca Dowdeswell attempted to re-register the trademark for her salon, "nkd," a name she has used for 15 years. L'Oréal objected, claiming it would cause consumer confusion with its "Naked" line of products under the Urban Decay brand. Despite having spent over £30,000 in legal fees, Dowdeswell remains determined to fight the opposition, stating there has been no evidence of confusion during her years of operation.</p>

          <h2>Warm, Sunny Weather in the UK Leads to a Proliferation of Certain Insects</h2>
          <div class="timestamp">2025-07-25 20:53:22 EDT</div>
        </div>
        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>The United Kingdom is experiencing a significant boom in insects like ladybirds, butterflies, and wasps, following its warmest and sunniest spring on record. The abundance of aphids, a primary food source for ladybirds, has contributed to this surge, while the warm, dry conditions have been ideal for butterflies. However, experts express concern that the lack of rain could negatively impact insect and amphibian populations next year by drying up wetland breeding grounds. This year's bumper season for some species contrasts with the longer-term trend of declining flying insect populations in the UK.</p>

          <p>An Illinois federal judge has dismissed a lawsuit filed by the Trump administration that challenged Chicago's sanctuary city laws. The suit, filed in February, argued that the city's policies unlawfully hindered federal immigration enforcement by limiting cooperation between local police and federal agents. In her ruling, Judge Lindsay Jenkins sided with the city, affirming its right to establish such policies. Chicago's mayor, Brandon Johnson, praised the decision, stating that the city is safer when its police force can focus on local needs rather than being compelled to participate in a "reckless and inhumane immigration agenda."</p>

          <p>A new exhibit at the New York Historical Society examines the Hollywood blacklist, a dark period in the 1940s and 50s when entertainment professionals were denied employment for alleged Communist ties. The exhibit focuses on the "Hollywood Ten," a group of writers and directors who were imprisoned for refusing to testify before the House Un-American Activities Committee. It showcases personal artifacts, such as letters from screenwriter Dalton Trumbo to his daughter, and testimony from figures like Walt Disney. The display explores the devastating impact on careers and raises enduring questions about free speech, political persecution, and democratic freedoms.</p>

          <p>An article explores Donald Trump's multifaceted relationship with golf, portraying it as more than just a pastime but a core part of his business and political identity. The sport serves as a venue for high-stakes networking with politicians and world leaders, a competitive outlet, and a significant brand extension through his ownership of numerous courses. Unlike other presidents who used golf for diversion, Trump's engagement is transactional and intensely competitive, reflecting his broader approach to business and diplomacy. The piece highlights how a tee time with Trump has become a coveted opportunity for those seeking influence and access.</p>

          <p>Wildlife biologists in Texas are undertaking a critical mission to save the state's bighorn sheep, whose population has been reduced by half in the last five years due to disease. The disease was spread from non-native animals brought into the region. In a rescue effort, biologists captured and airlifted dozens of sheep from the last remaining disease-free herd. After veterinary checks, the animals were relocated over 200 miles to an isolated, disease-free mountain range. Recent observations have confirmed the success of the mission, with sightings of healthy sheep and newborn lambs, signaling new hope for the native species.</p>

          <p>A recent article examines the science and practicality behind common daily health benchmarks, such as drinking eight glasses of water, getting eight hours of sleep, and walking 10,000 steps. Experts offer varied perspectives, suggesting that while these targets provide useful guidance, strict adherence may not be necessary for everyone. For instance, one kidney specialist argues that thirst is a reliable guide for hydration, while a sleep expert emphasizes that seven to nine hours of quality sleep is critical for long-term health. The overall consensus suggests that a balanced, consistent approach to health is more beneficial than stressing over hitting exact numerical goals every day.</p>

The musician, famous for his hit "Desvelado," is targeting the seat currently held by Republican Rep. Monica De La Cruz.

          <p>A scientific revolution is taking place in women's sports, with researchers focusing on uniquely female physiological factors that were historically overlooked. This new wave of research explores topics like breast biomechanics, showing how proper sports bra support can improve performance by enhancing stride length. Scientists are also investigating the nuanced impact of the menstrual cycle on athletic ability and the reasons behind the higher incidence of certain injuries, like ACL tears, in female athletes. This shift marks a departure from the old approach of treating female athletes as "mini-men," leading to better support, injury prevention, and performance optimization.</p>

          <p>In a modern twist on civic duty, the U.S. Treasury Department is now allowing Americans to make contributions to pay down the national debt via the mobile payment app Venmo. The long-standing "Gifts to Reduce the Public Debt" program has been updated to include the popular, youth-friendly platform alongside more traditional methods like PayPal and credit cards. With the national debt currently exceeding $36 trillion, the initiative offers a direct, albeit small-scale, way for citizens to contribute. Since 1996, Americans have voluntarily donated over $67 million, a figure that highlights patriotic generosity but barely makes a dent in the nation's massive financial obligations.</p>

          <p>Contrary to common criticism, some sociologists and psychologists argue that reality television has had a positive impact on society over the past 25 years. The genre has often featured more demographic diversity than other media, exposing viewers to different lifestyles and perspectives, which can foster greater social understanding. Shows have sparked national conversations on complex topics like coercive control, racism, and disability awareness, as seen with Pete Bennett's appearance on Big Brother. While the welfare of contestants remains a serious concern, the article suggests that by reflecting and sometimes shaping social norms, reality TV can serve as a valuable tool for public discourse.</p>

          <p>The White House has announced it will release $5.5 billion in education funding to states, reversing an earlier decision to freeze the congressionally approved money. The administration had abruptly withheld the funds, which support programs for educator training, arts education, and English language learners, claiming some were being misused for a "radical left-wing agenda." The move triggered widespread outrage from educators and bipartisan pushback from lawmakers, including 10 Republican senators who urged the administration to release the critical funding. Following the reversal, advocates and politicians praised the decision to restore the funds for the upcoming school year.</p>
