          <p>Iga Swiatek has won her first Wimbledon women's singles championship, defeating American Amanda Anisimova in a decisive final that concluded in under an hour. The Polish player, already a five-time Grand Slam winner, demonstrated her prowess by winning both sets 6-0, marking a significant achievement on grass courts where she had not previously reached the final. Anisimova was competing in her first-ever Grand Slam final after taking a break from the sport in 2023 for mental health reasons. The victory marks the eighth consecutive year a new champion has been crowned in the women's singles at Wimbledon.</p>

          <p>Adolfo Macias, the infamous Ecuadorian drug lord known as 'Fito,' has consented to be extradited to the United States to face charges of cocaine and weapons smuggling. Macias, leader of the 'Los Choneros' gang, was recaptured in June after a dramatic prison escape last year that triggered a wave of extreme violence across Ecuador. His agreement in a Quito court marks a significant step in President Daniel Noboa's campaign against organized crime. Fito's extradition would be the first of its kind since Ecuador approved the measure, signaling a major development in U.S.-Ecuador cooperation against transnational criminal organizations.</p>

          <p>After years of debate, new online safety regulations are coming into force in the UK, legally obligating tech platforms to prevent children from viewing harmful content like pornography and material promoting self-harm. The rules, enforced by the regulator Ofcom, will require platforms to implement age verification measures, with significant fines for non-compliance. However, critics and even government sources acknowledge the rules may already be outdated, as they do not fully address risks from AI chatbots, private messaging, or misinformation. The legislation represents a major step in internet regulation, though the debate over its effectiveness and scope is expected to continue.</p>
