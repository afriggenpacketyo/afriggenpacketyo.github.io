The UAE has maintained a neutral stance on the Ukraine war and has not participated in Western sanctions, becoming an important economic partner for Russia. This deepening relationship demonstrates the UAE's independent foreign policy, balancing ties between the U.S., Russia, and China.</p>

The company raised $868 million by pricing its shares at $45, well above the initially expected range, signaling strong investor confidence in the space technology sector. Firefly has secured major contracts with NASA and defense contractors like Northrop Grumman, and it successfully landed its Blue Ghost vehicle on the moon earlier this year.

          <p>Eli Lilly announced that its experimental daily obesity pill, orforglipron, helped patients achieve nearly 12% weight loss in a 72-week, late-stage trial. While the results pave the way for a new needle-free option in the lucrative weight-loss market, the company's shares fell as the efficacy was slightly below some Wall Street expectations. Doctors noted the convenience could expand treatment access, though some expressed concern over the rate of patients discontinuing the trial due to side effects like nausea. Lilly plans to submit the drug for regulatory approval by the end of the year.</p>

          <p>The probability of Federal Reserve Governor Christopher Waller becoming the next Fed chair has surpassed 50% on the prediction market Kalshi. His odds surged after reports that President Trump's advisors favor his forward-looking approach to monetary policy. Waller, who recently dissented on a decision to hold rates steady, is now seen as a more likely candidate than previous front-runners Kevin Warsh and Kevin Hassett. Investors appear to favor Waller for his perceived dovish stance and political independence, viewing him as a potential shift from current chair Jerome Powell's policies. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>In The Hundred cricket competition, the Northern Superchargers secured a decisive 47-run victory over last year's finalists, Welsh Fire. After setting a target of 141-4, the Superchargers' bowlers dismantled the Fire's batting lineup, dismissing them for just 94 runs, their lowest total in the competition's history. Australian all-rounder Georgia Wareham was the standout performer, contributing with both bat and ball, including an unbeaten 29 runs and taking two key wickets. The commanding win provides the Superchargers with a valuable net run-rate boost, placing them at the top of the league table.</p>

          <p>President Donald Trump is set to sign an executive order directing the Department of Labor to review rules governing retirement plans, aiming to allow alternative assets such as cryptocurrency, private equity, and real estate in 401(k)s. This move represents a significant development for the alternative asset industry, which has been advocating for access to the trillions held in defined contribution plans. While this could broaden investment options for millions of Americans, it also introduces new risks associated with the volatility and complexity of these assets. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>Following a White House executive order to broaden the availability of crypto in retirement plans, investors are re-evaluating how to access the asset class. Cryptocurrency ETFs, such as those tracking Bitcoin and Ethereum, have seen record inflows this year, offering a convenient way to gain exposure without directly holding the assets. While some advisors advocate for significant allocations to digital assets, the market also includes high-risk leveraged products not suitable for long-term investing. The new regulatory environment is encouraging innovation, but investors must carefully distinguish between standard and speculative crypto funds. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>Apple has announced a new $100 billion investment in U.S. manufacturing, a move seen as strengthening its relationship with the Trump administration and mitigating tariff risks. The announcement, made by CEO Tim Cook at the White House, temporarily shifted investor focus away from the company's perceived lag in developing a clear artificial intelligence strategy. The investment includes $2.5 billion to expand operations for Corning, which produces glass for iPhones and Apple Watches in the U.S. While the move boosted Apple's stock, the company still faces pressure to deliver on its AI promises and navigate ongoing legal challenges.

          <p>Shares of the language-learning platform Duolingo soared more than 30% after the company significantly raised its full-year revenue and bookings guidance. The optimistic forecast is attributed to strong user growth, with daily active users jumping 40% to nearly 48 million, powered by the implementation of new AI tools. The company has expanded its offerings beyond language to include subjects like chess and recently acquired a music gaming startup. Duolingo's second-quarter earnings and revenue also surpassed Wall Street estimates, signaling continued momentum for the mobile learning platform.</p>

The soldiers acted quickly to tackle an armed assailant who had shot five of their colleagues, and then provided critical first aid to the wounded. Army Secretary Dan Driscoll praised their actions, stating they "absolutely saved lives" by subduing the gunman, who was a fellow soldier. Three of the five injured soldiers have since been released from the hospital, while the alleged shooter remains in custody as an investigation into the motive continues.</p>

          <div class="timestamp">2025-08-07 12:00:00 EDT</div>
        </div>
        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>This essay explores the decline of politeness in modern society, particularly in online interactions, and argues that this trend negatively impacts personal well-being. The author defines politeness as a key component of the 'agreeableness' personality trait and cites research showing that being courteous to others, even non-human AI, can increase happiness and reduce anger. To counteract the coarsening effects of technology, the author suggests making courtesy a conscious habit, renouncing sarcasm, and responding to rudeness with dignity. The piece concludes by framing politeness as a form of personal empowerment in a culture of incivility.</p>

          <p>A startup named Neurable is pioneering consumer technology that uses a brain-computer interface (BCI) integrated into headphones to monitor focus and brain health. The device uses EEG sensors to pick up electrical signals from the brain, which algorithms then interpret to measure attention levels and provide real-time feedback. While the technology does not read thoughts, it can detect distraction and is being developed to track cognitive health indicators for conditions like depression or Alzheimer's. This non-invasive approach represents a new frontier in health tracking, moving beyond measuring symptoms to monitoring the brain directly.</p>

          <p>The Bank of England has lowered its key interest rate to 4% from 4.25%, the fifth reduction since last August and the lowest level in more than two years. The decision was narrowly passed by policymakers, signaling that future cuts will be carefully considered amid ongoing concerns about rising inflation, which is now forecast to peak at 4%. While the cut will provide relief to some mortgage holders, it may reduce returns for savers. The move comes as the UK economy shows signs of slowing growth and a softening jobs market.

          <p>The U.S. Department of Education has released the 2026-27 Free Application for Federal Student Aid (FAFSA) for beta testing ahead of its typical schedule. A limited group of students can already access the form, with broader participation in the testing phase available by request starting September 1, before the official October launch. Financial aid experts believe this earlier, longer testing window will allow the department to identify and fix bugs that have caused significant problems in previous application cycles. Timely FAFSA submission is crucial for students seeking federal grants, loans, and work-study funds for college.</p>
