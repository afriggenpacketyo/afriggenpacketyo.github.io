        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Following a routine victory against Andorra, this article reflects on the predictable and often dull nature of England's World Cup qualifying campaigns. Despite an impressive record of only four losses in 30 years during qualifiers, these matches rarely generate significant excitement for fans or players. The analysis suggests that the prevalence of defensive tactics from smaller nations and a more possession-based style of play contribute to the lack of jeopardy, making the qualifiers feel like a formality before the real challenges of major tournaments.</p>

          <p>A program at Johns Hopkins University's School of Nursing is providing free doula services to pregnant individuals in the Baltimore area, aiming to create a more supportive birth experience. Nursing students are trained as "Birth Companions" to offer emotional, informational, and physical support during labor, acting as advocates for patients without replacing medical staff. This initiative, now in its 27th year, aligns with a recent Maryland law requiring hospitals to accommodate certified doulas, thereby increasing access to these valuable support services for families.</p>

Andrew Feltwell caught the ball and gave it to his son, Lincoln, as a birthday gift, only to be yelled at by a woman who claimed he took it from her. Although Feltwell eventually gave her the ball to de-escalate the situation, both the Phillies and the visiting Miami Marlins provided Lincoln with memorabilia, including a signed bat from the player who hit the home run.</p>

          <h2>Experts Offer Advice on Securing Lower Mortgage Rates as 30-Year Fixed Average Declines</h2>

        </div>
        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>As the average rate for a 30-year fixed mortgage approaches a one-year low, financial experts suggest several strategies for homebuyers to secure even better terms. Key recommendations include improving one's credit score, as higher scores qualify for lower rates, and increasing the down payment to at least 20% to reduce lender risk and avoid private mortgage insurance. Additionally, prospective buyers are encouraged to consider alternatives to a 30-year fixed loan, such as adjustable-rate mortgages (ARMs), which can offer a significantly lower initial interest rate.

          <p>A new artwork by the street artist Banksy has emerged on an external wall of the Royal Courts of Justice in London. The piece depicts a judge in a wig and robe striking a protester on the ground, whose placard is splattered with blood. The mural, which Banksy confirmed on Instagram, appeared shortly after a major protest against the ban on Palestine Action led to nearly 900 arrests. Court officials have covered the artwork and stated it will be removed, as the building is a listed structure.</p>
