          <p>Donald Trump announced that "the war is over" as he journeyed to Israel for the release of hostages from Gaza, facilitated by a ceasefire agreement between Israel and Hamas. Trump praised Benjamin Netanyahu and Qatar for their roles in brokering the deal, which involves Hamas releasing hostages and Israel releasing Palestinian prisoners and detainees. The agreement also entails increased aid entering Gaza, with Trump planning to lead a summit in Egypt to finalize a document ending the conflict. The war, triggered by Hamas-led attacks in October 2023, has resulted in significant casualties on both sides, and while the ceasefire is in effect, challenges remain in reaching agreements on long-term governance and security. Optimism score is based on the author's reflection assuming the relative aforementioned seriousness.</p>

          <p>UK Prime Minister Keir Starmer arrived in Egypt for an international peace summit where the Gaza peace plan is expected to be signed, praising Donald Trump's role in brokering the ceasefire. The summit, co-led by Trump and Egyptian President Abdel Fattah al-Sisi, involves leaders from over 20 countries, and will address the next phases of the truce. Shadow foreign secretary Dame Priti Patel criticized Starmer's visit as a "photo opportunity," questioning the UK's involvement in the Gaza ceasefire. The summit aims to end the war in Gaza, strengthen peace efforts in the Middle East, and foster regional security and stability, with Starmer calling for continued coordination to secure a lasting peace.

          <p>India is adopting a strategy of hedging its bets on a new China charm offensive amidst ongoing global tensions. Prime Minister Narendra Modi met with Chinese President Xi Jinping, agreeing that the two countries should be partners rather than rivals. Modi emphasized the need for strategic autonomy and a fair resolution to their border dispute, subtly critiquing the US's tough stance on India. This move indicates India's attempt to forge a coalition of eastern powers against the West, balancing its relationship with China while maintaining strategic independence.</p>
