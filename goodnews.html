        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Japan, known for its pacifist constitution, is considering expanding its arms exports to strengthen ties with allies and bolster its defense industry. Defense Minister Gen Nakatani aims to promote defense exports, while Prime Minister Shigeru Ishiba attended a defense exhibition, signaling a shift in policy. This move is driven by security concerns and a desire to improve interoperability with allies through standardized maintenance and joint training. Japan also seeks to develop its defense industrial base, which has suffered due to reliance on U.S. weapons purchases, and to achieve economies of scale through exports.

          <p>The Senate Finance Committee's version of President Trump's funding bill faces potential opposition from both sides of the aisle, creating a challenge for Senate Majority Leader John Thune. Key senators have voiced concerns over Medicaid changes, the state and local tax (SALT) deduction cap, and the increase to the federal debt limit. House Speaker Mike Johnson has cautioned against significant alterations to the bill, fearing it could jeopardize its passage in the House. Despite these challenges, some Republicans remain optimistic about the bill's prospects, emphasizing Thune's track record of success, but the contrasting views and potential sticking points highlight the difficult path ahead.
