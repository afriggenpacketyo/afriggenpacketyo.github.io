          <p>The Berlin Zoo is preparing its popular young pygmy hippopotamus, Toni, for a move to the Mulhouse Zoo in France as part of the European Endangered Species Program. Since her birth, Toni has become a viral sensation, significantly boosting the zoo's social media presence and helping to raise awareness for her endangered species. The zoo is hosting a week of farewell events for fans before she departs, a move intended to support conservation breeding efforts for pygmy hippos, which number less than 2,500 in the wild.</p>

          <p>Top leaders from several Southeast Asian nations, including Indonesia, Malaysia, and Vietnam, are anticipated to attend a major military parade in Beijing next month. The event commemorates the 80th anniversary of the end of World War II and is seen as a demonstration of China's expanding influence in the region. According to sources, the presence of high-level delegations from these countries, as well as Cambodia, Laos, and Myanmar, would represent a significant diplomatic show of support for Beijing, with many nations sending more senior officials than to a similar event a decade ago.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>In a back-to-school themed episode, NPR's "Short Wave" podcast explores the complex scientific criteria used to define life. Developmental biologist Crystal Rogers joins the hosts to discuss the standard biological checklist for what constitutes a living organism, examining clear cases like kittens versus non-living objects like salt. The conversation also tackles more ambiguous examples, such as viruses, and extends into a philosophical debate inspired by Star Trek about whether advanced androids could one day be considered alive, challenging conventional biological definitions.</p>

          <p>A federal judge in Maryland has struck down guidance from the Trump administration that threatened to cut federal funding to schools and universities with diversity, equity, and inclusion (DEI) programs. The ruling found that the Department of Education's memos, which aimed to end all "race-based decision-making," violated procedural law by creating a significant policy shift without proper process. Judge Stephanie Gallagher, a Trump appointee, stated the guidance caused educators to fear punishment for lawful speech, representing a victory for educational and civil rights groups who challenged the policy.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>After winning the Premier League title in his first season, Liverpool manager Arne Slot now faces heightened expectations following a summer spending spree that could exceed £300 million. The club has made several high-profile signings, including Florian Wirtz and Hugo Ekitike, transforming the team from title defenders into firm favorites for multiple trophies. This significant investment shifts the landscape for Slot, as anything less than a major title and a strong Champions League challenge will likely be viewed as a failure. The pressure is on for the new acquisitions to integrate quickly and maintain the club's winning momentum.</p>

The operation involves female police officers jogging in plain clothes in specific areas, with uniformed colleagues nearby to intervene and educate perpetrators.

          <p>A children's playground in Wooler, Northumberland, has reopened after the removal of 177 World War II-era practice bombs that were buried just beneath the surface. The devices were discovered by a contractor in January while installing new play equipment, leading to a large-scale ordnance disposal operation. The bombs, which were not live but contained a charge, were found carefully stacked in rows. It is believed they were buried on the site of a former military ordnance depot after the war, remaining undetected for decades as generations of children played above them.</p>

          <p>The American Heart Association has issued new guidelines for managing hypertension, recommending that Americans limit both alcohol and sodium consumption. The updated advice suggests men consume no more than two alcoholic drinks per day and women no more than one, while also reinforcing the need to reduce daily sodium intake. A significant change is the recommendation for doctors to advise lifestyle modifications for individuals with stage 1 hypertension, an earlier intervention than previously prescribed. This proactive approach aims to better combat heart disease, which remains the leading cause of death in the U.S.</p>

          <p>Japan's economy expanded by 0.3% in the second quarter of 2025, exceeding forecasts despite facing tariff pressures from the United States. The growth was primarily driven by resilient exports, which contributed significantly to the GDP after contracting in the previous quarter. On an annualized basis, the economy grew by 1%, more than double what economists had predicted. However, analysts caution that a slowdown may be on the horizon, as corporate investment is expected to soften and the full impact of U.S. tariffs could dampen future growth.
