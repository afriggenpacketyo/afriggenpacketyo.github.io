          <p>Karla Flores, experiencing double vision, was diagnosed with a rare chordoma on her brain stem. During pre-surgery MRI, a second chordoma was discovered on her spine, which could have caused paralysis if undetected. Dr. Mohammed Labib at the University of Maryland Medical Center devised a plan to remove the brain stem tumor through traditional neurosurgery and the nose. For the spinal tumor, Dr. Labib pioneered a "third nostril" approach, operating through the side of Flores' eye to avoid spine incisions. After a 20-hour surgery, the tumor was removed, her eye socket rebuilt, and after radiation treatment, Flores is now cancer-free, though facing substantial medical bills.</p>

The original bars, filled with pistachio cream, kadayif, and tahini, are only available in Dubai, but the lack of international trademark protection has allowed other companies to create dupes.

          <p>The early 'Mission: Impossible' films, unlike many modern franchises, were defined by their lack of definition and strong authorial styles of their directors. The first four movies, directed by Brian De Palma, John Woo, J.J. Abrams, and Brad Bird respectively, were stand-alone stories that allowed each filmmaker to demonstrate their creative strengths. These films prioritized individual vision over building consistent lore or trying to top previous installments. The recent films in the franchise, however, have taken a different approach, emphasizing continuity and intersecting story threads, which sacrifices the unpredictable nature that made the earlier films so compelling.</p>

          <p>Consumers are taking a more frugal approach to summer vacations due to economic concerns, according to a Deloitte report. While more people plan to travel compared to last year, summer travel budgets have decreased following President Donald Trump's announcement of widescale tariffs and stock market volatility. The average summer travel budget is now expected to grow by 13% year-over-year, down from an initial projection of 21%. Travelers are cutting back on in-destination spending, staying with family and friends, and choosing to drive instead of fly to save money.</p>
