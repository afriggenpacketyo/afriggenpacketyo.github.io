        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>A private survey from Caixin/S&P Global revealed that China's factory activity unexpectedly grew in June, contrasting with official government data that showed a contraction. The Caixin Purchasing Managers' Index (PMI) rose to 50.4, driven by increased production and new orders, particularly among smaller, export-oriented firms. However, the report also highlighted challenges, including a decline in new export orders, weak employment, and an intense price war that is squeezing profit margins. This divergence from official PMI is attributed to differences in survey timing and company coverage. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>At a technology conference in Bangkok, experts emphasized the need for emerging economies to develop "sovereign AI" to ensure strategic autonomy and cater to local languages and cultures. Panelists argued that current AI models are predominantly English-based, and nations, particularly in regions like ASEAN, should build their own systems. They highlighted open-source AI models and accessible cloud computing services as key tools to democratize AI development and prevent a few large companies from dominating the technology. This approach allows countries to create a collective energy that fosters local innovation and competition.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>California Governor Gavin Newsom has successfully pushed through significant housing legislation by tying it to the state budget, a move that compelled reluctant lawmakers to approve the measures. The new laws, AB 130 and SB 131, aim to accelerate housing construction by exempting many urban projects from the lengthy review process mandated by the California Environmental Quality Act (CEQA). While proponents hail this as a transformative step to address the state's housing crisis, the strategy drew criticism for sidelining the typical legislative process and the concerns of some labor and environmental groups.</p>

          <p>The commander of U.S. Northern Command has proposed reassigning some of the California National Guard troops currently deployed in Los Angeles to help prepare for the state's wildfire season. The deployment of roughly 4,000 Guard members was initiated by President Trump to address protests, a move contested by California's governor. State officials had previously warned that the deployment could hinder wildfire response capabilities, and this proposal suggests shifting 200 members to be on standby for firefighting efforts. The move comes amid an ongoing legal battle between the state and the federal government over control of the Guard.</p>

          <p>Beachgoers and weather experts along the coast of northern and central Portugal were treated to a rare and spectacular meteorological sight: a "roll cloud." This unusual phenomenon, a long, tube-shaped arcus cloud, appeared in the sky on Sunday amidst a regional heatwave. Many people captured images and videos of the stunning formation as it moved across the horizon. Roll clouds are relatively uncommon and form in specific atmospheric conditions, often associated with weather fronts, making this sighting a notable event for those who witnessed it.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>A team of Chinese scientists has discovered that a naturally occurring compound called betaine, produced in the kidneys during long-term exercise, plays a key role in slowing the aging process. The research, published in the journal Cell, found that betaine prevents inflammation and the aging of multiple organs by inhibiting a specific enzyme. This finding helps explain the molecular mechanism behind the anti-aging benefits of physical activity. The discovery could also lead to new anti-aging strategies that simulate the effects of exercise, offering insights into promoting longevity and health.</p>

However, some observers question the long-term sustainability of this trend, suggesting that many cafes rely on a fleeting sense of novelty rather than building a loyal customer base. Despite this, China's coffee industry is now valued at over $40 billion, with consumption expected to continue its rapid growth.</p>

The review aims to modernize policies that campaigners say have been neglected for years. Currently, the UK's system has been criticized for its low statutory pay, which leads many fathers to forgo leave, and the low uptake of shared parental leave. Business Secretary Jonathan Reynolds stated the time is right for a serious re-evaluation, a move welcomed by family advocacy groups as a generational opportunity for improvement.</p>

          <p>According to CNBC's Jim Cramer, a new wave of younger investors is significantly influencing the stock market by favoring companies with bold, innovative ideas over established giants. He argues these investors are rewarding companies like Robinhood and Reddit for their disruptive potential, while punishing more traditional firms that focus on stock buybacks. This has created what he calls an "idea market" or a "story-dominated market," where the narrative and growth potential of individual stocks are valued more highly than broad market indices or Federal Reserve policy. This shift in focus is credited with driving rallies in a host of newer, growth-oriented stocks. (not investment advice)</p>
