          <p>Newspaper front pages are dominated by Sir Keir Starmer's reversal on winter fuel payments, described as a "U-turn" after pressure from Labour MPs. Several papers also highlight Donald Trump's confrontational meeting with South African President Cyril Ramaphosa, during which Trump presented a video purportedly showing violence against white farmers. Other headlines include Tottenham's Europa League victory and Deputy Prime Minister Angela Rayner's proposal to restrict state pension access for recent immigrants. The Sun leads with a report that the justice secretary is considering a nationwide scheme to chemically castrate paedophiles and rapists.</p>

          <p>Prime Minister Mark Carney has confirmed that Canada is in talks with the United States regarding participation in President Donald Trump's proposed "Golden Dome" missile defense program. The system is a multilayered, $175 billion initiative designed to detect, track, and intercept incoming missiles, including hypersonic and cruise missiles. Carney emphasized the growing missile threats, including those potentially originating from space, and stated that Canada takes these threats seriously. While discussions are underway, the extent of Canada's potential financial contribution remains unclear.</p>

          <p>House Republicans are proposing to give $1,000 to every American baby born over the next four years, initially calling the accounts "MAGA accounts" before changing the name to "Trump accounts." Under the bill, children born between January 1, 2025, and January 1, 2029, would receive the money, which would be invested on their behalf. The funds could be withdrawn later for expenses like college or buying a house. However, tax experts have noted that the accounts would function similarly to typical investment accounts, with post-tax contributions and taxed gains upon withdrawal.</p>

The Trump administration had sought to dismantle Radio Free Europe/Radio Liberty, with senior presidential advisor Kari Lake claiming they served up anti-American fare.

          <p>Chinese electric-vehicle maker Xpeng saw its shares in Hong Kong surge over 10% following upbeat earnings and a stronger-than-expected revenue forecast for the second quarter. The company's first-quarter revenue more than doubled, driven by robust sales, narrowing its net loss and lifting its gross margin. Xpeng expects to begin mass production of vehicles equipped with Level 3 autonomous driving features in China by year-end.

          <p>The Japanese government has initiated a revamped gasoline subsidy aimed at reducing prices by 10 yen per liter to ease the cost of living for consumers ahead of an upcoming parliamentary election. Unlike the previous scheme, the new subsidy provides a fixed sum regardless of prices, targeting a 10 yen reduction by mid-June. The program has been allocated around 1 trillion yen and could last until the end of March 2026. The reintroduction of the subsidies comes before the House of Councillors election slated for the summer.</p>
