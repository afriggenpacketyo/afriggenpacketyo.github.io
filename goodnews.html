          <p>Stellantis has unveiled a redesigned 2026 Jeep Cherokee, featuring its first North American hybrid system with a 1.6-liter turbo-four powertrain, aiming to reverse six consecutive years of sales declines for the brand. The new model, which is longer, taller, and wider, boasts 30% more cargo capacity and a technology-filled interior, with an entry-level price starting at $36,995. This strategic move is intended to reinvigorate Jeep's presence in the largest U.S. SUV segment, despite facing economic headwinds such as President Trump's tariffs. Production will occur at Stellantis' Mexico plant, with vehicles arriving at dealerships by early next year, as the company seeks a positive sales trajectory.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Google has rolled out its new "Preferred Sources" product, enabling users to prioritize specific news publishers, such as Vox, in their search results to see more of their content. This feature ensures that stories from chosen sources are more likely to appear in the "Top Stories" section and a dedicated "From Your Sources" feed. The initiative is presented as a crucial step for readers to access quality, trusted information in an era where artificial intelligence plays an increasingly significant role in content curation. By allowing users to actively select their preferred news providers, Google aims to empower individuals to make sense of complex news topics and find reliable explainers more easily, requiring just two clicks to implement this preference.</p>

This commanding win allowed the Aces to climb into third place in the overall WNBA standings, with only seven games left in the regular season. Wilson, the reigning league MVP, achieved her 18th double-double of the season, her seventh during this remarkable winning run. The Mercury, who lost the season series 3-1 to Las Vegas, also saw their guard Kahleah Copper depart the game in the third quarter due to a left side injury.</p>

He highlights his impressive head-to-head record against top players like Carlos Alcaraz and Jannik Sinner as evidence of his potential, emphasizing that his level rises in such high-stakes matches. Rune, who is working with coach Lars Christensen and consulting with Andre Agassi, believes his primary obstacle is mental, focusing on sustained peak performance rather than isolated good weeks.

          <p>A significant study by GiveDirectly in rural Kenya found that one-time cash grants of approximately $1,871 per household led to a remarkable 48% reduction in infant and child mortality. This effect is largely attributed to increased hospital deliveries and improved food security among mothers. While this contrasts with null effects seen in similar US studies, the article highlights a crucial caveat: the program's cost-effectiveness for saving lives ($299,418 per life) is not competitive with other interventions like Vitamin A supplementation or malaria prevention, which are far cheaper. The study suggests cash transfers primarily reduce poverty, with life-saving benefits being a secondary, less cost-efficient outcome.</p>

          <p>China's top engineering academy, the Chinese Academy of Engineering (CAE), has shortlisted a record 19 private-sector executives and chief scientists for academicianship, including leaders from prominent AI specialist iFlyTek, battery manufacturer CATL, and carmaker BYD. This unprecedented move reflects the country's high recognition of private enterprises' scientific and technological innovation capabilities, particularly in cutting-edge fields like artificial intelligence, new energy, and biopharmaceuticals. The CAE, which traditionally comprises members from universities and state-owned enterprises, aims to infuse new perspectives and drive innovation by integrating this diverse talent. This strategic shift demonstrates a commitment to leveraging all sectors for national technological advancement.</p>

          <div class="timestamp">2025-08-22 06:50:01 EDT</div>
        </div>
        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>The U.S. House of Representatives recently approved a proposal for the Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) to devise a knowledge test for "accredited investors," which would allow more individuals to access private-market assets such as pre-IPO companies, private credit, and venture capital funds. Currently, accredited status is primarily determined by income or net worth, thresholds that have not been updated for decades. Experts emphasize the difficulty in designing an effective test, as it needs to gauge an investor's understanding of the unique risks associated with private assets, including their limited liquidity, subjective valuations, and longer investment horizons. The challenge is further compounded by the fact that many consumers already struggle with basic financial literacy, making robust investor protection a critical concern. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>A new species of dinosaur, Istiorachis macaruthurae, discovered on the Isle of Wight, has been named after the renowned sailor Dame Ellen MacArthur. This medium-sized herbivore, whose remains date back 125 million years, possessed a distinctive "eye-catching sail" along its back, which scientists speculate was used for display, possibly to attract mates or intimidate rivals. Dame Ellen MacArthur expressed her profound honor at this unique tribute, highlighting the touching resemblance between the dinosaur's sail-like feature and the sails she has spent much of her life beneath. The fossils, initially found by fossil hunter Nick Chase, have been analyzed and are now showcased at the Dinosaur Isle Museum in Sandown.</p>

          <p>India's Supreme Court has revised its previous order regarding Delhi's stray dog population, now stipulating that non-aggressive, vaccinated, and sterilized dogs should be released back to their original sites rather than confined to shelters. However, dogs exhibiting rabies or aggressive behavior must still be immunized and kept in shelters. The court also banned public feeding of stray dogs, mandating dedicated areas for this purpose. This modification followed widespread protests and legal challenges from animal welfare groups advocating for more humane solutions to manage the estimated one million strays in Delhi, a city that accounts for a significant portion of global rabies deaths.</p>

Members, including non-Black individuals, are actively working to grow the group and promote Catholic social teachings, having already co-sponsored a gospel Mass and marched against immigration raids. The initiative highlights a critical need for inclusive spaces and the recovery of diverse Catholic heritage, with members seeking to weave themselves into the fabric of O.C.

          <p>A recent, rare case of the plague in a South Lake Tahoe resident, likely contracted from an infected flea, has prompted experts to explain the disease's current status and risks. While historically devastating, the plague is now treatable with antibiotics, making it far less lethal if detected early. The bacterium Yersinia pestis primarily affects small animals and rodents in rural areas, and humans typically contract it while hiking or camping. Although no FDA-approved vaccine exists, infectious disease experts consider the plague under control in the U.S. and not a top public health priority, reassuring the public that timely treatment offers little to fear.</p>

          <p>A review of David Baron’s book, "The Martians," delves into the early 20th-century obsession with intelligent life on Mars, fueled by figures like Percival Lowell, an independently wealthy scientist.

Baron's narrative focuses on the social currents and key personalities, including Nikola Tesla, who captivated the public with claims of receiving Martian signals. The review highlights how, despite scientific debunking of the "canals," this collective imagination ultimately inspired generations, including Carl Sagan, to pursue space exploration as a tangible possibility.</p>

          <p>A review of R.F.

The story follows protagonist Alice Law and her partner as they venture into hell to retrieve a mentor's soul, driven by a flawed, self-serving motive. The article highlights Kuang's profound knowledge of linguistics and chthonic myths, which enriches the novel's texture and complexity, making it suitable for intellectually engaged readers. The review notes a more mature and subtly humorous tone compared to Kuang's earlier works, exploring themes of delusion and self-destruction within an Oxbridge academic setting.</p>
