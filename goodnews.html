          <p>Taku Eto resigned as Japan's farm minister after admitting he doesn't buy rice due to receiving it from supporters, sparking public anger amid soaring rice prices. Prime Minister Ishiba appointed Shinjiro Koizumi as his replacement, a move that comes before a House of Councillors election this summer and follows public support for Ishiba's Cabinet plummeting to its lowest level since he took office. Eto's comments came shortly after the Agriculture Ministry decided to release additional rice from emergency stockpiles in an attempt to bring down the price of rice, which has doubled from a year earlier.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>The Food and Drug Administration (FDA) will limit Covid vaccine use to adults over 65 and individuals with specific medical conditions, potentially requiring further studies for healthy adults under 65. Agency leaders cited uncertain benefits for younger individuals already vaccinated or previously infected with Covid. This shift departs from the previous recommendation of annual Covid shots for everyone aged 6 months and older. Experts have voiced concerns that the new restrictions could unnecessarily limit access for healthy individuals at high risk due to their jobs or other factors.</p>

          <p>President Trump announced plans for the "Golden Dome" missile defense shield, an ambitious project to expand the country's air defense system, aiming for completion by the end of his term. The project, likened to Israel's Iron Dome, faces logistical and financial challenges, with cost estimates varying widely. Trump claims the system will intercept missiles from any location, including space, and has secured initial funding. Experts, however, express concerns about the technical complexities and financial burden of shielding the United States from advanced aerial attacks.</p>
