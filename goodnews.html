          <p>A Japanese district court has ruled that the state must pay 1.2 million yen to two asylum seekers as compensation for repeated detentions by the immigration agency. The court found that some detentions failed to consider the asylum seekers' physical and mental health, violating international human rights covenants and Japan's immigration law. The plaintiffs, a Kurdish man and an Iranian national, had been detained and released multiple times over a decade, leading them to file a lawsuit in 2022 focusing on their treatment since 2016. The Immigration Services Agency plans to respond after reviewing the ruling's details. </p>

The explosion occurred while engineers were preparing for a "routine static fire test" of the rocket's engines with the craft held down on the launch pad. SpaceX described the incident as a "major anomaly," assuring that a safety perimeter was in place and all personnel were safe. CEO Elon Musk confirmed there were no hazards to nearby communities and cautioned people to stay away from the site, as the company continues to develop Starship spacecraft for crewed missions to Mars.</p>

          <p>An opinion piece argues that while the U.S. must address Iran's nuclear ambitions, its primary strategic focus should remain on China. The author contends that a U.S. strike on Iran's Fordow nuclear facility should be precise and limited, aimed at setting back Iran's nuclear timeline without entangling the U.S. in a broader regional war. It warns that a prolonged U.S. involvement in the Middle East would benefit China, which the U.S. National Defense Strategy identifies as the pacing threat to U.S. global primacy.

Temperatures are expected to peak between 30 and 33C in central and eastern England, with regional fire services issuing water safety warnings. For the Met Office to declare an official heatwave, threshold temperatures must be met for at least three consecutive days, varying from 25C in the north and west to 28C in eastern England.</p>

The CloudMatrix-Infer solution, leveraging this infrastructure, surpassed the performance of prominent systems in running DeepSeek's 671-billion-parameter R1 reasoning model.

          <p>Juneteenth, now a federally recognized holiday, commemorates the end of slavery in the U.S. and is celebrated annually on June 19. The name combines "June" and "nineteenth," marking the day in 1865 when enslaved people in Texas learned of their freedom. The holiday symbolizes unity, power, and resilience, and was officially recognized in 2021 after decades of community advocacy. Celebrations include parades, parties, concerts, and educational events, reflecting the historical legacy and ongoing importance of emancipation.</p>

The new law aims to ensure that all aspects of university life, from protests to teaching, are open to discussion. The guidelines provide detailed scenarios for interpreting the law, balancing free speech with the need to prevent intimidation and harassment.</p>

Ishiba had previously indicated a willingness to dissolve the lower house if a no-confidence motion was submitted, but the lack of support from other parties has led to the current decision, as key bills are unlikely to pass during the parliamentary session.</p>
