          <p>The UK government has confirmed a national inquiry into the "Battle of Orgreave," a violent 1984 confrontation between police and striking miners in Rotherham. Home Secretary Yvette Cooper announced the inquiry, fulfilling a Labour manifesto promise to address unanswered questions that have persisted for four decades. The investigation will examine the events of the day and the subsequent, discredited criminal prosecutions against 95 miners. Campaigners, who have sought this inquiry for over 13 years, expressed cautious elation, hoping it will bring truth and justice to former mining communities affected by the historic industrial dispute.</p>

          <p>German Chancellor Friedrich Merz is meeting with executives from approximately 30 major companies, including Siemens and Deutsche Bank, to encourage fresh domestic investment and restore economic confidence. The "Made for Germany" initiative aims to revive the country's struggling economy, which has faced two years of recession. While the government has approved significant tax relief and a €500 billion infrastructure fund, it emphasizes that private sector participation is crucial for recovery. This high-level meeting is a key part of the new government's strategy to combat inflation, high energy costs, and global competition. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>Chinese-led infrastructure projects are set to unlock significant iron ore exports from Guinea and Algeria to China later this year. In Guinea, mining giant Rio Tinto and Chinese partners are developing the Simandou project, with shipments expected to begin in November after the completion of essential rail lines. Similarly, a new railway will connect the Gara Djebilet mine in Algeria's Sahara Desert to Mediterranean ports, overcoming a major logistical barrier. These developments demonstrate China's strategic efforts to secure new sources of raw materials by investing in critical transport infrastructure across Africa.</p>

The advanced stealth jet, part of the HMS Prince of Wales fleet, was diverted during a sortie on June 14 and was unable to be repaired by the carrier's engineers. A specialist team of 14 engineers was subsequently deployed from the UK with special equipment to make the aircraft airworthy again. The prolonged stay of the $110 million aircraft had sparked considerable public curiosity and even discussion in the UK's House of Commons.</p>

The city has faced years of economic decline and a shrinking population, with its GDP falling in recent years.

Researchers believe the drugs' ability to improve insulin sensitivity is key, as it can lower testosterone levels, a primary driver of PCOS symptoms.
