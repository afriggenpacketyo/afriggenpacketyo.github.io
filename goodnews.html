        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Sinclair Broadcasting has announced the immediate return of "Jimmy Kimmel Live!" to its ABC stations, effectively ending a controversial preemption that began due to remarks made by host Jimmy Kimmel concerning the shooting death of conservative activist Charlie Kirk. The show had been temporarily suspended by Sinclair and Nexstar affiliates following Kimmel's comments related to the shooting death of conservative activist Charlie Kirk. Sinclair's statement emphasized its commitment to ensuring programming remains accurate and engaging for the widest possible audience, while also honoring obligations to air national network content. Although Sinclair's 38 ABC stations will resume airing the program, Nexstar, operating about 30 ABC affiliates, has not yet indicated if or when it will follow suit. The preemption had drawn significant attention, with Kimmel's show still attracting a large broadcast audience on other affiliates.</p>

          <p>Shares of Electronic Arts (EA) experienced a significant 15% surge following a Wall Street Journal report indicating the video game giant is nearing a massive $50 billion deal to transition into private ownership. Major investors, including Saudi Arabia's Public Investment Fund and Silver Lake, are reportedly involved in the potential transaction, with an official announcement anticipated as early as next week. If finalized, this leveraged buyout would set a new record as the largest in Wall Street history, surpassing the approximately $45 billion deal for TXU Energy in 2007. EA, renowned for popular franchises such as The Sims, Madden NFL, and FC (formerly FIFA), has already seen its stock climb 32% for the year with these latest gains. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>A remarkably rare orange lobster, estimated to be a one-in-30-million find, has been successfully rescued from a New York supermarket and released back into the wild. Shopper Kyle Brancato spotted the uniquely colored crustacean, affectionately nicknamed Jean-Clawed Van Damme, moving among other lobsters for sale at a Tops grocery store and decided to purchase it with the explicit goal of setting it free. With crucial assistance from Humane Long Island and the New York Aquarium, the lobster was safely returned to the open waters of the Long Island Sound. This heartwarming and unusual rescue occurred just a day before National Lobster Day, offering a positive contrast to the typical fate of thousands of lobsters during peak harvesting season.</p>

          <p>Former shadow chancellor John McDonnell and MP Apsana Begum have been officially readmitted to the Labour Party, ending a year-long suspension imposed after they rebelled against the government's two-child benefit cap. They were among seven left-wing MPs who voted against an SNP motion to scrap the cap shortly after Labour's 2024 landslide victory, with six now having rejoined as the party begins to soften its stance on the controversial policy. Begum used her return to criticize Labour for suspending MPs who vote with their conscience, while the Resolution Foundation estimates that abolishing the cap would cost £3.5 billion and lift 470,000 children out of poverty. The issue is expected to be a central theme at Labour's upcoming annual conference in Liverpool.</p>

Despite an animated celebration, players and manager Dave Roberts acknowledged the unique obstacles, including early-season injuries, a significant second-half slump, and numerous bullpen collapses, suggesting a potential "World Series hangover" effect from their previous championship. Roberts highlighted the physical and mental exhaustion that comes with trying to repeat, a feat not accomplished since the Yankees' three-peat in 1998-2000. However, recent improvements in team performance and returning reinforcements offer renewed optimism as they prepare for the postseason, aiming to overcome adversity and make history.</p>

She discussed her upcoming book "107 Days," revealing to Evans that he was the first person outside her team with whom she had discussed it. Harris shared that she learned of President Joe Biden's decision not to seek re-election while casually playing with her young nieces, leading to an immediate, impromptu campaign meeting at her dining table. She also reflected on the immense challenge of certifying the 2020 election on January 6th, emphasizing her unwavering commitment to upholding the rule of law and the peaceful transfer of power, despite personal grief after conceding the election.</p>

          <p>President Donald Trump made a notable appearance at the 45th Ryder Cup at Bethpage Black in New York, attending on Friday to rally and boost the spirits of Team USA. His arrival was met with enthusiastic cheers from thousands of fans, who chanted "U-S-A" and sang the national anthem as Air Force One flew overhead. Trump, accompanied by his eldest granddaughter, expressed his desire to help the American golfers, who were initially struggling in the matches. He briefly greeted players like Bryson DeChambeau and Ben Griffin on the first tee before returning to his seat, remaining at the course for about two and a half hours. Scottie Scheffler, the world's top player, had previously stated that the president's presence would provide a significant boost to the U.S. team.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Despite recent interest rate cuts by the Federal Reserve, this article outlines three compelling and timely reasons for savers to consider opening a Certificate of Deposit (CD) account in early October. Firstly, securing a CD now allows for immediate interest compounding, meaning the reliable and predictable fixed rates, currently around 4.50%, will begin generating returns sooner. Secondly, with the CME Group's FedWatch tool indicating an 85.5% chance of another Fed rate cut by the end of October, acting proactively ensures savers lock in more attractive rates before potential declines. Lastly, many banks may preemptively reduce their rates even before an official Fed announcement, making prompt action crucial to maximize interest-earning opportunities. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>Nvidia is significantly expanding its investment portfolio, underscored by a reported $100 billion commitment to OpenAI, which highlights the chipmaker's increasingly central role in the burgeoning artificial intelligence ecosystem. This follows several other substantial recent investments, including $5 billion in Intel, $500 million in self-driving car startup Wayve, and £500 million in UK cloud provider Nscale. Nvidia strategically deploys its capital and offers access to its highly desired AI chips in exchange for equity and insights into the direction of leading AI startups. With its market cap soaring to $4.3 trillion since ChatGPT's debut, these investments solidify Nvidia's influence and allow it to effectively deploy its massive cash flow, particularly given the challenging regulatory environment for direct acquisitions.

The Human Rights Campaign defines "coming out" as acknowledging one's LGBTQ+ identity, a significant step in reclaiming the right to self-expression. Selected stories, which can include written responses, photos, or voice memos, will be featured in the Up First newsletter on October 12, promoting awareness and understanding of LGBTQ+ rights.</p>

          <p>The Federal Aviation Administration (FAA) has announced a significant step towards restoring trust in Boeing, allowing the manufacturer to resume self-certifying some of its 737 Max and 787 Dreamliner aircraft before they are delivered to customers. This decision marks a crucial turning point after years of intense scrutiny and safety crises that led the FAA to take over all airworthiness certifications for these models, following two fatal 737 Max crashes in 2019 and persistent production defects in 787s since 2022. The FAA stated that this move follows a "thorough review of Boeing's ongoing production quality" and will enable its inspectors to focus additional surveillance on the broader production process. Boeing CEO Kelly Ortberg expressed optimism about stabilizing the 737 Max production rate at 38 per month and evaluating potential increases with the FAA.</p>

          <p>The opening day of the Ryder Cup at Bethpage Black was marked by an initially raucous atmosphere that quickly turned subdued as Team Europe dominated the United States in the fourball session. Thousands of fans, some arriving as early as 3 am, created chaotic scenes around the course, but their energy waned as the European pairings, including Jon Rahm/Tyrrell Hatton and Rory McIlroy/Tommy Fleetwood, delivered precise and commanding performances. Despite Bryson DeChambeau's dramatic opening drive for Team USA, Europe absorbed the early American punch, capitalizing on a rain-softened course. By the session's end, Europe held a commanding 3-1 lead, silencing the partisan American crowd and setting a challenging tone for the remainder of the highly anticipated tournament.</p>

Michaels, having acquired Joann's intellectual property and private label brands in June, is also expanding its party goods section, aiming to solidify its position as North America's largest specialty fabric and party retailer.

        </div>
        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>This article provides a detailed breakdown of the estimated monthly costs for a $150,000 home equity loan, particularly relevant following the Federal Reserve's recent interest rate cut. Home equity loans offer a fixed interest rate, ensuring predictable monthly payments, and current average rates are slightly more favorable than earlier in the year. For a 10-year repayment period at an average rate of 8.34%, the monthly payment would be approximately $1,846.97. Opting for a 15-year term at an average rate of 8.21% would result in monthly payments around $1,451.72. While the immediate savings compared to earlier 2025 rates are modest, the potential for further rate cuts later this year and into 2026 could make this a increasingly attractive borrowing option for homeowners.

          <p>Costco reported its fiscal fourth-quarter earnings and revenue, which surpassed analyst expectations, though minor misses in same-store sales growth, membership renewal rates, and gross margin led to a slight 2% dip in its stock. Despite this, Wall Street analysts largely maintained "outperform" or "buy" ratings, making only marginal downward adjustments to price targets while expressing overall optimism. They highlighted several positive indicators, including robust membership fee growth and a significant increase in online signups, particularly among younger demographics, which are seen as crucial for long-term member retention. Although the stock's high price-to-earnings multiple presents a challenge for new investments, analysts emphasize Costco's strong value proposition as an inflation-fighter and its consistent operational execution, solidifying its status as a core holding.

          <p>The Netherlands has announced a significant act of cultural repatriation, committing to return over 28,000 fossils, including the iconic "Java Man" bones, to Indonesia at the nation's request. These invaluable fossils, known collectively as the Dubois Collection, were originally extracted by Dutch anthropologist Eugene Dubois in 1891, a period when Indonesia was under Dutch colonial rule. The decision follows a recommendation from the Dutch Independent Colonial Collections Committee, which concluded that the items were likely removed against the will of the local population, constituting an act of historical injustice. This initiative is part of a broader, ongoing effort by the Netherlands to confront and rectify its colonial past, having previously returned other significant artifacts to Indonesia and the ancient Benin Bronzes to Nigeria, marking a positive step towards reconciliation.</p>

The home run, hit during the Mariners' division-clinching game, sparked widespread positive reactions online, drawing comparisons to a previous, less generous fan incident. Mariners security quickly authenticated the ball, and Marcus, prioritizing the player's ownership of the milestone, willingly exchanged it for a signed bat and an invitation to batting practice.

          <p>The U.S. Coast Guard has successfully seized over $220 million worth of cocaine in a series of recent interdictions targeting alleged drug-smuggling vessels off the coasts of Mexico, Central, and South America. During August and September, the crew of the USCG Cutter Midgett alone intercepted four different vessels, confiscating approximately 21,126 pounds of cocaine. Separately, the USCG Cutter Diligence seized an additional 8,700 pounds of cocaine north of Panama in early September. The Coast Guard released a striking image of one alleged drug boat on fire, explaining that such vessels are intentionally sunk after narcotics are removed to prevent maritime accidents. These operations highlight that approximately 80% of illicit narcotics destined for the United States are intercepted at sea, predominantly in the Pacific Ocean.</p>

          <p>Defense Secretary Pete Hegseth has issued an unusual directive, summoning numerous generals and admirals, along with some of their staff, from military commands worldwide to attend a rare, in-person meeting next week in Quantico, Virginia. Chief Pentagon spokesman Sean Parnell confirmed that the "Secretary of War" will address his senior military leaders, though no further details about the meeting's agenda were provided to either the attendees or the press. This short-notice, large-scale gathering follows President Trump's earlier executive order renaming the Defense Department as the Department of War and Hegseth's previous public statements about his intent to significantly reduce the number of flag officers. While the exact purpose remains unclear, speculation suggests it could involve the rollout of the new National Defense Strategy or further discussions on military restructuring.</p>
