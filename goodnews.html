          <p>Martha's Rule, a vital initiative allowing families to seek an urgent second medical opinion for deteriorating loved ones, is now being rolled out across all acute hospitals in England. Spearheaded by the parents of 13-year-old Martha Mills, who died due to care failings, the rule has already demonstrated significant impact during its pilot phase in 143 hospitals. NHS England data reveals almost 5,000 calls led to 241 life-saving interventions, addressing issues like care changes, treatment delays, and communication breakdowns. Martha's mother welcomed the expansion on her daughter's 18th birthday, advocating for broader UK access and emphasizing the need for a more equal doctor-patient relationship.</p>

          <p>The BBC has introduced an interactive online feature titled "Cooler Than Me?", designed to allow users to compare their current location's weather with forecasts from cities worldwide. This playful tool taps into the British national pastime of discussing the weather, inviting individuals to see if their area truly experiences less sunshine than other global destinations. It aims to provide an engaging and accessible way for the public to interact with meteorological data, potentially fostering a greater understanding of diverse climates. The feature encourages users to explore the BBC Weather website for detailed forecasts, offering a unique perspective on global environmental comparisons.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>European stock markets are poised for a slightly higher open as investors closely monitor developments surrounding President Trump's trade tariffs. This follows a federal appeals court decision that declared most of these tariffs illegal, prompting Trump to request an expedited Supreme Court review. The uncertainty over the tariffs' fate is a key factor influencing global markets, with major European indices like the FTSE and CAC 40 showing modest gains. Alongside this, traders are anticipating new EU retail sales figures and crucial U.S. labor market data, including the ADP private payrolls report and jobless claims, which will significantly shape the near-term economic outlook.

          <p>Most Asia-Pacific markets experienced gains, mirroring an overnight tech-led rally on Wall Street, despite underlying economic fears. Japan's Nikkei 225 rose, though Nidec Corp shares plunged due to an accounting probe. Australia's S&P/ASX 200 climbed on strong household spending data, while South Korea's Kospi also saw modest increases. Conversely, Hong Kong's Hang Seng and mainland China's CSI 300 retreated in volatile trading. Global bond markets remain a focus, with U.S. 30-year Treasury yields exceeding 5% after the tariff ruling, and Japan's 30-year bond yield reaching a record high amid inflation concerns.

          <p>A recent survey conducted by the Chicago Council on Global Affairs and The Carter Centre reveals a more nuanced and flexible perspective among ordinary Chinese citizens regarding US rivalry and their nation's global role. Contrary to the American belief that China seeks to entirely displace the US, a significant plurality, 48%, expressed interest in a "shared leadership role," suggesting an openness to peaceful coexistence with the United States and the West. While Chinese respondents are optimistic about their country's future, economy, and military, this nuanced view provides potential pathways for de-escalating US-China tensions. Researchers, however, noted the possibility of self-censorship influencing some survey responses.</p>

While the state has recently favored Republican governors, Senate contests have proven more difficult for the GOP.

The painting's whereabouts remained unknown until Dutch journalists identified it in an online real estate listing associated with a Nazi lawyer who fled to Argentina.

Judge Allison Burroughs noted that while Harvard should have done more to address antisemitism, the administration's demands extended beyond this, covering ideological and pedagogical concerns. The freeze had halted critical research projects, and the White House has vowed to appeal this decision, which affirms academic freedom and procedural rights for the university.</p>
