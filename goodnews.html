          <p>The UK government has announced an ¬£86 billion package for the science and technology sector as part of its upcoming Spending Review. The funding will support research into drug treatments and longer-lasting batteries, with up to ¬£500 million allocated to regions across the UK, allowing local leaders to direct investment based on their areas' expertise. Chancellor Rachel Reeves stated that this investment would create jobs and enhance security, with the package expected to be worth over ¬£22.5 billion annually by 2029. While research backers have welcomed the funding, they also emphasized the need for a decade-long plan to train workers and address potential challenges such as visa costs for overseas scientists and budget adjustments for inflation.</p>

          <p>Archaeologists excavating at the Floga archaeological site on the Greek island of Paros have discovered an ancient workshop filled with unfinished sculptures and other artifacts. The excavation revealed new architectural remains, eating vessels, and storage items, indicating continuous use of the site over time. Among the finds were semi-finished marble sculptures, mainly of Aphrodite, clay heads of female figures, and clay molds and stamps. The site, reorganized at the end of the third century B.C., served as both a residential space and a sculpture workshop, evidenced by a room with a pebble floor and wall paintings imitating marble slabs.</p>

          <p>Nearly six decades after humans first walked on the moon, space agencies and commercial companies are planning a return with goals beyond simple exploration. NASA and ESA are collaborating on the Artemis program, aiming to establish a permanent base at the moon's south pole, while China and Russia are jointly developing the International Lunar Research Station by 2035. These projects seek to utilize the moon's resources, including iron, silicon, hydrogen, and rare earth elements, for self-sufficiency and as a launchpad for missions to Mars.

          <p>Mauricio Pochettino has dismissed rumors linking him to the vacant Tottenham Hotspur managerial position, stating that it is not realistic for him to leave his current role as the US men‚Äôs national team manager. Pochettino, who previously managed Spurs from 2014 to 2019, emphasized his commitment to the USMNT despite a mixed bag of performances in his first nine months. His comments came after the USA's 2-1 loss to Turkey in a friendly match, where he fielded a younger and less-experienced squad.

          <p>As the Labour government approaches its first year in office, its upcoming Spending Review is seen as a crucial opportunity to demonstrate a confident and deliverable economic vision to the private sector and international investors. The review will outline departmental spending plans, with a focus on long-term capital spending, projected to reach its highest sustained level in nearly half a century at 2.7% of GDP. While the government faces challenges such as industrial energy prices and social care costs, it aims to prioritize investment in science-led growth and infrastructure projects like the high-speed rail line between Liverpool and Manchester, while maintaining tight controls on day-to-day spending.</p>

The government is attempting to improve flexible options as part of its pledge to recruit 6,500 new teachers, with Education Secretary Bridget Phillipson advocating for more schools to offer flexible hours.

          <p>The Transportation Security Administration (TSA) has clarified that Costco cards are not a valid form of identification for air travel. Since May 7, 2025, travelers have been required to present a REAL ID-compliant driver's license or state ID to board domestic flights. The TSA emphasized this on Facebook, humorously stating that while they appreciate Costco's hotdogs and rotisserie chickens, their membership cards do not meet the REAL ID requirements. The REAL ID Act, passed in 2005, sets standards for identification sources, and compliant cards typically feature a star marking.</p>

          <h2>China's Demographic Crisis Could Ease with Male Childcare Subsidies, Research Suggests</h2>

          <p>A new study suggests that subsidizing men's participation in household chores and childcare could help reverse declining birth rates, particularly in countries like China facing a demographic crisis. Researchers from Fudan University and the University of Hong Kong found that subsidies for fathers produce higher long-term fertility gains compared to solely subsidizing mothers. The study emphasizes the need to address traditional expectations that place the burden of childcare on women, which clash with rapid economic changes and contribute to declining fertility rates.</p>
