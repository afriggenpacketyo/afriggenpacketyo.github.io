          <p>This article presents the concluding text from Justice Anthony Kennedy's majority opinion in the 2015 Supreme Court case Obergefell v. Hodges, which legalized same-sex marriage nationwide. Kennedy eloquently argues that the petitioners seek the profound union of marriage not to disrespect the institution, but to find fulfillment and escape condemnation to loneliness. He asserts that their plea is for equal dignity under the law, a right he concludes is granted to them by the U.S. Constitution. The text represents a pivotal moment in American civil rights history, reversing the lower court's judgment.</p>

          <p>During a White House event, President Donald Trump announced that the United States had signed an agreement with China on the previous day, though he did not provide any details about its contents. He made the remark while promoting a government spending bill, suggesting his administration is actively making deals with other countries and is beginning to 'open up China.' The statement was brief and came without elaboration from the president or his administration. As of the article's publication, the White House, USTR, and other relevant departments had not responded to requests for clarification on the nature of the agreement.</p>

          <p>NASA's James Webb Space Telescope has successfully captured its first direct images of an exoplanet, a planet outside our solar system. The newly found planet, named TWA 7b, is estimated to be similar in mass to Saturn and orbits a young star. Scientists utilized high-contrast imaging and a coronagraph, a tool that blocks a star's bright light, to detect the faint planet, which would typically be very difficult to observe directly. While a small possibility remains that the object is a background galaxy, researchers state the evidence strongly suggests it is a previously unknown planet.</p>

          <p>A state appeals court has dismissed the remaining criminal charges against Diana Teran, a former top advisor to ex-Los Angeles County District Attorney George Gasc√≥n. Teran was accused of improperly downloading and using confidential police records, but the court ruled unanimously that her actions were not criminal as the documents were publicly available court records. The case, brought by California Attorney General Rob Bonta's office, was politically charged and used by opponents during the campaign against Gasc√≥n. Teran‚Äôs defense maintained she was targeted for her work on police accountability.</p>

He outlined future goals focused on education, housing affordability, and mental healthcare access.

          <p>Nike reported a 12% drop in fourth-quarter sales, but the results still surpassed Wall Street's low expectations, and the company indicated that the worst of its financial slump is over. The sneaker giant's profits fell sharply as it implemented a turnaround plan involving clearing out old inventory and re-engaging with wholesale partners, which are less profitable than direct sales. While digital sales saw a significant 26% drop, sales at Nike's physical stores showed a modest 2% increase. The company confirmed this quarter would see the largest financial impact from its restructuring. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>Shares of backup generator maker Generac are heading for their best week since last November, with the stock price rising nearly 12%.

These events are placing significant strain on the nation's aging power grid, increasing demand for backup power solutions. The trend reflects a growing market concern over grid stability in the face of extreme weather and rising electricity demand. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>The sequel 'M3GAN 2.0' shifts the franchise from horror to action-comedy, introducing a new, more advanced military android named AMELIA to rival the titular killer doll. The film sees M3GAN's creator, Gemma, rebranding as an anti-technology crusader while M3GAN herself is rebuilt and placed in a new body. The review notes that the film is a goofy, self-aware B-movie that borrows heavily from influences like 'The Terminator' but is elevated by director Gerard Johnstone's shaggy sense of humor. While not scary, the movie playfully explores themes of human-machine blending and the absurdity of our hyper-connected world.</p>
