          <p>Israel's Supreme Court has ordered the state to provide sufficient food to Palestinian prisoners, overturning a policy implemented by far-right National Security Minister Itamar Ben-Gvir. The ruling came after a civil rights group argued that ration cuts had led to malnutrition and starvation among detainees. The minister criticized the court's decision, accusing it of protecting terrorists. This legal development highlights the contentious issue of prisoner conditions within the Israeli justice system amid the ongoing conflict.</p>

          <p>German automaker Volkswagen is intensifying its push to dominate the European electric vehicle market by introducing a new lineup of affordable, compact models.

CEO Oliver Blume stated that Volkswagen, already the market leader in Europe with a 28% share, intends to further expand its position through this new family of EVs, which benefit from improved software and a unified battery cell concept.</p>

          <p>China's central bank has extended its gold-buying streak, increasing its holdings to 74.02 million ounces in August as it continues to diversify its reserves away from US dollar-backed assets. This move is part of a broader global trend where central banks are seeking alternatives to the dollar due to geopolitical risks and concerns about long-term stability. The sustained demand has helped push gold prices higher, with gold's share of China's total foreign exchange reserves reaching a record 7.64%. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>The European Union Agency for Asylum (EUAA) has reported a 23% drop in asylum applications during the first half of 2025 compared to the same period last year. This significant decline was primarily driven by a 66% reduction in applications from Syrian nationals. The agency suggests this trend is not due to EU policy changes but rather to the ouster of Bashar al-Assad in Syria, which has made many displaced Syrians more hopeful about returning home. Germany, previously the top destination, saw the largest decline in applications among member states.</p>

          <p>European stock markets opened higher on Monday, with major indices like Germany's DAX and France's CAC 40 showing gains. Investor attention is heavily focused on France, where Prime Minister Francois Bayrou is facing a crucial no-confidence vote that he is widely expected to lose. The vote was called by Bayrou himself amid political gridlock over proposed budget cuts, and his potential ousting would require President Emmanuel Macron to appoint the country's fifth prime minister in less than two years.

          <p>As Norwegians head to the polls for a parliamentary election, the ruling Labour Party and its left-leaning allies are projected to win a narrow majority. Opinion polls suggest the alliance will secure just a few more seats than the minimum required to remain in power. The election campaigns have been dominated by domestic issues such as inflation, wealth taxes, and the quality of public services. However, the uncertain international political climate, including the war in Ukraine and U.S. trade policies, has also been a significant topic of discussion.</p>

          <p>With Japanese Prime Minister Shigeru Ishiba announcing his intention to resign, the race to lead the world's fourth-largest economy is now open, with former economic security minister Sanae Takaichi emerging as a frontrunner. According to a recent Nikkei poll, Takaichi holds a slight lead over her main rival, Shinjiro Koizumi. If she succeeds, Takaichi would become Japan's first female prime minister, a development that analysts suggest is timely given the country's high female labor participation rate. The leadership change comes as Japan grapples with a cost-of-living crisis.</p>
