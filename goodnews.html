          <p>An opinion piece on Fox News argues that President Trump's proposed $5,000 "baby bonus" should be specifically targeted toward married couples to incentivize married fertility. The author contends that the law should favor fertility within marriage due to the demonstrated benefits for children and society. The article draws on historical and sociological research to support the idea that married, two-parent families contribute to a more stable and thriving society, advocating for a revival of Christian faith and community to support this trend.
