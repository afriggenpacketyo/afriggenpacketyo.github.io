          <p>Contemporary Amperex Technology Co. Ltd. (CATL), the world's largest electric vehicle battery manufacturer and a key Tesla supplier, is aggressively expanding its international operations. Following a major IPO in Hong Kong, the company is investing heavily in new European factories in Hungary and Spain to sustain its global leadership. This push is driven by intense price wars and market saturation in China, with CATL also planning to introduce its battery-swapping technology to Europe. The move aims to localize production, secure long-term contracts, and tap into markets with higher profit margins.</p>

          <p>Lars Klingbeil, co-chairman of Germany's Social Democratic Party (SPD), has become the country's new vice chancellor and finance minister following a general election. The 47-year-old politician secured these powerful roles during coalition negotiations, creating an unusual concentration of power. Klingbeil, who has had a steady career within the SPD, is now tasked with analyzing the party's significant loss of support in recent years. His political outlook was shaped by his experiences during the 9/11 attacks, leading him to support a stronger military for self-defense.</p>

          <p>Mercedes driver George Russell has stated that the team is holding discussions with four-time world champion Max Verstappen regarding a potential move for the next Formula 1 season. Verstappen is contracted with Red Bull until 2028, but break clauses could allow an early exit. A move could be appealing for Verstappen due to Red Bull's recent performance dip and Mercedes' potential advantage with the new 2026 engine regulations. Russell's comments imply his own contract negotiations are being affected by the team's pursuit of the Dutch driver.</p>

          <p>Smaller cities in the American Midwest are experiencing economic and cultural revitalization thanks to the arrival of refugees and immigrants. Communities in Ohio, Kentucky, and Indiana have seen population declines offset by newcomers who fill critical jobs and start new businesses. For example, Dayton, Ohio, is now home to a thriving Ahiska Turk community, while Indianapolis hosts the largest Burmese community in the U.S. Despite the positive impact, these communities face challenges from new immigration restrictions, which advocates argue could harm both the refugees and the American economy.</p>

          <p>This opinion article argues that Zohran Mamdani's expected victory in the New York City Democratic mayoral primary represents a significant shift within the party. His success, achieved through a grassroots campaign focused on affordability, challenges the establishment's belief that the party must move rightward to win. The author posits that Mamdani's win proves the party's left flank can be an asset, energizing a base frustrated with passive leadership. Mamdani's campaign is presented as a model for a renewed, morally-driven Democratic party that is more aligned with the energy of its younger, more active voters.</p>

Kuniskis, who returned from a brief retirement, aims to reclaim significant market share from competitors like GM and Toyota.

          <p>Quantum computing is attracting massive investment from tech giants like Google, Microsoft, and IBM, despite the technology remaining largely futuristic with minimal current business applications. While a practical quantum computer is likely years away, its promise lies in solving complex problems impossible for traditional computers, particularly in chemistry and materials science. The technology also poses a significant national security risk, as it could potentially break current encryption methods, prompting a government-led push for "post-quantum" security. For now, researchers are focused on fundamental challenges like error correction and scaling up the number of qubits.</p>

          <p>The hotel minibar, once a symbol of travel convenience and indulgence, has largely fallen out of favor in the U.S. Introduced globally in the 1970s, minibars became a logistical and financial burden for hotels due to high operational costs, spoilage, and theft. By the early 2000s, major chains like Marriott began removing them. In their place, hotels are shifting to more modern and profitable alternatives, including contactless lobby marketplaces and strategic partnerships with food delivery apps like DoorDash and Uber Eats. While some luxury hotels have reimagined the minibar with local products, it has become a relic in most midscale establishments.</p>

Though heartbroken, the author found a different kind of connection with him as a close platonic friend.

          <p>Nike has announced it will reduce its reliance on Chinese manufacturing to mitigate the financial impact of U.S. trade policies, which the company estimates could add approximately $1 billion to its costs this year. The sportswear giant plans to lower the percentage of its U.S.-bound footwear made in China from 16% to a high single-digit figure by 2026. The move comes as the White House faces a looming deadline on its 90-day pause on broad tariffs. Despite the challenges, Nike's stock rallied after it forecast better-than-expected revenue.

          <p>Researchers believe they have identified the oldest rocks on Earth, dating back approximately 4.16 billion years, within Canada's Nuvvuagittuq Greenstone Belt. This finding helps settle a scientific dispute, as previous estimates ranged from 3.8 to 4.3 billion years old. The new study used two different radioactive dating techniques that yielded the same age, strengthening the claim. Studying these primordial rocks, which are extremely rare due to Earth's tectonic recycling, could provide invaluable insights into the planet's early formation and the origins of life. The site is on Inuit land, and the local community is seeking to protect it from damage.</p>

          <p>This article reviews Karen Russell's novel "The Antidote," which explores the fantasy of memory erasure against the backdrop of the 1930s Dust Bowl. The book centers on "prairie witches" who store painful memories for their neighbors, allowing them to live without guilt, but the narrative argues against this practice. Russell's project is to defeat the idea of getting rid of the past, suggesting that memories must be kept in circulation for societal health and justice. The novel complicates traditional Dust Bowl narratives by confronting the founding shame of land theft from American Indians, arguing that forgetting this history would be a dystopian national loss.</p>
