          <p>U.S. Representatives Thomas Massie and Ro Khanna are leading a bipartisan effort to force a vote on releasing the complete Jeffrey Epstein files. Massie suggested the delay may be due to potential embarrassment for powerful political donors and possible connections to intelligence agencies. Both congressmen emphasized that justice for survivors must take precedence over protecting influential individuals from reputational harm. They are confident they have secured the necessary votes for a discharge petition to bring the matter to the House floor for a vote this month.</p>

          <p>Police in the Czech Republic have arrested a 51-year-old man who has been seen driving a red, Ferrari-liveried racing car on public motorways since 2019. The driver, who wore a full racing suit and helmet, was tracked down after a recent sighting and arrested at his home. Previously, authorities were unable to press charges because the helmet obscured the driver's identity. The vehicle is identified as a Dallara GP2/08, not an actual Ferrari F1 car, and the owner now faces fines for driving an unroadworthy vehicle.</p>

She dismissed political labels, stating her focus is on deciding cases based on the law, not ideology. Regarding the overturning of Roe v. Wade, Barrett asserted that the Dobbs decision returned the issue of abortion to the democratic process in the states. She refrained from commenting on specific pending legal issues, including those related to President Trump's executive orders, emphasizing the need for judicial impartiality.</p>

          <p>Annalena Baerbock, Germany's former foreign minister from the Green Party, has started her one-year term as the President of the United Nations General Assembly. Her election was conducted via a secret ballot requested by Russia, a move seen as a reaction to her staunch criticism of the war in Ukraine. Baerbock's nomination by the outgoing German government was controversial, as it replaced the originally intended candidate, diplomat Helga Schmid. In her new role, Baerbock will chair meetings and facilitate discussions among the 193 member states.</p>

          <p>An excerpt from Justice Amy Coney Barrett's forthcoming book, "Listening to the Law," reveals the personal deliberations she and her husband faced before her Supreme Court nomination. She describes the decision as difficult, weighing the honor of public service against the significant sacrifices for her family, including a move to Washington D.C. and an intense loss of privacy. Barrett recalls the unpleasant media scrutiny from a previous consideration for the court and explains her husband's condition for moving forward was to "burn the boats," committing fully without second-guessing their choice.</p>

          <p>The Trump administration's elimination of the "de minimis" loophole, which allowed tariff-free imports under $800, has sparked concern among some small businesses. However, this article argues that the panic is misdirected, as the majority of small businesses are service-based and will not be directly affected. While acknowledging that prices will rise, the author contends that the economy can likely absorb the impact as long as consumer income and wealth remain strong. The piece advises businesses to adapt by diversifying suppliers and offering flexible payment options. (not investment advice)</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>This article outlines the key differences and advantages of Roth IRAs and 401(k)s for retirement savings. A Roth IRA offers greater investment flexibility and the ability to withdraw contributions penalty-free, while a 401(k) provides effortless, automated contributions and significantly higher annual contribution limits. The recommended strategy is to first contribute to a 401(k) to receive any employer match, then focus on maxing out a Roth IRA, before returning to the 401(k) if funds allow. This approach combines immediate tax benefits with future tax-free growth. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>According to pediatrician Dr. Daniel Golshevsky, establishing healthy sleeping habits, or "sleep hygiene," in infancy is one of the most critical things parents can do for a child's long-term health and success. These habits are crucial for a baby's physical, mental, and cognitive development and are linked to a child's ability to learn and regulate emotions later in life. Dr. Golshevsky advises creating a soothing environment with white noise, involving both parents in settling routines, and ensuring the baby is well-fed and burped. He stresses flexibility over rigid schedules to reduce parental stress.</p>

          <p>This opinion piece argues that solar power is an ideal energy solution for those concerned with self-sufficiency and preparing for societal disruptions, aligning with conservative principles of individualism. Unlike fossil fuels, which rely on complex and vulnerable supply chains, solar panels provide a decentralized and long-lasting energy source directly from the sun. The article highlights the simplicity and durability of solar technology and electric vehicles, which require minimal maintenance. It suggests that solar energy offers true independence, making a home a self-sustaining castle in times of crisis, while also addressing climate change.</p>

          <p>Despite being a world leader in green technology exports, China is also increasing its coal power capacity. This opinion piece argues that this is not a climate policy reversal but a strategic move to ensure grid stability as the country integrates record amounts of renewable energy. With solar and wind power generation surging, existing infrastructure sometimes cannot handle the output, leading to "curtailment" where clean energy is wasted. Coal plants are being used as a shock absorber to prevent blackouts during peak demand or when hydropower is low, providing a reliable backup for the energy transition.</p>

The platform expanded internationally and evolved into the app Vinted, which now has over 16 million users in the UK.

          <p>A group of Jeffrey Epstein's survivors held a press conference at the U.S. Capitol, demanding Congress pass the Epstein Files Transparency Act to release all government records on the case. They expressed frustration with the slow pace of the official investigation and President Trump's dismissal of the issue as a "hoax." Survivor Lisa Phillips announced that if the government fails to act, the survivors are prepared to create and release their own list of individuals involved. This threat adds pressure on lawmakers to pass the bipartisan bill, which requires just a few more Republican signatures to force a House vote.</p>
