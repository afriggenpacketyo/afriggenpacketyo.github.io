          <p>OpenAI is set to acquire IO, the AI hardware startup founded by former Apple designer Jony Ive, for $6.5 billion in an all-stock transaction, marking OpenAI's largest acquisition to date. Ive and his creative team at LoveFrom will take on significant design responsibilities across OpenAI and IO, aiming to develop innovative AI-driven products. This acquisition signals OpenAI's ambition to move beyond software and create physical devices that seamlessly integrate AI into everyday life, potentially revolutionizing how humans interact with technology.

          <p>Amazon CEO Andy Jassy stated that the company has not observed any decrease in consumer demand despite the imposition of tariffs by President Trump. During Amazon's shareholder meeting, Jassy noted that they also haven't seen significant increases in average selling prices. This contrasts with warnings from other retailers, such as Walmart, who anticipate consumers may soon experience price increases due to the tariffs. Trump responded to Walmart urging them to absorb the tariffs rather than pass the cost onto consumers. The situation is ongoing as retailers assess the impact of the tariffs on consumer behavior and pricing strategies.</p>

          <p>Bitcoin's price reached a new all-time high before experiencing a slight dip due to rising Treasury yields impacting risk assets. The cryptocurrency had been steadily climbing in May, driven by factors such as softer U.S. inflation data, de-escalation in U.S.-China trade tensions, and Moody's downgrade of U.S. sovereign debt. Inflows into Bitcoin ETFs have been substantial, and on-chain data suggests reduced selling pressure and increased liquidity in the crypto market. Investors are anticipating regulatory updates and corporate treasury investments to further boost Bitcoin's price, with public companies significantly increasing their Bitcoin holdings this year.

Microsoft's digital crimes unit, with help from international partners, seized over 1,300 domains used by the malware. The malware had been sold on underground forums since 2022 and was used in various cybercrimes, including phishing campaigns targeting online gaming communities, education systems, and critical infrastructure.</p>

          <p>A Wisconsin angler discovered the wreck of the J.C. Ames, a tugboat submerged in Lake Michigan for over a century, after it was exposed by recent storms. The ship, built in 1881, was once one of the largest and most powerful on the Great Lakes before being scuttled in 1923. Historians are working to document shipwrecks in the Great Lakes before invasive quagga mussels destroy them. The discovery highlights the resurfacing of lost history and the ongoing efforts to preserve maritime heritage in the Great Lakes.</p>

The ministry's director, Marc Wyatt, stated their mandate is to welcome and love people without discrimination, adhering to their religious principles. This decision contrasts with the Episcopal Church, which ended its refugee resettlement partnership due to concerns about racial justice and prioritizing Afrikaners over other refugees. The decision reflects a broader debate within faith-based groups about how to respond to the Trump administration's fast-tracking of Afrikaner resettlement.</p>

The Green Bay Packers' proposal failed to garner the required 75% majority, securing only 22 of 32 votes. The Eagles celebrated the decision, posting a graphic of the play with the words "push on." The push to ban the "tush push" had gained momentum following the Eagles' Super Bowl LIX victory. Some argued the play requires little skill and results in automatic first downs, while others defend it as a strategic component of the game.</p>

          <p>A Noise Within in Pasadena is presenting a lovely revival of "A Man of No Importance," a musical based on the 1994 film about a Dublin bus conductor obsessed with Oscar Wilde. The musical, with a book by Terrence McNally, finds freedom in Wilde‚Äôs iconoclastic example. The story follows Alfie Byrne, a Wilde disciple who decides to stage "Salome" with his amateur troupe, causing conflict within his community. The musical celebrates the stage and how art lifts the spirits of everyday people, and this modest musical is at its most touching when chronicling the ways art lifts the spirits of everyday people who are blessed with no spectacular gifts yet nevertheless possess the inner lives of theatrical giants.</p>

          <p>The Senate passed a surprise "no tax on tips" bill, leading to debate about its potential impact on workers. Both President Trump and Vice President Kamala Harris have expressed support for the concept. If enacted, workers could deduct all "qualified tips" from 2025 through 2028. While supporters claim it would provide relief to hard-working Americans, critics argue it would disproportionately benefit moderate to middle-income workers and could lead to income misclassification. The policy could also incentivize the introduction of tipping in new occupations or a shift in compensation towards greater reliance on tips.</p>

The weekend forecast includes a cloudy start on Saturday with patchy rain in the west and a mix of sunshine and showers on Sunday, mostly in the north and west.
