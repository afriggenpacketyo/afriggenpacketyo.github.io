          <p>Friedrich Merz has assumed the role of Germany's chancellor following a dramatic election process marked by an initial failed vote, revealing underlying divisions within the coalition government. Experts suggest that the focus will soon shift to the government's policy decisions, particularly regarding economic reforms and investments. The new government, composed of the Christian Democratic Union and the Social Democratic Party, faces pressing issues such as internal disagreements on migration, geopolitical tensions, and a struggling economy, needing to build trust to enact swift legislative changes. The chancellor's ability to navigate these challenges will be critical for Germany's economic future.</p>

          <p>Uber's first-quarter earnings surpassed expectations, although revenue fell short of projections, causing a slight drop in share value. The company reported a significant increase in net income compared to the previous year, driven by growth in its ride-hailing and delivery services. CEO Dara Khosrowshahi remains optimistic about autonomous vehicles, reporting an annual run-rate of 1.5 million autonomous vehicle trips, and highlighting the success of the Waymo partnership in Austin, Texas. The company is also facing a lawsuit from the FTC regarding its Uber One subscription service, which Khosrowshahi disputes, stating cancellation is simple and transparent.</p>

          <p>Arsene Wenger, FIFA's head of global development and former Arsenal manager, has suggested a modification to the offside rule that would benefit attacking players. The proposed change would deem an attacker onside if any part of their body is in line with the last defender. This adjustment aims to restore the advantage to attackers, which Wenger believes has been diminished by the use of Video Assistant Referee (VAR) technology in football.</p>

          <p>Despite lingering economic uncertainty and negative economic news, weekly mortgage demand has unexpectedly surged, driven by a decrease in mortgage interest rates. Applications for home purchases increased significantly, particularly for conventional loans, indicating a willingness among borrowers to make major financial moves. Refinancing applications also rose, fueled by demand for Veterans Affairs (VA) loans.

          <p>Chinese scientists have identified a gene in upland rice roots linked to drought resistance, potentially enabling the transformation of widely cultivated irrigated rice into drought-tolerant varieties. Researchers identified the HMGB1 gene, which obstructs the development of deeper, thicker roots essential for drought resistance. By removing this gene, irrigated rice developed traits similar to upland rice, allowing it to thrive in water-scarce environments. These findings could significantly enhance food security in regions facing water scarcity.</p>
