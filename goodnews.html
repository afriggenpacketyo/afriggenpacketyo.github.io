          <p>Following an audit by Baroness Louise Casey into child sexual abuse by grooming gangs, UK Prime Minister Keir Starmer announced a full national statutory inquiry.  The inquiry will cover England and Wales and address criticisms levied against Starmer for his previous reluctance to establish such an investigation.  This decision comes after the government initially dismissed calls for a national inquiry earlier this year. The inquiry will have the power to compel witnesses to provide evidence.</p>
