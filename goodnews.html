          <p>A 68-year-old dog trainer, Christopher Kennedy, was unexpectedly diagnosed with terminal idiopathic pulmonary fibrosis during a routine pre-surgery X-ray, despite having no prior symptoms. As his condition rapidly deteriorated, he was given less than a year to live, leading him to reluctantly agree to a double-lung transplant, a procedure his brother had not survived. After a tense month in the hospital, he successfully underwent the transplant and has made a remarkable recovery, with his lung capacity now at 98%, allowing him to return to training hospital therapy dogs with a renewed perspective on life.</p>

          <p>For the first time since its establishment in 1953, the People's Liberation Army Naval Submarine Academy in China has recruited female students for its undergraduate programs. The ten students who were accepted achieved top scores on their university entrance exams and expressed a desire to contribute to the country's national defense. This historic move marks a significant milestone for the institution, which has been training naval officers for over seven decades and is a key research center for military-aligned technologies.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>According to his great-granddaughter, the 1930s star Will Rogers was the highest-paid actor in Hollywood at the time of his death, but his true passion was being a cowboy, not a movie star. She explains that he used his film career to finance his travels and ranch life, never losing touch with his Oklahoma roots despite his fame. Rogers, who began as a trick-roper in a Wild West show, became a beloved newspaper columnist and cultural icon known for his common-man appeal, and his death in a 1935 plane crash was a moment of national mourning.</p>

          <p>As wedding costs rise, a growing number of couples are using credit cards to finance their big day. Financial experts say this can be a smart strategy to earn valuable rewards, such as points or miles for a honeymoon, but only if done with caution. The key is to have the savings on hand to pay off the credit card balance immediately, thereby avoiding the high-interest debt that can create financial stress at the start of a new marriage.

          <p>A proposed federal bill, the Captive Primate Safety Act, seeks to address the brutal exotic pet trade by making private ownership and breeding of primates illegal across all 50 states. Animal welfare advocates argue that the trade, often fueled by social media, causes immense suffering, beginning with poachers killing adult monkeys to steal their babies. Captive primates often suffer from chronic stress, malnutrition, and psychological damage, making the bill a key step in protecting these animals.</p>
