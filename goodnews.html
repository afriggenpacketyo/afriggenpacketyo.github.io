          <p>Several top leaders from Southeast Asian nations, including Indonesia, Malaysia, and Vietnam, are expected to attend a major military parade in Beijing next month. The event will commemorate the 80th anniversary of the end of World War II, referred to as Victory Day in China. According to sources, the high-level attendance from countries like Cambodia, Laos, and Myanmar signifies Beijing's growing diplomatic influence across the region. The presence of these leaders would mark a notable increase in the seniority of delegations compared to a similar parade held a decade ago.</p>

          <p>A recent episode of NPR's 'The Indicator from Planet Money' explores several economic topics through key statistics. The program examines the "nepo baby premium," revealing that individuals who work at the same company as their mothers tend to earn more. It also touches upon the latest Consumer Price Index inflation data, which has shown signs of soothing the market. Additionally, the episode delves into the ongoing legal disputes between Apple Inc. and Apple Corps, the record label founded by The Beatles, providing a brief overview of their long-standing courtroom feud over trademark rights.</p>

          <p>In a recent episode of NPR's 'Short Wave,' developmental biologist Crystal Rogers discusses the scientific and philosophical challenges of defining life. The conversation explores the standard criteria used in biology to classify living things, such as growth, reproduction, and response to stimuli. The episode highlights the ambiguity of these rules when applied to borderline cases like viruses, which exhibit some but not all characteristics of life. The discussion also extends to futuristic concepts, using a 'Star Trek'-themed debate to consider whether advanced androids could one day be considered alive.</p>

          <p>King Charles III delivered a message to mark the 80th anniversary of Victory over Japan (VJ) Day, vowing that the heroes who fought in the Pacific and Far East will never be forgotten. In his address, the King honored the service and sacrifice that brought an end to World War Two, specifically acknowledging the often-overlooked "Forgotten Army" that fought in Burma. He also reflected on the immense human cost of the war, including the suffering of prisoners of war and the civilian populations of Hiroshima and Nagasaki. The King is set to attend a national service of remembrance to commemorate the historic day.</p>

          <p>A federal judge has issued a preliminary injunction ordering the Department of Health and Human Services (HHS) to cease sharing Medicaid enrollees' personal data with immigration officials. The ruling blocks the Department of Homeland Security from using this information for the purpose of targeting migrants for deportation, a reversal of a recent policy change under the Trump administration. The judge noted that both HHS and Immigration and Customs Enforcement had long-standing policies against such data use, and the sudden change was made without a reasoned decision-making process. The injunction protects data from 20 states that filed a lawsuit to halt the practice.</p>

          <h2>Experts Offer Science-Backed Tips for Improving Sleep Quality</h2>

          <p>With many adults experiencing sleep difficulties, especially during summer heatwaves, experts recommend several strategies to improve sleep. Regular daily exercise is shown to increase the production of the sleep-regulating hormone melatonin and reduce stress, helping individuals fall asleep faster. It is also advised to avoid caffeine within eight hours of bedtime and to reduce screen time before sleep, as device usage can disrupt natural sleep cycles. While the popular "4-7-8" breathing technique lacks robust scientific backing, its calming effects are anecdotally reported to help some people, particularly those with anxiety.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>A federal judge in Maryland has struck down two Trump administration directives that aimed to eliminate diversity, equity, and inclusion (DEI) programs in educational institutions. The ruling found that the Department of Education acted unlawfully when it threatened to withdraw federal funding from schools and universities that continued DEI initiatives. The judge stated the guidance initiated a "sea change" in regulation without following proper procedures, causing educators to fear punishment for lawful speech. This decision is a victory for civil rights advocates who argued the administration's policy amounted to an attack on education and free expression.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>After winning the Premier League title last season, Liverpool manager Arne Slot faces heightened expectations following a summer spending spree that could exceed £300 million. The club has made several high-profile signings, including Florian Wirtz for £116m and striker Hugo Ekitike, signaling a strong intent to defend their title and compete for the Champions League. This significant investment shifts the dynamic for Slot, who initially arrived with modest expectations of securing a top-four finish. Now, with a heavily reinforced squad, anything less than a major trophy would likely be viewed as a failure by the club and its supporters.</p>

          <p>Former England captain Wayne Rooney has commented on the transfer speculation surrounding Newcastle United striker Alexander Isak, suggesting it is becoming difficult for the player to stay at the club. Amid strong interest from Liverpool, Rooney noted that while losing a top player like Isak is a blow, financial regulations might make a sale beneficial for Newcastle. He argued that the funds from selling Isak could allow the club to strengthen its overall squad by bringing in multiple new players. Rooney also acknowledged that the opportunity to join Premier League champions Liverpool is a significant draw for the Swedish striker.</p>

          <p>Police in Surrey, UK, have initiated a campaign called "Jog On" to address the prevalent issue of street harassment and catcalling targeting female runners. The operation involves plain-clothed female police officers jogging in specific areas, with uniformed colleagues nearby to intervene when harassment occurs. One undercover officer reported being honked at twice during a short run, describing the behavior as making her feel "icky" and ruining her experience. The initiative follows a local survey where 94% of female residents reported experiencing harassment, yet nearly half never reported it to the authorities.</p>

ASI plans to send scientific payloads, including a plant growth experiment and a weather station, on one of SpaceX's initial commercial missions to the red planet. The announcement comes despite the fact that SpaceX's Starship rocket, which is essential for Mars missions, has not yet successfully completed an orbital test flight and is not crew-rated. Musk has recently adjusted his timeline, suggesting an uncrewed flight is likely in about 3.5 years, with a crewed mission following roughly two years after that.</p>

          <p>A children's playground in Wooler, Northumberland, has reopened after the discovery and removal of 177 World War Two practice bombs buried beneath it. The devices were first found by a contractor installing new equipment, leading to a specialized ordnance disposal team being called in. The bombs, which were not live but contained a charge, are believed to have been deliberately buried after the war at a site that once housed a military ordnance depot. The successful removal has brought relief to the community, where generations of children had unknowingly played above the cache.</p>

          <p>The American Heart Association and the American College of Cardiology have issued new guidelines for managing hypertension, emphasizing stricter limits on alcohol and sodium intake.

The guidelines also continue to stress the importance of reducing sodium to an ideal target of 1,500 mg per day. Additionally, clinicians are now advised to recommend lifestyle changes for individuals with stage 1 hypertension, an earlier intervention than previously suggested.</p>

          <p>Japan's economy expanded by 0.3% in the second quarter of 2025, surpassing economists' forecasts despite trade headwinds from U.S. tariffs. The growth was primarily driven by strong export performance, which contributed significantly to the GDP figure and helped narrow the country's trade deficit. On an annualized basis, the economy grew by 1%, more than double the forecasted rate. However, economists remain cautious, warning that a slowdown is expected in the coming quarters as corporate investment softens and the full impact of tariffs on key sectors like automobiles begins to materialize (not investment advice).</p>
