          <p>Influencer-turned-boxer Jake Paul defeated former world champion Julio Cesar Chavez Jr. by unanimous decision in a cruiserweight bout in California. Paul, 28, controlled the fight against a largely passive Chavez, who rarely threw punches for most of the contest. The victory, with scores of 99-91, 97-93, and 98-92, continues Paul's winning streak against aging fighters and fuels debate about his legitimacy in professional boxing. Following the win, Paul called out current champions, expressing his ambition to contend for a world title in the near future.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>France is making a significant financial bet on satellite company Eutelsat, hoping to establish a European competitor to Elon Musk's Starlink. A recent state-led investment has made France the largest shareholder, positioning Eutelsat as a strategic asset for Europe's technological sovereignty. However, industry experts are skeptical about its ability to challenge Starlink's dominance, pointing to the massive disparity in the number of satellites and launch capabilities. Eutelsat's current constellation is less than a tenth the size of Starlink's, suggesting its immediate success may be limited to specialized security and enterprise markets rather than the mass consumer market.</p>

Despite his strong pitching performance, Ohtani was hitless in four at-bats, and the Dodgers' five-game winning streak ended with a 9-5 loss. This was Ohtani's third start of the season as he returns from elbow surgery, showing promising progress in his dual-threat capabilities.</p>

          <p>France has enacted a new smoking ban that prohibits lighting up on all public beaches, in parks, and near schools and other public spaces. The rules, which went into effect on Sunday, are part of a national plan to create a "tobacco-free generation" by 2032 and protect children from passive smoking. Violators could face fines up to ‚Ç¨700, although there will be an initial grace period. The ban does not apply to the terraces of bars and restaurants. Health officials note that while smoking rates are declining, over 30% of French adults still smoke.</p>

          <p>Major cities across the United States, including New York and San Francisco, are holding large-scale parades to mark the culmination of LGBTQ+ Pride Month. While the events are celebratory, organizers have adopted a more defiant and protest-oriented tone this year in response to a challenging political climate and legislative efforts targeting LGBTQ+ rights. The theme for New York's march is "Rise Up: Pride in Protest." The festivities also face headwinds from reduced corporate sponsorship, reflecting a broader pullback from diversity and inclusion initiatives by some American companies.</p>

Under the partnership, major supermarkets and manufacturers will be encouraged to use promotions, loyalty points, and store layouts to guide customers toward healthier choices. The initiative is part of a broader strategy to tackle rising obesity rates and relieve pressure on the NHS. While the plan will require retailers to report on healthy food sales for accountability, it does not impose specific targets, opting for a flexible approach.</p>

Athletes are living together in a "virtual athletes' village" during a domestic championship to simulate the challenges of an Olympic environment. The camp, held at a remote venue, aims to get athletes accustomed to unfamiliar conditions, travel logistics, and living in close quarters.

The initiative, led by the Melanoma Fund, educates pupils on checking UV levels and applying sunscreen, with plans for a nationwide rollout by 2026. Experts emphasize that sunburn in childhood significantly increases the risk of melanoma, the most serious skin cancer, later in life. With melanoma diagnoses projected to rise, the program aims to instill lifelong habits and "grow skin cancer out of the next generation."</p>

Developed by Mitsubishi Heavy Industries and JAXA, the H2A series has had a 98 percent success rate since 2001.

          <p>An estimated 100,000 to 200,000 people participated in the Budapest Pride march, turning the event into a major celebration of human rights and a clear message to Prime Minister Viktor Orban's government. The large turnout was partly spurred by the government's attempt to ban the march under a controversial "Child Protection" law that equates homosexuality with pedophilia. Budapest's mayor, Gergely Karacsony, defied the ban by organizing the event through the city council. The peaceful, vibrant march was seen by many as a powerful demonstration of solidarity against the government's increasingly restrictive policies.</p>
