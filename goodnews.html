          <p>This article provides an in-depth profile of Maro Itoje, the newly appointed captain of the British and Irish Lions rugby team. It explores how his Christian faith has deepened in recent years, providing him with humility and a philosophical perspective on the unpredictable nature of sport. Beyond rugby, Itoje leads a "portfolio existence," including founding an art gallery focused on African art, running a charity for disadvantaged children, and holding a master's degree in business. The piece contrasts his thoughtful, multi-faceted personality with past doubts from critics about his leadership capabilities, which he has since disproven.</p>

          <h2>Determining Retirement Savings Needs Remains a Complex and Personal Calculation</h2>
          <div class="timestamp">2025-07-01 01:00:24 EDT</div>
        </div>
        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>This article explores the complex question of how much money is needed for retirement, noting that the answer varies significantly based on individual lifestyle goals. It discusses the challenge for governments in setting pension policy, as targets that are too high can discourage saving, while those too low can lead to shortfalls. The piece examines different adequacy measures, such as the Living Pension benchmark for basic needs and the PLSA's tiered living standards. It concludes that while cash-based targets can be useful, they may not accurately reflect the needs of all earners, highlighting the difficulty in creating a one-size-fits-all retirement savings strategy.</p>

          <h2>Chinese Yuan Forecast to Strengthen Against US Dollar Through 2025</h2>

        </div>
        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>China's onshore yuan is projected to continue its appreciation against the U.S. dollar, with Goldman Sachs forecasting it will surpass the 7 per dollar mark within six months. This strengthening trend is attributed to a more resilient Chinese economic outlook than previously anticipated, despite a divergence between strong exports and weaker domestic demand. Concurrently, growing investor concerns about the sustainability of U.S. government debt and expectations of dollar depreciation are also contributing to the yuan's gains. The People's Bank of China has recently set its daily reference rate at its strongest level since November. (not investment advice)</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Panelists at CNBC's East Tech West conference emphasized the importance for emerging economies to develop "sovereign AI"‚Äîthe ability to control their own AI technologies and data. They argued that current prominent AI models are predominantly English-based, failing to capture linguistic and cultural nuances. To counter this, experts suggest that nations, particularly in regions like Southeast Asia, should leverage open-source AI models and cloud computing services. This approach would democratize access to AI, foster local talent, and allow countries to build systems tailored to their specific languages, cultures, and strategic priorities.</p>

          <h2>Private Survey Shows Unexpected Expansion in China's June Factory Activity</h2>

          <p>China's factory activity among export-oriented manufacturers unexpectedly returned to growth in June, according to the private Caixin/S&P Global manufacturing PMI. The index registered 50.4, surpassing expectations and rebounding from a contraction in May, indicating improving market conditions supported by a rise in production. This result diverges from the official government PMI, which showed a third consecutive month of contraction, a difference attributed to survey timing and company coverage. Despite the positive production figures, new export orders declined and employment in the sector remained weak amid cautious hiring.</p>

        </div>
        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Governor Gavin Newsom has signed significant housing legislation designed to accelerate construction by easing environmental review standards under the California Environmental Quality Act (CEQA). The new laws, pushed through via a 'poison pill' provision in the state budget, exempt most urban housing projects from lengthy CEQA reviews, a move aimed at tackling the state's housing crisis. While development experts praise the reform as a major step to remove construction logjams, it faced opposition from some labor unions and progressive lawmakers. The governor's assertive strategy marks a notable shift in his approach to housing policy.</p>

          <p>The White House has asserted that Canadian Prime Minister Mark Carney "caved" to pressure from former President Donald Trump by agreeing to rescind a proposed tax on large U.S. technology companies. After Trump threatened to raise tariffs and called off trade talks, Canada announced it would scrap the 3% digital services tax. Canadian officials framed the decision as part of a broader negotiation, and trade talks between the two countries have since resumed. The tax would have affected giants like Amazon, Meta, and Google, and its removal was hailed by the White House as a major victory for American companies.</p>
