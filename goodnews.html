          <p>European Ryder Cup player Justin Rose stated the team will not be distracted by Donald Trump's planned visit to the event at Bethpage, even as organizers warn of significant security disruptions. Spectators face unprecedented airport-style security checks and item restrictions, with gates opening exceptionally early to manage the influx. Trump's presence is expected to intensify the atmosphere, but players believe his movements will be managed to minimize direct interference with the competition. The event also faces potential weather delays from forecasted thunderstorms, adding another layer of complexity.</p>

          <p>President Trump has significantly shifted his stance on the war in Ukraine, now suggesting that Kyiv can win back all its territory with European support, a reversal from his previous skepticism. This change has been met with mixed reactions; some Ukrainian officials see it as a positive development, while security experts caution that Russian President Vladimir Putin is unlikely to be swayed by words alone. Critics argue that for the new rhetoric to be effective, it must be followed by concrete actions, such as lifting strike restrictions and enforcing stronger sanctions against Russia. The Kremlin dismissed Trump's comments, asserting its military operation will continue.</p>

          <p>A family reports that their son, diagnosed with nonverbal autism, began speaking just days after taking leucovorin, a drug typically used to mitigate chemotherapy side effects. The treatment is based on the theory that some children with autism have a cerebral folate deficiency, which this drug can bypass to deliver essential folate to the brain. While several small clinical trials have shown positive effects on speech, researchers emphasize that more funding and larger studies are needed for FDA approval. The drug's generic status presents a financial barrier, as pharmaceutical companies have little incentive to fund expensive trials for an inexpensive medicine.</p>

          <p>Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy praised President Trump after a meeting at the UN General Assembly, following which Trump publicly stated Ukraine could win the war and reclaim its original borders. Zelenskyy described the shift as significant, suggesting Trump now has a better understanding of the battlefield situation and is determined to help end the conflict. This marks a stark departure from Trump's earlier position that Ukraine would need to cede territory. While some Ukrainian politicians expressed cautious optimism, others worry it signals a US desire to hand the problem over to Europe rather than a commitment to direct, sustained support.</p>

          <h2>Key Questions for Prospective Homebuyers Following Federal Reserve Rate Cut</h2>
          <div class="timestamp">2025-09-24 13:59:36 EDT</div>
        </div>
        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Following a recent Federal Reserve interest rate cut, prospective homebuyers are advised to consider several key questions before entering the market. With mortgage rates near a three-year low, it's crucial for buyers to determine the actual interest rate they qualify for based on their credit score, as this can vary significantly from advertised averages. The article also suggests exploring alternatives like mortgage points or adjustable-rate mortgages (ARMs) to secure even lower initial rates. Finally, it cautions that waiting for rates to drop further is risky, as recent history shows they can rise unexpectedly, suggesting that acting now and refinancing later might be a prudent strategy.

          <p>A number of retired professional athletes and coaches are transitioning from sports to politics by running for Congress in the 2026 midterm elections. Among the hopefuls are former Yankees first baseman Mark Teixeira, former college football coach Derek Dooley, and former NFL kicker Jay Feely, all running as Republicans. While name recognition can be an advantage, a successful sports career does not guarantee victory, as demonstrated by several recent losses by other athlete-candidates. These new contenders follow in the footsteps of current and former athlete-politicians like Senator Tommy Tuberville and Representative Burgess Owens.</p>

          <p>Honda has confirmed it is canceling all future production of its Acura ZDX electric vehicle, which was being assembled by General Motors at a plant in Tennessee. The decision was attributed to evolving market conditions and a desire to align its product portfolio with customer needs and long-term strategy. Production of another GM-built Honda EV, the Prologue, will continue in Mexico. Honda plans to launch a new all-electric Acura RSX, produced at its own facility in Ohio, in 2026, signaling a shift in its EV production strategy.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>This article breaks down the monthly costs of an $80,000 home equity loan following the Federal Reserve's recent interest rate cut, showing a slight decrease in payments compared to earlier in the year. For example, a 15-year loan at the current average rate of 8.31% would cost approximately $779 per month. While the savings are modest, the article notes that borrowing is now marginally more affordable. It advises homeowners to carefully calculate their potential payments and compare them with other borrowing options to determine if leveraging their home equity is the right financial move at this time.

          <p>A federal judge has dismissed a class-action lawsuit against The Hershey Company that claimed its Halloween-themed Reese's candies were deceptively packaged. The plaintiffs argued that the candies, such as peanut butter pumpkins and ghosts, lacked the detailed facial features depicted on the wrappers. However, the judge ruled that consumers failed to show they suffered economic harm, as the candies were not rendered "worthless" by their plain appearance. The ruling noted that disappointment with the product's aesthetics does not constitute a concrete injury, though the plaintiffs' attorney has stated they intend to amend the complaint.</p>

          <p>New research has found that advanced artificial intelligence models are now capable of passing the notoriously difficult Level III Chartered Financial Analyst (CFA) exam in minutes. The study, from NYU Stern and GoodFin, tested 23 large language models, finding that top-tier AIs could handle the complex analytical reasoning and essay questions that previously posed a challenge. While this technological leap demonstrates AI's growing capabilities in specialized professional fields, experts believe it will transform rather than replace human financial analysts. They note that AI currently lacks the ability to assess human context and intent, which remain critical skills.</p>

His conviction was overturned in 2022 after new DNA evidence not only cleared him but also identified the real perpetrator, who died in prison in 2020. Hastings' lawsuit demonstrated that an Inglewood police detective had falsified evidence and ignored information that corroborated his alibi. The settlement is believed to be the largest for a wrongful conviction in California's history.</p>

          <p>Sales of new single-family homes in the U.S. rose by a surprising 20.5% in August, reaching the fastest pace since early 2022. Analysts attribute the surge to builders offering significant price discounts and sales incentives to attract buyers in an otherwise stagnant housing market. Easing mortgage rates ahead of the Federal Reserve's recent cut also likely contributed to the increase in activity. However, economists caution that new home sales are a volatile metric and represent only a small fraction of the overall market, which remains constrained by broader affordability challenges.

          <p>The Financial Industry Regulatory Authority (FINRA) has approved a proposal to eliminate the $25,000 minimum equity rule for pattern day traders, a move that would make active trading more accessible to investors with smaller accounts. The long-standing rule, established during the dot-com bubble, required traders making four or more day trades in a five-day period to maintain a $25,000 balance. It will be replaced by an intraday margin rule based on the positions taken during the day. The change, which awaits SEC approval, reflects the evolution of technology and market access for retail investors. (not investment advice)</p>
