          <p>Colorado Rockies relief pitcher Jimmy Herget appeared at a postgame press conference wearing a T-shirt that read, "My Arm Hurts." The gesture was a lighthearted commentary on his recent heavy workload, having been called to pitch four times in a single week. Herget assured reporters that it was just a joke and that he felt fine, but the shirt humorously highlighted the physical demands placed on relief pitchers. The veteran has been a key part of the Rockies' bullpen this season despite the team's struggles in the NL West.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Chinese researchers are developing a concept for a hypersonic drone carrier that revives a "scissor wing" design once explored by NASA. The aircraft features a single, centrally mounted wing that rotates to optimize performance across different speeds, from subsonic to hypersonic. At low speeds, the wing is perpendicular to the fuselage for maximum lift, pivots to a 45-degree angle at transonic speeds to reduce drag, and aligns parallel to the body at Mach 5, turning the entire craft into a "waverider." This innovative design aims to solve the long-standing aerodynamic challenge of balancing low-speed efficiency with high-speed stability.</p>

          <p>Mike Conner, a former software CEO, has completed a five-year, multi-million-pound renovation of Thorne Island, a derelict 19th-century Napoleonic fort off the coast of Pembrokeshire, Wales. After purchasing the abandoned property for £555,000 in 2017, he undertook a massive project to make it habitable, which included installing running water and electricity. The historic fort is now a luxury space with 40 beds, en-suite bathrooms, and a nightclub, and is back on the market for £3 million. Conner hopes the unique, off-grid location will be used for events or as a tourist attraction.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>With food prices rising, parents in the UK are employing meticulous planning and creative cooking to manage the increased cost of feeding children during the summer school holidays. Strategies include buying reduced "yellow-sticker" items, especially meat, to freeze for later use and making frozen snacks from fruit and yogurt. Other tactics involve pre-portioning food for each day to prevent overconsumption and utilizing local food pantries that provide surplus groceries at a low cost. These efforts highlight the financial pressures many families face when subsidized school meals are unavailable, forcing them to be more resourceful with their budgets.</p>

Named the Gower Mausoleum, the modern structure offers crypts with expansive views of the city and is designed with marble and natural light to create a peaceful atmosphere. This vertical expansion is part of the cemetery's evolving role as a cultural hub, hosting movie nights, festivals, and yoga classes for the living. The new building provides permanent housing for approximately 13,000 people, blending practical death care needs with aesthetic design.</p>

          <p>A group of GCSE students in the UK have opened letters they wrote to their future selves as 11-year-olds back in March 2021, just after returning to school from a COVID-19 lockdown. The time capsule letters, organized by their teacher, reveal the students' fears about the pandemic, their hopes for the future, and their personal ambitions. Reading the letters four years later, the students reflected on their disrupted secondary school education and how they have grown since that uncertain time. The experience served as a poignant milestone as they prepared to receive their exam results, marking their perseverance through a challenging period.</p>

          <p>A new box set titled "Sunset Boulevard" captures the music Elvis Presley recorded in Los Angeles between 1972 and 1975, a period considered his last major burst of creativity before his death in 1977. The collection includes hits like "Burning Love" and soulful ballads such as "Separate Ways," reflecting his personal turmoil at the time. The article also recounts how a missed opportunity to co-star with Barbra Streisand in "A Star Is Born" in 1975 may have marked a turning point, leading to a decline in artistic focus. The set offers a poignant look at a legendary artist grappling with his place in a changing musical landscape.</p>

          <p>Samsung is gaining ground on Apple in the U.S. smartphone market, with its market share surging from 23% to 31% in the second quarter while Apple's declined. This renewed competition is largely driven by Samsung's innovation in screen technology, particularly with its popular Z Fold and Z Flip foldable phones. While Apple remains the market leader, Samsung's wider range of price points and novel form factors are attracting consumers. Analysts expect Apple to respond with potential plans for a slimmer iPhone and its own foldable device in the coming years to counter Samsung's momentum. (not investment advice)</p>
