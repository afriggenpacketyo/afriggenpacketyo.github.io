          <p>Investors are increasingly favoring short-term Treasury investments, mirroring a strategy employed by Warren Buffett's Berkshire Hathaway. The trend is driven by concerns and volatility in the market, with shorter-end maturities offering more stable yields.

These small, consistent actions build a foundation of trust and support. </p>
