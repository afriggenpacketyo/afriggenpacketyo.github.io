          <p>Ozeki Onosato secured the Emperor's Cup with a 14-1 record at the Summer Grand Sumo Tournament, despite losing his final match to yokozuna Hoshoryu. The 24-year-old wrestler, who had already clinched consecutive championships and promotion to yokozuna, aimed to be the first to achieve an undefeated grand tournament since 2021. Hoshoryu, however, disrupted Onosato's perfect run with a skillful overarm throw, preventing the perfect victory. Onosato expressed happiness with his overall performance and vowed to work harder for a flawless win next time, while the Japan Sumo Association is expected to formally recommend his promotion to yokozuna.</p>

        </div>
        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>A growing number of women in their 20s and 30s are seeking "baby Botox" injections, smaller doses intended to prevent aging, raising concerns among doctors. Dr. Michelle Hure, a dermatologist, attributes this trend to increased online presence and the influence of TikTok filters, leading to heightened self-scrutiny and dissatisfaction with natural appearances. She highlights the psychological risks of cosmetic procedures, including dependence and perception drift, where individuals pursue incremental tweaks until they appear unnatural. Dr. Hure emphasizes the ethical responsibility of medical professionals to discourage unnecessary procedures and prioritize patient well-being over financial incentives, cautioning against the normalization of injections in non-medical settings like department stores.</p>

          <p>A recent surge of executive orders and congressional actions has placed the nation's public lands at risk, prompting a debate over their future management. The federal government manages these resources as a "commons" for all Americans, but proposals to transfer public lands into private hands raise concerns about ecological consequences. Historically, privatization has led to environmental damage, prompting the establishment of federal management to protect ecosystems. Designations on public lands do not seize private property but change management practices, often prioritizing multiple use and allowing for activities like camping, hunting, and fishing.</p>
