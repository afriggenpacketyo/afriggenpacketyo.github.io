          <p>Two Delta Connection planes operated by Endeavor Air were involved in a low-speed collision on a taxiway at New York's LaGuardia Airport. The incident occurred when one plane, taxiing to its gate, struck another that was holding its position as instructed. One flight attendant sustained a minor injury, but there was no significant impact on airport operations, and all passengers were safely deplaned. The National Transportation Safety Board is investigating the circumstances surrounding the collision.</p>

          <p>Justin Halstenberg, a 35-year-old man from Norco, has been sentenced to 16 years to life in prison for starting the Line and Bacon fires in San Bernardino County. The Line Fire ultimately burned 44,000 acres, injured six firefighters, and destroyed or damaged seven structures. Investigators successfully identified Halstenberg's vehicle near the fire's origin point using an automatic license-plate reader, leading to his arrest. The district attorney praised the conviction, stating it ensures a serial arsonist will no longer threaten the community.</p>

          <p>A team from Purdue University is preparing an expedition to a remote Pacific island to examine what they believe could be the wreckage of Amelia Earhart's lost plane. Researchers identified a "visual anomaly" in a lagoon on Nikumaroro island using satellite imagery, an object that has been visible in photos since 1938, a year after her disappearance. The team plans to use sonar and magnetometers before attempting to dredge the object for identification. If confirmed, the discovery would solve one of aviation's most enduring mysteries.</p>

          <h2>Analysis Argues Amelia Earhart's Disappearance Was a Tragic Accident, Not a Conspiracy</h2>

          <p>This article argues that the enduring mystery surrounding Amelia Earhart's 1937 disappearance is fueled by a public appetite for conspiracy rather than evidence. The author asserts that the most credible explanation is that Earhart and navigator Fred Noonan simply ran out of fuel and crashed into the Pacific Ocean. The piece details how Earhart's public image was carefully crafted and how, after her death, her story was exploited for profit and propaganda, leading to persistent but unfounded theories of espionage and capture. The author contends that focusing on these myths dishonors her true legacy as a pioneering aviator.</p>

          <p>Warren Buffett's Berkshire Hathaway has agreed to purchase OxyChem, the petrochemical division of Occidental Petroleum, in a $9.7 billion all-cash deal. This transaction marks Berkshire's largest acquisition since 2022 and utilizes some of the conglomerate's massive cash reserves, which total nearly $344 billion. Occidental Petroleum plans to use $6.5 billion of the proceeds to reduce its corporate debt, a move its CEO believes will unlock stock value and allow for the resumption of a share buyback program. The deal is expected to close in the fourth quarter.</p>

          <div class="timestamp">2025-10-02 10:46:25 EDT</div>
        </div>
        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>This article explains the common cognitive error known as "low-price bias," where investors mistakenly believe a stock with a lower share price has more upside potential than a higher-priced one. Using the example of choosing between International Paper and a pre-split Nvidia, it demonstrates that a company's underlying fundamentals, valuation, and growth prospects are far more important than its nominal share price. The analysis emphasizes that true investing requires focusing on a company's real value, not the illusion of a bargain based on a low price per share. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>As the S&P 500 reaches new highs, some financial experts are advising investors to reconsider the passive "set-it-and-forget-it" strategy. They argue the index has become heavily concentrated in a few large-cap technology companies, making it less diversified than many assume and potentially more volatile. Instead of relying solely on market capitalization-weighted S&P 500 funds, experts suggest alternatives like total market index funds, equal-weighted funds, or adding exposure to small-cap, value, and international stocks to achieve a more balanced and resilient portfolio.

          <p>German Unity Day, celebrated annually on October 3, commemorates the formal reunification of East and West Germany in 1990. The date was chosen over November 9, the day the Berlin Wall fell, to avoid coinciding with the anniversary of the 1938 Nazi pogroms known as "Reichspogromnacht." The article explains that following World War II, Germany was divided for over four decades, with the peaceful revolution of 1989 paving the way for reunification. While a national holiday, celebrations are typically subdued, and polls suggest many Germans feel the country has not yet fully overcome its historical division.</p>

He cited stablecoins as an early example of this trend and believes that crypto technology and traditional finance will fully merge.

          <p>Following her death at age 91, this article reflects on primatologist Jane Goodall's legacy, focusing not just on her groundbreaking chimpanzee research but also on her profound commitment to animal rights. Goodall used her scientific stature to advocate for veganism and vocally oppose the practices of factory farming and invasive animal experimentation, which she called a "living hell." This stance often placed her at odds with the scientific mainstream, yet she remained a powerful voice for treating animals as beings with interiority and moral worth.

The delivery numbers narrowly beat analyst expectations. The quarter was marked by a sales slowdown in Europe, which was partially offset by a rush of U.S. buyers seeking to take advantage of a federal EV tax credit before it expired. The majority of vehicles produced and delivered were the popular Model 3 and Model Y. Tesla will provide a more detailed financial update to investors later in the month.</p>

Instead of conceding production capacity, Taiwan is seeking cooperation on supply chains and preferential tariff treatment.
