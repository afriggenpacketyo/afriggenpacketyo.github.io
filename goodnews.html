          <p>A fourth federal judge has ruled against President Trump's campaign targeting elite law firms, permanently blocking an executive order against Susman Godfrey. U.S. District Judge Loren AliKhan declared the order unconstitutional, a ruling consistent with three previous decisions against similar orders targeting other firms. These orders, seen as retaliation for representing clients Trump opposes, have been widely condemned by judges as an attack on the American legal system and the right to counsel.</p>

          <p>The California legislature has approved a measure to more than double the state's annual tax incentives for film and television production, raising the total to $750 million. The move, championed by Governor Gavin Newsom, aims to combat the exodus of productions to other states and countries offering more generous credits.

He argues that investors should look past the current negativity, citing CEO Tim Cook's leadership and the stock's history of rebounding from downturns. Cramer suggests that Apple's earnings growth rate justifies a higher valuation and that any significant dip in the stock price would represent a prime buying opportunity. (not investment advice)</p>
