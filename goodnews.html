        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>In her first television interview since joining the Supreme Court, Justice Amy Coney Barrett addressed criticisms regarding the court's perceived rightward shift and its role in checking executive power. She emphasized that her decisions are based on legal questions rather than political leanings, declining to comment on specific pending cases like those concerning presidential tariffs. Barrett also discussed her new book, "Listening to the Law," and reflected on the personal challenges and responsibilities of serving on the nation's highest court, including the landmark Dobbs decision which she contends returned the issue of abortion to the democratic process.</p>

          <p>Red Bull's Max Verstappen won the Italian Grand Prix at Monza, while McLaren's race strategy created controversy between its drivers. The team ordered Oscar Piastri to allow Lando Norris to pass him for second place, a decision made after a slow pit stop for Norris dropped him behind his teammate. Piastri expressed his disagreement but complied with the order, which the team justified by referencing a previous race where Norris had similarly aided Piastri. The outcome narrowed Piastri's championship lead over Norris to 31 points with eight races remaining in the season.</p>

          <p>New York Mets pitcher Jonah Tong shared a personal culinary preference that has captured the attention of baseball fans. In a recent interview, he revealed that he enjoys dipping his grilled cheese sandwiches in maple syrup, a tradition he learned from his grandfather. Tong described the combination as "unbelievable" and his favorite way to eat the classic sandwich. The Canadian-born player, who was drafted in 2022, recently made his major league debut for the Mets, adding a touch of personal flavor to his public profile beyond his performance on the mound.</p>

          <p>Annalena Baerbock, Germany's former foreign minister from the Green Party, has begun her one-year term as the President of the United Nations General Assembly. Her election was conducted via a secret ballot at Russia's request, a move interpreted as a response to her outspoken criticism of the war in Ukraine. Baerbock's nomination by Germany's previous government drew some domestic criticism, with some political figures questioning her diplomatic style and the decision to appoint her over a career diplomat. In her new role, she will chair meetings and help prepare for the election of the next UN Secretary-General.</p>

          <p>In an excerpt from her new memoir, "Listening to the Law," Supreme Court Justice Amy Coney Barrett recounts the challenging decision to accept President Trump's nomination in 2020. She describes the significant personal sacrifices required, including uprooting her family from their life in South Bend and facing intense public scrutiny and loss of privacy. Barrett shares that she and her husband agreed to "burn the boats," committing fully to the path ahead without second-guessing their choice. Despite her fears and reluctance, she ultimately accepted the nomination out of a deep belief in the rule of law and the importance of an independent judiciary.</p>

          <p>Artist and mycologist Sam Shoemaker completed a 12-hour, 26.4-mile ocean journey from Catalina Island to San Pedro, California, in a kayak he grew entirely from mycelium, the root network of mushrooms. The voyage aims to raise awareness about AquaFung, a biodegradable and buoyant material, as a sustainable alternative to plastics used in marine recreation. The project, supported by the arts organization Fulcrum Arts, represents a significant step in exploring innovative fungal materials. Shoemaker hopes his achievement will inspire further research and development in this nascent field, making his methodology publicly available to encourage others.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>An economic analysis suggests that while the Trump administration's elimination of the "de minimis" tariff exemption will affect some small businesses, widespread panic is unwarranted. The article argues that the majority of small businesses are service-based and will not be directly impacted by the change, which primarily affects those importing goods under $800. While acknowledging that tariffs lead to price increases, the author contends that the economy can likely absorb these costs as long as income and wealth continue to grow. Businesses are advised to adapt by diversifying suppliers and exploring alternative financing options for customers. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>United Airlines has announced an expansion of its winter flight schedule, adding new routes and increasing frequencies to 15 cities, including popular destinations like Las Vegas and Orlando. The move is strategically timed as competitor Spirit Airlines struggles with financial instability, having recently filed for bankruptcy and announced significant flight cuts. A United executive stated the additional flights are intended to provide customers with alternative options in case of disruptions from Spirit's situation. This expansion follows a similar move by Frontier Airlines, indicating a competitive push to capture market share from the ailing budget carrier.</p>

          <p>The U.S. Eagles have been eliminated from the Rugby World Cup on points differential, despite a commanding 60-0 victory against Samoa in their final pool match. Australia's subsequent 47-7 loss to England was not large enough to allow the U.S. to advance to the quarter-finals. While the team will be disappointed, the tournament showcased the emergence of promising young talent, such as 22-year-old flanker Freda Tafuna, who scored six tries in three games. The performance of these rising stars provides a sense of optimism for the future of the American team heading into the next World Cup cycle.</p>

          <p>According to pediatrician Dr. Daniel Golshevsky, establishing healthy sleep habits, or "sleep hygiene," in infancy is one of the most crucial things parents can do for their child's long-term health and success. These foundational habits are linked to better cognitive development, emotional regulation, and concentration in later years. Dr. Golshevsky advises parents to create a soothing environment that mimics the womb with warmth, darkness, and white noise, rather than complete silence. He also recommends involving both parents in settling the baby and maintaining a flexible routine to reduce stress and better interpret a baby's needs.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>This opinion article suggests that right-wing preppers, who prioritize self-sufficiency in case of societal collapse, should embrace solar power as the ideal energy source. The author contrasts the complexity and unreliability of storing and sourcing fossil fuels during a long-term crisis with the simplicity and durability of solar panels and batteries. Solar energy offers true independence, as it relies only on the sun and requires minimal maintenance, fitting perfectly with a hyper-individualist or conservative outlook. The piece argues that despite political polarization around climate issues, solar technology provides a practical, resilient solution for anyone concerned about emergency preparedness.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>An opinion piece argues that China's recent ramp-up of coal power does not signify a reversal of its climate policy but rather serves as a practical support system for its massive expansion of renewable energy. With solar capacity more than doubling in the first half of the year, the existing grid struggles with "curtailment," where clean energy is generated but cannot be used. Coal plants act as a shock absorber, ensuring grid stability and preventing blackouts during peak demand or when hydropower is reduced by drought. This backup capacity allows China to continue its aggressive build-out of renewables without risking energy security.</p>

          <p>Milda Mitkutė, co-founder of the online marketplace Vinted, shared the story of how the platform originated from her personal need to downsize her wardrobe before moving to a new apartment in 2008. What started as a simple website to sell her own excess clothing quickly grew through word-of-mouth, eventually expanding into Germany and beyond. The company, which became Lithuania's first tech "unicorn," faced a major crisis in 2016 after introducing a commission fee that nearly halted its growth. After scrapping the fee and investing in TV advertising, Vinted rebounded to become a dominant player in the second-hand fashion market.</p>
