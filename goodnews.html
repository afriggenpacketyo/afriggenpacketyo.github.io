          <p>Roger Blevins Jr., frontman for the band Mingo Fishtrap, is back on stage after a life-altering battle with tongue cancer diagnosed in 2022. The diagnosis required surgeons to remove most of his tongue, reconstructing it with tissue from his thigh, which forced him to relearn how to speak and sing. After a year of clear screenings, Blevins has not only returned to performing but has also co-founded a nonprofit called "The Tough Crowd Project" with his wife. The organization aims to provide financial aid and support to other families who are navigating the challenges of a cancer diagnosis.</p>

          <p>Amid rising credit card debt and high interest rates, many Americans are exploring debt relief strategies to manage their financial burdens. This article provides an overview of common methods, including debt consolidation, which combines multiple debts into a single loan, and credit counseling, which offers structured debt management plans. More aggressive options like debt settlement, where a reduced payoff amount is negotiated, and bankruptcy are also discussed. The article advises that debt relief is most suitable for those whose debts are growing faster than their payments or who face income disruptions, while cautioning consumers to understand the long-term credit implications.

          <p>Shares of online brokerage Robinhood experienced a significant rally after S&P Global announced its inclusion in the prestigious S&P 500 index, effective September 22. The move, which had been anticipated by Wall Street for months, is expected to drive substantial investment as passive funds that track the index are required to purchase the stock. Robinhood's stock has more than tripled in value year-to-date, marking a strong recovery from its post-IPO volatility. The company's addition to the benchmark index solidifies its position as a major player in the financial markets and reflects its recent profitability. (not investment advice)</p>

An Amber Alert was issued after the child's father, Dragan Antonesco, allegedly threatened the mother while his parents assaulted her and took the infant from a Target store. Authorities reported the family was believed to be heading to Chicago. The child was rescued over seven hours later when an Arizona state trooper recognized the suspect vehicle from the alert and conducted a traffic stop, leading to the safe recovery of the boy and the cancellation of the alert.</p>

          <p>A new mural by the anonymous street artist Banksy has been discovered on an external wall of the Royal Courts of Justice in London. The artwork depicts a judge in a wig and robe striking a protester on the ground, with blood spattering from their placard. Banksy confirmed the work on Instagram, and its appearance follows recent mass arrests at a protest in the city. The mural was quickly covered with plastic sheeting by authorities, who cited the building's listed status, which requires its original character to be maintained. The police are investigating the incident as a report of criminal damage.</p>

          <p>This article details the primary factors that lenders consider when determining the terms of a personal loan offer, which many consumers use to consolidate high-interest debt. A strong credit score and a clean credit history are paramount, as they typically unlock lower interest rates. Lenders also closely evaluate a borrower's debt-to-income (DTI) ratio to assess their ability to manage new payments. Additionally, the desired loan amount, the length of the repayment term, and the stability of the applicant's employment and income play significant roles in shaping the final offer. Comparing offers from different types of lenders is recommended to secure the best possible terms.</p>
