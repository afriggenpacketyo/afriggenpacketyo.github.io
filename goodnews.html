          <p>The Los Angeles Dodgers are poised to achieve a historic milestone, surpassing 4 million in home game attendance for the first time in the franchise's history. Having led Major League Baseball in attendance every year since 2013, the team's success has been bolstered by a star-studded roster, including the addition of global superstar Shohei Ohtani. This landmark achievement reflects the team's sustained on-field dominance and robust business operations under Guggenheim ownership. The high attendance figures provide the Dodgers with significant ticket revenue, which, combined with a lucrative local television contract, helps finance one of the highest payrolls in professional sports.</p>

          <p>Nvidia has announced a landmark $5 billion investment in Intel, forming a strategic collaboration to co-develop chips for AI data centers and personal computers. This partnership provides a significant boost to Intel, which has struggled to keep pace in the AI era and recently saw the U.S. government take a 10% stake in the company. The deal will see the two Silicon Valley giants work to connect their respective architectures, with Intel producing custom CPUs for Nvidia's AI platforms. The announcement caused Intel's stock to surge nearly 23%, its largest one-day gain since 1987, signaling strong investor optimism about the collaboration's potential. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>The popular Pfeiffer Falls Trail in California's Big Sur region has reopened after being closed for over a year due to storm damage. The trail, which offers a scenic walk to a 60-foot waterfall, has a history of closures, including a nearly 13-year shutdown following a major fire in 2008. Most recently, a pedestrian bridge on the route was destroyed when a massive redwood tree collapsed during a 2023 storm. Crews have now repaired the bridge using a stronger, fiber-reinforced polymer, hoping to make the structure more resilient against the fragile region's frequent landslides and severe weather. The reopening is a welcome development for the park, which attracts 750,000 visitors annually.</p>

          <p>President Trump's state visit to the UK was marked by elaborate pageantry and warm personal interactions with both the Royal Family and Prime Minister Keir Starmer. However, an analysis suggests that while the trip solidified a positive diplomatic relationship, it did little to increase Britain's actual influence on U.S. policy. A White House official frankly stated the visit would have no impact on American positions regarding trade or international affairs. Despite this, the cordiality may have diplomatic benefits, allowing the UK to maintain a stable relationship and avoid the punitive tariffs or public criticism that Trump has directed at other nations, even while disagreeing on issues like Palestinian statehood.</p>

          <p>Shares of cybersecurity firm CrowdStrike jumped nearly 13% after the company presented highly optimistic long-term financial guidance at its investor day. The company announced plans to reach $10 billion in annual recurring revenue (ARR) by 2031 and to double that figure to $20 billion by 2036. This confident outlook, combined with recent announcements of an AI security acquisition and a partnership with Salesforce, was well-received by Wall Street. The strong performance reflects the broader trend of increased investment in the cybersecurity sector as businesses seek to defend against sophisticated threats in the age of artificial intelligence.
