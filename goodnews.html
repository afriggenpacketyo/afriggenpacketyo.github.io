          <p>A federal judge in Maryland has issued a fourth court decision blocking President Trump's executive order that seeks to deny citizenship to children born in the U.S. to parents who are in the country illegally or on temporary visas. U.S. District Judge Deborah Boardman granted a preliminary injunction, arguing the plaintiffs were highly likely to succeed in their claim that the order violates the 14th Amendment. The Trump administration contends the amendment's citizenship clause does not apply to these children, but courts have consistently blocked the policy. This ruling certifies a nationwide class of affected children, preventing the order from taking effect.</p>

          <p>Actress Gina Carano has reached a settlement with Disney and Lucasfilm regarding her lawsuit for wrongful termination from the Disney+ series 'The Mandalorian'. Carano was fired in 2021 after making controversial social media posts, including one comparing the political climate for Republicans to the persecution of Jews during the Holocaust. The terms of the settlement have not been disclosed, but Carano expressed hope that it would bring "healing to the force." Her lawsuit, which sought $75,000 in damages and reinstatement, was financially supported by Elon Musk as part of his initiative to fund cases against alleged workplace discrimination.</p>

          <p>California Governor Gavin Newsom has stated that the University of California should not yield to pressure from the Trump administration in negotiations to restore over half a billion dollars in frozen federal research grants for UCLA. The funding was suspended amid allegations of antisemitism on campus. Newsom criticized recent settlements made by Columbia and Brown universities, which involved large payments and concessions, urging UC to avoid a similar outcome. The governor emphasized the importance of principles and academic freedom, expressing confidence that the university system will "do the right thing" and not compromise its values.</p>

          <p>The Southern Small White butterfly, a species typically found in Southern Europe, has been officially sighted in the United Kingdom for the first time. The discovery was made at Landguard Bird Observatory in Suffolk by a volunteer who photographed the female butterfly. Experts have been tracking the species' rapid northward expansion across Europe over the past two decades, with its range extending from the Alps to the Netherlands. While a warming climate is considered a contributing factor to its migration, it is not yet certain if the species will establish a permanent breeding population in the UK.</p>

          <p>The U.S. government is auctioning the Amadea, a luxurious 348-foot superyacht valued at over $300 million, which was seized from a sanctioned Russian oligarch. The vessel, currently docked in San Diego, features eight staterooms, a glass elevator, a mosaic pool, a helideck, and a marble fireplace. The Justice Department maintains the yacht was owned by Suleiman Kerimov, who was sanctioned in 2018 for his role in advancing Russia's malign activities. The sealed-bid auction requires a $10 million deposit, with the sale intended to put pressure on Russian elites close to President Vladimir Putin.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>A growing number of people, particularly millennials and Gen Z, are moving away from dating apps and embracing old-fashioned, in-person singles events. Organizers of event series like Date Cincy report rising attendance, as users grow tired of the limitations and potential for misrepresentation in online dating. This trend aligns with market data showing a decline in the value of companies like Bumble and a 42% increase in attendance at singles events last year. Couples who have met at these events credit their success to the ability to connect face-to-face and gauge chemistry in a way that apps cannot replicate.</p>

          <p>Pharmaceutical company Eli Lilly has announced that its experimental oral GLP-1 medication, orforglipron, successfully helped adults with obesity achieve significant weight loss in a Phase 3 clinical trial. Participants lost an average of 27.3 pounds over 72 weeks, with an efficacy and safety profile consistent with existing injectable therapies like Zepbound. The most common side effects reported were gastrointestinal issues such as nausea and diarrhea. Eli Lilly plans to submit the drug for FDA approval later this year, potentially making a more accessible and convenient pill-based option available to consumers by 2026.</p>
