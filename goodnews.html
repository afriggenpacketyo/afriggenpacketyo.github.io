          <p>SpaceX successfully launched the Axiom-4 (Ax-4) mission, sending a four-person crew to the International Space Station (ISS). The crew includes retired NASA astronaut Peggy Whitson, who is now with Axiom Space, as well as Shubhanshu Shukla of India, S≈Çawosz Uzna≈Ñski-Wi≈õniewski of Poland, and Tibor Kapu of Hungary, marking the return to human spaceflight for India, Poland, and Hungary after over four decades. The mission experienced delays due to weather and concerns about a leak in the ISS's Russian-controlled module. The crew will spend approximately two weeks on the ISS, conducting around 60 science experiments and engaging with students worldwide. The launch was made possible via the SpaceX Dragon capsule on a Falcon 9 rocket, with the crew planning to splash down off the coast of southern California upon their return. The Dragon is the only U.S. spacecraft certified by NASA to take astronauts to the space station.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>As summer brings record high temperatures, it's crucial to differentiate between heat exhaustion and heat stroke and know how to respond. Heat exhaustion, less severe than heat stroke, can lead to the more serious condition if not properly managed, with symptoms including headache, fatigue, nausea, and cool skin. Treatment involves moving to a cool place, drinking water, and applying cold cloths, while heat stroke is a life-threatening condition characterized by impaired consciousness, high body temperature, and potential organ damage. Immediate medical attention is necessary for heat stroke, involving cooling the body and providing fluids, with prevention strategies including avoiding excessive sun exposure, staying hydrated, and wearing appropriate clothing.</p>

Chinese Premier Li Qiang urged more trade for "reshaping" the world order, signaling China's deepening relationship with the Global South, as the U.S.'s tariff policies act as a wake-up call for the need to diversify markets.

They can bring a friend or family member to immigration court, but must be wary of collateral arrests.

          <p>Wimbledon will introduce electronic line calling for the first time in its 148-year history, replacing line judges. This change marks a shift from tradition, as line judges have been an iconic part of the Wimbledon experience. While some traditionalists will miss the human element, technology fans will point to the increased accuracy and efficiency of the new system. The move aligns Wimbledon with other tournaments that have already adopted electronic line calling.</p>

          <p>A Chinese-led study suggests that the world's energy demands in 2050 could be met by an interconnected global solar-wind energy system. The study claims that this interconnected system would produce three times the amount of power needed at a lower cost than independent regional systems. Researchers suggest this network would draw on regions with abundant renewable energy potential to provide energy across continents to areas with high needs, noting that successful global interconnection could improve energy efficiency and ease the economic burden of decarbonization.</p>

          <p>Antoinette Lattouf, an Australian journalist, won her case against the Australian Broadcasting Corporation (ABC), with a court ruling that she was unfairly sacked over a social media post about the war in Gaza. Lattouf claimed the ABC cut short her stint as a fill-in radio presenter due to her political views, her race, and lobbying from pro-Israel groups. The court found that the ABC sacked Lattouf for reasons including her opinions on the Israeli military campaign in Gaza, awarding her damages of A$70,000.</p>
