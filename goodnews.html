        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Despite a broader slowdown in luxury spending, wealthy shoppers continue to splurge on high-end jewelry, but are becoming increasingly selective, favoring top brands. This trend benefits Swiss luxury group Richemont, known for its prestigious jewelry brands like Van Cleef & Arpels and Cartier. Richemont reported strong fourth-quarter sales, driven by an 11% growth in its Jewellery Maisons division. According to Bernstein's Luca Solca, Richemont's jewelry brands maintain a leading position in consumer desirability, despite efforts from competitors like LVMH to challenge this dominance.

          <p>A rare and intense dust storm swept across northwest Indiana and north-central Illinois, plunging the region into near-total darkness during the day. The National Weather Service issued dust storm warnings, a first for Chicago, as visibility dropped to less than a quarter-mile in minutes. The storm, originating near Bloomington, Illinois, was fueled by strong winds from thunderstorms lifting dust from exceptionally dry soil. Such storms, known as haboobs, are more common in desert regions, making this event particularly unusual for the area.</p>

          <p>Clayton Kershaw made his season debut for the Dodgers after recovering from a toe injury, but struggled through four innings in an 11-9 loss to the Angels. Kershaw, who reflected on the significance of his return, gave up three runs in the first inning before settling down, ultimately allowing two runs over the next three innings. Despite the uneven outing, manager Dave Roberts noted positive signs, including increased velocity, but acknowledged Kershaw's command was inconsistent. The Dodgers, currently missing several starters due to injuries, hoped for a stronger performance from the veteran pitcher.</p>

          <p>Britain and the European Union are cautiously moving towards renewed cooperation, highlighted by a summit in London expected to yield a defense pact and relaxed trade rules. This rapprochement is driven by President Trump's America, whose shift away from global leadership on defense and free trade has prompted both partners to address shared challenges. Despite lingering disputes over fishing rights and youth travel, the summit underscores a commitment to working together in an increasingly uncertain geopolitical landscape. This new relationship signifies a strategic realignment in response to America's changing role on the world stage.</p>

          <p>Chinese researchers have developed a fiber-optic gyroscope that offers enhanced stability across a wide temperature range, making it suitable for use in aircraft, ships, and oil rigs. This gyroscope, created by the Tianjin Navigation Instruments Research Institute and Jinan University, provides a more reliable means of measuring orientation and turning rates, crucial for inertial navigation systems. Unlike traditional gyroscopes with moving parts, fiber-optic gyroscopes use light in optical fibers, offering simplicity, high resolution, and immunity to interference, vital for military and civilian applications.</p>

          <p>High demand for live shows in China is driving a trend of "concert tourism," where fans travel across the country to attend concerts and music festivals. Local governments are capitalizing on this trend by bundling concert tickets with discounted hotel stays, dining, and tourist attractions to boost domestic consumption. This strategy aligns with Beijing's focus on increasing domestic spending amid trade tensions. Shily Zhou, a Shanghai resident, traveled twice in five months to see her favorite singer, benefiting from discounts on tourist sites offered with her concert ticket.</p>
