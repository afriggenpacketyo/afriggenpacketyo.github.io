        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>A federal judge issued a temporary restraining order blocking the Trump administration from deporting unaccompanied Guatemalan migrant children without a deportation order. This ruling came hours after lawyers alleged a hurried government effort to deport hundreds of children, with planes already prepared for departure from Texas. The judge deemed the action "extraordinary" given the timing, ensuring children would be returned to the custody of the Department of Health and Human Services while their legal protections are reviewed. This decision temporarily safeguards vulnerable minors from immediate repatriation.</p>

          <p>The article highlights the enduring reverence in China for the American Volunteer Group, known as the Flying Tigers, who fought alongside China during World War II. Despite current US-China tensions, the descendants of the Flying Tigers' founder are among the few Americans invited to China's WWII commemoration parade. These American pilots, who destroyed numerous Japanese planes, are remembered as heroes, symbolizing a historical bond between the two nations. This unique historical perspective contrasts sharply with contemporary geopolitical friction.</p>

          <p>Canadensys Aerospace is developing Canada's inaugural lunar rover, a key component of NASA's Artemis program, designed to explore the Moon's south polar region. The 35kg rover, scheduled for a 2029 launch, aims to locate water and measure radiation levels, preparing for future manned missions. This endeavor represents Canada's first-ever planetary exploration lead, building on its history in space technology. Engineers face significant challenges, including extreme lunar temperatures and the abrasive regolith, as they work to make the Moon a potential base for further space exploration.</p>

          <p>England has launched the final phase of its largest-ever childcare expansion, providing 30 hours of government-funded care per week for children aged nine months to four years. While Prime Minister Sir Keir Starmer hails it as a "landmark moment" for working families, parents report long waiting lists and nurseries struggle with staff shortages and capacity. The sector needs an estimated 35,000 more staff, and funding rates for providers are often lower than costs, leading to increased fees for "extras." This initiative aims to support parents but faces significant implementation hurdles.</p>

          <p>The global craze for matcha has led to unprecedented demand, causing supply shortages and soaring prices in Japan, where the green tea has been consumed for centuries. Exports of Japanese green tea, particularly powdered matcha, have quadrupled in a decade, with the U.S. being a major market. To address the strain on aging farming communities, the Japanese government is considering subsidizing farmers to grow more tencha, the labor-intensive tea used for matcha. The boom presents both opportunities and challenges for producers, who worry about future harvests and maintaining quality.</p>
