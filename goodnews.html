          <p>Organizers of the Great North Run have issued a humorous apology after the medals and T-shirts for the event mistakenly featured an aerial view of the rival city of Sunderland and the River Wear. The half marathon, which runs through Newcastle and along the River Tyne, was completed by approximately 60,000 runners who received the erroneous memorabilia. Despite the geographical blunder, which many participants found amusing, organizers have embraced the mistake as a celebration of the entire region. The incident has been dubbed a unique keepsake that will likely be remembered for years to come.</p>

          <p>Johns Hopkins University's School of Nursing is providing a free doula program, known as Birth Companions, to support expecting mothers in the Baltimore area. Nursing students are trained to offer informational, emotional, and physical support during labor, acting as advocates for patients without replacing medical staff. The initiative, now in its 27th year, aims to provide a more supportive birth experience and has become more accessible following a new Maryland law. This law requires hospitals to permit certified doulas during childbirth, ensuring mothers can utilize these valuable services.</p>

          <p>A business-led initiative to repeal a $30 per hour minimum wage for hotel and airport workers in Los Angeles has failed to qualify for the ballot after falling short on signature requirements. The ordinance, approved by the City Council, mandates phased wage increases culminating in $30 per hour by 2028. Labor groups hailed the failure of the repeal effort as a major victory for working people against corporate interests. The conflict over this wage law has sparked a broader battle in the city, with unions and business groups proposing competing ballot measures on topics ranging from business taxes to city-wide minimum wage.</p>

The company announced a $250 million private placement to fund the acquisition of the token associated with Sam Altman's biometric identity project. Ives stated his belief that Worldcoin will become the standard for human authentication in the age of AI, justifying the move beyond a typical token strategy. This follows a growing trend of public companies adopting cryptocurrency treasury strategies to potentially enhance shareholder value.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>With U.S. credit card debt exceeding $1.21 trillion and interest rates at historic highs, many consumers are seeking tailored solutions beyond generic advice. The article outlines three primary avenues for personalized help: credit counseling agencies, debt relief experts, and direct negotiation with card issuers. Credit counselors offer comprehensive financial analysis and can set up debt management plans with lower interest rates. Debt relief companies negotiate directly with creditors to potentially reduce the total amount owed, while issuers may offer hardship programs to those who proactively seek assistance.</p>

          <p>The Metropolitan Water District is offering a significant financial incentive for Southern California businesses and public institutions to remove nonfunctional lawns. A new rebate program provides $7 per square foot for replacing thirsty turf with water-efficient, sustainable landscapes, more than doubling the previous offer. The initiative aims to encourage water conservation ahead of a 2027 state law that will prohibit using potable water on such lawns. To qualify, projects must include features like stormwater retention and a minimum number of drought-tolerant plants, promoting biodiversity and environmental benefits.</p>

          <p>An article reflects on the routine and often unexciting nature of England's World Cup qualifying matches, despite the team's dominant record in such games. England has lost only four qualifiers in the last 30 years, yet matches against smaller nations like Andorra often lack jeopardy and fail to capture fan excitement. The piece notes that while these victories are expected, they rarely provide a true measure of the team's capabilities ahead of major tournaments, where they often face disappointment. The commentary suggests that the predictable nature of these games has become a contractual obligation rather than a compelling sporting spectacle.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Two independent audit reports have found no evidence of misuse of funds by the disaster-relief charity FireAid, which had faced scrutiny over its distribution of nearly $100 million raised for wildfire victims. The reports, including one by law firm Latham & Watkins, affirmed that the charity acted according to its mission and that aid is reaching affected communities in Southern California. The organization was criticized by some politicians and residents for giving grants to established nonprofits rather than direct payments to individuals. The findings conclude that this approach was consistently communicated and effectively implemented to provide swift relief.</p>

          <p>Hamas has announced it is reviewing 'ideas' from the United States, delivered via mediators, aimed at securing a ceasefire agreement in Gaza. This development follows a statement from President Trump urging the group to accept terms he claimed Israel had already agreed to, issuing a 'last warning.' According to a Palestinian official, the U.S. proposal includes a 60-day truce where all hostages would be released in exchange for Palestinian prisoners. The framework also reportedly involves negotiations on a permanent end to the war and the formation of an independent body to govern Gaza.</p>

Each ticket holder can choose between a lump sum of $410.3 million or an annuitized prize of $893.5 million before taxes. The winner in Texas will have a significant tax advantage, as the state does not levy an income tax on lottery winnings. In contrast, the Missouri winner will face a mandatory 4% state tax withholding on top of the 24% federal withholding, potentially resulting in a substantially smaller take-home prize.</p>

        </div>
        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>As the average rate for a 30-year fixed mortgage approaches a one-year low, prospective homebuyers can take steps to secure even better terms. Experts advise focusing on improving one's credit score, as higher scores directly translate to lower interest rates. Making a larger down payment, ideally 20% or more, can also lead to more favorable loan terms and eliminate the need for private mortgage insurance. Additionally, borrowers should consider alternatives to the traditional 30-year fixed loan, such as adjustable-rate mortgages (ARMs), which currently offer lower initial rates.</p>
