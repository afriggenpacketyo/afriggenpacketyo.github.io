          <h2>Rent Payments Rarely Boost Credit Scores Despite Trillions Paid</h2>

        </div>
        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>While Americans pay trillions in rent annually, few receive a credit score boost because rent payments are not commonly reported to credit bureaus. Wemimo Abbey, CEO of Esusu, highlights that over $5.3 trillion is being left on the table, as only 20% of landlords report rent payments. This financial inequity disproportionately affects minorities and immigrants, who are more likely to be "credit invisible." Esusu partners with rental companies to increase rent reporting, aiming to establish credit scores for more Americans and promote financial inclusion. Esusu charges a monthly fee of $2.50 to report timely payment on the renter's behalf, and the record of the amount paid is expected to show up roughly 30 days after it's been paid.</p>

          <p>Gold has risen to become the world's second-largest reserve asset, driven by central banks' increasing appetite for the precious metal, according to an ECB report. Central banks' gold stockpiles are near levels last seen in the 1960s, making it second only to the U.S. dollar in value terms. Emerging and developing countries are increasingly attracted to gold due to concerns about sanctions and the potential erosion of major currencies. While gold prices have recently experienced choppiness, analysts suggest that central bank purchases may cool in the coming months (not investment advice).</p>
