          <p>Tech giants Nvidia and AMD have agreed to an unprecedented deal to pay the U.S. government 15% of their revenue from specific chip sales in China. This arrangement is part of a deal to secure export licenses for advanced artificial intelligence chips, such as Nvidia's H20, which were previously restricted due to national security concerns. While the move signals easing trade tensions between the U.S. and China, some analysts question how a payment resolves the underlying security issues. The agreement places significant financial pressure on the companies but allows them to compete in the vast Chinese market. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>The UK Home Office is expanding its policy to deport foreign criminals before their appeals are heard, adding 15 new countries, including India and Canada, to the scheme. This "deport now, appeal later" initiative allows the government to expel foreign nationals whose human rights claims have been refused, with appeals conducted via video link from their home countries. Home Secretary Yvette Cooper stated the measure aims to prevent offenders from exploiting the immigration system and to fast-track removals. The move is part of a broader government strategy to toughen its stance on foreign criminals and increase public safety.</p>

          <p>The Los Angeles Sparks clinched a thrilling 94-91 victory against the Seattle Storm, thanks to a game-winning layup by Dearica Hamby with just 5.6 seconds remaining. The game was an intense, back-and-forth battle, with the Sparks rallying from a 16-point first-quarter deficit to secure their ninth win in eleven games. Kelsey Plum was instrumental in the comeback, finishing with 20 points, seven assists, and six rebounds, demonstrating her versatile impact on the court. The hard-fought win strengthens the Sparks' position in the WNBA playoff race as the team continues to build momentum with its competitive and hungry young roster.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>The UK government is preparing a significant overhaul of road safety laws for England and Wales, which could see motorists over 70 banned for failing compulsory triennial eye tests. The new strategy, expected in the autumn, also proposes lowering the drink-drive limit to match Scotland's stricter standard and introducing penalty points for passengers not wearing seatbelts. These potential changes follow a coroner's report that labeled the UK's driver licensing system the "laxest in Europe" regarding eyesight checks. The government aims to reduce the high number of road fatalities and injuries, which cost the NHS over £2 billion annually.</p>

          <p>While mature black holes are known for letting nothing escape, newly formed black holes exhibit a unique phenomenon described as a form of "music." During their formation, such as from a star's collapse, the resulting distortion in space-time quickly settles into a stable, mathematically perfect shape. This process generates vibrations, or gravitational waves, that ring out as the black hole stabilizes. These "good vibrations" offer a way to study these enigmatic objects in their infancy. Scientists anticipate that future observations will allow them to experience this strange, pure cosmic music, providing new insights into the fundamental laws of physics.</p>

          <div class="timestamp">2025-08-10 22:00:08 EDT</div>
        </div>
        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>China has introduced a nationwide childcare subsidy program, offering families 3,600 yuan (US$501) annually for each child under three years old. While the amount is uniform, its impact is expected to vary significantly across different economic regions. In poorer provinces like Gansu, the subsidy represents a substantial portion of the average resident's income (over 13.5%), whereas in affluent cities like Shanghai, it accounts for just 4.1%. This structure means the policy is likely to provide a more significant boost to consumption and potentially birth rates in less affluent, rural areas, where the financial support will be felt more acutely.

          <p>SoftBank founder Masayoshi Son is making his most significant strategic bet yet, positioning the Japanese conglomerate to lead the artificial intelligence revolution. Son predicts that artificial superintelligence (ASI), which he defines as AI 10,000 times smarter than humans, will arrive within a decade. To capitalize on this, SoftBank has made massive investments across the AI ecosystem, including its landmark acquisition of chip designer Arm and a planned $32.7 billion investment in OpenAI. This aggressive strategy aims to create a deeply integrated AI ecosystem, replicating the monumental success of Son's early investment in Alibaba and securing the company's long-term future.

          <p>English golfer Justin Rose secured his first PGA Tour victory in over two years, winning the St. Jude Championship in a dramatic three-hole playoff against American JJ Spaun. After both players finished at 16-under-par, they went to a sudden-death playoff where they matched each other on the first two holes. Rose ultimately clinched the title with a birdie on the third playoff hole. The victory was a disappointment for fellow Englishman Tommy Fleetwood, who had entered the final round with the lead but finished one stroke behind, tied for third. For Rose, the win marked his 12th PGA Tour title.</p>

          <p>The UK government has introduced new measures to help newly qualified nurses and midwives in England find employment, addressing a situation where there are significantly more graduates than available vacancies. The plan aims to cut red tape, allowing NHS trusts to hire more easily, including recruiting based on anticipated future needs rather than waiting for formal vacancies. The Royal College of Nursing welcomed the initiative but stated the true test will be whether graduates can actually secure jobs. While the move is intended to support the healthcare workforce, questions remain about how it will be funded, as NHS trust budgets are already under severe pressure. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>Trey Lance is making a strong case in the competition for the Los Angeles Chargers' backup quarterback position, seemingly closing the gap with Taylor Heinicke. In a 27-13 preseason victory over the New Orleans Saints, Lance showcased his dual-threat ability, rushing for 48 yards and a touchdown while completing seven passes. His performance, which demonstrated growing confidence and playmaking ability, earned praise from coach Jim Harbaugh. In contrast, Heinicke, the presumed backup, appeared rusty in his first preseason action, completing only one of five passes. Lance's continued development is a key storyline for the Chargers as they evaluate their roster depth.</p>
