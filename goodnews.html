          <p>Top trade officials from the U.S. and China met in London to address the ongoing trade dispute, focusing on restoring flows of critical minerals and easing export controls. The U.S. delegation, including Treasury Secretary Scott Bessent, Commerce Secretary Howard Lutnick, and Trade Representative Jamieson Greer, aimed to secure confirmation from China regarding the Geneva agreement. National Economic Council Director Kevin Hassett expressed optimism for a short meeting with a strong handshake, anticipating immediate easing of U.S. export controls and release of rare earths in volume. These talks follow heightened trade tensions and uncertainty after previous tariff escalations, with both sides accusing each other of violating the Geneva agreement.

          <p>A New York Federal Reserve survey indicated that Americans' inflation fears receded in May as President Trump eased some tariff proposals. The one-year inflation outlook decreased to 3.2%, with the three-year outlook falling to 3% and the five-year forecast to 2.6%. National Economic Council Director Kevin Hassett noted that inflation has decreased while tariff revenue has increased. The survey showed expectations dipping across most price groups, with respondents also expressing increased confidence in the stock market.

          <p>The article addresses common questions lenders receive about home equity borrowing, including the difference between HELOCs and home equity loans, borrowing limits, rates, fees, and permissible uses of funds. HELOCs offer a line of credit with variable interest rates, while home equity loans provide a lump sum with fixed rates. Borrowing limits typically range from 80% to 90% of a home's value minus the mortgage balance. Interest rates depend on credit score, loan-to-value ratio, and loan term. Funds can be used for various purposes, including debt consolidation, home renovations, and investments.

Yusuf stepped down from the role last week shortly after saying it was "dumb" for MP Sarah Pochin to call for a burka ban. Farage said Yusuf had "lost his rag" and "plunged us into a difficult place". Speaking to the BBC earlier in the day, Yusuf had said he regretted his social media post and that "exhaustion led to a poor decision". Having served as chair of the party for eleven months, Yusuf will now lead the party's Doge unit, a team inspired by the US Department of Government Efficiency, set up by President Donald Trump and Elon Musk.

          <p>Glendale has announced it will end its contract to hold Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE) detainees, ending an 18-year agreement amid rising tensions over immigration raids in Los Angeles. The city stated the decision reflects its core values: public safety, transparency, and community trust. This action follows reports that Glendale continued its ICE contract despite California's SB 54, which prohibits local municipalities from using funds for federal immigration enforcement. The city maintained its agreement complied with state law but recognized the divisive public perception of the ICE contract. The decision has garnered support from immigrant rights advocacy groups.</p>
