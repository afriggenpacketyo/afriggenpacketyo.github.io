          <p>An article in Vox explores the growing conservative opposition to lab-grown meat, despite its potential to alleviate the cruelty of industrial agriculture. While some opposition stems from the economic interests of livestock farmers, the author argues that the resistance is also rooted in cultural grievances and a fear that lab-grown meat could eventually lead to bans on traditional meat production. The author contends that such fears are misguided, as the market would ultimately determine the success of lab-grown meat, and widespread adoption would require it to be both tastier and cheaper than conventional alternatives.</p>

Despite this, U.S. District Judge Allison Burroughs said she plans to issue a preliminary injunction that prohibits the Trump administration from revoking Harvard's SEVP certification without first going through the legally required procedure.

          <p>Jim Cramer of CNBC's Investing Club suggests that the recent dip in GE Vernova's stock price may present a buying opportunity for new investors. This recommendation comes after Jefferies downgraded GE Vernova to a hold from buy, citing valuation concerns after the stock's surge to record highs. While the Investing Club also downgraded GE Vernova to a hold-equivalent rating, Cramer believes the recent pullback provides an entry point for those who missed the initial rally. The article also mentions upcoming earnings from Costco and potential caution due to trade policy uncertainty.</p>

          <p>Boeing CEO Kelly Ortberg announced that airplane deliveries to China will resume next month after a pause due to trade tensions. Ortberg dismissed the impact of tariffs, noting that Boeing is paying tariffs on imported components from Italy and Japan for its Dreamliner planes, but much of it can be recouped when the planes are exported again. The company is also planning to ramp up production of its 737 Max aircraft. China has now indicated they will accept deliveries, with the first deliveries scheduled for next month, he told a Bernstein conference on Thursday.</p>
