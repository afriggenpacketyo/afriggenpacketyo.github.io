          <p>A robotic Soviet spacecraft, Kosmos-482, launched in 1972 and intended for Venus, is expected to re-enter Earth‚Äôs atmosphere after 53 years adrift in space. Due to a rocket malfunction, it remained in Earth orbit and has been slowly spiraling back. Experts predict re-entry on Friday or Saturday, but the exact location remains unknown, though it is estimated to be between 52 degrees north and south latitude. While the spacecraft is expected to mostly burn up upon re-entry, some parts could survive impact, and legally belong to Russia if recovered.</p>

The couple found a journal entry by Maribeth expressing gratitude for her loving family, which inspired them to continue fostering children despite their grief. Kari Cox stated that 'Their need was greater than my pain,' reflecting the couple's commitment to providing a loving home for children in need.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>California public health officials have announced an annual statewide mussel quarantine effective through October 31, warning against eating sport-harvested mussels due to naturally occurring toxins. Mussels may contain paralytic shellfish poisoning and domoic acid biotoxins, which can be deadly and have no known antidotes. The quarantine area spans the entire California coastline, but commercially grown mussels from certified companies are exempt due to regular testing. Symptoms of poisoning include tingling lips, loss of balance, and muscular paralysis, with death possible within 30 minutes.</p>

          <h2>Study Links Left-Handedness to Higher Risk of Certain Neurological Disorders</h2>
          <div class="timestamp">2025-05-09 20:15:01 EDT</div>
        </div>
        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>A new study indicates that left-handedness may be associated with certain neurological disorders, particularly those affecting language or neurodevelopment. Researchers found that individuals with autism are 3.5 times more likely to be left-handed, and atypical handedness is also more common in people with schizophrenia and intellectual disability. The study suggests a potential link between handedness and brain organization, with language functions often divided between both sides of the brain in left-handed individuals. While the study highlights correlations, experts caution that it does not establish causation and call for further research.</p>

          <p>Tufts University student Rumeysa Ozturk, a doctoral candidate from Turkey, was released from an immigration detention facility in Louisiana following a judge's order citing violations of her First Amendment rights. She was arrested after co-authoring an opinion piece critical of Israel, leading to accusations of a crackdown on pro-Palestinian voices on US campuses. The Department of Homeland Security accused her of supporting Hamas, but the judge found the only evidence against her was the op-ed, sparking nationwide protests against her detention. The ACLU hailed the ruling as a victory for free speech, while Tufts University expressed pleasure at her return to campus.</p>
