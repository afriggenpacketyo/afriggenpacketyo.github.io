          <p>JPMorgan Chase announced second-quarter earnings that surpassed analyst expectations, driven by strong performance in its fixed income trading and investment banking divisions. Despite the positive results, which saw a 14% jump in fixed income trading revenue, CEO Jamie Dimon reiterated his concerns about persistent economic risks. He highlighted potential threats from U.S. trade policies, international conflicts, and high fiscal deficits, even as he acknowledged the U.S. economy's current resilience. The bank's revenue and earnings were down from the prior year, a comparison affected by a significant one-time gain in that period. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>The founder of Unitree Robotics, a leading Chinese start-up, has called for greater collaboration with American companies to advance the development of humanoid robots. Speaking at a government press conference, CEO Wang Xingxing emphasized that combining China's manufacturing and hardware expertise with the United States' rich AI software ecosystem would be mutually beneficial. This call for partnership comes as humanoid robotics emerges as a new front in the technological competition between the two nations. Wang suggested that global cooperation is essential to promote innovation in this burgeoning field.</p>

          <h2>Nvidia Receives Trump Administration Approval to Sell Advanced AI Chips to China</h2>
          <div class="timestamp">2025-07-15 07:21:00 EDT</div>

          <p>Nvidia CEO Jensen Huang announced that the Trump administration has approved the company's request to sell its advanced H20 computer chips to China, reversing a previous ban. The decision is seen as a significant boost for Nvidia, allowing it to better compete with rivals like Huawei in the crucial Chinese market, which is home to half of the world's AI researchers. This policy shift follows lobbying efforts by tech leaders who argued that export restrictions hinder U.S. competitiveness. The move aims to balance national security concerns with the economic interests of American technology firms in one of the world's largest markets.</p>

          <p>The UK government is launching a new grant scheme to encourage the transition to electric vehicles (EVs), offering discounts of up to £3,750 on eligible cars. The program, funded by a £650 million investment, applies to vehicles costing up to £37,000 and is part of the government's plan to ban the sale of new petrol and diesel cars by 2030. While the automotive industry has welcomed the move, some stakeholders emphasize the critical need for more public charging infrastructure to support the growing number of EVs. Critics from the opposition argue the policy forces consumers towards more expensive options they may not want.</p>

          <p>Chinese President Xi Jinping has described relations with Australia as having "turned around" during a meeting with Australian Prime Minister Anthony Albanese in Beijing. Both leaders emphasized seeking common ground and pursuing mutually beneficial cooperation, acknowledging a recovery from years of strained diplomatic ties. Albanese's visit comes as Australia aims to reinforce its economic relationship with China, its major trading partner. The diplomatic thaw is also significant for Beijing as it seeks to strengthen ties with key U.S. allies to counteract the effects of American trade policies and tariffs.</p>

          <p>In an opinion piece, U.S. Senator Marsha Blackburn champions President Trump's recently signed "One Big Beautiful Bill" as a historic achievement for the country. She argues the legislation delivers the largest tax cut in U.S. history, which will provide significant savings for households and boost take-home pay. Blackburn also highlights the bill's investments in border security, military funding, and the elimination of Green New Deal spending. She refutes Democratic criticisms, asserting that the bill benefits low-income workers the most and strengthens Medicaid by targeting waste and fraud without cutting benefits for vulnerable Americans.</p>

          <p>In a personal essay, a writer recounts their journey of leaving the conservative evangelical church due to its rigid stance against same-sex relationships, a position recently reaffirmed by the Southern Baptist Convention. Growing up, they were taught that opposing gay marriage was a moral duty and that their sexuality was a cross to bear. After years of internal conflict, the author realized that affirming their identity was not a rejection of God, but a choice for personal integrity and a deeper, more authentic faith. They now belong to a fully affirming church, finding community among other LGBTQ Christians who remain committed to their faith.</p>

          <p>A pastor and divinity school professor argues that despite a recent IRS rule change allowing political endorsements, churches should refrain from this practice to maintain their moral authority and unity. While acknowledging the historical necessity for churches, particularly in the Black tradition, to address political injustice, he distinguishes between making moral judgments and endorsing specific candidates. He warns that endorsements risk deepening political polarization, turning houses of worship into partisan spaces, and undermining the individual conscience of congregants. The author contends the church best serves the state by reminding it of its limits, not by becoming a political tool.</p>

          <p>An ocean exploration team has discovered the wreck of the Teruzuki, a Japanese destroyer sunk by U.S. torpedoes in 1942 during the pivotal Guadalcanal campaign. The warship was found more than 2,600 feet below the surface in the Solomon Islands' Iron Bottom Sound, a region known for its numerous sunken WWII vessels. The remotely operated vehicle that located the wreck revealed that the ship was severed in two but still had unused depth charges on its stern. The discovery provides the first visual record of the Teruzuki since it sank over 80 years ago, offering new insights into its final moments.</p>

          <p>China's economy expanded by 5.2% year-on-year in the second quarter of 2025, keeping it on track to meet the government's annual growth target of around 5%. The performance was supported by government stimulus measures and a temporary pause in trade war escalations with the U.S., which allowed for a surge in exports. However, analysts warn this growth may not be sustainable due to underlying issues such as weak consumer confidence and a persistent property crisis. Investors are bracing for a weaker second half of the year despite expectations of further stimulus policies from Beijing. (not investment advice)</p>

The policy is intended to help create a more "family-friendly society" as China grapples with a steep decline in marriage registrations, which fell to a record low in the past year. Despite government efforts to reduce the financial burden of weddings, many young people still view the cost of marriage as prohibitive.</p>
