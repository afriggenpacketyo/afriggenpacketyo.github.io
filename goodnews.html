          <p>Florida has become the second state to ban the addition of fluoride to drinking water, citing concerns over forced medication. Governor DeSantis signed the bill into law, despite opposition from public health experts and medical professionals who warn of increased tooth decay, especially in children. The law aligns with the positions of Robert F Kennedy Jr. and Florida‚Äôs surgeon general Joseph Ladapo, who claim fluoride affects children‚Äôs intellectual abilities. The American Dental Association expressed concerns over the long-term harm to vulnerable kids and adults due to the removal of fluoride.</p>

          <p>Mediterranean chain Cava reported better-than-expected sales, with same-store sales growing 10.8%, driven by increased traffic and premium item purchases. CFO Tricia Tolivar noted that diners are shifting from fast food and casual dining to Cava's offerings. This contrasts with rivals like Chipotle and Sweetgreen, which reported sales declines. Despite the strong performance, Cava maintained its conservative same-store sales forecast of 6% to 8% for the year. Cava now anticipates adjusted earnings before interest, taxes, depreciation and amortization of $152 million to $159 million, and plans to open between 64 and 68 new locations.</p>

          <p>A Republican-backed bill in the House does not include President Trump's suggestion to eliminate income taxes on Social Security benefits due to reconciliation process rules. The bill aims to make Trump's 2017 tax cuts permanent but offers seniors an extra $4,000 deduction instead. Eliminating taxes on Social Security could deplete the Social Security trust fund by 2032 and Medicare's by 2030, potentially leading to automatic benefit cuts. While appealing in the short term, experts warn that scrapping these taxes would weaken the program's long-term stability.</p>

          <p>Alibaba shares experienced a significant drop of over 7% after the Chinese e-commerce giant reported lower-than-expected earnings for its fiscal fourth quarter. Despite a 7% year-on-year increase in revenue, the company's net income fell short of analyst expectations, impacted by macroeconomic volatility and the trade war between Washington and Beijing. Alibaba is facing intense competition in China's e-commerce market, with rivals like PDD and JD.com engaging in a price war.

          <h2>Understanding Credit Card Debt Forgiveness</h2>
          <div class="timestamp">2025-05-15 15:23:02 EDT</div>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>This article discusses credit card debt forgiveness as a potential solution for unmanageable debt, involving negotiating with creditors for a reduced lump-sum payment. It highlights that there are no government-sponsored programs specifically designed to eliminate credit card debt. Options include debt settlement programs, which can reduce the principal balance but may harm credit scores, and bankruptcy, which can provide complete debt forgiveness but also has significant credit implications. The article also mentions alternative options like debt management and debt consolidation. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>Belgium's parliament voted to drop the country's planned nuclear phaseout, reversing a 2003 law. The motion passed with 102 votes in favor, eight against and 31 abstentions. Energy Minister Mathieu Bihet called it a "decisive step for the economic, environmental, and strategic future" of the country. The phaseout was initially delayed in 2022 due to energy uncertainty from Russia's war in Ukraine. Nuclear energy currently accounts for around 40% of Belgium's power generation.</p>
