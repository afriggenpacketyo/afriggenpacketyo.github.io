          <div class="timestamp">2025-09-14 13:24:15 EDT</div>
        </div>
        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>England cricket's head coach, Brendon McCullum, has indicated that the selection meeting for the upcoming Ashes tour of Australia will be "short" and relatively simple. He stated that the core of the group is largely settled, with the main point of discussion being the choice of a second spinner to support Shoaib Bashir. McCullum confirmed that the team will not take a specialist backup wicketkeeper and may include as many as seven seam bowlers in the 17-player squad. The announcement is expected next week, following England's T20 series against Ireland, as preparations intensify for the highly anticipated series against their rivals.</p>

          <p>A coalition of seven prominent women's organizations has warned the UK government against watering down its flagship Employment Rights Bill, arguing it represents a "once-in-a-generation" opportunity to advance gender equality. In a letter to the new business secretary, the groups expressed concern over amendments from the House of Lords that could weaken protections, such as introducing a qualifying period for unfair dismissal. They highlighted that women are disproportionately affected by insecure work, making up the majority of workers on zero-hours contracts. The organizations are urging ministers to pass the legislation in full to help close the gender pay gap and improve living standards for working people.</p>

          <p>British supermarket group Sainsbury’s has officially terminated talks with Chinese e-commerce firm JD.com regarding the potential sale of its general merchandise chain, Argos. The decision was made after JD.com reportedly sought to proceed only on "materially revised" terms and commitments. Sainsbury's concluded that these new conditions were not in the best interest of its shareholders and ended the discussions. Despite the collapse of the potential deal, the company reaffirmed its financial outlook, stating it still expects to achieve an underlying retail operating profit of approximately £1 billion for the 2025-2026 financial year.</p>

          <p>An analysis suggests that artificial intelligence chip designer Nvidia could reach a market capitalization of $10 trillion within the next five years, building on its recent achievement of becoming the first company to surpass a $4 trillion valuation. The prediction is based on the escalating demand for its powerful graphics processing units (GPUs), which are essential for driving advanced AI tasks and have already propelled the company's annual revenue to over $130 billion. With projections for AI infrastructure spending potentially reaching $4 trillion by the end of the decade, Nvidia is positioned to capture a significant portion of this expanding market.

          <p>Oblique Seville has become the new men's 100m world champion, securing Jamaica's first global title in the event since Usain Bolt's victory in 2016. The 24-year-old sprinter, who is coached by Bolt's former mentor Glen Mills, ran a personal best of 9.77 seconds in Tokyo to claim the gold medal. The victory was a moment of redemption for Seville, who had narrowly missed a medal at the previous world championships and finished last in the 2024 Olympic final despite high expectations. The win, celebrated by Bolt in the stands, signals a potential changing of the guard and a resurgence for Jamaican men's sprinting on the world stage.</p>

          <p>Philadelphia Eagles running back Saquon Barkley is reportedly investing millions of his NFL earnings into a diverse portfolio of tech startups and venture capital funds. Since being drafted in 2018, Barkley has adopted a strategy of living off his endorsement deals while investing his salary, a method inspired by former player Marshawn Lynch. His investments are said to include AI firm Anthropic, Elon Musk's Neuralink, and Peter Thiel's Founders Fund, reflecting a sophisticated approach to building long-term wealth beyond his athletic career. This strategy was partly motivated by a significant injury in 2020, which underscored the finite nature of a professional football career.</p>

          <p>UK Education Secretary Bridget Phillipson has officially launched her campaign for the deputy leadership of the Labour Party, emphasizing the need for unity to secure a second term in government and combat the rise of Reform UK. Speaking in Sunderland, she paid tribute to her predecessor, Angela Rayner, and pledged to continue a strong campaigning role if elected. The contest, which also features former Commons leader Lucy Powell, is seen by some as a reflection on the Prime Minister's leadership following recent high-profile resignations. Phillipson warned that internal division would only benefit political opponents and harm the country.</p>

          <p>Liverpool has maintained a perfect start to their Premier League season, characterized by a series of dramatic, late-game winning goals, drawing comparisons to the "Fergie Time" of Manchester United's past.

This was the fourth consecutive league match where Liverpool's winning goal was scored in the final 10 minutes or later, a new Premier League record. The trend highlights the team's resilience and winning mentality, even when not playing at their absolute best, creating a formidable psychological advantage over opponents.</p>

This meticulous engineering extends to crowd control, with operators using large visual landmarks, variable-tempo music, and even parades to guide guest flow.

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>The increasing popularity of "buy now, pay later" (BNPL) services like Affirm and Klarna is creating challenges for traditional banks and credit card companies. These services, used by an estimated 86.5 million Americans in 2024, allow consumers to split purchases into interest-free installments, representing transactions that might otherwise have gone through credit cards. Financial institutions are wary because BNPL activity often creates a "giant black hole" in a consumer's credit profile, as these short-term loans are not always reported to credit bureaus. This lack of visibility complicates risk assessment for banks when evaluating consumers for traditional loans. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>"In the Beginning, There Was the Word," a new poem by Ashley M. Jones, reflects on the enduring power of language and faith throughout the African American experience. The poem, written for artist Joe Minter, traces a lineage of resilience from the forced passage of slavery, where "the word rode with us," to the Civil Rights Movement in Birmingham. It frames historical figures and ordinary people as "messengers" who used their words and creations as acts of prayer and resistance. The work concludes by affirming the collective soul and "unstoppable song" of a people who have carried their heritage forward as a living torch.</p>
