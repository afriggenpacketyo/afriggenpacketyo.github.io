          <p>Paola Clouatre, the wife of a U.S. Marine Corps veteran, has been released from ICE custody after being detained for two months in Louisiana. Clouatre, who was breastfeeding her newborn at the time of her arrest, was taken into custody during what she believed was a routine green card application meeting. Her detention stemmed from a years-old, missed immigration hearing she was unaware of, which resulted in a deportation order. Her release follows advocacy from her husband and community, though she must still wear an ankle monitor and faces ongoing immigration proceedings.</p>

          <p>Ukrainian anti-corruption agencies have arrested a member of parliament and several other officials in connection with a large-scale bribery scheme. The plot allegedly involved inflating the prices of state contracts for military drones and electronic warfare systems by up to 30%. President Volodymyr Zelensky confirmed the arrests and reiterated a "zero tolerance" policy for corruption, especially during wartime. The arrests follow the recent restoration of independence for the country's anti-corruption bodies, a key demand for Ukraine's bid to join the European Union.</p>

          <h2>Appeals Court Upholds Restrictions on Immigration Raids in Los Angeles Area</h2>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>A federal appeals court has largely upheld a lower court's ruling that places restrictions on "roving" immigration raids in the Los Angeles area. The decision affirmed that federal agents cannot base arrests solely on factors like a person's race, ethnicity, or their use of the Spanish language. The ruling stems from a lawsuit alleging that sweeps conducted by the Trump administration were unconstitutional and predicated on racial profiling. The court agreed that these factors alone do not provide the reasonable suspicion required by the 4th Amendment for a stop.</p>

          <p>Former UK Labour leader Jeremy Corbyn is launching a new left-wing political party but has decided to let supporters choose its name. Corbyn and fellow independent MP Zarah Sultana claim over 600,000 people have registered as supporters for the yet-to-be-named venture. Before it can field candidates, the party must register an official name with the Electoral Commission, which has strict rules to prevent confusion with existing parties. The move is part of an effort to build a grassroots movement where supporters help define the party's platform and identity from the outset.</p>

          <p>The Los Angeles Lakers have signaled a clear shift in focus by signing Luka Dončić to a three-year, $165 million contract extension, officially making him the centerpiece of the franchise. The team's public celebration of the deal and praise for Dončić's support system are seen as a commitment to building the team around the 26-year-old star. This move intensifies speculation about the future of LeBron James, who is under contract for only one more season. How James, who has long been the focal point of his teams, will adapt to this new dynamic remains a major question for the organization.</p>

          <p>British comedian Harry Hill has revealed that the death of his stepfather at age 54 was the catalyst for his decision to leave medicine and pursue comedy. A qualified doctor, Hill felt unsuited for the emotional demands of the medical profession and was at the "end of his tether." He explained that seeing his stepfather, who had worked his whole life, die before getting to enjoy retirement made him realize he did not want the same fate. This personal tragedy, he said, ultimately set him free to follow his passion for entertainment in the early 1990s.</p>

          <p>Meta Platforms, a leading advocate for open-source artificial intelligence with its Llama models, has signaled it may become more "careful" with its open-source approach. This shift in strategy contrasts with China's current embrace of open-source AI, where companies are rapidly releasing advanced models. Some experts, like computer scientist Andrew Ng, suggest that China's competitive open-source ecosystem could be its path to surpassing the U.S. in AI development. This comes as Chinese tech giants like Alibaba and Zhipu AI have recently launched powerful new open-source models.</p>

          <p>The long-standing mystery surrounding the death of a platypus gifted to Winston Churchill during World War II has finally been solved by researchers. The platypus, named Winston, was a diplomatic gift from Australia in 1943 but died during the final leg of its sea voyage. For decades, it was rumored that the creature died from shell-shock after its ship encountered a German U-boat. However, newly analyzed records, including the attendant's logbook, reveal the platypus likely died from heatstroke as the ship crossed the equator, with water temperatures far exceeding a safe threshold.</p>

          <p>China is increasingly relying on the development of large-scale theme parks to help drive domestic consumer spending and boost local economies. The recent opening of the world's largest Legoland resort is the latest example of this trend, adding to the more than 4,400 amusement facilities already in the country. According to a global industry association, the number of attractions is forecast to grow significantly in the coming years. Experts note that for every yuan of revenue a theme park generates, it creates a much larger economic impact in the surrounding area.</p>
