          <div class="timestamp">2025-07-19 02:00:12 EDT</div>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Scientists in Wuhan, China, have developed a new method to generate cancer-fighting CAR-T cells directly within the human body, potentially revolutionizing treatment for blood cancers and other illnesses. This in-vivo approach aims to overcome the significant drawbacks of conventional CAR-T therapy, which is prohibitively expensive and logistically complex. The study, published in The Lancet, detailed the successful treatment of four multiple myeloma patients using this technique. This innovation could dramatically reduce treatment costs from over one million yuan, making advanced cell therapies more accessible globally.</p>

          <p>China's State Administration for Market Regulation (SAMR) has summoned major e-commerce and delivery platforms, including Alibaba, Meituan, and JD.com, to address an intensifying price war. The meeting aimed to promote rational competition and ensure a healthy ecosystem for all stakeholders, from consumers to delivery riders. The regulator emphasized that companies must comply with existing laws on e-commerce, anti-unfair competition, and food safety. This intervention reflects Beijing's ongoing efforts to rein in the aggressive and often disruptive business practices of its largest technology firms.</p>

          <h2>Dodgers Pitcher Tyler Glasnow Shows Progress in First Start After Injury</h2>
          <div class="timestamp">2025-07-19 00:39:26 EDT</div>
        </div>
        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Los Angeles Dodgers pitcher Tyler Glasnow delivered a strong performance in his return from the injured list, pitching six innings and allowing only one run in a 2-0 loss to the Milwaukee Brewers. Despite the team's defeat, Glasnow's outing was a positive sign, showcasing increased velocity and a more athletic, less mechanical approach on the mound. The Dodgers are heavily relying on the healthy return of Glasnow and fellow pitcher Blake Snell to fortify their starting rotation for a potential World Series run. This start marked Glasnow's most effective performance since last year, suggesting he may be overcoming previous injury-related struggles.</p>

          <p>Scott Morrison, the former prime minister of Australia, is scheduled to testify before a U.S. House select committee on China regarding strategies to counter economic coercion. His testimony is significant given his government's call for an inquiry into COVID-19's origins, which led to retaliatory tariffs from Beijing on Australian goods. The hearing occurs as relations between Australia and China are warming under Morrison's successor, Anthony Albanese. The event highlights the ongoing geopolitical tensions and the United States' focus on building a coalition to address China's economic practices.</p>

          <h2>Chinese Army Scientists Propose More Powerful X-Shaped Electromagnetic Railgun</h2>

          <p>Scientists at China's Army Engineering University have proposed a new design for an electromagnetic railgun that could nearly double the firing power of the current naval version. The innovative "X-rail gun" design involves cross-stacking two rail guns, which would significantly increase bore pressure and allow for heavier projectiles. This addresses a key limitation of the existing technology, where power constraints limit shells to a weight considered too light for major naval warfare. The proposed advancement aims to enhance the military application and technological progress of China's electromagnetic weapons program.</p>

          <p>A recent CBS News/YouGov poll reveals that a majority of Americans, approximately two-thirds, favor the United States returning to the moon and eventually sending astronauts to Mars. Support is particularly strong among younger Americans who did not witness the original Apollo moon landing. The survey also found that the 1969 moon landing is still widely viewed as a worthwhile achievement that contributes to national pride. These findings suggest a broad, cross-partisan public appetite for continued and ambitious space exploration initiatives led by the U.S.</p>

          <p>Chinese tech firms like DeepSeek and Alibaba are leveraging open-source AI to challenge the closed, proprietary systems of American giants like OpenAI and Google. By making their large language models (LLMs) freely available, they are fostering global collaboration and accelerating the development of new AI applications, particularly within China. This movement has sent shockwaves through Silicon Valley, as it presents a viable and powerful alternative to the restricted access policies of leading U.S. companies. Analysts believe this open-source approach poses a serious competitive threat to the established leaders in the global AI landscape.</p>

          <p>President Donald Trump announced that ten more hostages held by Hamas in Gaza are expected to be released "very shortly," as his administration continues to push for a 60-day ceasefire. The current ceasefire proposal reportedly includes the return of these ten living hostages and the remains of eighteen others in exchange for Israel releasing an unspecified number of Palestinian prisoners. The announcement came as the director of Israel's Mossad intelligence agency visited Washington to discuss relocating Palestinians from Gaza. Trump has been actively promoting the ceasefire deal, which he claims Israel has agreed to in principle.</p>

          <p>The Australian government has delivered a shipment of M1A1 Abrams tanks to Ukraine as part of a significant military aid package to help the country defend against Russia's invasion. The tanks are part of a A$245 million ($160 million) contribution, with most of the 49 promised vehicles now in Ukrainian possession. As one of the largest non-NATO contributors to Ukraine's war effort, Australia has provided over A$1.5 billion in total aid, including ammunition and other defense equipment. This move reinforces Canberra's stance in labeling Russia as the aggressor and supporting a resolution to the conflict on Kyiv's terms.</p>

          <p>A U.S. Marine veteran, Scott Harrison, who endured the horrors of the Vietnam War, has built a unique carousel in Colorado, turning a comforting wartime vision into a reality. During intense fighting, Harrison would listen to a music box and imagine a carousel in a peaceful mountain meadow to cope with the brutality. After struggling with PTSD for years, he began building the carousel in 1986, hand-carving the animals over 26 years. Now, the Carousel of Happiness has delighted over a million people and has become a source of profound healing and joy for Harrison and his community.</p>

          <p>President Trump has signed the GENIUS Act into law, establishing the first major regulatory framework for cryptocurrency stablecoins in the United States. The bipartisan bill creates consumer protections and allows banks and other financial institutions to issue their own stablecoins backed by U.S. dollars. At the signing ceremony, Trump hailed the law as a massive validation for the crypto community and a step toward a "21st-century upgrade" for the financial system. The legislation is seen as a significant victory for the crypto industry, which has long advocated for clear regulations to bring digital currencies into the mainstream. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>An adviser from the Bank for International Settlements (BIS) has stated that the global financial system must rewrite its rules to accommodate a future dominated by tokenization. The rise of stablecoins presents significant challenges to existing infrastructures for payment and settlement, particularly concerning anti-money-laundering (AML) efforts and know-your-customer (KYC) protocols due to their cross-border nature. This call for regulatory evolution comes as the market for digital currencies surges, fueled by the Trump administration's supportive stance and growing investor interest. Regulators worldwide, including in Hong Kong, are now moving to establish clear guidelines for the rapidly expanding sector. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>Fintech company Block, founded as Square by Jack Dorsey, is set to be added to the S&P 500 index, replacing oil producer Hess following its acquisition by Chevron. The inclusion, effective July 23, caused Block's shares to surge over 10% in extended trading, a common reaction as index funds rebalance their portfolios to include the new stock. Despite this boost, Block's stock has underperformed the broader market this year, down 14% amid a challenging macroeconomic environment. The company, with a market capitalization of about $45 billion, has expanded from payment processing into cryptocurrency and other financial services. (not investment advice)</p>
