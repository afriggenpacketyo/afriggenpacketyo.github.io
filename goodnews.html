          <h2>Measles Vaccination Rates Decline in Most U.S. Counties, Study Reveals</h2>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>A recent study indicates a widespread decline in childhood measles vaccination rates across the United States since before the COVID-19 pandemic, with significant variations within states. The MMR vaccination rate decreased from 93.92% in the 2017-2018 school year to 91.26% in the 2023-2024 school year across 33 states, with 78% of the 2,066 counties studied experiencing a decline. The study highlights the vulnerability of certain areas to measles outbreaks, pointing to Gaines County in West Texas, the epicenter of a recent outbreak, with a vaccination rate just over 80%. The CDC reports that 96% of U.S. measles cases are among those unvaccinated or with unknown vaccination status, underscoring the importance of herd immunity, which requires over 95% community vaccination. </p>

          <p>Following recent solar storms, the northern lights may be visible in parts of the U.S., including Alaska, Washington, Montana, and other northern states. The sun's current maximum phase of its 11-year activity cycle makes these light displays more common and widespread. Auroras, commonly visible near the poles, are caused by charged particles from the sun interacting with Earth's atmosphere. Severe storms can disrupt radio and GPS communications, but the active solar period is expected to continue through the end of the year. </p>

          <p>President Trump has pardoned two South Florida shark divers who were convicted of theft for freeing 19 sharks and a giant grouper from a fisherman's longline. Tanner Mansell and John Moore Jr. were convicted in 2022 of theft of property within special maritime jurisdiction. The men avoided prison time but were ordered to pay restitution, and the felony convictions restricted their voting rights, firearm ownership, and international travel. They believed the longline was illegal and reported it to state wildlife officials. </p>

          <p>A 15-year legal battle over water costs has ended with the San Diego County Water Authority and the Metropolitan Water District of Southern California reaching a settlement. The agreement establishes the price paid for delivering water supplies and will enable greater collaboration among the agencies.

The settlement will bring greater fiscal certainty and new opportunities to move water to communities that need it most. </p>

          <p>The Trump administration has reversed its decision to close eight California outposts of the U.S. Department of Agriculture (USDA), following pressure from Democratic lawmakers. The decision to keep the offices open came after lawmakers argued that their closure would negatively impact California's agricultural sector. The administration said the terminations would provide considerable cost savings for the American people. USDA offices slated for closure included outposts of the Farm Services Agency, the Natural Resource Conservation Service, the Agricultural Marketing Service, and the U.S. Forest Service. </p>
