          <p>Amazon reported second-quarter results that beat analyst expectations on both earnings and revenue, with sales growing 13% year-over-year to $167.7 billion. The company's cloud unit, AWS, and its advertising business both showed strong performance, with ad revenue climbing 23%. However, the company's stock fell in after-hours trading due to a weaker-than-expected operating income forecast for the third quarter. This cautious guidance has concerned investors who are closely watching the returns on Amazon's massive investments in artificial intelligence infrastructure and data centers.

          <p>The Pentagon has ordered the withdrawal of 1,350 National Guard troops from Los Angeles, a significant reduction from the 5,000 members originally deployed by the Trump administration to address protests against immigration policies. The deployment was met with resistance from California state and local officials, who argued the situation should be handled by local law enforcement. While the administration maintains the troops were vital for keeping peace, reports indicated low morale and a lack of clear directives. California politicians applauded the withdrawal and are calling for the remaining 250 troops to be sent home as well.</p>

          <p>Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky has overturned a controversial law that would have limited the independence of key anti-corruption agencies. The reversal came swiftly after thousands of young Ukrainians participated in the largest anti-government demonstrations since the start of Russia's full-scale invasion. Protesters argued that protecting the independence of these bodies was crucial for Ukraine's path toward EU membership, a status conditioned on a credible fight against corruption. The U-turn defused a major political crisis but has raised questions about the government's commitment to the reforms demanded by its citizens and Western partners.</p>

The proposed league, spearheaded by James's business partner Maverick Carter, aims to create a touring circuit of six men's and six women's teams competing in eight global cities. Inspired by formats like LIV Golf and Formula One, the venture would offer players equity stakes, which is currently prohibited for active NBA athletes. The plan represents a potential major disruption to the global basketball landscape, as the NBA also explores its own European expansion.</p>

          <p>A new study has solved the long-standing mystery of the potato's origin, revealing that it evolved from an ancient tomato ancestor approximately 9 million years ago. Researchers found that the modern potato is the result of a hybridization event between a wild, non-tuber-producing potato species and an ancient tomato. The tomato parent provided a crucial gene that signals the plant to form tubers, while the wild potato parent contributed a gene that controls their growth. This discovery, based on the analysis of hundreds of potato genomes, demonstrates how interbreeding between species can spark the evolution of entirely new traits.</p>
