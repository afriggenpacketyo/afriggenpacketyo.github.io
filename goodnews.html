          <h2>Chinese Premier Urges Collaboration on Trade Amid Global Tensions</h2>

          <p>Chinese Premier Li Qiang, speaking at the World Economic Forum's "Summer Davos" in Dalian, China, called for international collaboration on trade despite rising tariffs and barriers. He emphasized that globalization is irreversible and urged countries not to politicize or securitize trade. Li stated that engaging in the international economy involves "reshaping the rules and order" and encouraged countries to stay on the "right" path. Adam Tooze, a Columbia University professor, interpreted Li's comments as a move towards a "pluralization" of global order, focusing on processes rather than a single entity setting the order. The premier did not specifically address U.S. tensions or the Israel-Iran conflict. Optimism surrounding global economic collaboration is tempered by existing geopolitical challenges.</p>

Randolph Bracy expressed disappointment, noting his family's long history of service in central Florida.

          <p>China is expanding avenues for foreign institutions to use the yuan amid faltering international confidence in the U.S. dollar, aiming to challenge the greenback's dominance. Recent moves include establishing a center for digital yuan internationalization in Shanghai and promoting yuan foreign exchange futures trading. While global finance institutions are interested in diversifying to China, strict capital controls and systemic opacity have discouraged large-scale asset purchases. China is also promoting bilateral trade settlement in yuan and has developed a network of offshore yuan clearing banks to encourage its use in global payments. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>State assemblyman Zohran Mamdani achieved a significant political upset by defeating former governor Andrew Cuomo in the New York City mayoral Democratic primary. Cuomo, who resigned in 2021 amid a sexual harassment scandal, conceded to Mamdani, a 33-year-old democratic socialist. The primary in New York, a reliably liberal city, is expected to determine the next mayor in November's election. Mamdani's victory is seen as a reflection of New York Democrats' desire for leaders who demonstrate enthusiasm and courage, especially in the context of Donald Trump's presidency.</p>

          <p>Antoinette Lattouf, an Australian journalist, won her case against the Australian Broadcasting Corporation (ABC), with a court ruling that she was unfairly dismissed over a social media post about the war in Gaza.

The court found that the ABC sacked Lattouf for reasons including her opinions on the Israeli military campaign in Gaza, awarding her damages of A$70,000. The ABC apologized for its handling of the matter, acknowledging it had let down its staff and audiences.</p>

          <p>The New York City mayoral primary is a battle between Zohran Mamdani, a left-wing state assemblyman, and former Governor Andrew Cuomo, representing a struggle within the Democratic Party.

Cuomo, seeking a comeback after a sexual harassment scandal, is emphasizing his experience and moderate stance, though critics point to his past controversies. The race is seen as a test for the Democratic Party as it seeks to define its direction after recent election losses. Early results show Mamdani with a commanding lead, but falling short of the 50% threshold needed to win outright.</p>

The committee emphasizes the need for the government to ensure households benefit from the transition to cleaner technologies through reduced bills. While electric car sales have nearly doubled in the past two years, and heat pump sales are growing, both remain below target. The CCC also suggests making electricity cheaper by removing charges that support older renewable energy projects, which would incentivize the use of electric vehicles and heat pumps.</p>

          <p>Chinese astronomers have discovered that stars nearing the end of their lives slow their spin, revealing insights into star formation. Using data from the Gaia space telescope, researchers found that stars born today spin up to 10 times faster than those formed billions of years ago. This increased spin causes gas clouds to break into smaller fragments, making it harder for massive stars to form. The study provides evidence that the Milky Way's star-forming clouds have grown more turbulent over time, offering a new way to study galactic evolution.</p>
