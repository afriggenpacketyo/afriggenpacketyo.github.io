          <p>The Consumer Price Index (CPI) rose 2.3% in April, slightly below economists' expectations but still above the Federal Reserve's 2% target. Housing and energy costs were primary drivers of inflation, while grocery prices saw a slight decrease. Economists are closely monitoring the potential impact of President Trump's tariffs on consumer prices, though the April data may not fully reflect these effects due to exemptions and front-loading of purchases. The Federal Reserve is expected to remain cautious in cutting interest rates as it assesses the impact of trade policies on inflation. (not investment advice)</p>
