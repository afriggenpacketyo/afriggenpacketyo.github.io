          <p>Nvidia CEO Jensen Huang expressed optimism about resolving U.S.-China trade disputes, emphasizing America's need to win the AI race to ensure the future is built on an American tech stack. Huang advocates for American companies to access the best chip technology, desiring a global reliance on U.S. tech, similar to the dollar's role. His remarks follow an agreement for Nvidia and AMD to share 15% of China sales revenue with the U.S. government for export licenses. Huang warned that a complete ban on chip exports to China would harm American companies long-term, though Nvidia's guidance excludes China sales, suggesting potential upside from any resolution.

          <p>Orlando Bravo, co-founder of Thoma Bravo, a private equity firm with over $181 billion in assets, stated that valuations for artificial intelligence companies are currently "at a bubble," drawing comparisons to the dot-com era. He cautioned that investors cannot justify a $10 billion valuation for a company with only $50 million in annual recurring revenue. However, Bravo noted a key difference from the dot-com bust: large companies with healthy balance sheets are now financing AI businesses. Despite inflated numbers for companies like OpenAI, Palantir, and AppLovin, he emphasized the significant financial backing supporting the current AI market. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>Los Angeles, a city with a rich but often overlooked literary history, now has a new hub for its writers: the Center for California Literature. Founded by poet Christopher Soto, the initiative aims to connect authors and poets through readings, workshops, and advocacy, addressing a perceived lack of support and financial instability in the local literary community. Soto was inspired after an article he was writing about writers leaving L.A. due to lack of opportunities was decommissioned due to a layoff. Renowned authors like Roxane Gay support the center, emphasizing the need for community and resources for writers. The center’s recent launch showcased diverse literary talents, fostering excitement for a new era in L.A.'s literary arts.</p>

Dell now anticipates annual revenue growth between 7% and 9%, up from 3% to 4%, and diluted earnings per share to grow at least 15%, an increase from 8% or higher. The computer maker attributes this revised guidance to its strategic capitalization on the rapid advancements in artificial intelligence, positioning itself as a leader in AI infrastructure solutions.

          <p>Bari Weiss, founder of The Free Press, has been appointed editor-in-chief of CBS News, a move that has generated significant reaction within the journalism industry. Weiss, known for her 2020 resignation from The New York Times over concerns about journalistic principles, is now tasked with leading the "Tiffany network." The acquisition of her publication, The Free Press, by Paramount Skydance and her subsequent appointment have reportedly caused "freaking out" among some CBS staff. Supporters, however, view her as bringing traditional journalistic methods and a culture of ideas back to mainstream news, emphasizing her success in building a robust digital media enterprise.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Major drugmakers are increasingly adopting direct-to-consumer (DTC) sales models, a strategy encouraged by the Trump administration to lower U.S. drug prices. Amgen, Eli Lilly, Novo Nordisk, Pfizer, AstraZeneca, Novartis, and Bristol Myers Squibb have all launched or expanded DTC programs, offering significant discounts on various medications like cholesterol-lowering drugs, weight loss treatments, and blood thinners. This approach bypasses traditional middlemen, aiming to reduce costs for patients and capture more revenue. The Trump administration's "most favored nation" policy and the upcoming TrumpRx.gov website are driving these changes, signaling a significant shift in pharmaceutical sales and pricing strategies.

          <p>As the government shutdown continues, historical data suggests the S&P 500 typically performs well during and after such stalemates. The index returned 0.80% in the first week of the current shutdown and has historically shown significant gains in the year following previous shutdowns, with a 36% spike after the 2019 event. Experts note that markets are forward-looking and tend to price in future conditions rather than current political "noise." While not universally positive, the data indicates that staying invested through uncertainty has generally rewarded patient investors, underscoring the benefits of diversified portfolios over reactive trading during periods of political gridlock.

        </div>
        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>The UK's Financial Conduct Authority (FCA) has proposed a compensation scheme for car finance mis-selling, potentially leading to payouts from 14 million agreements made between 2007 and 2024. The scandal stems from undisclosed discretionary commission arrangements (DCAs) where dealers received commissions based on interest rates, incentivizing higher charges. The FCA banned DCAs in 2021, recognizing they led to consumers overpaying. While an earlier Supreme Court ruling narrowed the scope, the FCA expects average payouts of £700 per mis-sold agreement, totaling around £8.2 billion. Lenders are expected to cover costs, with many already setting aside billions for potential redress.</p>

          <h2>Understanding Effective Tax Rates for Optimal Pretax vs. Roth 401(k) Contributions</h2>

        </div>
        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Deciding between traditional pretax and after-tax Roth 401(k) contributions for retirement savings can be complex, often misjudged by focusing solely on marginal tax rates. Certified financial planner Cody Garrett emphasizes that understanding one's *effective* tax rate—taxes paid as a percentage of total income—is crucial, as it may be significantly lower in retirement than anticipated. Pretax deferrals offer upfront tax breaks, while Roth contributions grow tax-free. This article advocates for a multiyear perspective on tax decisions, suggesting pretax options might be more beneficial if a lower effective tax rate is expected in retirement, potentially enabling future planning opportunities like Roth IRA conversions.
