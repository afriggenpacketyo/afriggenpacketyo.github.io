        </div>
        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Japan's exports increased by 4.2% year-on-year in September, ending a four-month decline, primarily driven by strong growth in shipments to Asia, especially China. However, exports to the U.S., Japan's second-largest trading partner, dropped by 13.3%, largely due to a significant fall in auto shipments despite a recent trade deal reducing tariffs. Semiconductor exports were a key driver of overall growth. The data follows the appointment of Sanae Takaichi as Japan's first female Prime Minister, whose loose monetary policy is expected to weaken the yen and boost exports. (not investment advice)</p>

This major undertaking aims to deliver a "brand new terminal and airport experience," following previous large-scale reshuffling and renovation efforts. Airlines previously housed in Terminal 5, such as JetBlue, Spirit, and American Airlines, are being relocated to other terminals to minimize disruption. The project also includes the opening of a new Midfield Satellite Concourse South to help manage ongoing operations.</p>

          <p>While the U.S. currently holds a lead in science and technology, its dominance in tech innovation cannot be taken for granted, especially given China's clear edge in STEM education. The article, referencing insights from Nobel laureates, suggests that policies like the Trump administration's crackdown on universities and immigration could hinder U.S. progress. It also points out that large corporations stifling competition through acquisitions or lobbying can undermine growth, as explained by the "creative destruction" theory of Aghion and Howitt. This perspective highlights the need for a robust innovation ecosystem.</p>

          <p>Vice President JD Vance stated that the U.S.-brokered Israel-Hamas ceasefire plan is progressing better than anticipated, despite recent violence. Vance, along with Jared Kushner and Steve Witkoff, is in Israel to reinforce the fragile agreement, which has seen the return of hostages and Palestinian bodies. He acknowledged "difficulties" in recovering all remains, some buried under rubble, and urged patience. Vance emphasized that no American troops would be deployed in Gaza to implement the plan, focusing instead on coordination. The long-term viability of the peace plan, which aims for Gaza's demilitarization, remains uncertain.</p>

          <p>The UK government plans to make it quicker and easier to fine English water companies for raw sewage spills, introducing automatic penalties up to £20,000 for minor offenses. For more serious breaches, the burden of proof will be reduced from "beyond a reasonable doubt" to "on the balance of probabilities," allowing for fines up to £500,000 without court proceedings. Environment Secretary Emma Reynolds stated the goal is to give the Environment Agency "the teeth it needs" to enforce rules, aiming to raise £50m-£67m annually, with costs borne by shareholders, not customers.</p>

          <h2>Experts Debunk Common Haircare Myths, Emphasizing Scalp Health Over Product Claims</h2>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Trichologists Eva Proudman and Tracey Walker debunk four common haircare myths, emphasizing that no product can truly repair damaged hair or split ends; only a haircut can. They clarify that washing hair with cold water does not enhance shine and that claims of making hair grow faster are untrue. Furthermore, experts stress that hair does not "self-clean," and infrequent washing can lead to oil buildup, odor, and worsening scalp conditions like dandruff. While dry shampoo is acceptable for occasional use, it should not replace regular washing to maintain scalp health.</p>

          <p>A groundbreaking study by King's College London and the University of Oxford has, for the first time, ranked the physical side effects of various antidepressants, revealing substantial differences between drugs. The research, analyzing 151 studies and over 58,500 patients, found some medications could cause weight changes up to 2kg or heart rate variations of 21 beats per minute within eight weeks. Experts emphasize that while no one should stop treatment, these findings underscore the importance of tailoring antidepressant prescriptions to individual patient needs and health conditions. The study highlights how a push for generic, cheap medications has limited choice, but an upcoming online tool aims to aid personalized drug selection.</p>

          <p>La Liga has announced the cancellation of its plans to stage a Villarreal-Barcelona match in Miami this December, citing "uncertainty" from critical responses within Spain. The decision, made with promoter Relevent, reflects strong opposition from players and clubs, including Real Madrid, who argued the move "distorts the competition." The Spanish footballers’ association had organized protests over the league’s "lack of transparency." La Liga expressed regret, stating that overseas fixtures are crucial for generating new income and competing with leagues like the Premier League, but acknowledged insufficient time to execute the event properly.</p>

          <p>Analysts suggest that former President Donald Trump's strong control over his administration, particularly his ability to rein in China hawks, could make him a "guard rail" in U.S.-China relations. Despite ongoing trade tensions and sharp rhetoric from U.S. officials, Trump has reportedly shown restraint in not directly antagonizing Chinese President Xi Jinping or challenging core red lines like Taiwan. This approach implies that leader-to-leader diplomacy has become increasingly central to shaping ties between the rival powers. The article highlights Trump's unique position in navigating the structural competition between the rising and dominant global powers.</p>
