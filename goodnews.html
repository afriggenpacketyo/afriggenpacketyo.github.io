          <p>Argentinian police are searching for an 18th-century Italian portrait believed to have been looted by a Nazi officer during World War II. The search was initiated after Dutch reporters spotted the painting, "Portrait of a Lady," in an advertisement for a property linked to the descendants of the fugitive officer. The artwork was originally part of the extensive collection of Jewish art dealer Jacques Goudstikker. While a raid on the property did not recover the painting, the event highlights ongoing efforts to reclaim art plundered by the Nazis.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Darren Aronofsky's new film, "Caught Stealing," stars Austin Butler as Hank Thompson, a former baseball prospect whose life spirals into a violent crime caper in 1998 New York City. The review describes the movie as a "bruising bacchanal" that immerses viewers in a grimy, pre-millennial Manhattan, featuring a colorful cast of characters including those played by Zoë Kravitz and Regina King. The article praises the film's energetic, humorous, and menacing tone, viewing it as an affectionate, if dirty, tribute to the city and a continuation of Aronofsky's career-long focus on characters at risk of squandering their potential.</p>

          <p>Scientists in Argentina have discovered a new species of an ancient crocodile relative, named Kostensuchus atrox, that lived around 70 million years ago. The well-preserved fossil indicates the creature was a "hypercarnivore" and a top predator, reaching up to 3.5 meters in length and weighing around 250 kg. With a powerful jaw and large, sharp teeth, it likely preyed on medium-sized dinosaurs in the freshwater floodplains of ancient Patagonia. The discovery provides new insights into the terrestrial ecosystems at high latitudes during the late Cretaceous period.</p>

          <p>South Korea's central bank has decided to keep its policy interest rate unchanged at 2.5% for the second consecutive meeting. The Bank of Korea (BOK) cited the need to monitor rising housing prices in Seoul and household debt levels. While holding rates, the BOK upgraded its GDP growth forecast for 2025 to 0.9% and its inflation forecast to 2.0%. The decision reflects a cautious approach, balancing modest economic improvement with potential risks in the domestic real estate and credit markets. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>The University of Southern California has offered a multi-year contract extension to Notre Dame in an effort to continue their century-old football rivalry. Negotiations are ongoing, with USC's athletic director expressing hope for a resolution after public concern that the series might end. Previously, USC was hesitant to commit long-term due to the uncertainties of an expanded College Football Playoff and a demanding Big Ten travel schedule. A key point of contention remains the timing of the game, as USC prefers to move it to September to better balance its schedule.</p>
