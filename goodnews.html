          <p>Edan Alexander, an American-Israeli hostage, was reunited with his family after spending 584 days in Hamas captivity. His parents recounted the emotional moment they received the news of his release, facilitated by the Trump administration, describing it as the "happiest Mother's Day ever." Edan, though weak, has been cleared for release from the hospital and is gradually sharing details about his captivity. The family is now advocating for the release of the remaining hostages, emphasizing the urgency of ending the conflict and expressing gratitude to those who helped secure Edan's freedom.</p>

          <p>The People‚Äôs Bank of China has reduced its benchmark lending rates to historic lows in an effort to cushion the economy from the impact of US tariffs. The 1-year and 5-year loan prime rates were cut by 10 basis points each. This move is part of a broader stimulus package that includes lowering the reverse repurchase rate and the reserve requirement ratio. While China's stock market saw a surge, analysts believe further measures are needed to boost confidence amid economic uncertainty. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>Shares of Contemporary Amperex Technology, the world's largest battery manufacturer, experienced a significant jump in their Hong Kong trading debut, rising over 18%. This surge reflects investor confidence in the company's ability to capitalize on the expanding electric vehicle market. CATL's IPO raised a substantial $4.6 billion, earmarked primarily for the construction of a new factory in Hungary. The company is expanding into Europe to meet the growing demand from automotive clients like Stellantis, BMW, and Volkswagen. The company faces increased scrutiny from the U.S. and EU, which placed punitive tariffs on EVs made in China last year, citing unfair trade practices.</p>

          <p>Former President Joseph R. Biden Jr.'s announcement of his aggressive prostate cancer diagnosis has shifted the focus from criticism of his 2024 campaign to expressions of sympathy. The news has sparked questions about the timing of the announcement and whether the diagnosis was known during his presidency. Some, like former Representative Dean Phillips, have suggested the timing was strategic to deflect criticism, while others question why the diagnosis wasn't made earlier. Despite the outpouring of support, some Republicans have suggested a cover-up, and physicians have raised concerns about the timeline of the diagnosis.</p>

          <p>Manchester United's Europa League final against Tottenham is being described as a critical moment for the club, with significant financial implications.

The club is already burdened with over ¬£1 billion in debt and faces potential breaches of Premier League financial sustainability rules. Winning the Europa League would provide a much-needed financial boost and allow for investment in new players, while a loss could further jeopardize the club's future.</p>

          <p>The New Zealand government has postponed a vote on the suspension of three Indigenous lawmakers for performing a haka during a parliamentary session last year. The parliamentary privileges committee recommended the suspension, citing the lawmakers' actions as potentially intimidating. The delay aims to allow the suspended members to participate in the upcoming federal budget proceedings. The opposition Labour party has called for a compromise, suggesting censure instead of suspension, deeming the committee's proposal disproportionate.</p>
