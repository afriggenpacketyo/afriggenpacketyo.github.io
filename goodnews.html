          <p>CNBC's Jim Cramer has warned investors to be cautious of the recent resurgence in meme stock trading, which has seen speculative rallies in companies like Kohl's and GoPro. While the broader market is experiencing a rally, partly fueled by a new US-Japan trade deal, Cramer expressed a preference for "legitimate" investment strategies over short squeezes. The article also highlights GE Vernova's significant stock surge following a strong earnings report, driven by high demand for its power-generating gas turbines, which are crucial for the AI industry's energy needs.

          <p>Republican Congressman Mike Lawler has announced he will run for re-election in his competitive Hudson Valley House district, ending speculation about a potential 2026 gubernatorial bid against New York Governor Kathy Hochul. Lawler stated that keeping his seat, which was pivotal in determining House control, is critical for advancing the Republican agenda and moving the economy forward. His decision narrows the potential field of Republican challengers for governor, which may include Representative Elise Stefanik, who has been encouraged by President Trump to remain in Congress for now.</p>

          <p>President Donald Trump has announced a new trade deal with Japan, which includes a 15% tariff on Japanese exports to the U.S. and a reported $550 billion investment from Japan into the American economy. As part of the agreement, the tariff rate on Japanese auto imports will be lowered from 25% to 15%. In return, Japan will reportedly open its markets to U.S. goods, including cars, trucks, and agricultural products. The deal was met with relief in Japan, causing a surge in Japanese auto stocks and the broader Nikkei 225 index. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>The International Court of Justice, the UN's highest court, has delivered a non-binding but landmark advisory opinion stating that countries can be sued for their contributions to climate change. The ruling affirms that nations have a legal obligation under international law to protect the climate system and could be held accountable for historical emissions. This decision is a significant victory for climate-vulnerable nations, particularly small island states that initiated the case, as it opens a potential legal pathway for them to seek compensation from major polluters for climate-related damages.</p>

          <h2>Experts Debate Impact of Potential Elimination of Capital Gains Tax on Home Sales</h2>
          <div class="timestamp">2025-07-23 11:58:44 EDT</div>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>A proposal by President Trump to eliminate the capital gains tax on home sales is being debated by real estate experts for its potential to unlock housing inventory. The National Association of Realtors argues that the current tax, which applies to profits over $500,000 for couples, discourages some homeowners, particularly retirees, from selling and downsizing. However, other analysts are skeptical, suggesting the change would primarily benefit high-end homeowners and would not address the core issue of housing affordability or the lack of confidence in the market, which they see as the main deterrent for potential buyers.

          <p>Germany's cabinet has approved new legislation aimed at speeding up the procurement process for its military, the Bundeswehr. Defense Minister Boris Pistorius called the move a "quantum leap" for national security, designed to cut bureaucratic red tape in response to the perceived threat from Russia. The law will raise the value limits for direct contracts, allowing for faster acquisition of weapons and equipment without lengthy tender processes. The changes are intended to help Germany meet its NATO defense spending commitments and provide arms producers with greater planning certainty to scale up production.</p>

          <p>Uber is launching a new pilot program in the U.S. that will allow women and non-binary drivers and riders to preferentially match with each other. The feature, called "Women+ Connect," aims to increase comfort and safety on the platform by giving users more choice and control over their rides. The tool will be tested in cities like Los Angeles, San Francisco, and Detroit, following similar successful pilots in other countries. The initiative is Uber's latest effort to address longstanding safety concerns and sexual assault incidents that have been associated with ride-hailing services.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>The UK's Advertising Standards Authority (ASA) has banned a Marks & Spencer advertisement, ruling that it irresponsibly featured a model who appeared "unhealthily thin." The regulator cited the model's pose and clothing, including large pointed shoes that emphasized the slenderness of her legs, as contributing to the unhealthy portrayal. M&S defended its choice, stating the model was selected for her health and well-being and that the pose was meant to convey confidence, not slimness. The ASA has ordered the retailer not to use the ad again and to ensure future imagery avoids such portrayals.</p>

          <div class="timestamp">2025-07-23 11:13:20 EDT</div>
        </div>
        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>With rising interest rates and tighter lending standards, many homeowners are finding it harder to qualify for a Home Equity Line of Credit (HELOC). Financial experts advise that if an application is denied, the first step is to ask the lender for the specific reasons, which often relate to a high debt-to-income ratio, insufficient home equity, or a low credit score. To improve approval odds, homeowners should focus on reducing debt and boosting their credit score before reapplying. Experts also suggest exploring alternatives like fixed-rate home equity loans, cash-out refinances, or personal loans if a HELOC remains out of reach. (not investment advice)</p>

        </div>
        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Two former traders, Tom Hayes and Carlo Palombo, who were jailed for manipulating the Libor interest rate, have had their convictions quashed by the UK Supreme Court after a decade-long legal battle. The court ruled that their trials were unfair due to misdirections to the jury, rendering the convictions "unsafe." The traders had long argued they were scapegoats for normal commercial practices to appease public anger after the 2008 financial crisis. This ruling represents a major vindication and could lead to other traders convicted in the UK also seeking to have their convictions overturned.</p>
