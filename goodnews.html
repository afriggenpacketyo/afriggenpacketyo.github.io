          <p>Bitcoin's value surged to a new record, climbing past $120,000, largely driven by substantial inflows into bitcoin exchange-traded funds (ETFs). This rally is supported by increasing institutional investment, with one recent day seeing over $1.18 billion in ETF inflows. The momentum is also fueled by anticipation of clearer U.S. regulatory frameworks for digital assets, including potential legislation around stablecoins. Analysts suggest that while geopolitical trade disputes could cause short-term dips, the long-term outlook is buoyed by institutional confidence and potential government-level digital currency investments.

          <h2>China's June Exports Exceed Expectations Amid US Tariff Reprieve</h2>
          <div class="timestamp">2025-07-14 02:20:32 EDT</div>
        </div>
        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>China's exports grew by 5.8% in June, surpassing economists' forecasts, as a temporary tariff truce with the U.S. slowed the decline in shipments to America. The growth was significantly supported by increased exports to Southeast Asian nations and the European Union. Despite the positive data, economists express caution for the second half of the year, citing uncertainty over future U.S. tariffs and constraints on Chinese manufacturers' ability to expand market share. The data also showed a notable surge in exports of rare earths, steel, and integrated circuits, reflecting complex dynamics within the ongoing trade negotiations. (not investment advice)</p>

          <h2>Nvidia CEO Dismisses Concerns Over China's Military Use of Advanced Chips</h2>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Nvidia CEO Jensen Huang has sought to alleviate U.S. concerns that the company's advanced AI chips could be used by the Chinese military. In a recent interview, Huang argued that China cannot rely on U.S. technology that could be restricted at any moment and already possesses significant computing capacity. He reiterated his criticism of U.S. export controls, stating they are counterproductive to maintaining America's global tech leadership, as they limit access to the large market of AI developers in China. Huang's comments come as he navigates delicate relations between Washington and Beijing ahead of another trip to China.</p>

          <p>Restoration workers at Hungary's 1,000-year-old Pannonhalma Archabbey are undertaking a massive effort to save a significant portion of its library from a severe beetle infestation. Approximately 100,000 books are being removed from shelves to undergo a six-week disinfection process in an oxygen-free nitrogen environment to kill the pests. The drugstore beetles, attracted to the starch-based adhesives in the old bindings, have burrowed through numerous volumes. Experts believe climate change may be a contributing factor, as warmer temperatures allow the beetles to have more reproductive cycles annually, posing a growing threat to historical collections.</p>

Australian officials anticipate that Chinese surveillance ships will monitor the exercises, a practice observed since 2017, and have stated they will adjust their operations accordingly.

          <p>Chinese electric vehicle manufacturers like BYD, XPeng, and MG are rapidly capturing market share in Norway, which is considered the world's most EV-friendly country. These brands have achieved a combined market share of approximately 10%, challenging established players like Tesla with competitive pricing and advanced technology. Unlike the U.S. and EU, Norway has not imposed tariffs on Chinese EV imports, making it a key entry point for these brands into the European market. Analysts see Norway as a laboratory for EVs, where the lack of a domestic auto industry allows foreign brands to gain traction more easily.</p>

          <p>The Indian government is proposing a new rule that would require all new air conditioners to have a default minimum temperature setting of 20 degrees Celsius (68°F). The measure aims to achieve massive energy savings in a country with a rapidly growing market for AC units, driven by rising incomes and temperatures. Officials estimate that for every degree the temperature is raised, energy consumption is reduced by about 6%. While the move is part of a broader effort to manage India's soaring electricity demand and reduce reliance on fossil fuels, it has received mixed reactions from the public.</p>

On a year-over-year basis, the economy expanded 4.3%, beating forecasts. Despite the positive figures, the Ministry of Trade and Industry warned of significant uncertainty and downside risks for the rest of the year, citing a lack of clarity regarding future U.S. tariff policies and their potential impact on global trade.
