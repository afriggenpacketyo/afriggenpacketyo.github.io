          <p>Alex Palou became the first driver from Spain to win the Indianapolis 500, holding off former teammate Marcus Ericsson in the closing laps. Palou has secured three IndyCar titles in four years and entered the race with four wins in the first five races. The race experienced a series of bizarre incidents, including a crash by Scott McLaughlin during warm-up laps and a pit road fire involving Alexander Rossi. Kyle Larson's attempt to complete "the double" ended prematurely due to a crash, allowing him to reach Charlotte in time for the Coca-Cola 600.</p>
