          <p>A federal judge has temporarily blocked the Trump administration's move to revoke Harvard University's ability to enroll international students. Harvard filed a lawsuit arguing that the revocation was a violation of the First Amendment and retaliation for rejecting government demands to control Harvard's governance and curriculum. The administration claimed that Harvard was fostering violence and antisemitism. Harvard's president condemned the action, stating that it threatened international students and scholars at colleges and universities throughout the country.</p>

          <p>Ruth Beaglehole, a parent educator and child rights activist, dedicated her life to promoting nonviolent parenting and countering "childism."

Beaglehole founded several institutions, including the Center for Nonviolent Education and Parenting. Her teachings, disseminated in classes and workshops, helped families break cycles of violence and oppression toward children, emphasizing that all behaviors are an attempt to get needs met and parents should support their children through struggles.</p>

          <p>A fund expert warns that the ETF market is facing an unprecedented surge in new product launches, potentially doubling in size within a month due to SEC rule changes. This influx could lead to over 7,000 ETFs, placing a significant burden on investors and advisors to navigate the options. While ETFs offer benefits like liquidity and low fees, investors should exercise caution with new and complex strategies, particularly in illiquid markets. The history of active managers failing to beat the index is a good reason to approach this growth with a healthy level of skepticism. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>A new study indicates that contrast-enhanced mammography can detect three times as many invasive cancers in women with dense breast tissue compared to ultrasound scans. The New York Times article notes that this method is also capable of finding smaller tumors than regular mammography, although MRI scans detect more tumors overall but are more expensive. The study suggests contrast-enhanced mammography should become standard care for high-risk women with dense breasts, though it is not yet FDA-approved for screening. The research involved over 9,000 women and found that contrast-enhanced mammography detected 19.2 cancers per 1,000 exams.</p>
