          <h2>SK Hynix Achieves Record Quarterly Profit and Revenue Amid High Demand for AI Memory Chips</h2>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>South Korean chipmaker SK Hynix announced record-breaking operating profit and revenue for the second quarter, significantly exceeding market expectations. This surge is attributed to the robust and sustained demand for its high bandwidth memory (HBM) chips, which are crucial components in artificial intelligence technologies for clients like Nvidia. The company expressed confidence for the remainder of 2025, citing stable customer inventories and anticipating further growth from new product launches and continued AI investments by major tech firms. This performance has intensified its competition with rival Samsung for dominance in the global memory market. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>The iconic Mexican group Los Bukis received a star on the Hollywood Walk of Fame, an honor they dedicated to the immigrant community in the United States. During the ceremony, frontman Marco Antonio Solís delivered an emotional speech, calling immigrants a "silent service force" that contributes immensely to the country. He offered words of support during what he described as "times of adversity," expressing hope for a swift and positive resolution to their challenges. The event, celebrated by figures like actor Demián Bichir, marked a significant milestone, with Solís becoming the only Hispanic artist to have two separate stars on the famous boulevard.</p>

          <h2>A Retrospective on Ozzy Osbourne and the Genesis of Black Sabbath's Heavy Metal Sound</h2>
          <div class="timestamp">2025-07-23 22:04:36 EDT</div>
        </div>
        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Following the death of Ozzy Osbourne at 76, this article reflects on how he and his band, Black Sabbath, pioneered the heavy metal genre. The band formed as a reaction against the prevalent "hippy-dippy" music of the late 1960s, aiming to create a sound that was darker and heavier. A key element was guitarist Tony Iommi's unique playing style, which he developed after an industrial accident and which became the foundation of the genre's signature sound. Despite initial critical dismissal and controversy over their supposedly satanic themes, Black Sabbath's music, from "Paranoid" to "Sabbath Bloody Sabbath," established a lasting and influential legacy in rock history.</p>

          <h2>Giants' Rafael Devers Expresses Preference for Playing Defense Over Designated Hitter Role</h2>

          <p>San Francisco Giants player Rafael Devers made a surprising admission after his debut at first base, stating he prefers playing a defensive position over being a full-time designated hitter. Devers explained that being on the field keeps him active and prevents him from overthinking his at-bats. This contrasts sharply with his time at the Boston Red Sox, where he had been adamant about exclusively handling DH duties following a public disagreement with the team's management over a potential position change. His debut at first base for the Giants coincided with a decisive 9-0 victory for his new team against the Atlanta Braves.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>South Korea's economy grew by 0.6% in the second quarter compared to the previous one, surpassing expectations and allowing the country to avoid a technical recession. The growth was primarily driven by a strong 4.2% increase in exports, particularly in semiconductors and chemical products, as firms reportedly expedited shipments ahead of potential U.S. tariff adjustments. Despite the positive quarter, economists express caution for the future, as domestic demand remains sluggish and the externally facing sectors could struggle under the threat of new trade policies. The outcome may influence the Bank of Korea's future decisions regarding interest rate cuts. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>German Chancellor Friedrich Merz and French President Emmanuel Macron met in Berlin, emphasizing their commitment to strengthening Franco-German cooperation in the face of significant global challenges. A key topic was the looming trade conflict with the United States, with President Trump threatening 30% tariffs on the EU if a deal is not reached by August. Both leaders affirmed they would coordinate a determined response to provide stability and maintain low tariffs. The meeting also aimed to address ongoing disagreements over joint defense projects, such as the next-generation fighter jet, and differing policies on energy and trade.</p>

          <p>The United States has finalized new trade agreements with Indonesia and the Philippines, which will see imports from these nations face a 19% tariff while U.S. exports will be duty-free. Analysts interpret this as an indirect strategy to counter China's economic influence by reshaping regional supply chains and securing access to resources like rare earth minerals. However, the effectiveness of this approach is questioned by some experts, who note that Chinese manufacturing has become less reliant on transshipments. Chinese firms are increasingly localizing production directly within Southeast Asian countries, potentially mitigating the impact of these new U.S. trade dynamics. (not investment advice)</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>While still considered a seller's market, recent trends in the U.S. housing market suggest a slight shift that could benefit homebuyers. An increase in the number of houses for sale, with 34% more sellers than buyers nationally in May, is creating more inventory. However, median home prices continue to hit record highs, driven by a lack of incentive for current homeowners with low interest rates to sell. Real estate experts advise prospective buyers to look for properties that have been on the market longer, as owners may be more willing to negotiate, and to explore first-time homebuyer programs to improve their chances.

          <p>Spanish midfielder Aitana Bonmati scored a crucial extra-time winner against Germany, sending Spain to its first-ever Women's Euro final. The goal marked a personal triumph for the two-time Ballon d'Or winner, who almost missed the tournament after being hospitalized with viral meningitis just days before it began. After a tense and closely contested match that remained scoreless through regular time, Bonmati's skillful finish in the 105th minute broke the deadlock. Her performance was hailed as a defining moment from a world-class player, demonstrating her resilience and ability to deliver under pressure for her team.</p>

          <p>NASA has successfully launched the twin TRACERS satellites, which are designed to study the interaction between the solar wind and Earth's magnetic field. This research aims to improve understanding and prediction of "space weather," phenomena that can disrupt satellites, power grids, and GPS communications. The identical spacecraft will fly in tandem, allowing for precise measurements of how energy from the sun couples with Earth's magnetosphere. The mission is considered critical for protecting both space-based assets and terrestrial infrastructure, ultimately helping to safeguard modern technological systems from solar-induced disturbances.</p>
