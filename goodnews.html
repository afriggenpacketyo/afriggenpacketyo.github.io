          <h2>Study Reveals Roses Were Likely Yellow Before Becoming Red</h2>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>A new evolutionary genetic analysis conducted by Chinese and Dutch researchers indicates that the first roses were likely yellow, despite the popular association of roses with the color red. The study, published in Nature Plants, examined domesticated and wild rose samples to determine that the common ancestor of roses probably had single-petal flowers with a yellow color and seven leaflets. Roses are one of the most extensively cultivated ornamental flowers in the world, coming in an array of shapes, sizes, and colors. The article highlights the findings of the study and the historical significance of roses as symbols of love and beauty.</p>
