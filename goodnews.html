          <h2>Ancient Horses Migrated Between Asia and North America via Land Bridge</h2>
          <div class="timestamp">2025-05-15 22:00:07 EDT</div>
        </div>
        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>A new study reveals that ancient horses repeatedly migrated between North America and Eurasia during the late Pleistocene era, approximately 50,000 to 13,000 years ago. This migration occurred when lower sea levels created a land bridge connecting the two continents. The research indicates genetic exchanges between horse populations in both directions, with fossils of Dalianensis horses found in northeastern China showing mixed ancestry from Eurasian and American populations. These Dalianensis horses, which lived around 17,000 years ago, were slightly larger than modern wild horses, highlighting the dynamic movement and genetic mixing of species across continents during this period.</p>

          <h2>Japan Revitalizes Rural Areas by Transforming Unstaffed Train Stations</h2>
          <div class="timestamp">2025-05-15 21:53:00 EDT</div>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Faced with severe depopulation in rural areas, Japan is repurposing unstaffed train stations and vacant homes into tourist accommodations. Transport operators are collaborating with local communities to convert these quiet outposts into hubs of activity, breathing new life into the surrounding areas. This creative approach aims to attract visitors and stimulate local economies, turning once-abandoned spaces into valuable assets for tourism and community engagement. The initiative showcases Japan's innovative strategies for addressing rural decline and preserving its cultural heritage.</p>

          <p>The United Arab Emirates (UAE) and the United States have reached an agreement for the UAE to construct the largest artificial intelligence (AI) campus outside the United States, signaling a significant shift in US policy. This agreement grants the UAE expanded access to advanced AI chips, potentially allowing the import of 500,000 of Nvidia‚Äôs most advanced AI chips per year starting in 2025. The deal reflects the Trump administration‚Äôs confidence in securely managing the technology, requiring US companies to manage the data centers. Despite concerns about China accessing the technology, top CEOs from AI and chip companies support the agreement, which includes the UAE investing in US data centers.</p>
