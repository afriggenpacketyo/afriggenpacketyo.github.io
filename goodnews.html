          <p>Tax filings released by Illinois Governor JB Pritzker's campaign revealed that he and his wife reported nearly $10.7 million in total income for 2024, which included over $1.4 million in gambling winnings. According to his campaign, the winnings came from playing blackjack at a Las Vegas casino during a vacation. Governor Pritzker, a Democrat often mentioned as a potential presidential candidate for 2028, plans to donate the full amount of his winnings to charity. The disclosure provides a glimpse into the personal finances of the prominent politician, who has frequently clashed with former President Donald Trump on various policy issues.</p>

          <p>A mass-produced Chinese electric SUV, the Jetour G700, successfully completed a 1.48km crossing of the Yangtze River, showcasing its advanced amphibious technology. The vehicle, equipped with two military-grade turbo thrusters and a highly waterproof design, traversed the river in 22 minutes, an event that attracted over 2.5 million viewers on a live stream. This achievement marks a significant step in civilian amphibious vehicle technology, a field historically dominated by Western companies.

          <p>British tennis player Emma Raducanu concluded her 2025 season after playing 50 matches for the first time in her career, showing signs of progress but also highlighting areas for improvement. Her year included strong performances at major tournaments but also struggles against top-10 opponents and a frustrating end due to illness and a recurring back injury. Despite these challenges, the 22-year-old has demonstrated increased physical robustness and a more potent serve, and will continue her partnership with coach Francisco Roig. She now has an 11-week off-season to recover and prepare for the 2026 tour, aiming for greater consistency against elite players.</p>

          <p>UK Chancellor Rachel Reeves has indicated that the government's next Budget will include "targeted action" to address ongoing cost of living challenges for households. While speaking at the IMF and World Bank meetings, she emphasized that both the government and the Bank of England share the responsibility of reducing inflation, which is forecast to be the highest among G7 nations. Measures being considered reportedly include cutting the 5% VAT on energy or reducing other levies on bills. Despite expectations of tax rises to meet borrowing rules, Reeves reiterated her commitment not to raise rates on income tax, VAT, or National Insurance.</p>

          <p>During Medicare's open enrollment period, many seniors face the choice between Medicare Advantage plans and Medigap supplemental insurance, a decision driven by differing priorities in healthcare coverage. While Medicare Advantage plans often attract enrollees with low premiums and bundled benefits like dental and vision, Medigap is often chosen for its greater flexibility and predictability. Seniors who opt for Medigap value the ability to see any doctor who accepts Medicare nationwide without network restrictions or referral requirements. Medigap also typically offers more stable out-of-pocket costs, which is crucial for those managing chronic conditions or anticipating frequent medical care.</p>

          <div class="timestamp">2025-10-16 10:40:00 EDT</div>
        </div>
        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>A World Health Organization report indicates a significant drop in tobacco consumption across Southeast Asia over the past two decades, attributing the success to strong government policies like higher taxes and advertising bans. Smoking prevalence in the region fell from 54% to 23% between 2000 and 2020. However, this public health achievement is now being challenged by the rapid rise of e-cigarettes, especially among adolescents. While some countries like Thailand and Singapore have banned vaping outright, others are hesitant to implement strict regulations, creating a new front in the region's fight against nicotine addiction.</p>

          <p>John Furner, the CEO of Walmart U.S., stated that the resurgence of American manufacturing is a real and beneficial trend for business, employment, and the country's supply chain. Speaking at a CNBC forum, he highlighted that nearly two-thirds of the products sold by Walmart are already made, grown, or assembled in the United States. The company is actively increasing its investments in domestic production, including a new beef processing facility in Kansas and a partnership to bring back the manufacturing of pharmaceuticals like amoxicillin. This strategic priority aims to create jobs and enhance the flexibility of Walmart's supply chain.</p>

          <p>Uber is launching a new initiative to provide its U.S. drivers and couriers with opportunities to earn money through the app even when they are not transporting people or food. The pilot program will offer small online tasks, such as uploading photos or recording voice prompts to help train artificial intelligence models. This move allows Uber to tap into its vast network of gig workers for data labeling and other micro-tasks, similar to platforms like Amazon's Mechanical Turk. The company also announced the expansion of its women rider preference feature to more cities.</p>

          <p>Cardiff is set to become one of the first UK cities to charge more for residential parking permits for heavier vehicles like SUVs, after the city council's cabinet approved the new 10-year parking plan. The policy aims to reduce congestion and emissions by introducing a surcharge for vehicles weighing over 2.4 tonnes, which the council argues cause more pollution and road wear, and pose a higher safety risk. While the exact cost increase has not been set, the plan is part of a broader strategy to encourage walking, cycling, and public transport use. The proposal has drawn mixed reactions from residents and tradespeople.</p>

          <p>Apple's senior vice president of services, Eddy Cue, has confirmed the company's interest in acquiring more sports broadcasting rights, but stressed that any deal must allow Apple to create a "unique and special" viewing experience. Cue expressed a desire to fix common frustrations for fans, such as regional blackouts and the need for multiple subscriptions, pointing to Apple TV's global, blackout-free MLS package as a model. He stated that Apple aims to differentiate its sports coverage with superior video quality and innovative features, rather than simply replicating traditional broadcasts. This strategy suggests a focus on comprehensive, league-wide deals over individual game packages.</p>

The company will begin testing an advanced feature for its Copilot assistant that can perform multi-step tasks on locally stored files, such as resizing photos or creating music playlists in other applications. This computer-use agent technology, which will be off by default and operate in a contained environment for safety, represents a significant step in integrating generative AI directly into the operating system's core functions.

Blackburn, a proponent of the Kids Online Safety Act, stressed the importance of data privacy, as personal information is used to train large language models, and called for rules to prevent the unauthorized use of an individual's name, image, or likeness by AI systems.</p>

          <p>Beta Technologies, a developer of electric vertical takeoff and landing (eVTOL) aircraft, has set its initial public offering price range, which could value the company as high as $7.2 billion. The Vermont-based company plans to sell 25 million shares to raise up to $825 million, joining other electric air taxi makers like Joby and Archer in tapping public markets. The move comes amid a resurgence in IPO activity and growing interest in the eVTOL sector, which aims to reduce urban traffic congestion. Despite more than doubling its revenue, Beta has not yet achieved profitability, reporting a net loss of $183 million in the first half of the year. (not investment advice)</p>
