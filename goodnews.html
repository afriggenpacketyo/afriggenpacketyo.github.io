          <p>U.S. Steel shares experienced a rally after President Trump approved its merger with Japan's Nippon Steel, contingent upon a national security agreement with the U.S. government. The agreement includes a golden share for the U.S. government, granting the president veto power over decisions to relocate U.S. Steel's headquarters, move the company outside the U.S., or close plants. The transaction, described by Trump as a "partnership," will result in U.S. Steel becoming a wholly-owned subsidiary of Nippon Steel North America. All regulatory approvals have been received, and the deal is expected to be completed promptly. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>Florida has announced the removal of 20 tons of invasive Burmese pythons from the Everglades, marking a milestone in the state's efforts to curb the population of these snakes. Biologists at the Conservancy of Southwest Florida have been instrumental in this progress, although experts acknowledge that complete eradication is unlikely. The removal efforts are showing some success, with anecdotal evidence of demographic shifts and fewer large pythons in certain areas. Harnessing public fascination with pythons, along with various removal programs and educational initiatives, has aided in maintaining support for these management efforts.</p>
