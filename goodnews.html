        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Manchester United's recent EFL Cup elimination by League Two side Grimsby Town is being highlighted as one of the most significant upsets in the history of English domestic cup competitions. The Premier League giant lost 12-11 on penalties after coming back from a 2-0 deficit to draw 2-2 in normal time. The article places this stunning result in the context of other memorable giant-killings, such as York City's 3-0 victory at Old Trafford in 1995 and non-league Sutton United's defeat of top-flight Coventry in 1989. The defeat underscores the unpredictable nature of cup football and the potential for lower-league teams to triumph against elite opposition.</p>

Raducanu delivered a confident and clinical performance, defeating Indonesian qualifier Janice Tjen 6-2, 6-1 in exactly one hour. In contrast, Norrie endured a grueling four-hour battle against Argentina's Francisco Comesaña, ultimately winning in four sets to set up a challenging match against Novak Djokovic. Raducanu, the 2021 champion, expressed positivity about her form and her ability to handle expectations as she prepares to face former Wimbledon champion Elena Rybakina.</p>

          <p>Nvidia reported quarterly earnings and revenue that exceeded Wall Street expectations, forecasting sales growth to remain above 50% for the current quarter. Despite the strong performance, driven by continued high demand for its AI infrastructure products, the company's stock declined in extended trading. This dip was attributed to data center revenue falling slightly short of analyst estimates for the second consecutive quarter. Overall revenue grew 56% year-over-year to $46.74 billion, marking the ninth straight quarter of over 50% growth since the generative AI boom began.</p>

          <p>Kinloch Castle, a grand Victorian-era hunting lodge on the Scottish Isle of Rum, is back on the market with an asking price of over £750,000. The sale, managed by government agency NatureScot, comes after a previous bid collapsed due to a dispute involving a government minister and community concerns. The island community, with a population of about 40, has stipulated that any new owner must commit to supporting the local community and environment. The historic but dilapidated castle requires extensive restoration, presenting a unique opportunity for a buyer to preserve a significant piece of Scottish heritage.</p>

          <p>U.S. Senator Alex Padilla avoided directly answering questions about a potential 2026 run for California governor, stating his current focus is on the upcoming special election to redraw the state's congressional districts. During a political summit, Padilla emphasized the importance of the November election as a countermeasure to Republican efforts to, in his words, "rig the system." While he did not rule out a gubernatorial bid, he pivoted to his long history of public service in California. The governor's race remains open after former Vice President Kamala Harris declined to run, leaving a large portion of voters undecided.</p>

          <p>Google's YouTube TV and Fox Corp. have agreed to a short-term contract extension, preventing Fox channels from being removed from the streaming service. The temporary truce came just before a deadline that would have blacked out channels like Fox News and Fox Sports for millions of subscribers. The dispute centers on the programming fees YouTube TV pays to carry Fox's content, with YouTube claiming Fox is demanding unfairly high rates. This extension allows viewers to continue watching popular sports, including the upcoming college and NFL football seasons, while the two companies continue to negotiate a new long-term agreement.</p>

          <p>A Florida official has stated that the controversial immigration detention facility in the Everglades, known as "Alligator Alcatraz," will have zero detainees within a few days. The announcement was made in an email from Kevin Guthrie, the head of the Florida Division of Emergency Management. The facility has been the target of lawsuits, one of which successfully halted the transfer of new detainees to the site. The closure of this center comes as Governor Ron DeSantis's administration announced the opening of a new immigration detention facility in the state, which has been named "Deportation Depot."</p>

          <p>With car payments increasingly exceeding $1,000 per month, automotive resource Edmunds has outlined five common mistakes for consumers to avoid. These include buying a vehicle outside one's means, relying solely on dealership financing instead of securing pre-approval, and trading in a car with negative equity. The analysis also advises working with a dealership's internet sales team to secure better pricing and considering certified pre-owned vehicles to avoid the steep depreciation of a new car. Avoiding these pitfalls can save buyers thousands of dollars and prevent long-term financial strain in a challenging auto market.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>With a Federal Reserve interest rate cut appearing highly likely in September, savers are advised to take strategic actions now to maximize returns on certificates of deposit (CDs). Experts suggest shopping online for the highest available rates, as online banks typically offer better returns than traditional brick-and-mortar institutions. It is also crucial to accurately determine the amount one can afford to deposit to avoid early withdrawal penalties. Locking in the longest-term CD that fits one's budget can secure a higher rate before they fall, protecting principal and maximizing interest earnings over time. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>Homeowners seeking financing may find a Home Equity Line of Credit (HELOC) to be a particularly sensible option this September. HELOCs currently offer some of the lowest borrowing rates available, significantly cheaper than personal loans or credit cards. With the Federal Reserve expected to cut interest rates, the variable rates on HELOCs are positioned to become even more affordable. Furthermore, with average home equity levels reaching record highs, homeowners have a larger pool of funds to draw from for major expenses or investments. (not investment advice)</p>

Although overall sales declined, the company's performance was stronger than anticipated, leading it to narrow its full-year sales forecast to the higher end of its previous guidance.
