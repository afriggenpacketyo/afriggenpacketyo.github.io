          <h2>White House Clarifies Trump's Veterans Day Proclamation</h2>
          <div class="timestamp">2025-05-02 21:31:25 EDT</div>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Following President Trump's announcement to rename Veterans Day as "Victory Day for World War I," the White House clarified that it will be an additional proclamation, not a replacement. Press Secretary Karoline Leavitt emphasized that Veterans Day will not be renamed but supplemented with another proclamation. Trump also intends to designate May 8 as "Victory Day for World War II." Establishing federal holidays requires congressional approval, and this action sparked confusion and backtracking within the administration. This article provides live updates on the Trump administration's policies and announcements.</p>

          <p>A federal judge permanently struck down an executive order by Donald Trump that targeted the law firm Perkins Coie, which had worked with Hillary Clinton's 2016 campaign. Judge Beryl Howell deemed the order unconstitutional, violating the first, fifth, and sixth amendments. The executive order restricted Perkins Coie's access to federal buildings and government employees, which Howell called retaliatory and discriminatory. The judge criticized the order's broad reach, requiring companies with government contracts to disclose any work with Perkins Coie, regardless of relevance. The Trump administration is expected to appeal the ruling.</p>

          <p>This article explores the rising rates of autism diagnoses, examining whether the increase reflects a genuine rise in autistic individuals or changes in diagnostic criteria. It notes that autism diagnoses have increased significantly, particularly among women and adults, but a rise in diagnoses does not necessarily indicate a rise in the number of autistic people. Factors contributing to the increase include broadened diagnostic criteria, better recognition of autism in women, and greater awareness leading to more diagnoses in adults with milder forms of autism. The article also touches on the tensions within the autistic community regarding the diversity of experiences and perceptions of autism.</p>

          <p>Australians are heading to the polls to elect a new government, facing challenges such as inflation, housing affordability, and navigating relations with the US and China. Prime Minister Anthony Albanese and opposition leader Peter Dutton are vying for leadership amid economic concerns and global turmoil. Voters are primarily focused on cost-of-living issues, but both parties have offered only small-scale solutions. The election also reflects cultural divides and a shift away from major parties, with independent candidates gaining traction. This New York Times article provides context on the key issues and political dynamics shaping the Australian election.</p>

          <p>Health and Human Services Secretary Robert F. Kennedy Jr. will require new vaccines to undergo placebo testing, a move described as a "radical departure" from past practices. The policy change would mandate studies comparing new vaccines against a placebo to assess safety and efficacy. It remains unclear what HHS considers a "new" vaccine and whether this includes updated flu and COVID vaccines. Kennedy has long questioned vaccine safety and advocated for placebo-based trials. The article notes the existing safety monitoring processes for vaccines and the ethical considerations of placebo-controlled trials when effective vaccines already exist.</p>

          <p>Singapore is holding elections amidst global economic uncertainty, testing the popularity of the long-ruling People's Action Party (PAP). While the PAP is expected to retain power, discontent over rising costs of living and housing affordability is fueling the opposition. The election may serve as a referendum on Prime Minister Lawrence Wong's leadership. The opposition has criticized the PAP for its short campaigning period and gerrymandering, while the PAP defends its track record of stability and prosperity. This New York Times article examines the political landscape and key issues in the Singapore election.</p>

          <p>The Trump administration has agreed not to freeze funds to Maine schools after the state challenged the president's demand to bar trans girls from girls' sports. The USDA will halt efforts to withhold funds for a child nutrition program in Maine. Governor Janet Mills confronted Trump directly at the White House and vowed to challenge the decision in court. A federal judge had already ordered the administration to unfreeze funds. The settlement does not affect another ongoing lawsuit filed by the Trump administration against the Maine department of education over its policy for trans athletes.</p>
