          <p>India has surpassed China as the leading exporter of smartphones to the United States, according to a new report from Canalys. In the second quarter, smartphones assembled in India accounted for 44% of U.S. imports, a significant increase driven primarily by Apple's strategic shift in its manufacturing supply chain. This move reflects a broader trend of global manufacturers diversifying away from China amid ongoing trade uncertainties and tariffs. The shift highlights India's growing role as a major hub for electronics assembly for the U.S. market. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>This article details the challenging journey of Indian cricketer Akash Deep, who recently achieved a five-wicket haul in a Test match against England. Hailing from a small village in Bihar, Deep overcame significant personal tragedy, including the death of his father and brother, which forced him to pause his cricket career for nearly three years. With the support of a childhood friend and a determined move to Bengal, he reignited his dream, eventually earning a spot in the IPL and the national team. His recent performance is dedicated to his sister, who is battling cancer.</p>

          <p>The European Union is launching a major initiative to build a network of "AI gigafactories" to bolster its technological sovereignty and compete with the U.S. and China in artificial intelligence. With public funding of 10 billion euros and a goal of attracting significant private investment, the plan aims to create centralized ecosystems combining computing power, data, and talent. These facilities are designed to help thousands of European AI startups overcome limited computing capacity. Despite challenges like high energy costs, the EU has received extensive interest, viewing this as a crucial step in a new industrial revolution. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>Volunteer crew members for the Royal National Lifeboat Institution (RNLI) are defending their work of rescuing migrants in the English Channel, stating they make no apologies for saving lives at sea. Facing accusations of acting as a "taxi service," the crew emphasizes their non-political, compassionate mission to aid anyone in distress, as tasked by the Coastguard. The RNLI released harrowing images from a rescue to show the reality of their operations, where they saved 19 people from a capsized dinghy. Crew members assert their focus is on people, not politics, driven by a duty to help in distressing times.</p>

          <p>Chinese Foreign Minister Wang Yi has called on his new South Korean counterpart, Cho Hyun, to pursue an independent foreign policy and resist "decoupling" from China. In their first official phone call, Wang emphasized the need for a stable and predictable China policy from Seoul to foster pragmatic cooperation. The conversation signals Beijing's effort to reset relations with South Korea's new administration under President Lee Jae-myung, who is viewed as more China-friendly than his predecessor. Both ministers affirmed their commitment to advancing their strategic cooperative partnership in a mature and steady manner.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>To combat its looming demographic crisis, the Chinese government has announced its first nationwide subsidy program to encourage more births. The policy will offer parents 3,600 yuan (about $500) annually for each child under the age of three, a move expected to benefit around 20 million families. This national initiative follows various local pilot programs and comes as China's population fell for a third consecutive year in 2024. The country faces a rapidly aging population and one of the world's highest costs for raising children, making these financial incentives a key part of its strategy.</p>

          <p>Germany's Chancellor Friedrich Merz is meeting with Jordan's King Abdullah II to coordinate a humanitarian airlift of aid into the Gaza Strip. The move comes amid mounting international pressure on Israel to alleviate a devastating humanitarian crisis, with widespread concerns of starvation. A recent survey shows that 74% of Germans believe their government should apply more pressure on Israel to address the situation. While the chancellor acknowledged the airlift would be a small contribution, it represents a tangible effort by international partners to deliver desperately needed supplies to the besieged enclave.</p>

          <p>Dodgers pitcher Yoshinobu Yamamoto delivered a masterful performance, leading his team to a 5-2 victory against the Cincinnati Reds. The Japanese star pitched seven superb innings, allowing only one run on four hits while striking out nine batters. After a shaky period mid-season, Yamamoto appears to have returned to his dominant form, improving his record to 9-7 with a 2.48 ERA. His performance was supported by key offensive plays, including a two-run double from Shohei Ohtani. The start kicks off what the Dodgers hope will be a strong stretch for their star-studded starting rotation.</p>

          <p>The postponement of Taiwanese President Lai Ching-te's planned stopover in the United States could help ease tensions with Beijing and clear a path for a potential meeting between Chinese President Xi Jinping and U.S. President Donald Trump. Washington reportedly informed Lai that he could not stop in New York, a move that avoids provoking China, which views such visits as a challenge to its sovereignty. Taiwan's Presidential Office cited domestic issues, including typhoon recovery efforts, as the reason for delaying the trip. The decision is seen as a diplomatic de-escalation in the sensitive U.S.-China-Taiwan relationship.</p>

          <p>U.S. President Donald Trump's recent visit to his Scottish golf courses provided UK Prime Minister Keir Starmer with invaluable, if unconventional, diplomatic access. The trip, though notionally private, involved extensive one-on-one talks and a lengthy, free-wheeling press conference, allowing Starmer to burnish his relationship with the American president. Downing Street views this access as crucial for aligning on key issues, particularly Gaza, where Trump's language appeared to toughen. The visit highlights the unique, personal nature of diplomacy with Trump and the UK's strategy of navigating it to advance its interests.</p>
