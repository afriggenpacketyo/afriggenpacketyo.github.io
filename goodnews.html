          <p>The Ojai Music Festival, directed by Claire Chase, featured a performance of Susie Ibarra's "Sky Islands," which recently won the Pulitzer Prize for music. Ibarra's work evokes the upper rainforests of the Philippines, blending sounds of nature with gongs and string quartets. The festival highlighted composers focused on eco-sonics and the connection between nature and music. Ibarra's ability to mimic nature's sounds and connect with the underground resonated with the audience. </p>
