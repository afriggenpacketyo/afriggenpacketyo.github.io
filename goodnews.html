          <p>A happiness expert, after 15 years of study, reveals that long-term happiness is significantly influenced by one's approach to aging and the quality of their friendships. Five "counterintuitive yet empowering" habits include embracing one's felt age, being a reliable friend, increasing social frequency, not fearing new beginnings, and creating irreplaceable traditions. These practices foster agency and well-being, moving beyond reliance on external circumstances for contentment. The study found that the happiest participants felt that way due to their own intentional actions.</p>

Despite a 5% drop in Cisco's stock since its recent earnings report, the Trust views this pullback as an overreaction and an opportunity to strengthen its position. The article highlights Cisco's strong momentum in AI infrastructure, with over $2 billion in orders for fiscal year 2025 from hyperscale customers, indicating significant future growth potential.

This initiative follows a series of White House meetings involving Trump, Zelenskyy, and European leaders, where security guarantees for Ukraine were a key discussion point. Trump expressed hope for flexibility from both sides, suggesting a trilateral meeting with him would follow if initial talks progress positively. The urgency stems from a desire to prevent further loss of life in the ongoing conflict.</p>

A Certified Financial Planner advises that investors, especially newer ones, should continuously assess their risk tolerance and diversify their portfolios with a mix of stocks and high-quality bonds. Exchange-traded funds (ETFs) are highlighted as a cost-effective way to achieve broad market exposure. Buffer ETFs are also discussed as a tool for downside protection, though they come with higher fees and limited upside. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>A Condor Airlines flight from Corfu, Greece, to Dusseldorf, Germany, made an emergency landing in Brindisi, Italy, after the flight crew observed a "reaction near the engine" and shut it down in a controlled manner. Passengers reported seeing flames, though the airline could not confirm an engine fire. No injuries were reported among the 273 passengers and eight crew members. Some passengers spent the night at the airport due to insufficient hotel capacity, but all eventually reached their destination, with the airline arranging a replacement aircraft.</p>

          <p>Excel Dryer, a Massachusetts-based electric hand dryer manufacturer, has achieved its goal of sourcing 100% of its parts domestically by 2023. This move allowed the company to avoid Trump's China tariffs, a decision solidified by the tariff increases. The executive vice-president noted the difficulty of finding a motor supplier outside China, a search that took eight tough years. This case demonstrates a successful, albeit challenging, shift towards reshoring manufacturing and supply chains, highlighting a growing trend in American industry.</p>

          <p>This opinion article addresses the enduring and polarizing disputes in the South China Sea, stemming from conflicting national interests and incomplete post-World War II territorial arrangements. It highlights the "mutually exclusive" narratives, where one side's defensive actions are seen as aggressive by the other, hindering de-escalation. The author suggests a joint, fact-based, and truly collaborative process as a potential starting point to narrow the deep-rooted historical and legal perception gap and move towards a peaceful resolution. This approach is crucial for regional stability.</p>

          <p>Rudi Gernreich, an Austrian-born designer, invented the thong bathing suit in 1974 as a political act of rebellion against a nudity ban in Los Angeles. Gernreich, a pioneer of body positivity and LGBTQ+ rights, sought to liberate the body and challenge societal "sexual hang-ups," not sexualize. His designs often explored unisex fashion and body movement, including the groundbreaking topless monokini in 1964.

The previous UK demand led Apple to restrict advanced data protection options for new British customers.

Despite its ancient origins, the drink's renewed popularity is less about its traditional taste and more about its customizable nature, allowing consumers to dilute its flavor with various additions. This trend reflects a broader cultural shift towards individualized self-improvement rituals and a need for "consensus reality" in an increasingly isolated, hyper-consumerist society.
