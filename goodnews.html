        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Japan's new farm minister, Shinjiro Koizumi, announced plans to sell government-stockpiled rice directly to retailers, targeting a retail price of 2,000 yen per 5 kg to combat soaring prices. This move comes amid criticism of the government's failure to curb rice price spikes, which have hurt households as inflation outpaces wage growth. The government intends to commence procedures for negotiated contracts, including exploring online sales through Rakuten, to ensure broad distribution. The average price of rice in Japanese supermarkets reached a record 4,268 yen per 5 kg in early May, prompting the government to initially release 300,000 tons of rice.</p>

          <p>Former U.S. President Donald Trump has reportedly approved Nippon Steel's plan to acquire U.S. Steel, a move welcomed by both companies despite previous concerns about national security risks. Trump touted the "partnership" as one that would create at least 70,000 jobs and deliver a $14 billion boost to the U.S. economy. The Committee on Foreign Investment in the United States had previously reviewed the acquisition plan, and President Biden had issued an order to block the deal, citing national security grounds. The potential acquisition has been a bilateral diplomatic matter, discussed between Trump and Japanese Prime Minister Shigeru Ishiba.</p>

          <p>The Pentagon briefly lost contact with an Army Black Hawk helicopter on May 1, causing two commercial jets to abort their landings at Ronald Reagan Washington National Airport. The 20-second loss of contact occurred as the helicopter neared the Pentagon, attributed to a temporary antenna setup during control tower construction. The Army stated there were no deviations from approved flight paths and no risk of intersecting air traffic. The incident added to concerns about close calls between government helicopters and commercial airplanes, following a fatal midair collision in January.</p>

          <p>China has greenlit a mega-project to construct a 767-kilometer-long canal linking the inland province of Jiangxi to the coastal province of Zhejiang. The Jiangxi-Zhejiang Canal is part of a larger effort to connect Guangdong, Jiangxi, and Zhejiang by water, aiming to lower logistical costs and integrate inland regions with wealthier coastal hubs. The canal, expected to cost $44.4 billion, will facilitate the transport of resources like rare earth and copper from Jiangxi, a growing manufacturing hub for electric vehicles, to Zhejiang's seaports.</p>

          <p>The European Union's trade chief emphasized the need for a trade deal with the U.S. based on "respect" rather than "threats" following President Trump's threat to impose a 50% tariff on all goods sent to the United States from the EU. EU Trade Commissioner Maros Sefcovic affirmed the EU's commitment to securing a mutually beneficial deal. European governments warned that higher tariffs would be damaging to both sides, advocating for negotiations as the best way forward.</p>

          <p>Irish-language hip-hop trio Kneecap performed their biggest festival headline gig shortly after a band member, Liam √ìg √ì hAnnaidh, was charged with a terror offence. At the Wide Awake festival, √ì hAnnaidh addressed the charges, calling them "political policing" and urging fans to support Palestine. The concert followed a smaller "secret" set and saw fans wearing Irish and Palestinian flags. Some critics label Kneecap as dangerous upstarts, while supporters see them as relatable provocateurs giving a voice to the oppressed.</p>

          <p>The White House is trimming and restructuring the National Security Council (NSC), following the appointment of Marco Rubio as national security adviser.
