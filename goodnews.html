          <p>An escaped zebra caused traffic disruptions in Tennessee after it was reported missing by its owners, who had acquired it the previous night. The zebra was seen running along Interstate 24, leading to lane closures for safety reasons as deputies attempted to manage the situation. The Rutherford County Sheriff's Office reported that the zebra ran through traffic on both sides of the highway, creating chaos for drivers. The article does not specify how the owners obtained the zebra or where it was being housed at the time of its escape, leaving several questions unanswered.</p>

          <p>The Trump administration remains optimistic that the Alaska LNG project, a massive liquified natural gas initiative, will attract investors despite its $40 billion price tag. Energy Secretary Chris Wright believes that securing commercial offtakers for the gas will facilitate financing, with countries seeking to reduce their trade deficit with the U.S. as potential buyers. However, energy analysts express skepticism about the project's commercial viability, noting its decades-long planning phase without significant progress. The administration plans to build the project in stages, initially serving domestic demand in Alaska, with the Department of Defense ready to support the project with its resources.</p>

          <p>Leaders from the fashion industry, including Vogue Editor-in-Chief Anna Wintour, met with White House officials to discuss potential tariff relief.

The discussion aimed to explore balanced trade policies that would maintain jobs in the U.S. and preserve American prosperity. There has been tension between Anna Wintour and Melania Trump, as the former First Lady was never featured on the cover of Vogue.</p>

          <p>The San Diego County Water Authority and the Metropolitan Water District of Southern California have settled a 15-year legal dispute over water costs, establishing a fixed price for delivering supplies. The agreement resolves disagreements about the price the Water Authority pays MWD for Colorado River water secured through deals with the Imperial Irrigation District. This settlement is expected to foster greater collaboration, improve finances, and facilitate the movement of water to areas in need.

          <p>The Trump administration has reversed its decision to close eight California outposts of the U.S. Department of Agriculture, following pressure from Democratic lawmakers. These lawmakers argued that closing the offices would severely hamper the USDA's ability to support farmers in California, the nation's largest agricultural state. The original closure plans were part of a broader effort to reduce government spending, but the reversal ensures that farmers retain access to vital resources. The USDA office in Mt. Shasta remains under discussion.</p>
