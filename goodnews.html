          <p>American shoppers continue to drive strong sales in the jewelry market, standing in contrast to weaker consumer sentiment in Europe and China. Danish brand Pandora reported an 8% rise in U.S. sales for the second quarter, while ultra-luxury group Richemont also saw a significant jump in its Americas sales. This trend is occurring despite challenges like potential tariffs, a weakening dollar, and rising costs of precious metals like silver and gold. While the U.S. market remains robust, industry leaders acknowledge that these economic pressures could eventually impact consumer demand. (not investment advice)</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Shares of online real estate company Opendoor surged approximately 10% following the resignation of CEO Carrie Wheeler. Her departure comes after an intense pressure campaign from investors, including hedge fund manager Eric Jackson and co-founder Keith Rabois, who were dissatisfied with the company's turnaround efforts. Opendoor, which went public via a SPAC in 2020, has struggled with rising interest rates and a difficult housing market, though its stock has seen a recent resurgence. The company has named its technology chief as an interim leader while it begins a search for a new CEO.</p>

        </div>
        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Despite rising home prices nationwide, mansions with at least 5,000 square feet of space are available for under $1 million in a few U.S. metropolitan areas. A Zillow analysis identifies Buffalo, Indianapolis, Cleveland, and Memphis as cities where the median mansion price remains below this threshold. This affordability contrasts sharply with coastal markets like San Jose, where the median mansion is valued at $6.5 million. The more affordable large homes are typically older, and their availability reflects broader regional housing market trends where overall costs are lower compared to the rest of the country.</p>

          <p>Krish Kandiah, a theologian and head of the Sanctuary Foundation charity, has offered an "olive branch" to UK Shadow Justice Secretary Robert Jenrick following a public dispute. Kandiah had previously accused Jenrick of xenophobia during a BBC radio segment for comments the politician made about migrants from "backward countries." The BBC later apologized and edited the segment. In a subsequent social media message, Kandiah expressed a desire to work with Jenrick to de-escalate tensions and focus on core issues like housing and jobs rather than anti-immigrant sentiment.</p>

          <p>King Charles III and Queen Camilla attended a remembrance service at the National Memorial Arboretum to mark the 80th anniversary of Victory over Japan Day. The event honored the 33 surviving veterans, aged 96 to 105, who served in the Far East and Pacific during World War II. In an audio message, the King praised the courage and sacrifice of the "Forgotten Army" and acknowledged the immense suffering of both Allied forces and Japanese civilians. The ceremony included wreath-layings, a two-minute silence, and a flypast, commemorating the final end of the war on August 15, 1945.</p>

          <p>With U.S. credit card debt surpassing $1.21 trillion, many households struggle with managing their balances. For a $3,000 balance, the minimum monthly payment typically ranges from $55 to $85, depending on the issuer's calculation method, which often combines a percentage of the balance with accrued interest. Simply paying the minimum is a costly strategy that can prolong debt for years due to compounding interest. To escape this trap, consumers can employ strategies like balance transfers to 0% APR cards, debt consolidation loans, or negotiating with lenders through credit counseling or hardship programs.

          <p>Following reports that the Trump administration is considering taking a government stake in Intel, a technology analyst has described the potential intervention as essential for national security. The move would aim to revive the struggling chipmaker and reduce U.S. dependence on foreign semiconductor manufacturers like Samsung and Taiwan Semiconductor. While government ownership of private enterprise is typically avoided, proponents argue it is necessary to ensure a reliable domestic supply of critical technology. The news caused Intel's stock to climb, with shares on track for their best week in over 25 years. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>Associated British Foods (ABF), the owner of the Kingsmill bread brand, has announced an agreement to purchase its rival Hovis. The merger would create the largest bread producer in the United Kingdom, surpassing current market leader Warburtons. ABF plans to implement cost-cutting measures to make the combined entity profitable, as both brands have faced declining sales amid shifting consumer preferences toward specialty breads and lower-carbohydrate diets. The deal, which is valued at an estimated £75 million, will require approval from the UK's competition regulator to proceed.</p>

Communications were successfully re-established, and the plane was safely escorted to Stansted Airport. A sonic boom occurs when an aircraft exceeds the speed of sound, and the noise generated widespread reports on social media from residents who thought an explosion had occurred.</p>

          <p>All-rounder Jacob Bethell, at 21 years old, is set to become the youngest man to captain England in international cricket. He will lead an understrength T20 squad for a three-match series against Ireland in September, as regular captain Harry Brook and other key players are being rested. The appointment is a significant show of faith in Bethell, who has had limited playing time this summer but is highly regarded by England's selectors. The record for the youngest captain was previously held by Monty Bowden, who was 23 when he led the team in 1889.</p>
