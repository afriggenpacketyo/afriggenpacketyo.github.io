          <p>Hours before his assassination, conservative activist Charlie Kirk posted on social media about a Wall Street Journal article concerning a Kentucky child custody law that presumes equal parenting time is in a child's best interest. The article he shared noted the law's correlation with a falling divorce rate and its growing adoption in other states. Kirk's post highlighted polling data showing that shared parenting policies have overwhelming bipartisan support among voters, suggesting that political candidates who champion such laws could gain a significant electoral advantage in key swing states.</p>

          <p>Ed Langevin, a retired grandfather, experienced severe heartburn, nausea, and a 20-pound weight loss, which was eventually diagnosed as chronic mesenteric ischemia, a rare condition caused by blocked arteries restricting blood flow to the small intestine. His condition was successfully treated with a minimally invasive stent procedure performed by Dr. Gabriel Wallace at Northwestern Medicine. After a follow-up procedure to address some scarring, Langevin has made a full recovery, regaining his weight and quality of life, and now advocates for patients to persist in seeking answers for their health problems.</p>

          <p>A select group of seven high-valued private technology companies, including OpenAI, SpaceX, and Anthropic, have seen their combined valuation nearly double in the past year to $1.3 trillion, according to Forge Global. This surge is overwhelmingly driven by the artificial intelligence boom, which has funneled vast amounts of capital into the private market and reshaped investor priorities. With such significant private funding available, these leading AI firms have little incentive to go public, allowing them to scale rapidly while remaining outside the traditional stock market.</p>

          <p>Following his death at age 89, Robert Redford is being remembered not only for his iconic acting roles in films like "Butch Cassidy and the Sundance Kid" and "All the President's Men," but also for his profound impact as a director and mentor. His most enduring legacy is the Sundance Institute and Film Festival, which he founded to support independent and risk-taking filmmakers. Through Sundance, he championed the careers of countless influential artists, including the Coen Brothers and Quentin Tarantino, effectively recycling his own success to create opportunities for new generations.</p>

          <h2>German States Update Burial Laws to Allow for River Burials and Keeping Urns at Home</h2>
          <div class="timestamp">2025-09-20 07:57:00 EDT</div>
        </div>
        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>The German states of Rhineland-Palatinate and Saxony-Anhalt have passed new legislation to modernize burial practices, reflecting changing social attitudes toward mourning. The new laws will permit river burials in the Rhine and other major rivers, allow families to keep a loved one's urn at home, and enable the creation of "memorial diamonds" from ashes. While undertakers' associations have welcomed the changes as overdue, the move has been criticized by Christian churches concerned about the potential loss of dignity and the decline of traditional cemeteries.</p>

          <h2>Financial Experts Suggest '20-4-10' Rule as a Guideline for Affordable Car Purchases</h2>

          <p>To help car shoppers manage costs and avoid debt, financial planners recommend the "20-4-10" rule as a helpful guideline. This framework suggests making a down payment of at least 20% of the vehicle's price, financing the car for no more than four years, and ensuring that total monthly vehicle expenses—including payment, insurance, and fuel—do not exceed 10% of your monthly income. Following this rule can help prevent becoming "upside down" on a car loan, where you owe more than the vehicle is worth, and keeps transportation costs from overwhelming your budget.</p>

          <p>In his new book "Breakneck," analyst Dan Wang examines the divergent paths of the U.S. and China, framing the competition as one between a "lawyerly society" and an "engineering state." He argues that while America's leadership is dominated by lawyers focused on procedure, China's engineer-led government has prioritized physical dynamism, resulting in vast infrastructure and a robust manufacturing base. Wang provocatively suggests that despite China's authoritarian flaws, its successes in industrial policy and construction hold valuable lessons for a physically stagnant United States.</p>

          <p>Robert Fortunato's "Green Idea House" in Hermosa Beach, California, has been producing more energy than it consumes for over a decade, demonstrating the feasibility of sustainable living. By retrofitting his 1959 home with solar panels, electric appliances, and passive design features like strategic overhangs and a "thermal chimney," he eliminated his family's utility bills for less than the cost of a conventional remodel. The project highlights that while achieving net-zero energy requires significant research and planning, it can be done with off-the-shelf technologies available to any homeowner.</p>

          <p>A wave of intense, youth-led protests in Nepal, largely organized by "Gen Z" activists, has resulted in the overthrow of the government and the appointment of the country's first female prime minister, former chief justice Sushila Karki. The upheaval was fueled by widespread public anger over government corruption and the lavish lifestyles of political elites, which activists highlighted through viral social media campaigns. The protests turned violent after police opened fire on demonstrators, leading to the prime minister's resignation within 48 hours and marking a dramatic generational shift in the nation's politics.</p>
