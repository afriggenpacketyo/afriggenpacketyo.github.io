          <p>President Donald Trump served as the commencement speaker for this year's U.S. Military Academy graduates at West Point, amidst the administration's crackdown on diversity, equity, and inclusion programs within military academies. Since assuming office, Trump and Defense Secretary Pete Hegseth have advocated for significant changes, leading to the disbanding of student clubs like the National Society of Black Engineers and the removal of books addressing diversity from U.S. Naval Academy libraries. Former West Point teachers have criticized these actions, arguing they undermine the values and education of the academies. Protests were planned during the ceremony, both outside the academy and on the Hudson River.</p>

          <p>Experts are working to save Florida‚Äôs coral reefs by planting over 1,000 nursery-grown elkhorn coral juveniles, aiming to reverse the severe decline caused by record ocean heat and climate change. The Florida Keys have lost 90% of their coral cover in the last 40 years. Marine biologists from the Keys Marine Laboratory and the Florida Aquarium have partnered to develop a large-scale restoration project, focusing on the fast-growing and resilient elkhorn coral. The project involves spawning genetically diverse corals and planting them at seven offshore sites, with teams monitoring their progress.

          <p>President Trump is considering taking Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac public, potentially ending 17 years of federal control over the U.S. housing market. This move, supported by investor Bill Ackman, could benefit investors but raises concerns about mortgage market stability. Fannie and Freddie, which guarantee trillions in mortgages, were bailed out during the 2008 recession and placed under federal conservatorship. Critics warn that privatization could increase mortgage rates, while supporters argue it could provide a windfall to taxpayers. The administration's decision will hinge on the impact on long-term mortgage rates and market safety.</p>

          <p>A German police chief has warned of increasing radicalization among young people, prompting heightened vigilance and security measures. Meanwhile, Interior Minister Alexander Dobrindt has intensified border controls, resulting in over 1,500 people being turned back at the border. The stricter measures have drawn criticism from migration researchers, who question their effectiveness and legality under EU law. Police also warn that the intensified border checks are unsustainable in the long term.</p>

          <h2>Mental Health A&E Centers to Open Across England</h2>

          <p>Specialist mental health crisis centers will be opened across England over the next decade in an attempt to reduce crowding in accident and emergency departments. The NHS plans to expand the scheme nationally to "dozens of locations", as part of its ten-year NHS plan. These clinics will be open to walk-in patients as well as those referred by GPs and police, with specialist staff present to treat people in acute mental distress. However, concerns remain about funding and the integration of mental and physical health services.</p>

          <p>The European Union's trade chief emphasized the need for a trade deal with the US based on "respect" rather than "threats", following President Donald Trump's threat to impose a 50% tariff on all goods from the EU. EU Trade Commissioner Maros Sefcovic affirmed the EU's commitment to a mutually beneficial agreement. European governments warned that higher tariffs would be damaging to both sides. The EU remains one of Washington's largest trading partners, with significant trade volumes in both directions.</p>

          <h2>Zoos to Implement Animal Welfare Reforms with More Enclosure Space</h2>
          <div class="timestamp">2025-05-24 02:16:57 EDT</div>
        </div>
        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Zoos in Britain will be legally required to provide animals with more enclosure space as part of animal welfare reforms. The new standards, published by the Department for Environment Food & Rural Affairs (Defra), will modernize zoo practices for the first time in over a decade. Key changes include larger habitats for elephants and an end to practices such as long-term tethering of birds of prey. Zoos and aquariums have a two-year timeline to adapt to the changes.</p>

          <h2>Young Chinese Delay Retirement Plans Amid Economic Slowdown</h2>
          <div class="timestamp">2025-05-24 02:00:13 EDT</div>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Young people in China are putting retirement plans on hold due to rising job uncertainty, stagnant wages, and housing pressures amid a slowing economy. Most young employees interviewed by the South China Morning Post said they are too preoccupied with present circumstances to think about old age. The government has urged young people to begin planning early for retirement, but many are focused on living well in the present rather than worrying about the distant future.</p>
