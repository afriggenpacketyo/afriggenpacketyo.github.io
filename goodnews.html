          <p>CK Asset Holdings has issued a formal statement denying widespread social media rumors that Hong Kong's wealthiest family, the Lis, are selling their iconic residence at 79 Deep Water Bay Road. The company, on behalf of chairman Victor Li Tzar-kuoi, labeled the speculation as "entirely fabricated" and "groundless." The denial comes during a period of economic strain in Hong Kong, where high interest rates have forced some other prominent families to sell assets.

          <p>China's central bank is intensifying efforts to internationalize the yuan, viewing recent questions about the U.S. dollar's stability as a strategic opportunity. The bank announced plans to accelerate the yuan's use in global trade, enhance its financing functions, and strengthen offshore markets. This initiative includes developing overseas clearing banks through its Cross-border Interbank Payment System (CIPS). This marks the first time in three years that yuan internationalization has been a dedicated section in the central bank's midyear policy meeting readout. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>The UK Home Office has committed an additional £100 million in funding to intensify its crackdown on illegal people-smuggling operations in the English Channel. The investment will support up to 300 new National Crime Agency officers and provide new technology to disrupt criminal gangs. This move comes as the number of people crossing the Channel in small boats has reached a record high for this point in the year, exceeding 25,000. The government aims to show it is taking firm action to secure the border and dismantle the networks facilitating these dangerous journeys.</p>

There, the man found the dog's owners, a man and a woman, unresponsive. He called 911, and first responders transported the pair to the hospital.

          <p>A new federal report from the National Survey on Drug Use and Health has revealed a promising decline in depression and suicidal behaviors among teenagers between 2021 and 2024. The prevalence of serious suicidal thoughts in 12-to-17-year-olds fell from nearly 13% to 10%. Experts suggest this may be due to more teens seeking and receiving treatment, although they caution that access to mental health care remains a significant challenge for many. Despite the positive trend, millions of adolescents still experience suicidal thoughts, indicating more progress is needed.</p>

          <p>A new book, "Tonight in Jungleland," details the immense pressure and creative struggles Bruce Springsteen faced while making his landmark 1975 album, "Born to Run." At risk of being dropped by his record label, Springsteen labored for months with notorious perfectionism, particularly on the title track and "Jungleland." The book highlights the pivotal role of critic and future manager Jon Landau, who helped streamline the band's sound and refine key songs like "Thunder Road." The album ultimately vaulted Springsteen to superstardom, saving his career.</p>

          <p>China is making significant progress in developing its own aviation supply chain, reducing its dependence on foreign technology for aircraft components. A key project is the CJ-1000A, a domestically produced large commercial jet engine, which is reportedly progressing well and is intended to power Chinese airliners like the C919. This effort is part of a broader national strategy to close technological gaps and establish China as a major, self-sufficient player in all aspects of the global civil aviation industry, from complete aircraft to individual parts.</p>

          <p>The public library in Ann Arbor, Michigan, has created a massively popular city-wide activity called "The Summer Game." Originally a simple reading challenge, it has evolved into a library-using game where thousands of residents, more than half of whom are adults, earn points by solving puzzles, exploring local history, and using various library services. The game's success is attributed to its design, inspired by corporate loyalty programs, and its ability to engage the community in a fun way. Points can be redeemed for library merchandise, making it a beloved local tradition.</p>

        </div>
        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>While sports drinks are heavily marketed for their electrolyte content, medical experts and sports scientists suggest they are unnecessary for most people. Electrolytes like sodium and potassium are lost in sweat, but a varied diet of fruits and vegetables typically provides more than enough to replenish them. The body, particularly the kidneys, is also highly effective at regulating electrolyte levels. These drinks can be useful for elite athletes or individuals engaged in prolonged, heavy sweating, but for average daily hydration, plain water is sufficient and more economical.</p>
