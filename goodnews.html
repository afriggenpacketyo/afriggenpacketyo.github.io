          <p>Pop Mart International, a Chinese toymaker known for its trendy characters, has surpassed HK$300 billion in market capitalization on the Hong Kong stock market, becoming the 27th most valuable company listed there.

JPMorgan Chase has initiated coverage of Pop Mart with an overweight rating, projecting substantial revenue growth through 2027. This surge in valuation highlights the increasing investor confidence in the company's unique business model and its ability to capitalize on the growing demand for trendy toys.

          <p>The tradition of drinking milk in the Indianapolis 500 victory circle began in 1936 when Louis Meyer drank buttermilk after winning his third Indy 500. The moment was captured by a cameraman, leading a dairy industry executive to request milk be given to every winner. From 1947 to 1954, winners were handed cold water in a silver chalice, but the milk tradition returned in 1956. Since then, 69 consecutive winners have enjoyed milk in the victory circle, continuing the iconic tradition.</p>

          <p>Bitcoin continued its rally, hitting a new record high above $111,000, driven by positive momentum, growing optimism around U.S. crypto regulation, and continued interest from institutional buyers. Despite a drop in U.S. stock markets, Bitcoin's price rose, possibly due to investors seeking alternative stores of value. The rally was also fueled by macro concerns, including Moody's downgrade of U.S. sovereign debt, reinforcing Bitcoin's narrative as a hedge against fiat instability. Positive regulatory developments in the U.S., along with JPMorgan CEO Jamie Dimon's announcement that the bank will allow clients to buy Bitcoin, have further supported the market.

          <p>China has expressed concerns to the European Union regarding proposed handling fees on small parcels entering the bloc, most of which originate from Chinese e-commerce firms. A spokesperson from the Ministry of Foreign Affairs urged the EU to provide a fair and non-discriminatory business environment for Chinese companies. The European Commission is proposing a two-euro fee for small packages valued at 150 euros or less sent directly from overseas, while parcels stored in European warehouses would incur a lower fee. The fee is intended to generate revenue for Brussels to cover customs and safety checks.</p>
