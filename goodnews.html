          <p>The Walt Disney Company has agreed to pay $10 million to settle allegations from the Federal Trade Commission (FTC) regarding the unlawful collection of children's personal data on YouTube. The FTC claimed that Disney allowed the collection of data from children viewing videos without parental notification or consent, violating the Children's Online Privacy Protection Rule. The settlement requires Disney to pay the civil penalty, comply with data protection rules, and implement a program to review YouTube videos for child-directed content. This settlement highlights ongoing concerns about children's privacy online and the responsibilities of content creators and distributors. The company is still committed to investing in the tools needed to continue being a leader in this space. </p>

Kelce shared that he introduced Swift as his fiancée to his teammates at a recent Cincinnati Bearcats game, noting how much he enjoys using the term. As he prepares for his 13th NFL season with the Kansas City Chiefs, Kelce is expected to be a key target for Patrick Mahomes, especially with Rashee Rice suspended.

          <p>U.S. Treasury yields decreased on Wednesday following the release of weaker-than-expected job openings data. The yield on the 30-year Treasury bond fell, while the yield on the 10-year Treasury also declined. The move lower in yields came after the Labor Department's Job Openings and Labor Turnover Survey revealed that available positions in July were below forecast. Investors are now awaiting Friday's jobs report, which is expected to show a slight increase in the unemployment rate. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>A New York judge has ruled that critical DNA evidence will be allowed in the Gilgo Beach serial killer case against Rex Heuermann. The defense had challenged the evidence, which was obtained using whole genome sequencing, a new DNA technology in New York courts. The judge determined that the technique is generally accepted in the scientific community. This decision marks the first time these techniques are allowed as evidence in a New York court and could allow more cold cases to move forward for prosecution. </p>

          <p>Over three dozen Democratic and independent senators are urging Department of Homeland Security Secretary Kristi Noem to clarify the agency's position on DACA recipients. The senators are responding to a DHS statement that DACA recipients are not automatically protected from deportation and that DACA does not confer legal status. They argue this contradicts DHS's own guidance, which states that those with deferred action are "not considered to be unlawfully present." The senators emphasize that DACA was created to protect Dreamers who meet strict requirements. </p>

          <p>The EU Commission has approved major trade deals with South American bloc Mercosur and Mexico. The Mercosur deal, which requires approval from at least 15 EU member states, aims to progressively remove tariffs on EU imports, including cars, machinery, and pharmaceuticals. In return, Mercosur members would be able to sell agricultural goods to the EU with fewer restrictions. The Commission emphasized the potential economic benefits and protections for sensitive agricultural sectors. </p>

          <p>Phantom energy, or vampire energy, is the wasted electricity consumed by devices left plugged in when not in use, accounting for 5% to 10% of home energy use. This hidden drain contributes to climate change by increasing the demand for electricity from sources that release planet-warming emissions. Unplugging devices, such as phone chargers and microwaves, can significantly reduce emissions. Individuals can also disable extra features on smart televisions and other appliances to minimize energy consumption. </p>
