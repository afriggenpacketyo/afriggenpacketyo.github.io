          <p>Oracle reported lower-than-expected earnings and revenue, but its stock surged due to staggering forward-looking projections for its cloud infrastructure business. The company forecasts massive growth, with analysts expressing shock and excitement over multi-billion dollar AI deals and a huge increase in remaining performance obligations. This optimism is driven by Oracle's expanding data center capacity, which is attracting business from competitors like Microsoft and Google, though some caution that these are not organically acquired customers. The forecast suggests a significant shift in the cloud computing landscape. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>Swedish online lender Klarna has priced its Initial Public Offering (IPO) at $40 per share, exceeding its initial valuation range and valuing the company at approximately $15 billion. The company, known for its "buy now, pay later" services, raised $1.37 billion, with the majority of funds going to existing shareholders. This successful pricing reflects a strong market appetite for tech IPOs, despite Klarna reporting a widening net loss in the second quarter. The move to go public is seen as a test of investor confidence in its recent rebranding efforts towards becoming a digital retail bank. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>Democrat James Walkinshaw has won the special election for a congressional district in Northern Virginia, further narrowing the Republican majority in the House of Representatives to 219-213. Walkinshaw, who previously served as chief of staff to the late Rep. Gerry Connolly, defeated Republican Stewart Whitson in a reliably Democratic district. Key issues in the race included federal job cuts initiated by the Trump administration, which significantly impact the local workforce. Walkinshaw has also pledged to support a bipartisan effort to force a vote on releasing files related to the late sex offender Jeffrey Epstein.</p>

Japan's Nikkei 225 and South Korea's Kospi saw early gains, while U.S. equity futures also rose slightly. The positive sentiment follows a record-setting day on Wall Street, where all three major benchmarks closed at all-time highs.

          <h2>Akron, Ohio's Public Transit System Wins National Award After Rider-Focused Overhaul</h2>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>The Metro bus system in Akron, Ohio, has been named the national mass transit system of the year after a major overhaul led to a 24% increase in ridership. Led by CEO Dawn Distler, a former bus driver, the agency reinvented its services by listening directly to passenger feedback. The system revamped its routes, increased bus frequency to every 15 minutes in key areas, and expanded service to seven days a week, all without a budget increase. This customer-centric approach, focusing on reliability and convenience, has been credited with successfully boosting usage and improving essential transportation for residents.</p>

          <div class="timestamp">2025-09-09 19:10:59 EDT</div>
        </div>
        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>The UK's Financial Conduct Authority (FCA) has proposed plans to scrap the £100 cap on contactless card payments, potentially allowing for unlimited transactions via tapping a card. If approved, banks and card providers would be able to set their own limits, bringing card payments in line with digital wallets on smartphones, which have no restrictions. The move is intended to reflect rising prices and changes in payment habits, though it has raised concerns about fraud and theft. The FCA stated that providers would be responsible for fraud losses and would need to ensure that higher-value payments are low-risk.</p>

          <div class="timestamp">2025-09-09 19:09:30 EDT</div>
        </div>
        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Apple has unveiled its new, ultra-thin iPhone Air, which replaces physical SIM cards with eSIM technology, but this feature may cause a delayed or limited release in mainland China. Currently, only one of China's three major cellular carriers supports eSIMs, which allow for easier switching between service providers. Chinese regulators are reportedly taking time to approve and encourage the adoption of eSIM standards, a process some analysts believe is influenced by concerns over potential revenue loss for state-owned telecom companies. This delay could provide a competitive advantage to domestic Chinese smartphone manufacturers.</p>

        </div>
        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>According to analysis highlighted by CNBC's Jim Cramer, investors are continuing to reward companies that aggressively repurchase their own shares, even as the overall pace of buybacks has slowed. A note from Goldman Sachs identifies a group of "buyback aristocrats"—companies that consistently reduce their share count—which have been outperforming the market. This strategy is seen as a sign of management's confidence and can provide an edge, particularly when the economy is slowing. Apple and Wells Fargo were cited as examples of companies whose generous buyback programs help support their stock value. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>President Donald Trump has signed a memorandum aimed at increasing enforcement of transparency and accuracy laws for direct-to-consumer prescription drug advertisements. The administration plans to send hundreds of cease-and-desist and warning letters to companies, targeting misleading ads on television, social media, and digital platforms. The initiative will also scrutinize social media influencers who promote pharmaceuticals without proper risk disclosures. This move stops short of the outright ban previously suggested by HHS Secretary Robert F. Kennedy Jr., but officials described it as the strongest possible action using existing regulations.</p>

The dominant display provides a major boost for Tuchel and creates positive selection challenges as younger players staked their claims for regular spots.</p>

Chlamydia can cause blindness, infertility, and death in koalas, and is a major contributor to their declining numbers.

          <p>Researchers at the Chinese Academy of Sciences have developed a new AI model, SpikingBrain 1.0, that mimics the human brain's efficiency by only activating necessary neurons. This design allows the model to run up to 100 times faster than traditional systems on long-text processing tasks and learn from significantly less training data. Crucially, the system operates entirely on China's domestic MetaX chip platform, rather than relying on dominant Nvidia hardware. This development is strategically important for China as it seeks to build a self-reliant AI ecosystem amid U.S. export controls on advanced chips.</p>
