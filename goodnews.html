          <p>Former President Donald Trump played a round of golf with Republican Senators Eric Schmitt, Lindsey Graham, and Rand Paul. The outing occurred as Senate Republicans aimed to pass a significant tax package, referred to as the "Big, Beautiful Bill," before a self-imposed July 4 deadline. The White House endorsed the bill, emphasizing its potential to provide economic certainty for businesses navigating the effects of recent tariffs. Treasury Secretary Scott Bessent also met with senators to advocate for the bill's passage, suggesting it could accelerate economic growth in the year's third quarter. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>The California Highway Patrol responded to an unusual report of a baby tiger on the side of Highway 166 in San Luis Obispo County. A concerned driver had called in the sighting along the remote stretch of road connecting the Central Coast and the San Joaquin Valley. However, upon investigation, the responding officer discovered the animal was not a tiger cub but a deceased hawk. The California Department of Transportation was notified to remove the bird. The incident serves as a reminder that owning exotic animals like tigers is illegal in California without special permits.</p>

          <p>An estimated 180,000 to 200,000 people participated in the Budapest Pride march, defying a government ban and creating one of the largest demonstrations in the event's history.

Budapest's mayor declared the parade a municipal event to bypass the ban, a move that has drawn criticism from the government. The massive turnout, supported by EU officials and dozens of embassies, symbolized a powerful resistance to the increasing repression of LGBTQ+ rights and civil liberties in Hungary.</p>

          <p>The J.M. Smucker Co. has announced its plan to remove all artificial colors from its consumer products by the end of 2027. The company, which owns brands like Smucker's jams, Uncrustables, and Hostess, stated that most of its products are already free of synthetic dyes. However, some items, including sugar-free jams, ice cream toppings, and certain Hostess snack cakes like Twinkies, still contain them. This move aligns Smucker with other major food companies like Nestle and Kraft Heinz, which have recently made similar pledges amid increased federal scrutiny of artificial food additives.</p>

          <p>The British and Irish Lions rugby team started their Australian tour with a decisive victory over the Western Force, but the win was overshadowed by an injury to Welsh scrum-half Tomos Williams. Williams, who scored two tries, left the field with a tight hamstring, raising concerns about the team's depth in that key position. Coach Andy Farrell noted that while the team showed impressive attacking flair, their high penalty count in the first half indicated a lack of composure that needs to be addressed. The performance of lock Joe McCarthy was a standout, positioning him as a contender for a Test series spot.</p>
