          <p>The Labor Department reported that the annual inflation rate in April fell to 2.3%, the lowest since February 2021, slightly below expectations. The consumer price index rose 0.2% for the month, with core CPI also increasing by 0.2%. Shelter prices were identified as the main driver of inflation. The article notes that the lower-than-expected inflation comes as President Trump's tariffs begin to affect the slowing U.S. economy. Markets showed little reaction to the news, with stock futures remaining flat and Treasury yields mixed. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>Chief Justice John Roberts addressed Georgetown Law graduates, highlighting the necessity for collaboration across ideological lines within the Supreme Court. Roberts acknowledged the strong disagreements among justices but stressed the importance of maintaining decorum and positive working relationships to effectively function as a court. He noted that personal relationships should transcend professional disagreements, even in the face of frustrating habits. His comments come as the Supreme Court is preparing to hear several high-profile cases filed by the Trump administration, including those on education, religious liberty, and election redistricting.</p>
