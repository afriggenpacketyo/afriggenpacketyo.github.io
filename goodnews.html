          <p>Pupils in Edinburgh have been cut off from revision resources ahead of key exam dates due to an attempted cyber attack on the council's education department. Staff identified a suspicious invitation to a meeting as "spear-phishing," impersonating a trusted source. Parents were notified that student passwords were reset as a precaution, disrupting access to school learning resources. The council prioritized support for students preparing for exams and assured that no data was compromised by the attempted attack. This incident follows a suspected criminal ransomware cyberattack on schools in West Lothian earlier in the week.</p>

          <p>Freddy Escobar, the suspended president of the United Firefighters of Los Angeles City (UFLAC), is contesting allegations of financial improprieties, including missing receipts for credit card purchases. Escobar claims he has all the necessary documentation, including over 1,500 receipts, meeting minutes, and explanations for expenses. The International Association of Fire Fighters (IAFF) suspended Escobar and other union officers, placing UFLAC under conservatorship due to approximately $800,000 in undocumented credit card purchases. Escobar insists that all his expenses were union-related and calls on the IAFF to reinstate him, while the IAFF maintains that Escobar was repeatedly urged to submit proper documentation.</p>

          <p>Leicester Tigers fought back with four second-half tries to secure a crucial victory against Sale Sharks in the Premiership, boosting their chances for the play-offs. Sale initially dominated with tries from Luke Cowan-Dickie, Rekeiti Ma'asi-White, Arron Reed, and Rob du Preez, giving them a 26-16 lead at halftime. However, Leicester responded strongly after the break, with two tries from Ollie Hassell-Collins and one from Emeka Ilione. Although Rob du Preez scored a second try for Sale, Ilione's late try denied Sale a losing bonus point, sealing the win for Leicester.</p>

          <p>A federal judge has ordered Rumeysa Ozturk, a Tufts doctoral candidate, to be immediately released from immigration custody on bail. Ozturk was detained after the Trump administration revoked her student visa, allegedly due to an opinion piece she co-authored criticizing Israel's war with Hamas. Judge William Sessions stated that Ozturk raised "very substantial" claims that her First Amendment and due process rights were violated. The judge said there was no evidence other than the op-ed to justify her detention, and allowed her to return to her home in Somerville, Massachusetts, with no travel restrictions.</p>
