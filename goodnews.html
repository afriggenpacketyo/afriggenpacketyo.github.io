          <p>An angel investor who provided crucial early funding for the multi-billion dollar AI voice startup ElevenLabs said he committed to the investment within 30 minutes of meeting co-founder Mati Staniszewski in 2022. At the time, voice AI was an overlooked sector, and most venture capitalists were hesitant to invest. The investor, Carles Reina, was drawn to Staniszewski's deep technical knowledge and his vision for solving the problem of robotic-sounding AI voices before a product had even been built. His early bet paid off, as ElevenLabs is now valued at over $6 billion and is a leader in text-to-speech technology.</p>

          <p>Former President Donald Trump has begun a five-day tour of Asia, with scheduled stops in Malaysia, Japan, and South Korea for crucial diplomatic engagements. The trip's centerpiece is an anticipated meeting with Chinese President Xi Jinping in South Korea, aimed at de-escalating a contentious trade war between the two economic superpowers. While traveling, Trump also expressed openness to meeting with North Korean leader Kim Jong-un for the first time since 2019, though US officials have stated no such meeting is currently planned. The tour includes participation in the ASEAN and APEC summits, where various regional security and trade issues will be addressed.</p>

          <p>Herbie Farnworth, who plays professionally in Australia's top-tier NRL, is being hailed as a key player for England in the upcoming Rugby League Ashes series against Australia. Widely regarded as one of the best centres in the world, his skill is seen as a crucial advantage for an English side seeking its first Ashes victory since 1970. Teammates and his coach describe him as a "cheat code" who can create scoring opportunities from nothing. Having grown up in Lancashire before moving to Australia at 17 to pursue his career, Farnworth is now set to play a pivotal role in front of a home crowd.</p>

          <p>The Toronto Blue Jays secured a decisive 11-4 victory over the Los Angeles Dodgers in Game 1 of the World Series. The game was blown open during a nine-run sixth inning, highlighted by the first pinch-hit grand slam in World Series history from Addison Barger. Despite an early 2-0 lead for the Dodgers and a two-run home run from superstar Shohei Ohtani later in the game, Toronto's offensive onslaught proved insurmountable. The Blue Jays' victory gives them an early advantage in the best-of-seven series, which continues in Toronto for Game 2.</p>

          <p>In a significant development just before the start of early voting, House Minority Leader Hakeem Jeffries has endorsed progressive candidate Zohran Mamdani for mayor of New York City. Jeffries' backing provides a major boost to Mamdani, a Democratic assemblyman who has focused his campaign on the city's affordability crisis. The endorsement helps unify the Democratic party behind Mamdani, who had already secured support from figures like Bernie Sanders and Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez. This move comes shortly after Mamdani's opponent, former Governor Andrew Cuomo, received the endorsement of the outgoing mayor, Eric Adams.</p>

          <p>High-level delegations from the United States and China have commenced crucial economic and trade consultations in Kuala Lumpur, Malaysia. The talks are a precursor to a potential summit between US President Donald Trump and Chinese President Xi Jinping, which is anticipated to take place in South Korea. This meeting marks the fifth face-to-face discussion between the lead negotiators since President Trump intensified the trade war earlier in the year. The outcome of these preliminary discussions is seen as critical for setting the stage for the leaders' meeting and potentially easing the significant economic tensions between the two global powers.</p>

          <p>Chinese President Xi Jinping's upcoming visit to South Korea for the APEC summit is being interpreted by experts as a significant, albeit symbolic, step toward mending strained bilateral ties. While major immediate breakthroughs are not expected, the visit itself marks a carefully calibrated move to restart dialogue and cooperation. This will be Xi's first visit since 2014, a time considered a high point in Beijing-Seoul relations that led to a free-trade agreement. The diplomatic landscape has since shifted, particularly regarding issues like the denuclearization of the Korean peninsula, making this visit a crucial opportunity to gauge the future direction of the relationship.</p>
