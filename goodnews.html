          <p>A growing number of singles, particularly from Gen Z, are using AI-powered dating assistants to improve their romantic prospects on apps. Services like Rizz and Keepler offer users suggestions for messages, help craft replies, and even provide ways to handle being "ghosted." These tools aim to boost confidence and help users stand out in the crowded online dating world. While some users find the AI helpful for initiating conversations, the trend raises questions about authenticity and the potential for over-reliance on technology instead of genuine human connection.</p>

          <p>The British and Irish Lions secured a commanding 48-0 victory against the Australia and New Zealand Invitational XV in their final warm-up match before the first Test against the Wallabies. Winger Duhan van der Merwe was a standout performer, scoring a hat-trick as the Lions ran in a total of eight tries in Adelaide. The dominant performance provided a strong platform for the team, though concerns arose over injuries to Luke Cowan-Dickie and Garry Ringrose. The match also saw the return of Owen Farrell as a second-half substitute, who looked comfortable despite a recent lack of play.</p>

          <p>A 13-year-old boy named Micah was diagnosed with Danon disease, an extremely rare genetic condition causing severe heart failure, after complaining of chest pains. His mother, who had previously received a heart transplant for what was thought to be peripartum cardiomyopathy, was then also diagnosed with the same disease. After receiving a pacemaker, defibrillator, and eventually a heart transplant, Micah and his mother have launched a support network. Called Transplant Teenz, the non-profit provides a virtual community for teenagers nationwide who are awaiting or recovering from organ transplants.</p>

          <h2>Experts Advocate for Unstructured Free Play to Foster Children's Physical and Cognitive Health</h2>
          <div class="timestamp">2025-07-12 08:00:00 EDT</div>

          <p>This article argues that modern societal norms and parental fears are depriving children of the benefits of unstructured, "wild" free play. While animals spend their youth frolicking and exploring movement, children are increasingly sedentary, which can negatively impact bone health, cognitive skills, and mental well-being. Injury-prevention experts suggest that allowing kids to engage in activities like climbing trees and wrestling helps them develop robust "movement vocabularies," making them less prone to injury later in life. The author suggests that encouraging such play is crucial for developing resilient and physically competent individuals.</p>

          <h2>Financial Author Argues Beauty Standards Create a Costly "Hamster Wheel" for Women</h2>
          <div class="timestamp">2025-07-12 07:30:01 EDT</div>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>In her new book, "Rich Girl Nation," author Katie Gatti Tassin describes the recurring expenses needed to maintain an "acceptable feminine appearance" as a "hot girl hamster wheel." She argues that spending on things like hair, nails, and skincare is an insidious force in women's financial lives, functioning as a depreciating asset that requires ever-increasing investment. Tassin suggests women perform a "hot girl detox" by annualizing these costs to see their true financial impact and then experimenting with removing them. The goal is to redirect that money towards wealth-building activities like paying off debt or investing.</p>

          <p>A 26-year-old German backpacker, Carolina Wilga, was rescued after being lost for 11 nights in the remote Western Australian outback. Police reported she became lost after her van got stuck in bushland, and she walked 24 kilometers in a disoriented state. She survived the ordeal by drinking water from puddles, eating minimal food supplies, and sleeping in a cave. Ms. Wilga was found by a passing driver suffering from exhaustion, dehydration, and injuries, and was subsequently airlifted to a hospital in Perth, with police calling her rescue a matter of "sheer luck."</p>

          <p>China is preparing to launch its Tianzhou-9 cargo spacecraft to deliver supplies to the Tiangong space station. The spacecraft and its Long March-7 carrier rocket have been transported to the launch pad at the Wenchang Spacecraft Launch Site. According to the China Manned Space Agency, all facilities are in good condition for the upcoming mission. The supplies for the astronauts onboard Tiangong will include two sets of advanced, domestically developed spacesuits, each designed to be used for up to 20 spacewalks over a four-year period, representing a significant upgrade in lifespan.</p>

          <h2>Student Perceptions of Top Career Fields Contrast with Actual Employment Data</h2>

        </div>
        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>A recent survey by the CFA Institute found that U.S. students and recent graduates believe finance offers the best career prospects in the current economy. However, data from the New York Fed suggests this perception may be misleading, as several other fields have lower unemployment rates for recent graduates. For example, majors like art history and nutritional sciences show lower unemployment than finance, while philosophy majors fare better than economics majors. This discrepancy highlights a growing trend of employers, such as BlackRock, seeking humanities graduates for their creative thinking and soft skills in an AI-driven world.</p>

          <p>Nvidia CEO Jensen Huang recently sold approximately $36.4 million worth of the company's stock, part of a pre-planned agreement to sell up to six million shares this year. The sale comes as Nvidia's market dominance in AI chips has caused its stock to surge, making it the first company to exceed a $4 trillion market capitalization. Huang's personal net worth has skyrocketed to $143 billion, placing him nearly on par with legendary investor Warren Buffett. Despite the sale, Huang still holds over 858 million shares of the company, both directly and indirectly. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>London's Gatwick Airport marked a milestone by welcoming its first-ever all-electric flight. The aircraft, a two-seater Pipistrel Velis Electro, landed at the airport as part of a 17-day tour around France. The plane is commercially approved for pilot training and other operations. The event coincides with Gatwick's broader sustainability efforts, as the airport is upgrading its 300-strong vehicle fleet to be fully electric by 2030. This is part of a larger decarbonization program aiming for net-zero emissions for its own operations, according to the airport's management.</p>

          <p>Scientists are making significant strides in understanding black holes, which are now seen as essential to the formation of galaxies. Recent discoveries, aided by the James Webb Space Telescope, have confirmed theories that supermassive black holes in the early universe could form directly from collapsing gas clouds. While a black hole's gravity is so intense that it creates a "singularity" where known laws of physics break down, they do not function as cosmic vacuum cleaners. Researchers also have a term for what would happen if a person fell into one: the intense gravitational difference would stretch them out in a process called "spaghettification."</p>

          <p>This commentary argues that the "superwoke" backlash against the new "Superman" movie, sparked by director James Gunn's comments on the character being an immigrant, is overblown. The article posits that the film's story is fundamentally about assimilation and opportunity, emphasizing that Superman's values are shaped by his all-American upbringing in Kansas. While acknowledging the character is an immigrant from Krypton, the author notes that Superman's story has rarely delved into the complex political realities of immigration in the U.S. Instead, his identity as an outsider serves to reinforce his choice to be a hero for humanity.</p>
