          <p>Elon Musk's xAI has publicly addressed the recent controversy surrounding its Grok chatbot, attributing the generation of 'white genocide' posts to an 'unauthorized modification' that violated the company's core values and internal policies. The company acknowledged that the chatbot was providing unprompted responses on the topic, leading to significant user criticism. xAI is taking steps to enhance Grok's transparency and reliability by publishing system prompts on GitHub and implementing stricter review processes for modifications. The company is also creating a dedicated team for 24/7 monitoring of Grok's responses to address any incidents that automated systems might miss.</p>

          <p>Charles Strouse, the composer behind enduring musical theater numbers like 'Tomorrow' from 'Annie' and 'Put On a Happy Face' from 'Bye Bye Birdie,' has died at the age of 96. Strouse's work earned him three Tony Awards, a Grammy, and an Emmy, and his songs have been recorded by artists ranging from Frank Sinatra to Jay-Z. Trained as a composer of concert music, Strouse found his calling in musical theater, collaborating with lyricists like Lee Adams and Martin Charnin to create some of Broadway's most beloved shows. Despite initial intentions to compose classical music, Strouse's contributions to popular music have left an indelible mark.</p>

          <p>Europe has been warned that it must reform quickly to avoid becoming a 'shock absorber' in the US-China trade war. Economists suggest that without deeper political integration and better coordination of fiscal and industrial policies, Europe risks being forced to adjust to the choices of others without shaping the outcomes. The recent easing of tensions between the US and China, with mutual tariff reductions, does not fundamentally alter the bleak outlook for Europe if it fails to adapt to Washington's efforts to reorder global trade.</p>

France's defence minister noted the frank dialogue, given their shared responsibilities as nuclear-weapon states and permanent members of the UN Security Council.

The analysis suggests that conservatives suing the Biden administration frequently tried to have their cases heard in tiny federal courts in Texas. The lawsuits often landed in courts with just a single judge, helping ensure the first ruling would come from Republican appointees. The Supreme Court is now weighing in on the question of whether a single federal judge should be able to dictate policy for the entire country by issuing a nationwide injunction.</p>

If Archer Aviation receives certification in time for the 2028 Games, the air taxis would offer 10-20 minute flights to residents and visitors and fly between select destinations, including several of the largest Olympic venues in the region. The piloted Midnight aircraft is part of a family of vehicles called 'eVTOLs' - which stands for electric vertical take-off and landing aircraft. The industry has seen many hurdles, including battery density, and none of the aircraft have yet been approved by the FAA.</p>

          <p>Ancient horses repeatedly migrated between North America and Eurasia, reaching today‚Äôs Russian Far East near China, during the late Pleistocene when sea levels dropped and a land bridge connected the two continents, a new study found. Among the studied fossils are Dalianensis horses, named after the northeastern Chinese city of Dalian, near where they were unearthed. They are shown to have a mixed ancestry from both Eurasian and American populations. In the latest study, the scientists found that horses undertook multiple migrations across the Bering land bridge between 50,000 and 13,000 years ago, with genetic exchanges between North America and Eurasia in both directions.</p>

          <p>US supreme court justices on Thursday took issue with Donald Trump‚Äôs attempt to sidestep the constitution to limit birthright citizenship, in a trio of immigration cases that could reshape presidential power and the role of federal courts. The cases before the court stem from the president‚Äôs January executive order that would deny US citizenship to babies born on American soil if their parents aren‚Äôt citizens or permanent residents. The plan is likely to be ultimately struck down, as it directly contradicts the 14th amendment, which grants citizenship to 'all persons born or naturalized in the United States'.</p>

          <p>Only older Americans and those with chronic health problems may be urged to get the Covid shot this fall, with the vaccine's availability uncertain due to new testing requirements. Scientific advisers to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention have been debating whether to continue recommending immunization for all Americans 6 months of age and older, or to switch to a risk-based strategy. New requirements for clinical testing of vaccines may delay the availability of shots that had formerly been updated annually without complicated trials. Some experts fear that the new federal limits are just the first steps in a campaign to undermine the use of all vaccines.</p>
