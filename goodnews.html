        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>The 2025 Salzburg Festival in Austria is set to feature a program that mirrors contemporary global crises, with a strong focus on themes of power, conflict, and crumbling authority. Artistic director Markus Hinterhäuser has curated a selection of operas and plays, including Verdi's "Macbeth" and Handel's "Giulio Cesare in Egitto," that explore the historical lust for power. The festival also includes contemporary works reflecting modern turmoil, such as a play based on a book by Russian dissident author Vladimir Sorokin. Despite a recent controversy over the dismissal of a Russian festival director, the program prominently features numerous Russian artists and conductors.</p>

          <p>PepsiCo's stock rose after the company reported second-quarter earnings and revenue that surpassed Wall Street expectations, signaling a potential rebound from weak North American demand. Despite a slight dip in overall sales volume, the company is implementing a new strategy focused on healthier snacks, cost-cutting measures, and better in-store execution to boost sales. CEO Ramon Laguarta expressed confidence that these efforts will help the company achieve its long-term growth targets in the coming quarters. PepsiCo also reiterated its full-year financial outlook, projecting stable earnings and low single-digit organic revenue growth for the year. (not investment advice)</p>

          <h2>UK Government Announces Plans to Lower Voting Age to 16 and Overhaul Voter ID Rules</h2>
          <div class="timestamp">2025-07-17 10:28:05 EDT</div>
        </div>
        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>The United Kingdom's government has announced significant electoral reforms, including lowering the voting age to 16 for all UK elections, a change that will enfranchise approximately 1.5 million teenagers. The plan also aims to make voting more accessible by allowing bank cards as a valid form of voter ID and moving towards an automated voter registration system to address the millions of citizens missing from electoral rolls. While the move to lower the voting age was a Labour party manifesto promise and has been welcomed by student groups, it has faced criticism from Conservatives and Reform UK.</p>

          <p>A pioneering trial in the United Kingdom has resulted in the birth of eight healthy babies using an IVF technique that incorporates DNA from three people to prevent inherited mitochondrial diseases. The method, approved in the U.K. in 2015, successfully reduced the transmission of mutated DNA from mother to child by up to 100% in most cases. Researchers hailed the results as a breakthrough, offering hope to families affected by these often-fatal genetic conditions. The procedure remains controversial, however, raising ethical concerns about embryo destruction and potential for creating so-called "designer babies."</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>While the popularity of women's soccer grows, a noticeable lack of ethnic diversity persists on many European national teams, including at the Euro 2025 tournament. Unlike their male counterparts, teams from countries like England and Germany have significantly fewer players from minority or immigrant backgrounds, failing to reflect the multicultural makeup of their populations. In contrast, France's team is highlighted as a more diverse squad, which players attribute to a well-developed, accessible club system across the country. Football associations and programs are now increasingly focused on grassroots initiatives to break down barriers and foster greater inclusion in the sport.</p>

          <p>Eighty years after the end of World War II, Germany and the United Kingdom have signed a historic friendship treaty aimed at strengthening their relationship following Brexit.

          <p>Analysts at CIBC Capital Markets are predicting a new all-time high for gold, forecasting that the precious metal will reach US$3,600 per ounce in the latter half of 2025 and maintain that level through 2026. This bullish outlook is attributed to a combination of global geopolitical uncertainty, the accelerating trend of de-dollarization by central banks, and the anticipation of U.S. interest rate cuts. The bank has consequently upgraded its price targets for 36 Canadian gold stocks. This forecast represents a significant increase from their previous prediction, reflecting a rapidly changing macroeconomic landscape. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>China has sent a sophisticated 'mini-brain' on a chip to its Tiangong space station to investigate the effects of microgravity on the human brain. This experiment is reportedly the first of its kind to use a highly integrated chip containing living human brain cells, immune cells, and a capillary network that mimics the blood-brain barrier. The research aims to understand and ultimately prevent cognitive issues experienced by astronauts during long-duration missions, such as dizziness and sleep problems. Scientists believe the three-dimensional model will provide more human-like data than previous experiments, advancing space medicine and neuroscience.</p>

The bill, which would establish the first major regulatory framework for cryptocurrency in the U.S., was held up when a dozen conservatives initially voted against advancing it. After a meeting with Donald Trump, the holdouts reversed their opposition, allowing the legislative process to move forward. The bill has faced criticism from some Democrats who argue it lacks sufficient consumer and national security protections, but its passage would mark a significant step in crypto legislation.</p>

          <p>As Disneyland celebrates its 70th anniversary, the company's strategy of leveraging its vast portfolio of intellectual property (IP) remains a cornerstone of its highly profitable experiences division. From its opening in 1955 with rides based on films like "Snow White" and "Peter Pan," Disney has consistently used its stories to create immersive attractions. This approach has intensified under CEO Bob Iger, with acquisitions of Pixar, Marvel, and Lucasfilm fueling the creation of entire themed lands like Star Wars: Galaxy's Edge. While this sometimes means shuttering older, non-IP rides, the strategy successfully broadens the parks' appeal and drives significant revenue growth.</p>
