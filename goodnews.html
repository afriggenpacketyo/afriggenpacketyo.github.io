          <p>Apple announced third-quarter financial results that exceeded Wall Street's expectations, driven by a 13% year-over-year increase in iPhone sales. The company's overall revenue grew by 10%, marking its most significant quarterly growth since December 2021. The Mac business saw the fastest growth at nearly 15%, while the services division also continued its strong performance. Despite these gains, sales for the iPad and the wearables division, which includes the Apple Watch and AirPods, experienced a decline during the quarter.</p>

          <p>For individuals who have saved a substantial amount like $20,000, choosing the right account to maximize growth is crucial in the current high-interest-rate environment. This article compares the earning potential of high-yield savings accounts and money market accounts. Based on current average rates, a high-yield savings account at 4.44% APY would earn slightly more over a year than a money market account at 4.32% APY. However, the difference is minimal, and the best choice may depend on other factors, such as a money market account's check-writing capabilities. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>The Trump administration has announced plans to construct a new 90,000-square-foot ballroom in the East Wing of the White House. The project, estimated to cost around $200 million, will be funded by President Trump and other private donors, with construction scheduled to begin in September. The new venue is designed to host large state functions for up to 650 seated guests, eliminating the need for temporary tents on the White House grounds. The administration stated the design will respect the historical architecture of the main building while providing a much-needed modern space for major events.</p>

          <p>Following a Los Angeles Times investigation, City Councilmember Traci Park has introduced a motion to compel the city to comply with a 2019 state law requiring a public analysis of its emergency evacuation routes. The law, AB 747, mandates that local governments assess the capacity, safety, and viability of these routes for disasters like wildfires and tsunamis. The city's planning department had previously cited terrorism concerns for not publicizing the routes. The new motion demands a report on routes within Park's vulnerable district and a city-wide compliance plan.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>The new sequel to "The Naked Gun" franchise effectively captures the silly and creative humor of the original films, offering a largely successful and hilarious comedic experience. Liam Neeson gives a surprisingly entertaining performance as Frank Drebin Jr., the son of the original protagonist, mastering the deadpan delivery and slapstick comedy required for the role. While the script plays it safe by closely following the established formula, it provides a welcome dose of irreverent fun. The article also briefly reviews other new releases, including the horror film "Together" and the thriller "She Rides Shotgun."</p>

          <p>The Pentagon has ordered the removal of 1,350 National Guard troops from Los Angeles, significantly drawing down the force sent by the Trump administration to manage protests against federal immigration raids. Approximately 250 troops will remain to protect federal property and personnel. The initial deployment of 5,000 military members was met with strong opposition from California politicians, including Mayor Karen Bass and Governor Gavin Newsom, who argued it was an overreach and diverted resources from other state needs. The withdrawal has been praised by local leaders, who are pushing for a complete demobilization.</p>

          <p>Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky has reversed a contentious law that would have curtailed the independence of key anti-corruption agencies, following nearly a week of large-scale public protests. The demonstrations, the largest since Russia's full-scale invasion, were led by young Ukrainians who feared the law would jeopardize the country's path toward EU integration. The swift U-turn by the government highlights the power of civil society in Ukraine. However, the crisis has raised questions about the administration's commitment to anti-corruption reforms, which are crucial for maintaining Western financial support.</p>

          <p>After announcing she will not run for governor of California, former Vice President Kamala Harris has numerous options for her next chapter. Experts suggest she is likely to remain in the public eye, potentially preparing for another presidential run in 2028, starting a foundation, or championing a specific cause like artificial intelligence. To remain politically relevant, she will need to reshape her public narrative following the 2024 election loss. Her next steps will likely involve reconnecting with the American public and helping to elect other Democrats while carefully navigating a divided party.</p>
