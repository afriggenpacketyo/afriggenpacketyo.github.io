        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>The NHS is appealing for 200,000 new blood donors to alleviate a persistent shortage that has impacted patient treatment. A previous "amber alert" highlighted critically low supplies, particularly of O negative blood, which is universally compatible. The NHS Blood and Transplant (NHSBT) aims to increase regular donors from 800,000 to over one million to ensure a stable supply, with a specific focus on attracting more black donors who are more likely to possess blood types crucial for treating sickle cell disease. While donor registrations increased in 2024, only a quarter proceeded to donate, underscoring the urgency of the appeal to prevent a "red alert" scenario. The importance of blood donations is emphasized by individuals who rely on transfusions, such as a young boy named Isaac, and the NHS is working to simplify the donation process through new donor centers and convenient appointment scheduling.</p>

          <p>The U.S. National Guard, a component of the Armed Forces Reserve, comprises the Army National Guard and the Air National Guard, with approximately 419,000 reservists as of 2023. Primarily deployed for disaster relief, the National Guard also plays a role in ensuring internal security and supporting military operations abroad. Within states, the governor typically commands the National Guard, while the U.S. president serves as commander-in-chief during nationwide deployments. Recently, President Trump bypassed the authority of California's Governor Newsom in deploying the National Guard to Los Angeles during protests against ICE immigration raids, citing national security concerns.</p>

          <p>The UK's Financial Conduct Authority (FCA) has announced a collaboration with Nvidia to launch a "Supercharged Sandbox" that will enable financial services firms to safely experiment with artificial intelligence. Starting in October, institutions can utilize Nvidia's accelerated computing and AI Enterprise Software products to explore AI innovations. The initiative aims to address challenges banks face in deploying AI tools due to concerns about privacy and fraud, particularly with large language models that send data overseas. The FCA's new sandbox is designed for firms in the "discovery and experiment phase" with AI, providing access to better data, technical expertise, and regulatory support.</p>

          <p>The UK government is proposing to expand the prohibition of bottom trawling across English waters, increasing the protected area from 18,000km2 to 30,000km2. Environment Secretary Steve Reed stated that urgent action is needed to prevent irreversible destruction of the oceans. The proposal comes as the UN Ocean Conference begins in France, with Sir David Attenborough warning about the destructive nature of bottom trawling. The extension would cover 41 of the UK's 178 Marine Protected Areas, aiming to protect rare marine animals and the seabed, and is subject to a 12-week industry consultation.</p>

Ed had arrived in Christiana on May 30 and was reported missing the next day, leading to sightings along Interstate 24 and various social media memes.

          <p>Geely Auto, China's second-largest carmaker, will cease building new plants due to severe global overcapacity, according to Chairman Li Shufu. This decision is likely to have broader implications for the automotive sector, as many Chinese companies struggle to maintain profitability. Li Shufu emphasized the company's focus on enhancing its technological capabilities to become a key player in the future of mobility, rather than expanding production capacity. His comments come amidst a brutal price war among carmakers in mainland China, with leading players like BYD, Geely, and Leapmotor slashing prices to retain market share.</p>
