          <p>England completed a comprehensive one-day international series clean sweep over the West Indies with a nine-wicket victory in a rain-affected match at Taunton. Set a target of 106 in 21 overs, England cruised to victory, led by captain Nat Sciver-Brunt's unbeaten 57. The West Indies struggled, slipping to 4-3 early on, and despite a brief recovery, could only manage 106-8. England's summer continues with T20s and ODIs against India, which presents a relatively positive outlook for English cricket fans.</p>

          <p>Former MLB pitcher Steven Register, diagnosed with stage 4 colon cancer, found a liver donor in his high school classmate Kristin Johnston, whom he hadn't seen in 20 years. Johnston volunteered after seeing Register's wife's Facebook post searching for a living liver donor. The surgery will involve removing 70% of Johnston‚Äôs liver and transplanting it into Register, with both livers regenerating over time. The families hope their story raises awareness about the impact of living organ donation, believing fate had a hand in reconnecting them.</p>

          <p>Los Angeles Mayor Karen Bass has reached an agreement with City Council President Marqueece Harris-Dawson to restore police officer hiring, reversing cuts made by the council last month. The agreement ensures that funds will be identified for an additional 240 recruits within 90 days, requiring an additional $13.3 million for the coming year. The move aims to balance budget constraints with public safety concerns, reflecting ongoing debates about law enforcement funding in Los Angeles. The situation provides a relatively stable outlook for police resourcing and public safety in Los Angeles.</p>

          <p>Amid parliamentary deadlock, France has turned to remembrance politics, adopting three initiatives to recognize and symbolically heal historical injustices. These include posthumously promoting Alfred Dreyfus, recognizing returnees from Indochina, and addressing a "double debt" to Haiti. While these initiatives lack concrete political steps or financial agreements, they reflect a tradition of remembrance politics in France. Some view this as social maturity, while others see it as a diversion from addressing structural reforms.</p>
