        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Airbnb reported first-quarter results that aligned with expectations but issued a weaker-than-anticipated revenue forecast for the second quarter, leading to a stock decline. The company projects revenue between $2.99 billion and $3.05 billion, slightly below analysts' estimates, citing economic uncertainties in the U.S. Despite strong growth in North America, travel from Canada to the U.S. experienced softness, though international travel, particularly from Latin America, remained robust. Airbnb also announced upcoming platform updates and highlighted its efforts to remove problematic listings to enhance host quality.</p>

          <p>Apple's second fiscal-quarter earnings surpassed Wall Street predictions, although revenue from its Services division was slightly below expectations. CEO Tim Cook mentioned that tariffs are expected to increase Apple's costs by $900 million in the current quarter, assuming no new tariffs are implemented. Cook stated that Apple is already sourcing a significant portion of iPhones from India and other products from Vietnam to mitigate tariff impacts. The company also authorized a $100 billion share repurchase program and declared a dividend increase.</p>

          <p>Amazon's first-quarter results exceeded expectations, driven by cloud computing and advertising growth, but the company's guidance for the current period fell short, causing the stock to decline. Amazon cited tariffs, trade policies, and recessionary fears as potential factors impacting its outlook, a notable shift from the previous quarter when tariffs were not mentioned in forward-looking statements. The company faces significant exposure to tariffs through its retail unit and third-party marketplace sellers, who rely on goods made or assembled in China.

          <p>New York lawmakers are contemplating a deal that could significantly reduce state oversight of religious schools, a move that would particularly benefit the Hasidic Jewish community. The proposal, potentially included in the state budget, has sparked concern among education experts, including the state education commissioner, who believes it would compromise the education of children attending schools that do not offer a basic secular education. The potential changes include delaying consequences for schools that flout education law and lowering standards for demonstrating compliance, raising questions about the motivations of elected officials and the future of secular education in these communities.</p>

          <p>President Donald Trump declared that any country or person purchasing oil or petrochemicals from Iran will face immediate secondary sanctions, barring them from conducting business with the U.S. This announcement is part of Trump's "maximum pressure" campaign against Iran, aiming to halt the country's oil exports and prevent it from developing nuclear weapons. Experts suggest the move is primarily targeted at China, a major importer of Iranian oil, and underscores Trump's strategy of negotiating from a position of strength. The president had previously imposed similar sanctions on countries buying oil from Venezuela.</p>

Brooks suggests that in this increasingly dehumanizing age, it is crucial to find solace in rehumanizing forces such as art, literature, and selfless individuals.

          <p>The U.S. military will maintain its existing standards for investigating sexual assault reports and sexual harassment complaints, despite a broader review of equal opportunity programs. This announcement comes as the Defense Department faces potential staff reductions in sexual assault prevention programs due to government-wide cost-cutting efforts. While Secretary of Defense Pete Hegseth has called for a review to ensure discrimination complaints are not being "weaponized," officials emphasize that the standard of proof for sexual assault cases remains unchanged. Advocacy groups express concern that the directive could discourage victims from reporting misconduct.</p>

          <p>The Trump administration has requested the Supreme Court to intervene in its effort to terminate Temporary Protected Status (TPS) for Venezuelan migrants in the U.S. The administration argues that continuing the program is "contrary to the national interest," while a lower court has delayed the termination, citing concerns about negative stereotypes. The legal battle centers on the Executive Branch's authority over immigration policy and the rights of migrants seeking protection from deportation due to conditions in their home country.</p>

          <p>Mike Waltz is leaving his role as national security advisor, but will be nominated as ambassador to the United Nations, while Secretary of State Marco Rubio will serve as interim national security advisor. The decision to nominate Waltz to the U.N. post was made at the last minute, following concerns about vetting of NSC staff, the Signal chat incident, and a lack of fit within the senior team. The move comes after several NSC staffers were fired, and Waltz will now face Senate confirmation for the ambassador role.</p>

          <p>Amid sweeping tariffs imposed by President Trump, businesses are raising prices on a wide range of products, and some are opting to tell consumers exactly why prices are rising by adding tariff surcharges to customer's bills. China-based e-commerce giants Shein and Temu both began listing new prices on their sites this week that reflect the cost of tariffs. Triangl, an online swimwear company, announced that as of April 30, orders from U.S.-based customers will include tariff charges at checkout. Transparency is becoming the norm for businesses that can't absorb tariffs of as high as 145% on goods from China and are passing price hikes onto consumers.</p>

Factors contributing to gold's resilience include its safe-haven appeal, response to monetary policy, currency concerns, and the need for portfolio diversification. While no asset is guaranteed to perform perfectly, gold's long-standing reputation as a store of value means it's typically one of the more resilient assets during economic downturns.
