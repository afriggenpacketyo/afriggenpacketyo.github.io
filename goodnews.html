          <p>US Commerce Secretary Howard Lutnick stated that the U.S. would not impose tariffs on natural resources it lacks in abundance. This announcement came during questioning by House lawmakers concerned about rising consumer prices. Lutnick cited bananas, spices, and roots as examples of items exempt from duties. He emphasized the need for fair trade, particularly regarding U.S. agricultural products, as the U.S. negotiates trade deals ahead of President Trump's proposed "Liberation Day" tariffs deadline.</p>

          <p>The government has announced a ban on "unfair" bonuses for senior executives at water companies that fail to meet environmental and consumer standards. The measures apply to companies that do not meet environmental and consumer standards, are not financially resilient, or have been convicted of a criminal offense. Six firms are banned from paying bonuses this year including Anglian Water, Southern Water, Thames Water, United Utilities, Wessex Water and Yorkshire Water. The ban, which is backdated to April 2024, means regulator Ofwat can force firms to claw back bonuses that have been paid or face enforcement action.</p>
