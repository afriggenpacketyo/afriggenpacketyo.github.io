          <h2>NCAA Settlement Approved, Ushering in New Era of Athlete Compensation</h2>
          <div class="timestamp">2025-06-06 22:47:33 EDT</div>
        </div>
        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>A federal judge has approved a $2.7 billion settlement in the House v. NCAA case, which will allow college athletes in the NCAA's top division to be directly paid for the first time. The settlement includes a $20.5 million salary cap per school and payments to former athletes who were not allowed to earn money during their collegiate careers. NCAA president Charlie Baker hailed the approval as a positive change that was long overdue, marking a significant shift from the tradition of amateurism that previously governed college athletics. The settlement arose from multiple lawsuits challenging the NCAA's restrictions on athlete compensation, driven by the exponential growth of revenue in college sports. The agreement also establishes a third-party clearinghouse to review licensing agreements for fair market value. The new system is expected to significantly impact the recruitment and compensation of college athletes, particularly in high-revenue sports like football and basketball.</p>

          <p>A federal judge approved a settlement that will allow schools to begin paying athletes directly, marking a significant shift in college sports. The settlement includes a provision for each school to share up to $20.5 million with athletes annually and a $2.7 billion payout to former players who were previously barred from receiving revenue. NCAA President Charlie Baker stated that the settlement opens a pathway to stabilizing college sports, allowing schools to provide direct financial benefits to student-athletes. The agreement is expected to professionalize college athletics, impacting recruitment, compensation, and the overall structure of college sports programs. The ACC, Big Ten, Big 12, and SEC conferences will hold significant power in decision-making, especially concerning the College Football Playoff.</p>

          <p>The phone call between Chinese President Xi Jinping and U.S. President Donald Trump could provide a temporary relief for Asian countries caught in the rivalry between the two nations. The conversation, described as "very positive" by Trump, may ease the pressure on these countries to choose between prioritizing trade with China and navigating aggressive U.S. policies. However, analysts caution that the relationship between the two powers remains fragile. The call is considered a diplomatic breakthrough after weeks of worsening tensions between the world's two largest economies.</p>

          <p>Hong Kong continues to be China's leading hub for global finance, surpassing Shanghai as the preferred destination for mainland companies seeking capital. Despite the presence of mainland exchanges like Beijing, Shanghai, and Shenzhen, companies are increasingly turning to Hong Kong's stock exchange due to its access to international capital and strong connectivity to global markets. Recent trade hostilities and animosity towards Chinese companies in the U.S. have further solidified Hong Kong's appeal. Hong Kong's market capitalization is nearly US$6.2 trillion, making it the world's fourth-largest.</p>
