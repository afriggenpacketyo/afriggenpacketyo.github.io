        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>American shopping malls, long considered a dying retail format, are experiencing a surprising resurgence by replacing vacant anchor stores with unconventional tenants like churches, bowling alleys, and large bookstores. For example, the Dayton Mall in Ohio transformed a former Sears into a thriving church and community hub, driving significant foot traffic. Mall owners are finding that diversifying their offerings with experiential businesses and community spaces increases 'cross-shopping' and appeals to younger generations like Gen Z. This strategy of subdividing large retail spaces is proving successful in revitalizing these once-struggling commercial centers.</p>

          <p>After a high school football player, Logan Coleridge, experienced debilitating symptoms for months following a concussion, doctors discovered he had a rare brain condition. His persistent dizziness, severe headaches, and memory issues were not improving with standard concussion treatment, prompting a specialist to order an MRI. The scan revealed an arteriovenous malformation (AVM), an abnormal tangle of blood vessels that was likely the true cause of his symptoms. Following successful brain surgery to remove the AVM, the teenager has made a full recovery and is preparing to return to the football field.</p>

          <p>As extreme heat increases cooling demands in commercial buildings, New York-based startup Runwise is tackling energy waste with its innovative hardware and software platform. The system uses a network of wireless sensors and weather algorithms to intelligently control a building's heating and cooling, eliminating inefficient, centralized temperature settings. Runwise, now installed in over 10,000 buildings, claims to have saved clients over $100 million in energy costs. The company recently secured a $55 million Series B funding round to expand its operations and further integrate artificial intelligence into its efficiency models.</p>

          <p>With rising ticket prices for major artists, a growing number of concertgoers, particularly younger generations, are using buy now, pay later (BNPL) loans to afford live events. A recent survey found 23% of attendees have used these services, with the figure rising to over a third for Gen Z and millennials. Financial analysts caution against this trend, suggesting that fans should instead create dedicated savings funds for such discretionary spending. While BNPL offers interest-free installments, it may lack the consumer protections of credit cards and can lead to debt if not managed carefully.</p>

          <p>San Francisco-based startup Marathon Fusion has proposed a modern form of alchemy: manufacturing gold by repurposing neutrons generated during the nuclear fusion process. The company suggests that this could create a valuable revenue stream, potentially producing tons of gold annually to help subsidize the high cost of developing commercial fusion energy. While the concept of transmuting elements is scientifically possible, it has never been commercially viable. The plan remains speculative, as it depends on the future success of commercial-scale fusion reactors, which are still in the experimental phase.</p>

          <p>Activist investment firm Carronade Capital is pushing satellite communications company Viasat to unlock shareholder value by spinning off its Defense and Advanced Technologies (DAT) division. Carronade argues the market misunderstands Viasat, undervaluing it as a legacy satellite company threatened by competitors like Starlink, while ignoring the highly profitable and rapidly growing DAT business. The firm suggests that separating the defense segment could reveal its true worth, potentially valuing it at multiples far exceeding the entire company's current valuation.

          <p>The leaders of Armenia and Azerbaijan have signed a historic peace agreement at the White House, officially ending decades of conflict over the Nagorno-Karabakh region. The U.S.-brokered deal includes the creation of a major transit corridor linking Azerbaijan to its exclave of Nakhchivan, which will be named the "Trump Route for International Peace and Prosperity." This agreement marks a significant diplomatic achievement and signals declining Russian influence in the South Caucasus region. Both nations also signed separate cooperation deals with the United States to bolster economic and technological ties.</p>

          <p>OpenAI's newly launched GPT-5 model is receiving mixed reviews from experts in China, a key market in the global artificial intelligence race. While OpenAI touted its latest offering as its smartest and fastest model yet, some Chinese analysts described it as lacking revolutionary breakthroughs or memorable characteristics. The launch comes as competition in the AI sector intensifies, with Chinese tech firms rapidly developing their own advanced models. GPT-5 features improved performance in areas like coding, math, and visual perception, with a built-in "thinking" function to handle complex queries.</p>

          <p>China is moving forward with the development of the Xinjiang-Tibet Railway, a strategic project aimed at creating a 2,000-kilometer (1,240-mile) transportation artery in its western region. The project involves connecting the existing Lhasa-Shigatse line with a new route from Hotan, enhancing connectivity between northwestern and southwestern China. This railway is a key component of a larger plan to establish a 5,000-kilometer plateau rail network centered on Lhasa by 2035. A new company has been registered to oversee the project, which also includes real estate development, tourism, and international contracting.</p>

          <p>Travelers can avoid expensive international roaming charges on their cell phones by employing several cost-saving strategies. Experts recommend leveraging free Wi-Fi whenever possible and pre-downloading maps and guides for offline use to minimize cellular data consumption. Another effective option is purchasing a local or international eSIM, which often provides data at a much lower cost than daily roaming packages from major carriers. Before traveling, customers should check their current plan's international features and, if necessary, contact their provider to ensure their phone is unlocked to support a third-party eSIM.</p>

          <p>The South Korean military has observed North Korean troops dismantling some of their propaganda loudspeakers along the shared border. This move is seen as a reciprocal gesture following South Korea's decision in June to halt its own broadcasts of K-pop music and news reports into the North. The action represents one of the first de-escalatory steps taken by Pyongyang under the new administration of South Korean President Lee Jae Myung, who has prioritized reopening dialogue. These cross-border loudspeaker campaigns have historically been a tool used by both nations during periods of heightened tension.</p>

          <p>Manchester United has completed the signing of 22-year-old striker Benjamin Sesko from RB Leipzig for a total fee of £73.7 million. The Slovenia international has signed a five-year contract, becoming the club's third major attacking acquisition under manager Ruben Amorim. Sesko, who was also a target for Newcastle United, is recognized as one of the top young goalscorers in Europe, known for his electrifying pace and physical dominance. His arrival raises questions about the future of current striker Rasmus Hojlund, whom the club is reportedly willing to sell.</p>
