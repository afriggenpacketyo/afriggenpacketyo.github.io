          <p>Former Labour leader Jeremy Corbyn has confirmed that "discussions are ongoing" to form a new left-wing political party in the United Kingdom. The announcement follows former Labour MP Zarah Sultana's decision to leave her party to co-lead the new venture with Corbyn. He praised Sultana's move and stated that the "democratic foundations of a new kind of political party will soon take shape" to provide an alternative to the current government. The move signals a formal effort to organize the small group of independent, pro-Gaza MPs into a unified political entity.</p>

          <p>Emily Hunt, a former government advisor on sexual assault, has expressed relief after her abuser, Christopher Killick, was sentenced to three years in prison for harassment. Killick had previously pleaded guilty to voyeurism for filming Hunt while she was unconscious in 2015 but avoided jail time. Despite a restraining order, he repeatedly breached it by tweeting about her, leading to the new sentence. Hunt, who waived her anonymity to campaign for justice and changes in the law, stated she finally feels safe now that he is imprisoned.</p>

          <p>Astronomers have identified a third known interstellar object, a comet named 3I/ATLAS, that has entered our solar system. Scientists confirm that the comet, currently about 416 million miles from the sun, poses no danger to Earth, with its closest approach in October being more than 1.5 times the distance from the Earth to the sun. The object was spotted by the ATLAS telescope in Chile and is believed to be larger than the two previously detected interstellar visitors, 'Oumuamua and Borisov. Researchers will continue to study its trajectory and composition to learn more about its origins from another planetary system.</p>

          <p>Turkish authorities have arrested Ismail Abdo, a 35-year-old Swedish-Turkish dual citizen and one of Sweden's most-wanted suspected gang leaders. The arrest was part of a major operation targeting international drug trafficking and money laundering. Abdo is allegedly a key figure in a violent gang war in Sweden that has resulted in more than a dozen deaths, including that of his own mother. Swedish police described the capture as a significant success resulting from close cooperation between the two countries' judicial systems.</p>

          <p>A cardiologist with over 20 years of experience treating heart disease has shared a list of six food categories he avoids feeding his own children. The list includes microwave popcorn due to chemicals in the bags, flavored yogurts for their high sugar content, and processed meats like bacon and hot dogs because of sodium and nitrates. He also advises against sugary cereals, sugary drinks, and deep-fried foods, which can promote inflammation and poor metabolic health. Instead, he recommends healthier alternatives like air-popped popcorn, plain yogurt with fruit, and unprocessed proteins.</p>

          <p>This article provides financial guidance on whether to hire professional movers, a service that can cost over a thousand dollars for a local move. Experts suggest asking four key questions before deciding. These include considering if you have expensive items that need professional handling, calculating if the time saved is worth the cost relative to your hourly income, and evaluating the value of reducing stress and maintaining peace of mind. Finally, one should ensure the expense does not jeopardize long-term financial goals or lead to high-interest debt.</p>

          <p>This essay reviews two new books that champion a philosophy of valuing the female body for its capabilities rather than its appearance. The first, a memoir by Casey Johnston, celebrates weight lifting as a way to build strength and reject restrictive diet culture. The second is a biography of fashion designer Claire McCardell, who prioritized comfort and practicality in her clothing, famously adding pockets and designing for "women as doers." The article suggests these works offer a refreshing perspective that emphasizes function and empowerment, moving away from punishing beauty standards.</p>

        </div>
        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>A new study published in the Journal of Experimental Psychology suggests that the definition of "cool" is consistent across different cultures. Researchers surveyed nearly 6,000 people in a dozen countries and found that individuals perceived as "cool" share six key traits: they are seen as more extroverted, hedonistic, powerful, adventurous, open, and autonomous. The study distinguishes "coolness" from "goodness," noting that while there can be overlap, cool people possess traits not always associated with being morally good. The findings suggest coolness is a fundamental concept linked to pushing boundaries and sparking change.</p>

          <p>Archaeologists in northern England have unearthed a collection of "unusually large" 2,000-year-old Roman shoes at the Magna Roman Fort, part of the Hadrian's Wall World Heritage Site. Eight of the shoes found in a defensive ditch are over 30cm long, with one equivalent to a modern U.S. size 15. This proportion of large footwear is significantly higher than at other Roman sites like Vindolanda. Researchers are now investigating which Roman regiments were stationed at Magna to understand why so many large-footed individuals might have been present at this specific location.</p>

          <p>This opinion piece, written by three legal professionals, argues that celebrating American freedom on the Fourth of July feels contradictory amid a perceived backslide in democracy and civil rights. The authors contend that the gap between American ideals and reality has always existed for marginalized communities but is now becoming more apparent to all. They reject despair, advocating instead for grassroots action and community engagement as the most powerful response. The article calls on people to connect, act locally, and envision a more just future to transform and defend the nation's democratic principles.</p>

          <p>The Summer Fancy Food Show in New York showcased several emerging food and beverage trends that may soon appear on grocery shelves. Key trends included new takes on pantry staples, with artisanal mustards and flavor-infused olive oils gaining prominence. The "swicy" (sweet and spicy) flavor profile continues to evolve, appearing in products like hot honey ketchup. Other notable trends were the rise of chef-led consumer brands, a more taste-focused approach to plant-based foods, and the niche but growing popularity of cooking with beef tallow.</p>
