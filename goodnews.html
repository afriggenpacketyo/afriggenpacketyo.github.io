          <p>Following meetings with Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy and European leaders in Washington, President Trump announced he has called Russian President Vladimir Putin to begin arranging a bilateral meeting between the two heads of state. Trump stated that after their meeting, he would join them for trilateral talks to advance a peace process for the nearly four-year-long war. The Kremlin confirmed the call, stating Putin supports continued direct negotiations, while German Chancellor Friedrich Merz suggested a potential meeting could occur within two weeks. Zelenskyy affirmed Ukraine's readiness for such a trilateral format, marking a potential diplomatic development.</p>

          <p>Talks in Washington between Presidents Trump and Zelenskyy, joined by European leaders, yielded several key developments aimed at ending the war in Ukraine. The article highlights that Trump initiated arrangements for a direct meeting between Zelenskyy and Russian President Vladimir Putin, to be followed by a trilateral summit. A major point of discussion was the nature of security guarantees for Ukraine, with Trump suggesting U.S. involvement without offering specifics. However, a key divergence remains, as European leaders pushed for a ceasefire as a precondition for further talks, an idea Trump dismissed as not necessarily required.</p>

          <p>Sam Altman, the CEO of OpenAI, has warned that the artificial intelligence sector is currently in a phase of investor overexcitement, with startup valuations becoming "insane." While he cautioned that some investors are likely to get "very burnt," he maintained his deep belief that the long-term societal value created by AI will be tremendous. Altman also stated that OpenAI is prepared to spend trillions on datacenter construction to meet growing demand for computing power, a sign of his conviction in the technology's future. Other tech giants have similarly increased their capital expenditure guidance to keep pace with AI demand.</p>

          <p>Japanese investment giant SoftBank has announced a $2 billion investment in Intel, purchasing shares at $23 each and becoming one of the chipmaker's largest shareholders. This move is seen as a significant vote of confidence in Intel, which has faced challenges in the AI semiconductor boom and in establishing its new manufacturing business. The investment comes as the U.S. government considers taking its own equity stake in the company to support domestic advanced chip manufacturing. SoftBank has been increasing its presence in the chip sector, with major holdings in Arm and a recent acquisition of Ampere Computing. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>The article analyzes Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy's markedly different approach during his latest meeting with President Trump compared to a tense encounter six months prior. This time, Zelenskyy focused on expressing gratitude and avoiding confrontation, a strategy that appeared to be effective in managing the high-stakes talks. He adjusted his attire and opened the meeting with thanks, successfully navigating Trump's desire for acknowledgment while European leaders worked to keep the conversation focused on key issues like a ceasefire. This shift in tactics highlights Zelenskyy's adaptation to the diplomatic challenges of securing continued U.S. support for Ukraine's defense.</p>

          <p>Alibaba's AI-assisted coding model, Qwen 3 Coder, has rapidly gained popularity since its release, capturing over 20% of the usage share on the AI marketplace OpenRouter. This positions it as a major competitor to established leaders like Anthropic's Claude Sonnet 4. Alibaba claims its model's strong performance is due to extensive training on coding-related data and the use of large-scale reinforcement learning. The success of Qwen 3 Coder reflects a broader trend of Chinese tech giants, including ByteDance and Tencent, entering the increasingly competitive AI coding sector to capitalize on the demand for AI-powered development tools.</p>

          <p>Major League Baseball Commissioner Rob Manfred has indicated that future league expansion could provide an opportunity to geographically realign the sport. He suggested that reorganizing teams into Eastern and Western conferences, similar to the NBA, could significantly reduce travel wear and tear on players and create more appealing postseason television slots. While such a move would likely face pushback from traditionalists, it could also foster stronger regional rivalries. Manfred expressed a desire to have expansion locations, with Nashville and Salt Lake City seen as frontrunners, selected before his term ends in 2029.</p>

          <p>The California state legislature has passed a bill that ensures homeowners, rather than mortgage lenders, receive interest earned on insurance payouts for homes damaged or destroyed in natural disasters. Currently, lenders can deposit insurance funds into an escrow account and keep the accrued interest while homeowners wait for the funds to be released for rebuilding. The new legislation, which now heads to the governor's desk, would close this loophole by guaranteeing homeowners at least 2% simple interest per annum on these held funds. The bill is intended to provide additional financial support to disaster victims during their recovery.</p>
