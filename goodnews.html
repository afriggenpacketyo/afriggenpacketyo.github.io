          <p>England's Red Roses secured their place in the Rugby World Cup semi-finals after defeating Scotland 40-8 in challenging, rainy conditions at Ashton Gate. The victory marked England's 31st consecutive win, setting a new record in international rugby. Despite an early penalty from Scotland, England dominated with tries from Kelsey Clifford and Morwenna Talling, while Abby Dow scored her 50th try for the national team. The team's pragmatic and powerful performance in the wet weather proved decisive, setting up a highly anticipated semi-final clash against France next week in Bristol.</p>

          <p>Representative Michael McCaul, a prominent Texas Republican and foreign policy expert, has announced he will not seek another term in 2026, concluding an 11-term career in Congress. McCaul, who has chaired both the House Homeland Security and Foreign Affairs Committees, stated he is looking for a 'new challenge' in the national security realm. A strong advocate for U.S. support for Ukraine, he recently disputed President Trump's assessment of Russian drone incursions over Poland. His retirement adds to a number of departures from the House as lawmakers seek other offices or leave public service.</p>

          <p>Barron Trump has reportedly transitioned from New York University's main Manhattan campus to its specialized program in Washington, D.C. This move places him closer to his parents, President Donald Trump and First Lady Melania Trump. The NYU D.C. program is highly selective, accepting up to 120 students per semester for a curriculum that integrates coursework with professional internships related to government and public policy. While Barron was previously enrolled in the Stern School of Business, his choice of the D.C. program has sparked speculation about a potential shift in his academic focus toward politics.</p>

          <p>England's head cricket coach, Brendon McCullum, anticipates a 'short' selection meeting for the upcoming Ashes tour of Australia, indicating the team is largely settled. The main point of discussion is expected to be the choice of a second spinner to support Shoaib Bashir. McCullum confirmed that the squad could include as many as seven specialist seamers and will not feature a backup wicketkeeper, with Ollie Pope able to deputize. He also hinted at ongoing discussions about the vice-captaincy, acknowledging Harry Brook's emergence as a leader within the team's structure.</p>

          <p>British supermarket group Sainsbury’s has officially ended talks with Chinese e-commerce firm JD.com regarding the potential sale of its general merchandise chain, Argos. The company announced that JD.com was only prepared to proceed with 'materially revised' terms, which were not in the best interest of Sainsbury's shareholders. Despite the collapsed deal, Sainsbury's reaffirmed its financial outlook, stating it still expects to achieve a retail underlying operating profit of approximately £1 billion for the 2025-2026 fiscal year. The potential acquisition was seen as a way for JD.com to leverage its expertise in technology and logistics.</p>

          <p>Philadelphia Eagles running back Saquon Barkley has reportedly invested millions of his nearly $80 million in career earnings into a diverse portfolio of tech startups and venture capital funds. Following the 'Marshawn Lynch method,' Barkley lives off his endorsement deals while investing his NFL salary to build long-term wealth. His investments are said to include AI firm Anthropic, Elon Musk's Neuralink, and Peter Thiel's Founders Fund, reflecting a sophisticated strategy that has evolved from traditional index funds to higher-risk, high-reward ventures. This approach is driven by his awareness of the limited lifespan of an NFL running back's career.</p>

          <p>Bridget Phillipson, the UK's Education Secretary, has officially launched her campaign for the deputy leadership of the Labour Party, urging the party to remain united. In a speech in Sunderland, she positioned herself as a candidate who can bring Labour together, secure a second term, and effectively combat the rise of the Reform UK party. Phillipson paid tribute to her predecessor, Angela Rayner, who resigned over her tax affairs, and pledged to continue a strong campaigning role. She is competing against former Cabinet colleague Lucy Powell for the position, with the winner to be announced in late October.</p>

          <p>The financial markets are focused on the Federal Reserve's upcoming policy meeting, with a 25-basis-point interest rate cut widely expected on Wednesday. Investors are less focused on the cut itself and more on Chairman Jerome Powell's subsequent statements for clues about the future path of monetary policy, especially after recent mixed inflation data and weak jobs growth. Also on the agenda for the week are investor day presentations from cybersecurity firm CrowdStrike and industrial giant DuPont, which will provide updates on their respective business strategies and outlooks.
