          <p>The Canadian government has rescinded its digital services tax just a day before the first payments were due, following a declaration by U.S. President Donald Trump that he was terminating all trade talks. The tax, which would have applied a 3% levy on large tech companies like Google and Amazon, was a point of major contention with the United States. Ottawa's reversal is aimed at restarting crucial trade negotiations, with officials stating the move will support progress toward a new economic and security relationship. The U.S. had strongly opposed the tax, particularly its retroactive application, calling it discriminatory against American firms. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>A black bear, nicknamed "Mosey" by local police, has been spotted for a second time in Greene County, Ohio, prompting the Yellow Springs Police Department to issue public safety reminders. The bear was previously seen in the area on June 19 and is believed to be the same one that first appeared in a neighboring county. The Ohio Department of Natural Resources (ODNR) states that black bears are typically shy and will avoid humans. Officials are advising residents not to approach or feed the animal and to secure potential food sources like trash, bird feeders, and pet food to encourage it to move on naturally.</p>

          <h2>Researchers Investigate Why Electric Vehicles May Induce Motion Sickness More Frequently</h2>
          <div class="timestamp">2025-06-29 22:00:13 EDT</div>
        </div>
        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>As electric vehicles become more common, passengers are increasingly reporting experiences of motion sickness, a phenomenon researchers are now studying. Studies suggest that the unique acceleration and deceleration of EVs, particularly the regenerative braking systems, can contribute to queasiness. Regenerative braking, which captures energy when slowing down, creates a low-frequency deceleration that can provoke symptoms like dizziness and tension in passengers. This issue presents a new challenge for automakers, who must now consider passenger comfort and health alongside the environmental and performance benefits as they refine EV technology for a broader market.</p>

In New York, the theme was "Rise Up: Pride in Protest," commemorating the Stonewall Riots and highlighting current threats to the community. The events underscored a global mood of defiant joy, with communities asserting their right to exist and resist in the face of legislative and rhetorical assaults on their freedoms.</p>

          <p>China has officially lifted its comprehensive ban on Japanese seafood imports, which was imposed in August 2023. The ban was a strong political response to Japan's decision to release treated radioactive wastewater from the damaged Fukushima nuclear power plant into the ocean. The move to end the embargo follows an agreement between the two nations in May to begin the process of resuming trade. While the ban is lifted, it may still take several months for actual shipments to commence as procedural steps need to be completed by both sides, marking a significant de-escalation in the trade dispute.</p>

          <p>A young mountain lion cub that suffered a fractured skull and other severe injuries after being struck by a vehicle has been successfully released back into the wild. The San Diego Humane Society's wildlife center undertook a nearly five-month rehabilitation process, providing medical care while carefully ensuring the cub did not become accustomed to humans. After gaining sufficient weight and demonstrating natural survival behaviors, the cub was released in a remote area of the Santa Ana Mountains. The successful rehabilitation highlights the crucial work of wildlife rescue organizations in giving injured animals a second chance at life.</p>
