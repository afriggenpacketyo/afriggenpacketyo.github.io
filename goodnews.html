          <p>Mount Etna, Europe's most active volcano located in Sicily, Italy, has erupted, spewing hot ash and lava in a pyroclastic flow. The nation's volcano monitoring body, INGV Vulcani, reported "explosions of increasing intensity" and noted that the activity from the Southeast Crater had become a lava fountain. Infrared images captured the flow of lava down the mountain's face, accompanied by a massive plume of smoke and ash rising into the sky. While Etna frequently erupts, causing occasional dust coverings in nearby towns, there were no immediate reports of risks to the local population or air travel. The volcano had a significant eruption just over a year ago, and it has erupted at least once every year for the past several years. The volcano is considered the most active stratovolcano in the world.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Maintaining a romantic relationship requires effort, but knowing when that effort becomes excessive is crucial for individual well-being. While all relationships need maintenance, modern culture often encourages individuals to abandon relationships that demand significant conflict resolution or compromise. Research suggests that couples who invest effort into their relationships are happier in the long term, engaging in activities such as showing compassion, spending time together, and discussing problems. However, it's important to recognize when one partner is carrying most of the burden, leading to resentment and burnout, and to consider personal needs and goals before deciding when enough is enough.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Major steel stocks experienced a significant surge following President Donald Trump's decision to double tariffs on steel imports. Shares of Cleveland-Cliffs, Steel Dynamics, and Nucor all jumped substantially in premarket trading. Trump announced he would increase tariffs on steel imports to 50% from 25%, a move that has reignited trade tensions and drawn criticism from global partners. This decision is expected to further secure the steel industry in the United States, according to Trump. The VanEck Steel ETF (SLX) also saw gains, reflecting overall positive market sentiment towards steel companies following the tariff announcement. (not investment advice)</p>

          <h2>Flight Path Modernization Aims for Quicker Flights and Reduced Delays</h2>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>The UK government plans to modernize flight paths, potentially leading to shorter journey times, fewer delays, and increased flight capacity. The UK Airspace Design Service (UKADS) will redesign flight routes, many of which were established 70 years ago, to allow planes to climb quicker during takeoff and descend more smoothly. The changes also aim to reduce aviation's climate impact and accommodate new technologies like flying taxis. However, some residents fear new flight paths could increase noise pollution over currently unaffected areas, and environmental groups stress the need to prioritize environmental impacts and community well-being. Changes to London airspace are not expected until the 2030s, but some route adjustments outside London could occur sooner. The changes would allow the largest re-design of UK airspace since it was first formed in the 1950s.</p>

          <p>Space agencies and commercial companies are increasingly interested in returning to the moon, driven by its potential as a gateway to Mars and its abundant resources. NASA and ESA are collaborating on the Artemis program, aiming to establish a permanent base at the moon's South Pole and launch a space station called Gateway into lunar orbit. Simultaneously, a joint China-Russia project plans to build the International Lunar Research Station by 2035. The moon's resources, including iron, silicon, hydrogen, titanium, and rare earth elements, could support lunar bases and future Mars missions, with water ice at the lunar poles being crucial for drinking, food, and rocket propellant. Scientific research on the moon aims to make space travel safer and easier, with the long-term goal of using lunar bases as staging posts for more distant space travel.</p>

          <p>A restaurant consultant shares insights on proper dining etiquette, emphasizing the importance of avoiding "one-timing" servers by placing orders all at once and using polite methods to get their attention, such as making eye contact and waving. The consultant advises customers to be understanding if an order is incorrect, acknowledging the potential for errors in the kitchen. The consultant also notes that appropriate dining time ranges from two to two-and-a-half hours for fine dining and an hour to an hour and 45 minutes for casual dining. It is courteous to place your first order shortly after being seated, and appetizer orders should be taken within 10 to 15 minutes, with entrees arriving within 20 to 25 minutes.</p>

          <div class="timestamp">2025-06-02 07:00:00 EDT</div>
        </div>
        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>The pursuit of perfect self-knowledge is often encouraged but remains unattainable due to limitations in human self-perception. Unconscious behaviors, biases, and the capacity for change all complicate the ability to see oneself clearly and accurately. Overly intense introspection can lead to rumination and undermine well-being, while the belief in a fixed "true self" can hinder personal growth. Instead of seeking a definitive truth about oneself, it is more beneficial to construct a positive, reality-based narrative that allows for flexibility and surprise. The notion that each person has one real, abiding self buried within, waiting to be discovered, is both widespread and difficult for many people to shake.</p>

          <h2>First-Time Buyers Borrowing for Longer Mortgage Terms</h2>
          <div class="timestamp">2025-06-02 06:49:05 EDT</div>
        </div>
        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>First-time buyers are increasingly opting for longer mortgage terms, averaging 31 years, due to the challenges of home affordability. This trend contrasts with a decade ago when the average mortgage term was 28 years, as higher mortgage rates have pushed buyers to extend their repayment periods to lower monthly payments. Lenders are offering mortgage terms up to 40 years, particularly popular among first-time buyers in their 30s, although many may choose shorter terms later if their financial situation improves. Despite recent decreases in mortgage rates, affordability remains strained due to rising house prices, with many new mortgages requiring repayments into retirement. Even as interest rates have come down, this measure of affordability has not eased significantly, with rising house prices largely offsetting any lowering of payments through falling rates.</p>

          <p>Max Verstappen has acknowledged that his "frustration" led to a collision with George Russell during the Spanish Grand Prix, admitting that the move "was not right and shouldn't have happened." Russell had accused Verstappen of deliberately driving into his Mercedes, and Verstappen initially dismissed the incident as a "misjudgement." However, Verstappen later posted on social media that his actions were fueled by emotions and that he takes responsibility for the collision. The incident resulted in a 10-second penalty for Verstappen and left him 49 points behind championship leader Oscar Piastri.</p>
