          <p>Scientists on Nantucket are pursuing a groundbreaking strategy to combat Lyme disease by genetically engineering wild white-footed mice to develop immunity to the illness. Led by MIT associate professor Kevin Esvelt, the "Mice Against Ticks" project utilizes CRISPR technology to introduce an antibody gene into mouse embryos, creating heritable immunity. The aim is to interrupt the disease transmission cycle, which relies on mice as the main host, without harming the animals or the broader ecosystem.
