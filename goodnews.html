          <p>McDonald's exceeded Wall Street's second-quarter earnings and revenue expectations, driven by a rebound in U.S. sales from promotional activities like a "Minecraft" movie tie-in. Despite this success, executives expressed caution regarding the economic health of low-income consumers, who are a crucial part of their customer base. The company is exploring more affordable menu options to re-engage this demographic and anticipates stronger performance in the latter half of the year. This article highlights the dual reality of corporate success against a backdrop of consumer economic strain.</p>

          <p>Shopify's stock price increased by 20% after the company reported second-quarter earnings and revenue that surpassed analysts' predictions. The Canadian e-commerce firm also provided a positive outlook for the third quarter, projecting revenue growth in the mid-to-high twenties percentage range. Executives noted that the feared negative impact from U.S. trade tariffs did not occur, and the company has seen accelerating U.S. demand. The strong performance is also attributed to investments in artificial intelligence tools designed to attract and support merchants on its platform. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>The Democratic party is actively recruiting high-profile candidates in an effort to regain a majority in the Senate during the 2026 midterm elections. A significant development is the entry of former North Carolina Governor Roy Cooper into the race for a retiring Republican's seat, a move seen as a major boost for the party. Democrats are also courting former Senator Sherrod Brown for a run in Ohio and are navigating competitive primary races in states like Michigan. The strategy focuses on key battleground states such as Georgia and even traditionally Republican states like Texas, where they hope to capitalize on divisive GOP primaries.</p>

          <p>Iranian President Masoud Pezeshkian and Pakistani Prime Minister Shehbaz Sharif have agreed to enhance bilateral relations, aiming to increase trade to $10 billion and bolster security cooperation. Both nations face challenges from militant groups operating near their shared border and are pursuing joint patrols and intelligence sharing. The partnership comes as Pakistan also deepens its ties with the United States, creating a complex diplomatic situation. Analysts suggest that while Iran is wary of U.S. influence, Pakistan has historically avoided direct military alignment against Tehran and may act as a mediator between Iran and Washington.</p>

          <p>One of the largest solar and battery storage projects in the U.S., the Eland project in Kern County, is now fully operational and supplying power to Los Angeles and Glendale. The facility, featuring 1.36 million solar panels, will generate 7% of L.A.'s electricity, pushing the city to 64% clean energy and closer to its 2035 goal of 100%. The project's battery storage is crucial, as it allows clean energy to be stored and dispatched after sunset. This development represents a significant step in California's transition to renewable energy, even as the federal administration slows clean energy initiatives.</p>

          <p>In an economic climate of persistent inflation, Certificates of Deposit (CDs) offer a secure way for savers to earn returns that can outpace rising costs. Top CD rates currently surpass national averages, with online banks often providing the most competitive yields due to lower overhead costs. The article notes an inverted yield curve, where short-term CDs presently offer higher interest rates than long-term ones, a trend that has persisted since late 2022. For savers, this suggests that shorter-term CDs may provide better immediate returns in the current market. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>Despite recent news of redundancies and cost-cutting measures, Manchester United appears able to finance a potential £74 million deal for RB Leipzig striker Benjamin Sesko. Football finance experts explain that the club is using clever financing, such as spreading payments for new signings over the length of their contracts. The club has also benefited financially from loaning out Marcus Rashford, receiving a payment from Chelsea's abandoned pursuit of Jadon Sancho, and from sell-on clauses for former players. While not in as strong a financial position as some rivals, the club's commercial power remains a significant asset.</p>

          <p>The Italian government has approved the €13.5 billion construction of a bridge connecting the mainland to Sicily, a project that has been debated and delayed for decades. When completed, the Strait of Messina Bridge would be the world's longest suspension bridge, measuring nearly 2.3 miles. Proponents, including Transport Minister Matteo Salvini, argue it will accelerate development and create jobs in southern Italy. However, the project faces significant opposition from critics who raise concerns about its environmental impact, vulnerability to earthquakes, and the potential for mafia interference in its construction.</p>

          <p>China is on the verge of completing a merger between its two largest state-owned shipbuilders, which will create the world's largest publicly listed shipbuilding company. The move, absorbing China Shipbuilding Industry Company into China CSSC Holdings, is seen as a strategic effort by Beijing to optimize resources and boost its competitiveness in the global market. The combined entity will have assets exceeding 400 billion yuan and will focus on high-end vessels while phasing out less efficient operations. This consolidation is a key part of China's broader industrial and military ambitions amid growing rivalry with the United States.</p>
