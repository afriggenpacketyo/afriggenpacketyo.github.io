          <p>Jim Agresti, president of Just Facts, challenges Democratic criticisms of President Trump's "big beautiful bill," arguing that claims of Medicaid cuts harming the poor are unfounded. He asserts the bill targets illegal immigrants and fraudsters, aiming to bring people out of poverty by incentivizing work. Agresti refutes claims that the bill raises copayments for those below the poverty line, explaining it reduces the maximum copayment for those above it. He also points out the potential for waste in the current system where people can access medical services without any copayment. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>Tokyo police and prosecutors have issued apologies to two men for their wrongful arrest and indictment in a 2020 case involving the suspected unauthorized export of sensitive equipment. The apology follows a Tokyo High Court ruling ordering compensation for Masaaki Okawara and Junji Shimada, who were arrested and indicted on suspicion of exporting spray dryers that could be used in biological weapons production.

          <p>A new PBS documentary, Caregiving, examines the historical context behind the lack of resources and support for family caregivers in the United States. The film traces the evolution of caregiving policies, from early 20th-century almshouses to the limitations of Medicare and Medicaid. It highlights the absence of a comprehensive public support system for long-term care, leaving caregivers largely on their own. The documentary also features activists working to bring caregiving back into the public conversation and advocate for policy changes.</p>

        </div>
        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Contrary to claims that Gen Z is becoming increasingly conservative, data suggests that young adults have not become more likely to identify as conservative or hold broadly conservative views. While young adults voted for Trump at a higher rate in 2024, they remain more liberal than previous generations on many issues. The shift may be due to dissatisfaction with the economy or a generalized pessimism, leading to a desire to "vote the bastards out" regardless of party affiliation. This suggests that the 2024 election may have been an anomaly rather than a lasting ideological realignment.</p>
