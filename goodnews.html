          <div class="timestamp">2025-09-28 20:30:13 EDT</div>
        </div>
        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Hong Kong's ambitious goals for adopting green marine fuels, particularly methanol, face a critical hurdle in establishing a robust and reliable supply chain, according to CM Energy President Wang Yongxin. While the city has successfully implemented liquefied natural gas and biodiesel operations, it urgently needs to develop the necessary infrastructure to bring mainland-produced green methanol into Hong Kong, store it, and sell it tax-free. This challenge arises as the CM Hong Kong, touted as the world's first large vehicle carrier capable of running on both traditional fuel and methanol, embarks on its inaugural voyage. Despite green methanol currently costing four times more than conventional fuel, its usage is projected to increase significantly from 2027, driven by Europe's new carbon emissions-based import tariff regime.</p>

          <p>Moldova's pro-European Party of Action and Solidarity (PAS), led by President Maia Sandu, is set for a new parliamentary majority after winning elections marked by widespread claims of Russian interference. Sandu emphasized the election's critical importance for Moldova's future path to the EU, with her party securing nearly 50% of the vote. The vote saw bomb scares at polling stations and arrests for plotting unrest, which Sandu's party attributed to Moscow-backed criminal groups. The outcome is a significant step towards European integration for Moldova, a country grappling with economic issues and the impact of the war in neighboring Ukraine.</p>

          <p>Asia-Pacific markets experienced mixed trading on Monday, with Australia's S&P/ASX 200 seeing gains while Japan's Nikkei 225 and Topix declined after reaching a record high on Friday. The Reserve Bank of Australia began its two-day policy meeting, where it is widely anticipated to maintain its cash rate at 3.6%, according to a Reuters poll. Analysts from the Commonwealth Bank of Australia highlighted "real tension building in the data flow," noting both "material upside risks to Q3 inflation" and a cyclical upswing in activity, alongside signs of moderating wages growth and softer employment. Meanwhile, U.S. major averages rallied on Friday following crucial inflation data, breaking a three-day losing streak but still closing the week with slight losses. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>Team Europe secured a 15-13 victory over the United States in the Ryder Cup at Bethpage Black, marking their fifth away win and the first since 2012. Despite entering Sunday singles with a record seven-point lead, the Americans mounted a fierce comeback, winning 8.5 points from 12 matches. Tyrrell Hatton ultimately clinched the winning point for Europe, while Shane Lowry's crucial birdie on the 18th ensured they would at least retain the trophy. Captain Luke Donald became only the second European captain to achieve back-to-back home and away victories, cementing his legacy in the tournament's history.</p>

          <p>Dana White, CEO of the Ultimate Fighting Championship (UFC), is widely credited with transforming the mixed martial arts league from an unprofitable and largely unsanctioned operation into a global sports empire valued at over $15 billion. White's business acumen and willingness to take risks were evident from the start, notably securing Donald Trump's Taj Mahal casino as a venue for early fights when others rejected the sport. The league's ascent was significantly aided by a reality television series, "The Ultimate Fighter," which broadened its appeal. The UFC was later sold for $4 billion, with White remaining at the helm, and its mainstream status was further solidified by Paramount's recent $7.7 billion offer for its U.S. media rights.</p>

          <p>The picturesque Dutch village of Zaanse Schans, famous for its historic windmills, is set to introduce a €17.50 entry fee for non-local tourists starting next spring to manage severe overtourism. Last year, the village, with only 100 residents, attracted 2.6 million visitors, leading to significant privacy intrusions like tourists walking into private gardens and houses. The new fee will include admission to the village's museum and the interior of the windmills, which previously charged separately, with the generated revenue earmarked for essential maintenance and new infrastructure, including toilets. While some visitors question the cost, others believe it is a necessary step to preserve the village's unique charm and quality of life for its inhabitants.</p>

While his individual match against Scottie Scheffler was not his best, McIlroy's overall performance secured 3.5 points for Europe. This victory marks the culmination of a personal mission for McIlroy, who had been focused on this specific achievement since the previous Ryder Cup.</p>

Manager Dave Roberts had Freddie Freeman remove Kershaw from the mound, marking an emotional moment.

The proposals include stringent conditions such as achieving high English proficiency, maintaining a clean criminal record, and actively volunteering in their communities, while also extending the qualification period from five to ten years. This initiative aims to draw a clear distinction between Labour's approach and that of Reform UK, which advocates for abolishing indefinite leave to remain entirely.

Their starting pitching, particularly Hunter Greene, is a significant strength, along with a reliable closer in Emilio Pagán.

While broad agreement existed, some divisions emerged on criminal justice approaches, with varying stances on stricter penalties versus treatment and diversion programs. The debate also prominently featured the urgent need to construct more housing units and streamline bureaucratic permitting processes across the state.</p>

Cramer acknowledges skepticism about AI's immediate tangible benefits but believes in its future potential and the strategic investments being made by trusted leaders like Nvidia's Jensen Huang.

          <p>Asian economies should closely monitor the upcoming 2026 review of the US-Mexico-Canada Agreement (USMCA) due to their substantial trade and investment flows to North America. In the past five years, Asian exports to USMCA partners grew by nearly 35% to $1.7 trillion, with foreign direct investment exceeding $33 billion in 2024, particularly tripling to Mexico. This investment surge is driven by a desire to leverage USMCA tariff preferences, access the growing Mexican market, and diversify trading partners.
