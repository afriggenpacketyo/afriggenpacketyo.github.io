          <p>Archaeologists in London have discovered a significant collection of painted Roman wall plaster at a development site. The fragments, found in a pit, once adorned a high-status Roman building and offer insights into ancient Londinium's artistic sophistication. Experts at the Museum of London Archaeology (MOLA) meticulously reassembled the fragments, revealing vibrant yellow panel designs with motifs of birds, fruit, flowers, and lyres. The discovery also includes what appears to be the first known example of a painter's signature in Roman Britain, as well as ancient graffiti, enhancing our understanding of Roman domestic art and literacy.</p>

          <p>Singapore's Prime Minister Lawrence Wong is scheduled to visit China, marking his first trip since assuming office in May 2024.

Trade and economic cooperation are anticipated to dominate the agenda, with Beijing keen to reassure Singapore about the Chinese economy's stability.

          <h2>Study Challenges Theory on Why Birds Sing at Dawn</h2>
          <div class="timestamp">2025-06-20 05:00:00 EDT</div>
        </div>
        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>A new study challenges the long-held belief that birds sing at dawn because sound travels farther and more clearly at that time. Researchers from the Cornell Lab of Ornithology analyzed audio recordings of birds in an Indian rainforest and found little support for the "acoustic transmission hypothesis." The study suggests that the dawn chorus is more likely related to birds marking their territory after being inactive at night and communicating about finding food. The researchers examined recordings from 43 locations in the Western Ghats mountain range, focusing on 69 different bird species to compare vocal activity at dawn and dusk.</p>
