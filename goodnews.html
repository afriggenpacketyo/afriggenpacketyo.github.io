          <p>The deodorant brand Mitchum has issued an apology and recalled some of its 48-hour roll-on products following numerous customer complaints of skin irritation. Consumers reported experiencing itchy, burning armpits, with some describing severe reactions like "weeping spots" and redness. The company stated that a change in the manufacturing process for a raw material, not a formula change, caused the issue in batches sold in the UK, Ireland, and South Africa. Mitchum has since reverted to its original manufacturing process and is working to remove the affected products from stores while addressing customer concerns.</p>

          <p>China is advancing its "Air Silk Road" initiative, a component of the broader Belt and Road Initiative, to develop civil aviation capabilities in dozens of partner countries. A recent government report outlines plans to enhance air route connectivity and establish express air traffic corridors, primarily with nations in Central Asia, the Middle East, Africa, and Eastern Europe. This strategy is expected to create new markets for China's domestically produced aircraft, such as the Comac C919, while also strengthening trade relationships. The initiative represents a strategic effort to expand China's global economic and technological influence amid ongoing trade tensions.</p>

          <h2>Debit Card Usage Rises as Consumers, Especially Gen Z, Grow Wary of Credit Debt</h2>
          <div class="timestamp">2025-09-09 11:00:00 EDT</div>
        </div>
        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>American consumers are increasingly favoring debit cards over credit cards, a trend driven by a growing aversion to debt, particularly among younger generations like Gen Z. High interest rates and the memory of economic downturns have made many hesitant about credit card spending, which can feel less tangible and lead to compounding debt. In response, financial companies are marketing debit cards with new reward programs to attract these consumers. While credit cards once dominated transactions, debit usage has steadily climbed and now accounts for nearly half of all U.S. card payments, reflecting a cultural shift towards more direct budget management.</p>

          <p>The U.S. State Department has authorized funding for disaster relief in Pakistan, where catastrophic flooding has displaced over 1.3 million people and caused hundreds of deaths. This marks the first such assistance package approved under the second Trump administration, which has previously faced criticism for cutting foreign aid. The aid will provide food, shelter, and other lifesaving support to affected communities in coordination with the Pakistani government. A State Department official highlighted the rapid deployment of personnel and resources as an example of the administration's "America First" foreign assistance capabilities in action.</p>

          <p>The U.S. Drug Enforcement Administration (DEA) has announced that a weeklong series of coordinated operations resulted in the arrest of 617 individuals associated with the Sinaloa drug cartel. The actions, which took place in late August across 23 U.S. divisions and seven foreign regions, also led to significant seizures of fentanyl, methamphetamine, cocaine, and heroin. This enforcement effort is part of the Justice Department's increased focus on dismantling major drug cartels, which were designated as terrorist groups by a presidential executive order earlier this year. The DEA administrator affirmed the agency's commitment to dismantling the cartel's global network.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>A recent survey by Natixis Investment Managers indicates that American optimism about achieving a secure retirement is improving, with only 21% believing it will "take a miracle," down from 41% in 2021. This increased confidence is partly attributed to strong stock market performance over the past two years. However, significant worries persist, with 69% of respondents concerned about financial instability. The primary concerns include outliving their savings, potential cuts to Social Security benefits, and the erosive effect of high inflation on their retirement funds, highlighting a persistent gap between retirement goals and current savings.

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>With interest rates on certificates of deposit (CDs) currently high but a Federal Reserve rate cut likely, savers are considering how to best lock in returns. Financial experts weigh the choice between opening a single jumbo CD, which typically requires a $100,000 minimum deposit, and a CD ladder strategy using multiple smaller CDs. While jumbo CDs traditionally offer higher rates, the current market often sees shorter-term standard CDs matching or exceeding their yields. A CD ladder provides greater flexibility and liquidity as funds mature at different times, which is advantageous in a shifting rate environment. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>An experienced CEO who has interviewed over 500 candidates highlights three subtle yet critical red flags that job seekers should avoid. The first is tardiness, even by a minute, as it suggests poor planning and a lack of respect for time. The second is giving generic, theoretical answers instead of specific examples rooted in personal experience, which fails to demonstrate proven problem-solving skills. The final red flag is a lack of energy or enthusiasm, as a disengaged demeanor in an interview often predicts a similar performance on the job. The article advises candidates to be punctual, use concrete examples, and show genuine engagement.</p>

          <p>Several Premier League clubs are requesting more information regarding the legal settlement between the league and Manchester City over Associated Party Transaction (APT) rules. These regulations are designed to prevent clubs from inflating commercial deals with companies linked to their owners. While City has now accepted the rules as valid, ending its lawsuit, rival clubs report they have not been given details about the settlement's terms or potential concessions. Concerns have been raised that the agreement might make it easier for state-linked clubs to secure lucrative sponsorship deals, potentially impacting the league's competitive balance.</p>

Drew Feltwell said that after catching the ball and giving it to his 9-year-old son, a woman became loud and persistent, claiming the ball was hers. To avoid a larger conflict and teach his son a lesson in de-escalation, Feltwell chose to hand over the ball. The story had a positive outcome, as both the Marlins and Phillies organizations provided the boy with souvenirs, and he got to meet and receive a signed bat from the player who hit the home run, Harrison Bader.</p>

          <p>China has unveiled its new Type 100 tank, a smaller and lighter vehicle that represents a strategic shift towards information-centric and uncrewed combat systems. The tank features a diesel-electric hybrid engine for quieter operation and is equipped with an unmanned turret and advanced active protection systems instead of heavy armor. Its design emphasizes a high degree of "informationisation," allowing for superior situational awareness and networked coordination with other crewed and uncrewed platforms. According to state media, this new generation of combat vehicles is intended to revolutionize future land battles by integrating reconnaissance, communication, and firepower.</p>

          <p>The Thai government has lifted a long-standing ban, allowing approximately 80,000 long-term refugees from Myanmar to legally work in the country. This policy change comes after significant cuts in U.S. humanitarian aid led to the cancellation of food rations for many living in border camps, some for decades. The move is seen as a pragmatic solution to allow refugees to become self-sufficient and support their families, while also potentially filling labor shortages in Thailand. The UN Refugee Agency has praised the decision as a "turning point" and a potential regional benchmark for rights-based refugee solutions.</p>
