          <div class="timestamp">2025-06-10 05:11:56 EDT</div>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Rolls-Royce, the British aerospace group, has received government backing to build Britain's first small modular nuclear reactors (SMRs). The announcement follows a two-year selection process and aligns with Britain's commitment to nuclear power. The government also pledged ¬£14.2 billion to construct the Sizewell C power station in eastern England. Officials say the SMR plans could generate up to 3,000 jobs and power the equivalent of 3 million homes once connected to the grid in the mid-2030s. Rolls-Royce hailed the decision as a "very significant milestone" for the company.</p>

          <p>The Formula 1 calendar for 2026 will feature the Madrid Grand Prix, marking its debut as the second race in Spain, while the Imola race is dropped. Imola's removal reflects the pressure on the number of races and the desire for new locations. Zandvoort will also host its last race next year, and Spa will have a six-year contract hosting only four races. Thailand is seeking to host a grand prix in Bangkok, and F1 is keen to have a race in Africa, although securing a host venue remains challenging. The changes highlight the evolving landscape of Formula 1 racing locations.</p>

This move underscores Meta's commitment to remaining at the forefront of AI research and development. The company is investing heavily in AI to enhance its existing products and explore new applications. The focus on superintelligence suggests a long-term vision for AI's potential impact.</p>

The announcement follows changes in UK government regulations regarding driverless cars. The government now aims to introduce an accelerated framework for small autonomous commercial services earlier than previously planned. The trial's specifics are still being determined, but Uber intends to add robotaxis as a regular option via its UK app once legislation permits.</p>

          <p>German police authorities have declared that membership in the Alternative for Germany (AfD) party is incompatible with service in the police force. This decision reflects concerns about the AfD's political positions and their potential conflict with the values and principles of law enforcement. Meanwhile, Germany saw a record number of naturalized citizens in 2024, with Syrians comprising the largest share of new citizens. Changes to immigration law, allowing individuals to retain their nationality and lowering the required residency period, contributed to the increase.</p>

          <p>Bulgaria is poised to become the 21st member of the euro zone, having received approval from the European Commission and European Central Bank. Prime Minister Rosen Zhelyazkov prioritizes euro zone membership, arguing it would boost economic stability and growth. However, concerns about rising prices and loss of independence have fueled protests, with half of Bulgaria's population opposing the move. Experts weigh the potential risks and benefits, noting the potential for increased foreign investment and economic stability, while acknowledging fears of reduced monetary policy control.</p>

          <p>Authorities from multiple countries, including the UK's Financial Conduct Authority (FCA), are collaborating on an international crackdown targeting misleading financial promotions by social media influencers. The FCA has issued numerous warning alerts and cease and desist letters, leading to takedown requests on social media platforms and websites. The FCA has also made arrests and authorized criminal proceedings against individuals. The Treasury Committee has requested information from Meta, the owner of Facebook and Instagram, regarding its approach to financial influencers. The actions aim to protect social media users from unauthorized and potentially harmful financial advice.</p>

          <p>Japan plans to release another 200,000 tons of rice from government stockpiles through direct contracts with retailers, aiming to lower elevated prices of the staple food. The release will consist of rice from the 2020 and 2021 harvests, with the 2020 rice expected to be sold at 1,700 yen per 5 kilograms. The move will reduce the country's rice reserve to around 100,000 tons. The government suspects some wholesalers and farmers are hoarding rice in anticipation of price hikes. The ministry is focusing on smaller supermarkets and specialty shops to ensure the rice reaches consumers at lower prices.</p>

          <p>China's relations with Niger have been strained after the junta expelled three Chinese oil executives and revoked the license of a Chinese-owned hotel, citing "discriminatory practices and administrative violations." This comes after China provided the new military government with a US$400 million oil-backed loan. The dispute underscores the limits of Beijing's non-interference policy, which avoids entanglement in domestic affairs but can incur economic costs. Observers say Niger's actions highlight the challenges of maintaining a regime-agnostic approach amidst rising nationalism.</p>

          <p>Chinese exports to major industrial centers in Southeast Asia have risen significantly in the first five months of the year. Shipments to Vietnam, Thailand, and Indonesia increased by double-digit percentages compared to the same period in 2024. Analysts suggest that Chinese manufacturers are shipping more to factory sites in Southeast Asia to offset losses from high US tariffs. Some exports may be transshipped from China via Southeast Asia to avoid US tariffs, while others are injected with enough local content to be declared as made in Vietnam, Thailand, or Indonesia.</p>
