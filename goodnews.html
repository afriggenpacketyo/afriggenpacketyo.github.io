          <p>Germany's new coalition government, led by Chancellor Friedrich Merz, is cracking down on illegal immigration at its border with Austria, implementing stricter controls and turning back asylum-seekers who don't meet vulnerability criteria. Interior Minister Alexander Dobrindt emphasized the government's commitment to stopping criminal people smugglers and ensuring order, deploying additional police officers and advanced surveillance technology. This policy shift reflects a departure from former Chancellor Angela Merkel's open asylum policy and responds to the electoral successes of the far-right Alternative for Germany (AfD), although it has faced criticism from neighboring countries like Poland.</p>

          <p>A new genetic study has traced the migration of the first people to colonize the Americas from modern-day Russia between 20,000 and 30,000 years ago, revealing connections between languages, traditions, and genetic codes of Indigenous groups living in the Americas today. The study sequenced the genomes of 1,537 individuals from 139 ethnic groups in northern Eurasia and the Americas, finding that early settlers split into isolated groups, adapting to different environmental settings. These findings provide a deeper understanding of South American communities and underscore the importance of ancestral knowledge for people's identities.</p>

          <p>A rare dust storm swept through Chicago, blanketing the city and reducing visibility to near zero, prompting the National Weather Service to issue its first-ever dust storm warning for the city itself. The storm, caused by high winds blowing over dry farmlands, disrupted traffic, delayed flights, and created eerie conditions, with residents describing it as something out of the history books. While dust storm warnings are more common in rural areas, this event marked an unusual occurrence for the city.</p>

          <p>President Trump's tour of the Middle East has been marked by lavish displays of honor and respect, including standing ovations, investment pledges, and prestigious awards. In Saudi Arabia, he announced the lifting of sanctions on Syria, while in Qatar, he secured billions of dollars in investment, and in the United Arab Emirates, he received the country's highest civilian honor. The trip provided Trump with a series of economic and diplomatic wins, contrasting with the backlash he faces at home over tariff policies and immigration.</p>

          <p>As the United States and China reduce their presence in Africa, the United Arab Emirates is increasing its investment and influence across the continent. Emirati corporations are investing in key economic and strategic sectors, including ports, mines, and renewable energy projects, as part of a broader plan to diversify its economy and increase its global influence. While the UAE's actions have raised some concerns, such as its involvement in the Sudanese civil war, Washington considers the Emirates a reliable ally in the region.</p>
