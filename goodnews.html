          <p>South Western Railway (SWR) has been renationalized, marking the first train company to return to public ownership under Labour. The initial nationalized service departed from Woking to Surbiton on schedule, but the journey to London Waterloo involved a rail replacement bus due to engineering work. The government has emphasized plans to improve services and invest in infrastructure, while unions have voiced concerns about outsourcing staffing to private companies. Transport Secretary Heidi Alexander acknowledged that while she couldn't promise lower fares, she would ensure good value for money for customers, noting that taxpayers subsidize the trains by ¬£2 billion annually.</p>

          <p>American businesses are contending with unstable tariff rates, bond-market swings, and rising import costs amidst policy shifts from both the Biden and Trump administrations. The American economy has shown resilience, with corporate profits high, a low jobless rate, and new businesses blossoming. However, experts suggest this resilience may be waning, and the political instability of the country is causing unease. Despite these challenges, many firms benefited from the coronavirus crisis by disrupting markets and consumer behavior, aided by governmental support and robust private-credit markets.</p>

          <p>In a move seen as a message to President Trump and the world, Canada's Prime Minister Mark Carney has invited King Charles III to open the 45th Canadian Parliament. This decision is viewed as a strong affirmation of Canada's sovereignty and independence, particularly in light of Trump's undermining of Canada's identity. The invitation also serves to strengthen Canada's ties with Europe and highlight its unique traditions. While the majority of Canadians may be indifferent to the monarchy, the visit holds significant political weight.</p>
