          <div class="timestamp">2025-08-13 23:10:09 EDT</div>
        </div>
        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>A new Gallup poll indicates that the percentage of Americans who drink alcohol has fallen to a record low of 54%, a figure not seen since 1958. This decline is linked to increasing public awareness and concern about the health risks associated with alcohol, even in moderation. Young people, aged 18-34, show a particular inclination towards sobriety, with 66% believing moderate drinking is harmful. The shift also highlights gender differences in drinking habits and preferences, with women's alcohol use dropping significantly compared to men's.</p>

          <p>The NBA Board of Governors has unanimously approved the sale of the Boston Celtics to a group led by Bill Chisholm, valuing the franchise at a reported $6.1 billion. This marks the second-largest sale price for a US sports franchise. Chisholm's group will initially acquire at least 51% ownership, with plans to buy out remaining minority shareholders by 2028 at a $7.3 billion valuation. Chisholm, a Massachusetts native and private equity firm co-founder, will assume the role of the Celtics' governor.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>A Virginia Tech study shows that trained pet dogs can effectively detect the egg masses of the invasive spotted lanternfly, a destructive pest. These insects harm plants and promote mold growth, making their hard-to-find egg masses a critical target for eradication. Dogs, with their superior sense of smell, achieved over 80% accuracy in indoor tests and over 60% in outdoor settings, outperforming human searches. Researchers hope this method can be expanded to combat other invasive species, offering a fun and fulfilling activity for dog owners.</p>

          <p>Australia and Vanuatu have agreed to a ten-year, A$500 million ($328 million) security and economic deal, aimed at deepening ties between the Pacific neighbors. Dubbed the Nakamal agreement, it includes funding for data centers, climate change initiatives, and security enhancements. The pact reflects Australia's strategy to counter China's growing influence in the region. While visa-free travel for Vanuatu citizens was discussed, it remains part of a separate, unconfirmed subsidiary agreement. Both nations hailed the deal as a "win-win situation."</p>

          <p>Photos of rabbits in Colorado with black, horn-like growths have gone viral, sparking alarm and earning them nicknames like "zombie-rabbits." Colorado Parks and Wildlife confirmed the growths are caused by the relatively harmless Shope Papilloma Virus, spread by fleas and ticks, primarily in the Midwest. The papillomas are generally not painful unless they impede essential functions like eating or seeing. This natural phenomenon is believed to have inspired the mythical "jackalope" and has contributed to scientific understanding of virus-cancer links.</p>

          <p>Juneau, Alaska's capital, faced record-setting floodwaters from a glacial outburst flood stemming from the Mendenhall Glacier's Suicide Basin. The Mendenhall River peaked at an unprecedented 16.65 feet, surpassing last year's record, before waters began to recede. City officials reported minimal flooding and avoided a catastrophic event, crediting temporary Hesko barriers. This annual phenomenon, caused by a retreating glacier, has repeatedly damaged homes, prompting long-term solution studies. The immediate threat has ended, and evacuated areas have reopened, with damage assessment underway.</p>

          <p>A new survey indicates that over half of business travelers, and up to 73% of C-suite executives, are now bringing family members or friends along on work trips. This trend, known as "bleisure" travel, allows professionals to reclaim family time and save costs by leveraging company-covered travel expenses. While generally accepted, many employees prefer not to broadcast these plans to avoid appearing unprofessional. Companies are increasingly open to the practice, provided business objectives are met and expenses are clearly separated, boosting morale and loyalty.</p>

          <p>Conspiracy theorist Alex Jones is on the verge of losing his Infowars studio and brand as a Texas judge ordered the company's assets turned over to a receiver. The move aims to facilitate payment to Sandy Hook families, who won a $1.3 billion defamation case against Jones for spreading false conspiracies about the 2012 shooting. The receiver is authorized to seize property and control websites, potentially ending Jones's Infowars run. Legal experts believe a sale to the satirical site The Onion, which previously vowed to parody Infowars, is now more likely.</p>

          <p>A study published in the British Medical Journal suggests that drug treatment for newly diagnosed ADHD can significantly reduce the risk of substance misuse, suicidal behavior, transport accidents, and criminality. These broader benefits are attributed to medication's ability to manage impulsive behavior and concentration difficulties. The research, based on 148,500 people in Sweden, confirms the positive impact of drugs like methylphenidate, offering crucial evidence for patients considering medication. It highlights the importance of diagnosis and treatment to prevent negative life outcomes associated with ADHD.</p>
