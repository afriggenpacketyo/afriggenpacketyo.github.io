          <p>Police in Scotland have confirmed they are making preparations for a potential visit by U.S. President Donald Trump to his Aberdeenshire golf resort later this month. The visit is expected for the opening of a new course, though it will not include a private meeting with King Charles. This would be Trump's first visit to Scotland since his election, with his 2018 presidential trip prompting major security operations and widespread protests. Critics have raised concerns about the potential policing costs, while the Scottish government stated it is coordinating with UK authorities to support the operation.</p>

          <p>The third Test between England and India at Lord's is highly anticipated, highlighted by the return of England's fast bowler Jofra Archer after a four-year absence due to injury. Archer's comeback adds a significant boost to an England attack that struggled in the previous match. India will also be strengthened by the return of their star pace bowler, Jasprit Bumrah, who was rested for the second Test. With the series poised at 1-1, the match features a compelling showdown between two of cricket's most exciting fast bowlers at one of the sport's most iconic venues.</p>

          <p>With federal student loan payments resuming and a new law set to overhaul repayment programs, borrowers are facing a new financial landscape. This article outlines five strategies to make payments more affordable before stricter rules take effect. Recommendations include enrolling in an income-driven repayment (IDR) plan to cap monthly bills, requesting temporary deferment or forbearance for short-term hardship, and setting up autopay for an interest rate discount. It also suggests exploring employer or state-based repayment assistance programs and cautiously considering refinancing private loans to secure a lower interest rate, while weighing the loss of federal protections.</p>

          <p>The U.S. Department of Homeland Security has corrected previously released data, now showing that international student enrollment in the U.S. actually increased last year, rather than declined. An analysis flagged that the agency's initial report undercounted students by over 200,000. The revised figures indicate a 6.5% year-over-year growth, aligning with other data sources that found the U.S. hosted a record number of students from abroad in the 2023-24 academic year. The correction provides a more accurate picture of robust growth at a time when international student trends are under close scrutiny.</p>

          <p>McDonald's is bringing back its popular Snack Wrap and introducing a limited-time Spicy Egg McMuffin as part of a strategy to boost sales amid a slowdown from inflation-weary customers.

The menu refresh, which also includes an emphasis on its McValue deals, aims to regain customer trust and stay competitive. The return of the Snack Wrap, a fan-favorite discontinued in 2016, is a strategic move to leverage nostalgia and existing customer demand.</p>

          <p>Nvidia's stock continued its remarkable surge, pushing the company's market capitalization past $4 trillion for the first time and making it the most valuable public company in the world. The chipmaker has become the undisputed leader in producing the specialized graphics processing units (GPUs) essential for the generative AI boom. This massive demand has caused Nvidia's shares to skyrocket, with the company reaching the $2 trillion mark in February 2024 and surpassing $3 trillion just last month.
