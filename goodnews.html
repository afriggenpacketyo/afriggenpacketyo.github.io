          <p>Japan, a skateboarding powerhouse, supports the new Olympic age limit of 14 and older, despite its potential impact on medal prospects. World Skate's decision aims to reduce severe injuries among young skateboarders attempting increasingly difficult tricks. Japan's street skateboarding head coach, Daisuke Hayakawa, endorsed the restriction, citing concerns about physical immaturity and skill development. While Japan will adhere to the Olympic age limit, domestic competitions may remain open to younger participants, focusing on nurturing talent and promoting the culture of skateboarding.</p>

The new system includes 24 tailored programs based on age, characteristics, and other factors, such as a Daily Care-Senior curriculum and Addiction Recovery, with inmates sent to prisons offering appropriate programs and reviewed every six months.</p>

          <p>Blue Origin successfully launched six passengers on a sub-orbital trip to the edge of space. The international crew experienced a few minutes of weightlessness and panoramic views before returning to Earth. This marks Blue Origin's twelfth New Shepard passenger flight, bringing the total number of passengers launched to 68. The company's reusable New Shepard booster returned to a landing pad near the launch site. This flight continues Blue Origin's efforts to democratize space travel.</p>

          <p>Wayfarers Chapel, a historic landmark in Rancho Palos Verdes, is seeking a new location after landslides forced its closure. The chapel is hoping to relocate to a site next to Rancho Palos Verdes City Hall on the old Battery Barnes military site. The new site would include a visitor's center, a museum, a cafe, and gardens, while still offering ocean views. The chapel's original site was battered by landslides, making rebuilding in the same location impossible.</p>
