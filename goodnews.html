The company will also sell a "T1" smartphone, featuring a gold-colored metal case etched with an American flag, though further specifications are currently unavailable.

          <p>As energy standards began to eat into machines‚Äô functionality and were drafted into the cause of limiting climate change, Americans‚Äô thinking about energy efficiency jumped to a different, more political plane. The Trump administration is rescinding dozens of energy-efficiency rules, while the Biden administration justified its push for energy efficiency in part to save energy and in part to save money. The appliance industry relies on the federal government to help streamline expectations, and surveys indicate that about 90 percent of American households recognize the Energy Star label. Eliminating those standards would result in electrical bills nearly five times the cost of the savings, according to an analysis by the Appliance Standards Awareness Project.</p>

The agreement includes a golden share for the U.S. government, granting the president veto power over decisions to relocate U.S. Steel's headquarters, move the company outside the U.S., rename U.S. Steel, transfer production or jobs abroad, and close or idle plants before certain time frames. The company will become a wholly owned subsidiary of Nippon Steel North America, and all regulatory approvals required for the transaction have been received.

Both sides expressed positive sentiments regarding the talks, which addressed rare earths, Chinese student visas, and US exports of jet engine parts to China, with Trump describing it as ‚Äúa great deal.‚Äù This progress may allow for discussions on other key bilateral and multilateral issues and the resumption of important dialogue mechanisms.</p>

While not aggressive, the ant's potent bite can cause anaphylaxis, prompting increased public awareness efforts. These small, shiny, black ants often colonize undisturbed forest areas, nesting under logs and debris, but can also be found near homes and businesses. Entomologists encourage people with a history of anaphylaxis after insect bites to seek identification of suspected Asian needle ants and to take precautions like wearing gloves and cleaning up woody debris.</p>

The "talking stage," a type of situationship without clear boundaries or commitment, dominates Gen Z's dating woes, often leading to ambiguous taperings off instead of clear breakups. Despite the challenges, young people still yearn for romantic connection, with a Hinge survey finding that 90 percent of Gen Z daters hope to find love.

          <p>The trial of Gjert Ingebrigtsen, father of Olympic champion Jakob Ingebrigtsen, has ended with Gjert found innocent of abusing his son but guilty of violence against his daughter, raising questions about parenting in elite sports. Dr. Bettina Rulofs, a professor for Diversity Studies in Sport, emphasizes the high prevalence of psychological violence in sports and the importance of autonomy for children in high-performance environments. She suggests that parents should prioritize creating a situation where children can make their own decisions and develop an autonomy-based approach in realizing their own wishes and in developing their own competencies. The Safe Clubs project offers training and education to adults in sports clubs, including an educational tool for parents.</p>

Poorer countries are wary of committing to ambitious goals on monetary grounds, and action from the biggest states will make the most difference.

          <p>Scientists in Hawaii are using drones to release live mosquitoes in remote forests as a clever solution to the extinction crisis facing the state's avian species. The drones drop biodegradable containers filled with male mosquitoes containing a strain of bacteria called wolbachia that interferes with reproduction, causing the eggs of mated females to fail to hatch. This approach aims to erode the population of biting mosquitoes, suppressing the spread of avian malaria, a mosquito-borne disease devastating Hawaii's iconic forest birds. The project has released over 40 million male mosquitoes across Maui and Kauai, with drones offering a safer and more efficient alternative to helicopters.</p>

          <p>Some conservative women are challenging traditional views by arguing that women can successfully combine motherhood with a career. This stance contrasts with historical arguments from some on the right that women should prioritize family over paid work. These women express frustration with those encouraging full-time devotion to housekeeping and child-rearing, advocating for policies like federal parental leave and remote work. They emphasize the importance of financial independence and modeling a balanced life for their daughters, acknowledging the trade-offs but highlighting the fulfillment and value children bring.</p>

          <h2>Red Sox Trade Rafael Devers to Giants in Blockbuster Deal</h2>

          <p>The Boston Red Sox traded All-Star slugger Rafael Devers to the San Francisco Giants in a deal that could impact pennant races on both coasts. Devers had grown disgruntled with his demotion from third base, leading to the trade. In exchange, the Red Sox received Jordan Hicks, Kyle Harrison, James Tibbs III, and Jose Bello from San Francisco. The Giants hope Devers' bat will significantly improve their lineup, while the Red Sox aim to address other needs with their newly acquired players. The move is reminiscent of past Red Sox trades involving star players.</p>

          <h2>Car Prices Remain Stable Despite Tariffs, Prompting Potential Buying Opportunity</h2>

          <p>Despite the implementation of auto tariffs by President Donald Trump in April, American car prices have remained relatively stable. Experts attribute this to factors like tariff fears reducing demand, dealers working through pre-tariff car supplies, and automakers absorbing some costs to avoid angering the Trump administration. However, experts anticipate that prices may increase later this year as tariffed vehicles hit the lots, potentially making now a favorable time for consumers to purchase a car. Automakers are expected to raise the MSRP on 2026 models to account for the tariffs. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>The leaders of the Group of Seven democracies are meeting in Canada to address global challenges, including restoring stability in the Middle East and Asia. The discussions aim to overcome divisions stemming from U.S. President Donald Trump's unilateralism. The conflict between Israel and Iran is expected to dominate the agenda, with leaders urged to de-escalate the situation. Stability in the Indo-Pacific region will also be a key topic, with leaders expected to reiterate their opposition to unilateral changes in the East and South China seas.</p>
