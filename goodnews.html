          <p>Chinese court astronomers in 1408 documented detailed observations of a nova, a dying star's explosion, near the Milky Way. The astronomers described the star's size, color, and brightness in a formal report to Emperor Yongle, interpreting it as a positive omen. This rediscovery settles a debate among modern astronomers, confirming the event as a nova rather than a comet or meteor. The detailed records, including the star's size and brightness, have allowed researchers to narrow down the star's possible position. </p>

This decline follows a public falling out between Musk and President Trump, sparked by disagreements over spending bills. Despite the dip in favorability, Musk remains popular among Republicans after his time running the Department of Government Efficiency (DOGE), an effort to dramatically reduce the size of the federal government. </p>

The 86-million-year-old skeletons represent the closest known ancestor of all tyrannosaurs, including the iconic T.rex. This discovery provides insight into how tyrannosaurs evolved from smaller hunters to formidable giants. The new species also exhibits early evolutionary stages of key features, such as skull anatomy that gave it a strong jaw, crucial for the tyrannosaurs' dominance as predators. </p>
