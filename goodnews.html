          <p>Donald Trump indicated he is open to meeting with North Korean leader Kim Jong-un during his Asia tour, which includes stops in Malaysia, Japan, and South Korea. Trump is scheduled to meet with Xi Jinping to discuss trade, Taiwan, and Russia. Officials have downplayed the possibility of a Trump-Kim meeting, despite South Korea's reunification minister suggesting a considerable chance. Trump's Asia trip also includes signing a trade deal with Malaysia and overseeing a peace accord between Thailand and Cambodia, with global markets watching for progress on the trade war with China. The trip will also include a meeting with Japan's first female prime minister. Optimism for diplomatic progress remains tentative. </p>

          <p>The Toronto Blue Jays defeated the Los Angeles Dodgers 11-4 in Game 1 of the World Series, fueled by Addison Barger's grand slam, the first by a pinch-hitter in World Series history. The Blue Jays scored nine runs in the sixth inning, overcoming an early lead by the Dodgers. Shohei Ohtani hit a two-run home run for the Dodgers, but it was not enough to close the gap. The game marked the first World Series game in Canada since 1993, with Toronto fans chanting "We don't need him!" at Ohtani. The Blue Jays took an early lead in the series. </p>

          <p>The ASEAN summit in Kuala Lumpur, hosted by Malaysia, will address key regional issues, including Thailand-Cambodia border tensions and the civil war in Myanmar. US President Donald Trump is expected to oversee the signing of a peace accord between Thailand and Cambodia. Diplomatic efforts to resolve the conflict in Myanmar have been ineffective, with discussions expected on sending observers to monitor the December elections. The summit will also welcome Timor-Leste as ASEAN's 11th full member. Despite challenges, Malaysia hopes to facilitate progress on regional peace and stability.</p>

          <p>The Toronto Blue Jays emerged victorious against the Los Angeles Dodgers with an 11-4 score in Game 1 of the World Series, played at the Rogers Centre. The Dodgers initially took a 2-0 lead, but Toronto surged ahead in the fourth and dominated with a nine-run sixth inning, including Addison Barger's historic grand slam. Dodgers' Shohei Ohtani marked his World Series debut with a home run, yet it was insufficient to bridge the gap. Blue Jays fans expressed their feelings towards Ohtani, who had previously been courted by the team, chanting, "We don't need him!" The Dodgers aim to even the series in the next game. </p>

          <p>House Minority Leader Hakeem Jeffries endorsed Zohran Mamdani in the New York City mayoral race, just before early voting began. Jeffries cited Mamdani's focus on addressing the affordability crisis and his commitment to being a mayor for all New Yorkers. The endorsement is a significant boost for Mamdani, a Democratic socialist. Republicans are expected to use Jeffries' endorsement in future campaign material. Mamdani's opponent, former Gov. Andrew Cuomo, received an endorsement from outgoing Mayor Eric Adams. The Knicks sent Mamdani's campaign a cease-and-desist letter over an ad using the team's logo.</p>
