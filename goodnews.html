          <p>While digging trenches in Lima, Peru, utility workers discovered a well-preserved, 1,000-year-old mummy with its dark brown hair still intact. Archaeologists believe the remains belong to a woman from the Chancay culture, which predates the Inca Empire by several hundred years. The mummy was found just 20 inches below the ground in a city that contains around 400 archaeological sites. Experts note that such discoveries are common on the Peruvian coast, where the dry desert climate naturally mummifies remains.</p>

          <p>Former heavyweight world champion Deontay Wilder made a successful return to boxing with a seventh-round stoppage victory over Tyrrell Herndon in Kansas. This was Wilder's first win since October 2022, following three losses in his previous four fights. The 39-year-old fighter, known as the "Bronze Bomber," showcased a more measured approach, using his jab effectively before securing the win. While the performance was dominant, it was a low-key event compared to his past high-profile bouts, signaling a new, more deliberate phase of his career.</p>

          <p>A new report highlights the significant spending power of Generation Alpha, who are accustomed to instant gratification through services like Amazon Prime and Uber Eats. The analysis indicates this generation, born between 2010 and 2024, spent millions on services like food delivery, with their economic influence projected to reach trillions by 2029. To counter this, financial experts suggest parents teach tangible money skills, such as using physical cash and visual budgeting exercises. This approach aims to instill an understanding that money must be earned before it is spent (not investment advice).</p>

For Paul, a victory over a former world champion would add legitimacy to his boxing career, which has been criticized for facing weaker opponents.

          <p>According to a top economist at China International Capital Corporation, China's established third-party payment platforms like WeChat and Alipay provide a significant comparative advantage in the global race to develop stablecoins. Chief economist Peng Wensheng argues that this platform-based digital money already functions similarly to stablecoins, as it is an extension of legal tender pegged 1:1 with fiat currency. The existing systems are supported by a mature regulatory framework where customer funds are backed by central bank money, ensuring stability and providing a strong foundation for future digital currency initiatives (not investment advice).</p>

The research assessed the benefits of a diet rich in rice, miso soup, soy products, fish, seaweed, and green tea. The study was the first of its kind to specifically link this dietary pattern to mental health outcomes.

          <p>A research team from China's Nankai University has successfully completed the world's first human trial of a brain-computer interface (BCI) implanted through blood vessels. This minimally invasive technique avoids the need for open-skull surgery, as used by technologies like Elon Musk's Neuralink, thereby reducing risk and recovery time. The procedure involved inserting a stent electrode into a patient's intracranial vasculature via a neck vein. The trial successfully helped a paralyzed patient regain some limb movement, marking a significant advancement in neurotechnology.</p>
