          <p>Harvard University's graduation day saw a blend of pride and protest, reflecting the ongoing conflict between the university and the Trump administration. Signs of the university‚Äôs fight with the Trump administration took many forms. The Trump administration has already frozen more than $3 billion in federal funding to Harvard and plans to cancel remaining federal contracts worth an estimated $100 million. The president has also expressed interest in revoking the university's tax-exempt status.</p>

          <p>For those who have yet to file their 2024 tax return, it's crucial to address key questions to mitigate potential penalties and interest from the IRS. Key considerations include whether an extension was filed, the amount owed, and the availability of necessary documents like W-2s and 1099s. The IRS offers options such as payment plans and hardship programs for those unable to pay immediately, and it's advisable to seek professional help if unsure about navigating the complexities of late filings. Acting promptly is essential to minimize the risk of enforcement actions like wage garnishment. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>Stocks experienced a modest rise but fell short of earlier highs due to uncertainty surrounding President Trump's tariff policies and concerns about investment banking activity. A court ruling against Trump's "reciprocal" tariffs initially boosted the market, but gains were short-lived as the administration plans to appeal to the Supreme Court. Goldman Sachs' President John Waldron noted a slowdown in investment banking activity in the second quarter due to market volatility. Bristol Myers Squibb's CEO addressed investor concerns about the company's schizophrenia drug, Cobenfy, after a failed trial. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>The Supreme Court has placed new limits on federally mandated environmental impact statements for major transportation and energy projects, potentially expediting approvals for similar construction programs nationwide. The decision in Seven County Infrastructure Coalition v. Eagle County, Colorado, focused on the purpose of the National Environmental Policy Act of 1969 (NEPA). Justice Kavanaugh said the law imposed merely a "modest procedural requirement," related only to the project at hand, not a mandatory study of possible upstream or downstream impacts far afield from actual construction. The ruling is expected to reduce costly delays in project completion.</p>
