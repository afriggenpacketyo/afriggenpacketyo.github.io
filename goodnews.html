        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Warner Bros. Discovery is splitting into two companies, one focused on streaming and studios, and the other on global networks including TNT Sports, which raises questions about the future of TNT's live sports rights. CEO David Zaslav indicated that the Global Networks division will decide how to monetize TNT Sports' streaming and digital rights, which could involve licensing deals or a merger with another entity. The current agreement sees TNT Sports content on HBO Max, but Zaslav suggested that sports haven't been a major driver for HBO Max sign-ups in the U.S., so the company will evaluate its options. The separation is expected to be completed by mid-2026, giving the Global Networks team ample time to consider various strategies.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>A federal judge has dismissed Justin Baldoni's $400 million defamation lawsuit against Blake Lively, Ryan Reynolds, and The New York Times. Baldoni, who directed and co-starred in the movie *It Ends With Us* with Lively, filed the suit after Lively alleged sexual harassment during the film's production, which coincided with a New York Times article detailing Baldoni's public relations efforts. Judge Lewis J. Liman ruled that Baldoni failed to demonstrate actual malice in Lively's allegations and that the Times reported on the available evidence, though possibly in a dramatized manner. Lively's lawyers hailed the decision as a complete vindication, calling Baldoni's lawsuit a sham.</p>
