          <p>Former heavyweight champion Deontay Wilder made a successful, albeit modest, return to boxing by defeating Tyrrell Herndon in a seventh-round stoppage. The victory marks his first win since 2022, following a series of high-profile losses that cast doubt on his career. Wilder stated he is focused on becoming a more complete fighter and has been working with a sports psychologist to repair himself emotionally. While the win puts him back on track, his path to another title shot remains distant in a competitive heavyweight division.</p>

          <p>A top economist from China International Capital Corporation argues that China's established third-party payment systems, like WeChat and Alipay, provide a significant edge in the global race to develop stablecoins. According to Peng Wensheng, these platforms already function similarly to stablecoins and are backed by a mature regulatory framework. He notes their stability is ensured by strict safeguards, including backing by central bank money. This perspective suggests China could leverage its existing digital payment infrastructure to lead in the evolving landscape of digital currency. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>A recent study has found a correlation between consuming a traditional Japanese-style diet and lower rates of depressive symptoms among working-age individuals. The research, conducted by the Japan Institute for Health Security, assessed diets rich in rice, miso soup, fish, soy products, and seaweed. A modified version including fruit and dairy also showed benefits. This is the first study of its kind to specifically link the traditional Japanese dietary pattern to mental health outcomes, suggesting nutritional choices can play a role in combating depression.</p>

This minimally invasive technique was used to help a paralyzed patient regain some limb movement, offering a potentially safer alternative to methods like Elon Musk's Neuralink. The procedure involves inserting a stent electrode into the brain's vascular network via a vein in the neck. The successful trial marks a significant advancement in neurotechnology with the potential to reduce surgical risks and recovery times.</p>
