          <h2>GoPro and Krispy Kreme Become Latest Targets in Meme Stock Trading Frenzy</h2>
          <div class="timestamp">2025-07-23 13:45:17 EDT</div>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Retail traders, largely coordinating on Reddit's WallStreetBets forum, have shifted their focus to new companies, causing significant stock volatility. Wearable camera maker GoPro and doughnut chain Krispy Kreme saw their shares surge as they became the latest targets of the meme stock phenomenon. Both companies are characterized by low stock prices and notable short interest, attracting traders employing high-risk "YOLO" strategies. This speculative activity coincides with a broader market rally, with some analysts attributing the trend to a removal of economic downside risks and hopes for Federal Reserve rate cuts.

          <div class="timestamp">2025-07-23 13:41:26 EDT</div>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Hasbro reported second-quarter financial results that surpassed Wall Street's expectations, despite a significant decline in its traditional toy business. The company's strength came from its Wizards of the Coast and digital gaming division, with popular titles like Magic: The Gathering and Monopoly Go! driving a 16% revenue increase in that segment. This performance helped offset a 16% drop in the consumer products segment, which has been negatively affected by retailer order timing and the impact of tariffs. Despite an overall net loss attributed to a goodwill impairment, Hasbro raised its full-year guidance, signaling confidence in its gaming-focused strategy. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>Stevie Nicks and Lindsey Buckingham have announced the first official reissue of their 1973 pre-Fleetwood Mac album, "Buckingham Nicks." The record, which was a commercial failure upon its initial release, has been out of print for decades and will now be available on all formats, including digital and a remastered vinyl edition. The announcement followed cryptic social media posts from the duo, sparking speculation about a reunion. The new release, sourced from the original analog master tapes, will include fresh liner notes with recent interviews, finally making the fabled album widely accessible to fans after years of anticipation.</p>

          <p>Italian cyclist Jonathan Milan won his second stage of this year's Tour de France, emerging victorious in a chaotic sprint finish on stage 17. The final kilometers were marked by heavy rain and a crash that took several of Milan's key rivals out of contention. The Lidl-Trek rider demonstrated his strength to beat Jordi Meeus, further solidifying his lead in the points classification for the green jersey. Meanwhile, overall race leader Tadej Pogacar finished safely within the main peloton, maintaining his significant advantage in the general classification as the tour heads into its final, more challenging stages.</p>

          <p>In a landmark advisory opinion, the International Court of Justice (ICJ) has ruled that countries can be held legally responsible for their role in climate change, opening the door for legal action over climate-related damages. The ruling, which is non-binding but carries significant legal weight, is a major victory for climate-vulnerable nations, particularly the Pacific island states that initiated the case. The court stated that countries have obligations under international law to protect the environment from greenhouse gas emissions and that failure to do so could lead to claims for compensation. This decision could significantly influence future climate litigation worldwide.</p>

          <p>The Trump administration's new AI Action Plan outlines a strategy to maintain U.S. dominance in the field through several key initiatives. The plan prioritizes accelerating the construction of data centers, modernizing semiconductor fabrication plants, and updating the nation's electrical grid to support AI's energy demands. Another major focus is on combating perceived ideological bias in AI, with proposals to update federal procurement guidelines to favor developers who allow for free speech. The strategy also aims to keep advanced technology from competitors like China and includes removing diversity, equity, and inclusion requirements from the CHIPS Act to speed up projects.</p>

          <p>In Los Angeles, many pet owners treat their dogs as children, leading to a culture of extravagant care and services. This article highlights several examples, from dogs that fly frequently and dine on crab legs to those enrolled in members-only social clubs with monthly fees. Owners describe their companions as "babies," providing them with everything from custom meals and extensive wardrobes to private training "preschools." This trend reflects a broader societal shift in how pets are viewed, with some owners even making major life decisions, like moving to a new home, solely for their aging dog's comfort.</p>

          <p>President Donald Trump has announced a significant trade deal with Japan, which he described as possibly the "largest Deal ever made." Under the new agreement, the tariff rate on Japanese imports, including automobiles, will be set at 15%, a reduction from a previously threatened 25%. In return, Japan has reportedly agreed to open its markets to U.S. goods like trucks and agricultural products and to invest $550 billion in the United States. The announcement was met with relief and positive market reactions in Japan, with major auto stocks like Toyota and Honda soaring on the news.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Researchers have successfully used gene editing to make mosquitoes highly resistant to spreading malaria, a breakthrough that could significantly impact the global fight against the disease. By altering a single amino acid in the mosquito's genome, scientists were able to largely prevent the malaria parasite from completing its journey to the insect's salivary glands. The study also demonstrated that this genetic trait can be rapidly spread through a laboratory population using a gene drive. While the technology is still years from field use and faces controversy over potential ecological impacts, it represents a promising new strategy for curbing malaria.</p>

          <p>The recently announced trade agreement between the U.S. and Japan sets a new 15% tariff on Japanese products, avoiding a threatened 25% rate that was set to take effect.

In exchange for this softened tariff stance, Japan has agreed to increase imports of certain U.S. agricultural goods and trucks, and President Trump stated the country would also make a $550 billion investment in the U.S. This accord is one of several the White House has pursued as part of a broader strategy to renegotiate trade relationships globally.
