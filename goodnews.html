          <p>With Halloween costume prices increasing by 11% this year, one Texas man, Christophe Waggoner, is using his skills to help families in need. For nine years, he has been sourcing materials from thrift stores to create and donate unique costumes, ensuring children can celebrate regardless of their financial situation. Waggoner spends over $5,000 of his own money annually on this project, driven by the belief that every child deserves to experience the joy of Halloween and that acts of kindness inspire others to pay it forward.</p>

          <p>A significant historical document, Margaret Thatcher's signed nomination paper for the 1975 Conservative Party leadership election, has been discovered in a garage in Somerset, UK. The letter, which belonged to former Conservative MP Sir Edward du Cann, marks the beginning of Thatcher's ascent to becoming party leader and eventually Prime Minister. The document is part of a larger collection of political papers from the era that will be auctioned, with experts predicting it could fetch up to £100,000 due to its historical importance.</p>

        </div>
        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Amidst significant market volatility, Invesco senior portfolio manager John Burrello recommends that risk-averse investors consider income funds utilizing options-based strategies. He argues that these funds offer more structural protection and provide income that is not sensitive to interest rate changes, which is increasingly important as the Federal Reserve is expected to cut rates. Burrello highlights funds like the Invesco QQQ Income Advantage ETF, noting that the demand for income and defense against equity drawdowns gives these strategies a long-term tailwind. He advises investors to seek out ETFs managed by institutional professionals and to be wary of unsustainable yields. (not investment advice)</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Contrary to the common stereotype that women are more eager to commit, a new study from DatingNews.com and the Kinsey Institute indicates that men are more likely to want to speed up relationship milestones. The research, which surveyed 2,000 U.S. singles, found 28.6% of men would move in with a partner sooner and 18.8% would marry sooner, compared to 18.8% and 13.7% of women, respectively. Experts suggest that beyond financial motivations, men often rely more heavily on romantic relationships for their primary social and emotional support, leading to lower well-being when single.</p>

          <p>A United Airlines aircraft clipped the tail of another stationary United plane while taxiing to its gate at Chicago's O'Hare International Airport. No injuries were reported among the 113 passengers on the arriving flight from Jackson Hole, Wyoming, who were able to deplane normally after a delay. The incident involved the wing of the moving plane striking the horizontal stabilizer of the other aircraft. This event adds to recent concerns about aviation safety following several other ground collisions and near misses at U.S. airports.</p>

          <p>Repair work has commenced to restore the main external power supply to the Zaporizhzhia nuclear power plant in Ukraine, according to the UN's International Atomic Energy Agency (IAEA). For the past four weeks, Europe's largest nuclear facility has relied on backup diesel generators after its last power line was severed, creating a precarious safety situation. The IAEA stated that both Russian and Ukrainian forces engaged constructively to establish ceasefire zones, allowing the complex repairs to proceed. The plant requires a reliable power source to cool its reactors and prevent a potential nuclear incident.</p>

While users report a significant increase in recruiter engagement after updating their photos, the trend raises questions about authenticity. Career experts warn that poorly done AI headshots can appear inauthentic and harm a candidate's chances, even as the technology makes it harder to distinguish between real and generated images.</p>

Founded by Desmond Carter, the group addresses the specific pressures Black men face, from systemic racism to societal expectations of toughness, which contribute to rising suicide rates in this demographic. Psychologists note that Black men are less likely to seek professional help and often receive culturally incompetent care when they do. This community initiative provides a gateway for men to prioritize their well-being and break generational cycles of emotional suppression.</p>

          <p>Psychologist Jean Twenge advises parents to delay giving children smartphones and social media access for as long as possible, ideally until age 16, to promote better mental health outcomes. She recommends two key strategies: starting conversations about responsible technology use by late elementary school and setting firm, clear rules once devices are introduced. These rules should include no phones in bedrooms overnight or during the school day, using parental controls to limit usage, and starting with a basic, non-internet-connected phone. This proactive approach helps prepare children for a healthier relationship with technology.</p>

          <p>In a detailed explanation of his investment strategy, Warren Buffett categorizes assets into three types: currency-denominated, non-productive, and productive. He expresses skepticism towards the first two, particularly gold, which he describes as a non-productive asset whose value depends solely on the hope that someone else will pay more for it in the future. Buffett famously illustrates this by noting that all the world's gold would fit into a small cube that "isn't going to do anything." Instead, he advocates for investing in the third category—productive assets like farms and businesses—which generate value and deliver tangible returns over time. (not investment advice)</p>
