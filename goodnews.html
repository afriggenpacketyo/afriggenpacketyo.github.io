          <p>China has introduced a new K visa program designed to attract young foreign graduates in science, technology, engineering, and mathematics (STEM) by offering streamlined entry and employment opportunities. However, the initiative is facing criticism within China due to concerns about increased competition in a struggling domestic job market and broader immigration fears. The program aims to present China as open to early-career professionals, but policy analysts suggest that Beijing needs to provide greater transparency and stricter oversight to address the public's unease. Details about eligibility criteria are still forthcoming from Chinese diplomatic missions.</p>

          <h2>Experts Analyze Potential Impact of October Fed Rate Cut on Mortgage Rates</h2>
          <div class="timestamp">2025-09-30 09:57:29 EDT</div>
        </div>
        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>While the Federal Reserve is widely expected to cut interest rates again in October, experts suggest the impact on mortgage rates may be less significant than borrowers hope. Markets have likely already priced in the anticipated quarter-point reduction, meaning mortgage rates may not see a substantial drop following the official announcement. Mortgage rates are more directly influenced by Treasury yields, which can fluctuate based on broader economic data like inflation reports released before the Fed's meeting. Homeowners with high-interest loans from recent years are still encouraged to explore refinancing options as rates remain at three-year lows. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>Milorad Dodik, the long-serving leader of Republika Srpska, has withdrawn from all official roles after a prolonged conflict with Bosnia's state judiciary. A Bosnian federal court had sentenced him to prison and barred him from politics for six years for defying the authority of the international High Representative. After initially resisting, Dodik has now capitulated, paving the way for an early presidential election in November. His departure marks a significant political shift in the Serb-majority entity of Bosnia and Herzegovina, potentially leading to the fragmentation of his SNSD party and the end of his three-decade political career.</p>

          <p>A Chinese national, Zhimin Qian, has pleaded guilty in a UK court to illegally acquiring and possessing cryptocurrency linked to a massive international fraud scheme. The conviction follows a seven-year investigation that led to the seizure of 61,000 bitcoin, currently valued at over £5 billion, believed to be the world's largest crypto seizure. Between 2014 and 2017, Qian orchestrated a scam in China that defrauded over 128,000 victims before she fled to the UK. Her associate, Jian Wen, was previously jailed for laundering the proceeds by purchasing multi-million pound properties.</p>

          <p>Boston Federal Reserve President Susan Collins voiced support for the central bank's recent interest rate cut but signaled a cautious approach toward future reductions. Citing ongoing risks from inflation and a potentially softening labor market, she stated that a "modestly restrictive" policy remains appropriate to ensure price stability. While acknowledging that further easing may be necessary this year, she emphasized that any decision would be data-dependent. Her comments reflect the uncertainty facing policymakers, which is compounded by the looming government shutdown that threatens to halt the release of critical economic data.

She aims to build a coalition focused on economic issues, such as raising the minimum wage, expanding Medicaid, and improving education, which she argues have been neglected during two decades of Republican control.

This infusion of capital comes a year after the company filed for an IPO, buying it more time to remain private while expanding its U.S. manufacturing capacity. The company faced scrutiny over its reliance on a single Middle Eastern customer, which delayed its public offering plans. Despite the delay, the new funding from prominent investors nearly doubles its 2021 valuation, signaling strong private market confidence in its potential within the booming AI hardware market.</p>

          <p>A new analysis has identified 16 major U.S. cities where housing costs consume the smallest portion of residents' income, offering a measure of relative affordability. The study calculated a weighted average of rent and mortgage costs against median household income for the 50 largest cities, finding that housing costs took up about 25% of income on average. While housing remains a significant financial strain for many Americans nationwide, this report highlights metropolitan areas where local incomes are better aligned with housing expenses.
