          <p>Keith Rabois, Opendoor's new board chair, has strongly criticized the online real-estate platform as "bloated," vowing to cut 85% of its 1,400-person workforce and mandate a return to in-person operations. He asserted that remote work had significantly damaged the company's culture, deviating from its foundational principles of innovation and collaborative work. Rabois also indicated a strategic shift away from Diversity, Equity, and Inclusion (DEI) initiatives. These drastic restructuring plans follow the recent resignation of the previous CEO, Carrie Wheeler, amidst investor pressure, and the appointment of Kaz Nejatian, with co-founder Eric Wu also returning to the board.</p>

          <p>Twin brothers Se Youn “Steve” Kim and Hee Youn “Ted” Kim face federal charges for tax evasion on over $1.1 million in income, largely stemming from a years-long scheme brokering golf tee times. The indictment alleges they created a monopoly on popular early morning slots at numerous Southern California public courses by quickly reserving them and reselling them via online platforms like KakaoTalk. Customers paid reservation fees to the brothers' personal accounts through various digital payment applications. Despite Ted Kim's previous claims of legality, prosecutors assert they willfully failed to report significant income and made lavish purchases while neglecting mounting tax debts.</p>

          <p>The U.S. Department of Agriculture is arranging a fall visit for American growers and exporters to China, which will include meetings with Chinese officials in Beijing and a prominent presence at a key import expo in Shanghai. This marks the third annual trip of its kind, but this year's delegation carries heightened importance amidst lingering trade tensions and Beijing's continued reduction in purchases from the U.S. Approximately 20 participants, including state representatives and agricultural associations, will showcase their products within a dedicated 350-square-meter American pavilion. The initiative seeks to stabilize bilateral ties and bolster American agricultural exports to China, which remains the largest overseas market for U.S. farmers.</p>

          <p>As multiple Federal Reserve rate cuts have occurred and more are anticipated, this article examines the merits of renewing a $10,000 Certificate of Deposit (CD) account maturing in September 2025. Despite current CD rates being lower than in 2024, they remain competitive, with online banks still offering around 4.50%, which can yield significant interest over the term. Renewing a CD offers crucial fixed-rate protection against future market volatility, unlike traditional savings accounts. This strategy could represent a final opportunity for investors to secure a relatively high rate before further Fed reductions potentially diminish yields across the market.

This initiative will establish at least five public-private partnerships with state and local governments to promote the safe development and deployment of eVTOL technology. The program builds on President Trump's executive order from June, which called for fostering safe eVTOL advancement in the U.S. Proponents believe this technology will significantly reduce emissions and alleviate traffic, marking a critical step towards widespread commercial air taxi services in the near future.</p>

          <p>Nepal's President Ram Chandra Poudel has appointed former Supreme Court Chief Justice Sushila Karki as the interim prime minister, marking a historic moment as she becomes the first woman to lead the Himalayan nation's government. Karki, 73, widely respected for her strong anti-corruption stance during her previous tenure as chief justice, was sworn in following a week of intense protests that culminated in the resignation of Prime Minister Khadga Prasad Oli. These demonstrations, initially triggered by a social media ban, quickly expanded to reflect broader public discontent, leading to 51 deaths and the imposition of a military curfew. Karki's appointment is intended to stabilize the country and facilitate negotiations.</p>

          <p>This article from the Investing Club advises regular investors to prioritize a stock's underlying value and valuation metrics, such as the price-to-earnings ratio or dividend yield, over its per-share price. It clarifies that the total dollar amount invested, rather than the number of shares, dictates an investor's exposure and potential risk/reward. The piece emphasizes that technological advancements, particularly the widespread availability of fractional share trading, have made high-priced stocks accessible to all investors, thus removing the need to compromise on company quality for affordability. Ultimately, investment selection based on fundamental characteristics and growth opportunities should guide decisions, not merely the stock's cost. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>Brazil's supreme court has sentenced former president Jair Bolsonaro to 27 years in prison for leading a criminal conspiracy aimed at overturning the 2022 elections, a verdict widely celebrated as a landmark for Brazilian democracy. The extensive plot involved an online disinformation campaign and aborted plans to assassinate the newly elected president, Luiz Inácio Lula da Silva, culminating in the January 2023 riots in Brasília. This ruling, which also convicted seven close allies from the military and security establishment, challenges historical norms of impunity, marking the first conviction of military members for coup-related offenses in a civilian court. Despite international backing for Bolsonaro, a majority of Brazilians accept his guilt, sending a powerful message against undermining democratic norms.</p>

Featuring returning favorites and delightful guest stars, including a standout performance by Arty Froushan as Noel Coward, the article praises Julian Fellowes for illustrating both the significant changes and enduring aspects of society, making it a pleasurable, if perhaps not truly final, visit to Downton.</p>

          <p>As the Federal Reserve prepares for its first interest rate cuts in a year, a debate is emerging over the fate of a record $7.6 trillion parked in money market funds. While some on Wall Street speculate this "wall of cash" could fuel a stock market rally, experts like Peter Crane of Crane Data argue that money fund assets typically only decline during periods of extreme economic calamity and near-zero rates. The article highlights that institutional and corporate cash now constitutes 60% of these funds, which are less likely to move into riskier assets. Investors are advised to consider alternatives like treasury ETFs or re-evaluating equity portfolios, though many may prefer the relative stability of money funds even with slightly lower yields.

          <p>The family of Steve Biko, the prominent South African anti-apartheid activist, expressed confidence that a new inquest into his death 48 years ago will finally lead to the prosecution of those responsible. Biko, a Black Consciousness Movement founder, died from a brain injury in police detention in 1977, after which police falsely claimed he had hit his head. After apartheid ended, former officers admitted to assault, yet no one was ever prosecuted. Biko's son, Nkosinathi, emphasized that South Africa cannot truly move forward without decisively addressing its violent past. This new inquest, initiated after President Cyril Ramaphosa announced a judicial inquiry into apartheid-era crimes, aims to bring long-awaited accountability to a society still grappling with historical injustices.</p>

Snider argued that adults already possessed sufficient information to choose appropriate music for their children, while Gore passionately advocated for "truth in packaging" through labeling to facilitate parental guidance. The PMRC presented provocative album art and lyrics, raising concerns about songs encouraging suicide and violence. Ultimately, the music industry agreed to implement "Parental Advisory: Explicit Lyrics" stickers, which, ironically, some artists like Ice-T claimed boosted their sales, and these labels remain voluntary today.</p>

Tyler Winklevoss asserted that the cryptocurrency is still in its "bottom of the first inning," anticipating at least a 10x increase from its current value exceeding $115,100 per coin. This optimistic forecast coincides with Gemini's preparations for its initial public offering, which was priced above expectations at $28 per share, valuing the company at $3.3 billion. Their conviction stems from a belief that many still underestimate Bitcoin's early stage of development and its long-term disruptive potential in global finance. (not investment advice)</p>

Team officials and players attribute the slump to a combination of nagging injuries and a critical loss of focus on fundamental "team at-bats," where players prioritize advancing runners and driving up pitch counts over individual swing mechanics. With key players like Shohei Ohtani and Mookie Betts regaining form and others recovering from injuries, the team is now intensely emphasizing a renewed, collective approach at the plate. They hope this strategic shift will prevent a repeat of past postseason offensive collapses that cost them dearly.</p>

Leadbeater countered that terminally ill people supporting the article are "definitely not suicidal" but are seeking choice in their dying process.
