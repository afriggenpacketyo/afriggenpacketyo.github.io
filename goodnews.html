          <p>UFC legend Khabib Nurmagomedov drew attention when he declined to shake hands with CBS Sports broadcaster Kate Scott during UEFA Champions League coverage. Nurmagomedov, a devout Muslim, shook hands with male colleagues but kept his hand at his chest when Scott extended hers. This action aligns with Islamic teachings that discourage men from shaking hands with women they are not married to. Scott acknowledged the situation and retracted her hand, understanding the cultural and religious context.</p>
