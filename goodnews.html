          <p>Prime Minister Mark Carney has confirmed that Canada is engaged in "high level" discussions with the United States regarding participation in President Donald Trump's proposed "Golden Dome" missile defense program. The program, estimated to cost $175 billion, aims to create a multi-layered defense system capable of detecting and intercepting various missile threats. Carney emphasized the growing missile threats, including those potentially originating from space, and stated that Canada is seriously considering contributing to the program to enhance its national security, though he did not disclose potential financial commitments. This comes amidst complex US-Canada relations and Canada's efforts to diversify its security alliances.</p>

          <p>The House Rules Committee has advanced a revised version of the "One Big Beautiful Bill Act," a megabill supporting President Donald Trump's second-term agenda, to the full House after a marathon hearing. Changes to the bill include a revised start date for Medicaid work requirements, now set for no later than December 31, 2026, and an increase in the State and Local Tax (SALT) deduction to $40,000 for incomes under $500,000. The amendment also renames MAGA Savings Accounts to "Trump" Accounts and expedites cuts to clean energy credits. The bill appropriates $12 billion for border security reimbursements to states and ends the tax on silencers.</p>

          <p>The European Union has stepped in to provide Radio Free Europe/Radio Liberty with emergency funding of $6.2 million to ensure its continued operation, after the Trump administration withheld $75 million in funds already designated by Congress. The move comes as the international broadcaster faces financial strain due to the Trump administration's actions. RFE/RL President Steve Capus expressed gratitude for the EU's support, emphasizing the network's vital role in providing non-ideological news coverage to countries in Eastern Europe and neighboring states where press freedom is limited. The funding is intended as a short-term safety net to support the network's independent journalism.</p>

          <p>Xpeng, a Chinese electric-vehicle maker, saw its shares in Hong Kong surge over 10% following upbeat earnings and a stronger-than-expected revenue forecast for the second quarter. The company's first-quarter revenue more than doubled from a year earlier, driven by robust sales of 94,008 vehicles. This improved top line helped narrow its net loss for the first quarter and lifted its gross margin to 15.6%. The company anticipates a revenue of 17.5 billion yuan to 18.7 billion yuan for the second quarter and expects to deliver 102,000 to 108,000 electric cars. (not investment advice)</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>The Japanese government has initiated a revamped gasoline subsidy aimed at reducing prices by 10 yen per liter to alleviate cost-of-living pressures on consumers. The new scheme, effective Thursday, replaces the previous subsidy by providing a fixed sum regardless of prices, targeting a 7.40 yen per liter reduction in the first week and aiming for a 10 yen reduction by mid-June. The program is allocated around 1 trillion yen and could last until the end of March 2026, with the reintroduction of subsidies coinciding with an upcoming parliamentary election. Price reductions are expected to reach gas stations in two to three weeks.</p>

          <p>Japanese Finance Minister Katsunobu Kato and U.S. Treasury Secretary Scott Bessent have agreed that the current dollar-yen exchange rate reflects economic fundamentals, during discussions connected to bilateral tariff negotiations. This acknowledgement suggests that the yen's weakness against the dollar should no longer be a point of contention in trade talks. Kato expressed concerns about the impact of the Trump administration's tariffs on the global economy and reiterated Japan's opposition to additional tariffs. The two countries are aiming to strike a "mutually beneficial" trade deal, with ministerial talks expected to ramp up later this month.</p>
