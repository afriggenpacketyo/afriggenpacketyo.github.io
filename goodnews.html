          <p>Nike co-founder Phil Knight and his wife, Penny, are donating $2 billion to the Knight Cancer Institute at Oregon Health and Science University. This contribution, the largest single gift to a U.S. health institution, aims to revolutionize cancer research, treatment, and patient care. The donation builds on a previous challenge where the Knights matched $500 million in fundraising for the institute, led by cancer research pioneer Dr. Brian Druker. The Knights are renowned philanthropists, with lifetime giving estimated in the billions.</p>

She and her friends also co-founded the Vorden Initiative, a nonprofit that educates sighted individuals on how to become allies and athletic guides for blind people.

        </div>
        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Since its 2020 public debut, software company Palantir has seen its stock surge over 1,700%, recently surpassing a $430 billion market valuation. A significant portion of its growth is driven by U.S. government contracts, particularly with the military, which accounted for 55% of its revenue last quarter. Despite its first-ever quarter with over $1 billion in revenue, the company's valuation is exceptionally high compared to tech giants with far greater earnings, trading at a forward price-to-earnings ratio of over 280. This indicates investors are paying a significant premium based on high expectations for its AI-powered software. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>Rebecca Young, a schoolgirl from Glasgow, has been named one of Time magazine's "girls of the year" for inventing a solar-powered heated blanket to help homeless people. She conceived the idea at age 12, and engineering firm Thales later developed it into a working prototype, with 35 units distributed by Homeless Project Scotland. As part of the honor, run in partnership with Lego, Rebecca was also turned into a Lego mini-figure. She hopes her story encourages other young girls to pursue their ideas and get involved in STEM subjects.</p>

        </div>
        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>President Trump's decision to deploy the National Guard and federalize the D.C. police force is a unique situation that would be difficult to replicate in other major U.S. cities. Because Washington, D.C. is a federal district and not a state, the president has direct authority over its National Guard and can assume control of its police in emergencies under the Home Rule Act. In contrast, the governors of the 50 states command their own National Guard units, creating a significant legal barrier to similar federal interventions elsewhere. Legal experts note that any attempt to do so in cities like Chicago or Los Angeles would face major legal challenges and run contrary to American traditions of civilian-led, local law enforcement.</p>

          <p>This article explores the historical concept of "genius," tracing its definition from an innate, almost spiritual quality in the 19th century to a more scientific, and sometimes problematic, focus on heritability. It notes how early attempts to study genius, like those by Francis Galton, were intertwined with the development of eugenics, a discredited and harmful ideology. The piece reflects on how the term has been applied over time, often subjectively and with cultural biases, to figures from chess prodigies to QVC. Ultimately, it argues that while talent and hard work are crucial, genius is also shaped by luck, timing, and social conditions, making it a complex and ever-shifting idea.</p>

          <p>Tropical Storm Erin is expected to intensify into the first hurricane of the Atlantic season by Saturday and potentially become a major Category 3 storm by Sunday as it moves north of Puerto Rico. While the storm is not projected to make a direct landfall on the U.S. mainland, its outer bands will bring rain and dangerous surf to Puerto Rico. The current forecast track shows Erin remaining over the ocean between the U.S. East Coast and Bermuda. However, it is expected to generate a high risk of rip currents along the East Coast from August 21 to 27.</p>

          <p>The U.S. Military Academy at West Point has honored Peter Wang, a 15-year-old Junior ROTC cadet who was killed in the 2018 Marjory Stoneman Douglas High School shooting. Wang, who died while holding a door open for his classmates to escape, had dreamed of attending West Point and was posthumously accepted into the class of 2025. Following nominations from his would-be classmates, he was officially recognized as an Honorary Graduate, an honor for those who embody the academy's values of duty, honor, and country.

          <p>This opinion piece praises a new Department of Energy climate report for taking a nuanced position, acknowledging human-driven climate change without promoting what the author calls an "apocalyptic" narrative. The report, created by a small group of independent scientists, affirms that greenhouse gases are warming the planet but finds no convincing evidence of increased intensity for U.S. hurricanes, tornadoes, or droughts in recent decades. It also suggests that the economic damage from warming may be less than commonly claimed and that drastic emission-reduction policies could cause more harm than good. The author argues this perspective is a vital contribution to a more open and evidence-based debate on climate policy.</p>

          <h2>Comparing Debt Forgiveness and Debt Management as Financial Relief Options</h2>

        </div>
        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>For individuals struggling with debt amid high interest rates, debt forgiveness and debt management are two distinct relief strategies. Debt forgiveness involves negotiating with creditors to pay a lump sum that is less than the total amount owed, which can significantly reduce the principal but often damages credit scores and may result in a tax liability on the forgiven amount. Debt management, typically arranged through a credit counseling agency, involves creating a structured repayment plan with lower interest rates to pay the debt in full over time, which is less harmful to one's credit. The better choice depends on an individual's specific financial situation. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>The plant-based meat industry is seeing its two biggest players, Beyond Meat and Impossible Foods, adopt different strategies to win over consumers. Beyond Meat is rebranding to "Beyond" and launching simpler, less processed products like "Beyond Ground" to appeal to a wellness-focused desire for "natural" ingredients. In contrast, Impossible Foods is doubling down on mimicking conventional meat, launching more "indulgent" products and using a "meatier" brand identity. These opposing bets on whether consumers prioritize clean labels or meaty taste will shape the future of an industry facing stagnant growth and criticism over processing.</p>

          <p>The City of Wolverhampton Council in the UK has reversed its decision to implement higher charges for wider burial plots following a public outcry and media investigation. The proposal, labeled a "fat tax" by critics, would have increased the cost of a larger grave by 20%, a move the council initially defended by citing rising obesity rates and increased operational costs. A local funeral director and residents criticized the plan as discriminatory and an unfair burden on grieving families. After initially defending the plan, the council announced it would "not proceed with the plans."</p>

The statement comes as Aviva's shares hit a post-2008 high following a 22% jump in operating profit.

          <p>The average interest rate for a 30-year fixed mortgage in the U.S. has dropped to 6.58%, its lowest point since October of the previous year. This marks the fourth consecutive week of falling rates, providing some relief and increased purchasing power for potential homebuyers in a market slowed by high borrowing costs. The decline is partly linked to weaker job market data, which has fueled speculation of a potential Federal Reserve interest rate cut. However, economists caution that inflationary risks from tariff policies could still push rates back up, with most projecting the average to remain above 6% for the year. (not investment advice)</p>
