          <h2>Psychologist Identifies Top Five Sources of Conflict in Romantic Relationships</h2>
          <div class="timestamp">2025-06-08 14:51:46 EDT</div>
        </div>
        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>According to a psychologist specializing in couples, even happy couples experience conflict, and the subjects of these disagreements reveal underlying issues in the relationship. The most common source of conflict is tone of voice or attitude, which can signal contempt, a predictor of divorce. Other frequent issues include family relations, household chores, and communication styles, all of which often stem from unmet needs or misalignments. The psychologist suggests strategies such as naming the effect of condescension, reassuring one another, acknowledging the invisible load of domestic work, and using a designated word or phrase for taking time-outs during arguments.

          <p>Tropical Storm Barbara has formed off the southwestern coast of Mexico and is expected to strengthen into a hurricane without directly threatening land.

        </div>
        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>The government is considering implementing stricter online safety measures to limit the amount of time children spend on social media, with proposals including a two-hour cap on individual apps and a 10 PM curfew. Technology Secretary Peter Kyle cited the addictive nature of some apps and smartphones as a concern. However, online safety campaigners, including Ian Russell, whose daughter died after seeing harmful content online, criticize the government for delaying tougher online safety laws. While parental controls and some app-based time limits already exist, uptake is reportedly low, prompting the government to consider further action to ensure a healthy online life for children.</p>
