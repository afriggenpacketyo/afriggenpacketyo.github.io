          <p>Veteran NFL quarterback Aaron Rodgers has officially signed a one-year contract with the Pittsburgh Steelers, worth up to $19.5 million with incentives and a $10 million guarantee. Rodgers addressed rumors about his decision and his time with the Jets, during an appearance on " The Pat McAfee Show " in April. The move resolves the Steelers' quarterback situation, at least for the upcoming season, after Russell Wilson and Justin Fields signed with New York teams. Rodgers will compete with Mason Rudolph for the starting position.</p>

          <p>Charlotte Edwards began her tenure as England women's cricket head coach with a clean sweep in both T20 and ODI series against the West Indies. However, this victory comes with caution, as England has historically dominated home bilateral series but struggled in major tournaments. World Cup-winning spinner Alex Hartley notes England is in a "good place" due to their dominant wins, but the series' significance in indicating future success remains uncertain. Tougher challenges lie ahead, including a series against India and the 50-over World Cup in India and Sri Lanka.</p>

          <p>Zia Yusuf is returning to Reform UK just two days after resigning as chairman, taking on a new role leading the party's "Doge team". Yusuf's resignation earlier in the week was attributed to exhaustion after 11 months of hard work building the party. Reform leader Nigel Farage expressed delight at Yusuf's return, noting that he will take on a more public role and appear more frequently in the media. Yusuf also expressed regret for his previous comments, reaffirming his belief in Nigel Farage's leadership.</p>
