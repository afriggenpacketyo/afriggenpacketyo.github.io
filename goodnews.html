          <p>Air Canada flights are set to gradually resume after a tentative agreement was reached with the Canadian Union of Public Employees, ending a nearly four-day strike by 10,000 flight attendants. The walkout, which impacted over 500,000 passengers during peak travel season, primarily stemmed from disputes over pay and unpaid work hours, such as boarding time. While full details await ratification by members, the union announced the deal secures "transformational change" and guaranteed pay for work performed while planes are on the ground. This breakthrough allows the airline to begin restoring its full service, though a complete return to normal operations may take several days due as aircraft and crew are out of position.</p>

          <p>Former LSU head coach Ed Orgeron has made a bold comparison, likening Texas Longhorns quarterback Arch Manning to Joe Burrow, who had a record-setting national championship season. Orgeron, after observing Manning's practice, stated he is "as close to – or maybe as good as – Joe as I've seen," a sentiment he claims he has never expressed about anyone else. Manning, whose Longhorns are ranked No. 1 in the preseason Associated Press poll and face defending national champion Ohio State soon, carries immense expectations. Despite the high praise, Manning remains grounded, acknowledging that "talk is cheap" and he needs to prove himself on the field.</p>

          <p>Treasury Secretary Scott Bessent announced that interviews for the next Federal Reserve chair will commence after Labor Day, with an initial pool of 11 "very strong candidates" including current governors, economists, and Wall Street figures. The White House is keen to expedite the process, pushing for interest rate cuts to stimulate the "moribund" U.S. housing market and broader economy, despite recent increases in producer prices. Bessent attributed much of the price rise to higher stock market values. Current Chair Jerome Powell is expected to deliver his final keynote address at the Jackson Hole symposium, potentially signaling the Fed's stance on future rate adjustments.

        </div>
        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>The South China Sea dispute is deeply polarized by conflicting historical narratives and legal interpretations, with China asserting historical claims based on pre-war presence and other nations arguing for terra nullius post-WWII. This fundamental divergence, rooted in incomplete post-war territorial arrangements and conflicting national interests, fuels mistrust and escalation, making de-escalation difficult. The article argues that without narrowing this perception gap, a peaceful resolution remains distant. It proposes a joint, fact-based, and truly collaborative process as a potential starting point to overcome the mutually exclusive perspectives and address the underlying identity, national pride, and historical grievances in the region.</p>

          <p>UK Prime Minister Sir Keir Starmer has lauded U.S. President Donald Trump's commitment to security guarantees for Ukraine as a "breakthrough," following a leaders' summit at the White House. Starmer, a proponent of "gratitude diplomacy" towards Trump, expressed satisfaction with the progress, including significant movement towards potential bilateral and trilateral meetings between Russia, Ukraine, and the U.S. Despite this, anxiety persists in UK government circles regarding Ukraine's future, particularly concerning Putin's willingness to engage. UK officials believe the discussions have helped position Ukraine more strongly for potential peace negotiations, especially on sensitive territorial issues, by ensuring allied protection.</p>

          <p>Rudi Gernreich, an Austrian-born designer who fled the Nazis, is credited with inventing the thong in 1974 as an act of rebellion against a nudity ban in Los Angeles. Gernreich, a gay man and co-founder of one of the first LGBTQ+ rights organizations, aimed to liberate bodies, not sexualize them, believing it would "cure society of its sexual hang-up." His designs consistently challenged taboos, including the creation of the topless monokini in 1964 and advocating for unisex fashion, long before it became a mainstream concept. The article highlights his enduring legacy as a pioneer of body positivity, whose progressive vision remains remarkably relevant amidst ongoing societal debates about prudery and censorship.</p>

          <p>The UK government has reportedly dropped its demand for Apple to provide "backdoor" access to encrypted U.S. customer data, as confirmed by U.S. Director of National Intelligence Tulsi Gabbard. This development follows a months-long transatlantic dispute, where President Trump and Vice President Vance criticized the UK's stance as encroaching on civil liberties. The controversy had previously led Apple to withdraw advanced data protection options for new British customers, making their data more vulnerable. While official comments from the Home Office and Apple are pending, Gabbard's statement suggests a resolution that protects American citizens' private data, though it remains unclear if Apple will restore highest data protection levels for UK customers.</p>

          <p>Following a Washington summit, German Chancellor Friedrich Merz expressed satisfaction with progress on Ukraine peace, despite differing views with the U.S. on the necessity of a prior ceasefire. The article highlights discussions on security guarantees for Ukraine, possibly along NATO's Article 5, and the potential for peacekeeping troops, a concept explored by France and the UK. While Merz remains non-committal on German troop deployment, citing the need for domestic coalition and Bundestag approval, he is seen as a leader articulating a European stance. Security experts acknowledge Merz's special way of dealing with Donald Trump and his positive actions towards peace in Ukraine.</p>

          <p>Matcha is experiencing a "second wave" boom, becoming a ubiquitous cultural staple driven less by its inherent taste and more by its aesthetic appeal and role in individualized self-improvement rituals. The article notes its previous, smaller peak in the mid-2010s, but attributes its current widespread popularity to the rise of visual social media platforms like TikTok and Instagram, where its vibrant color and preparation process thrive. While the act of preparing matcha often mirrors traditional Japanese tea ceremonies, its Westernized consumption frequently involves diluting its natural taste with milk and sweeteners. This trend reflects a broader consumer desire for community and tangible experiences in an increasingly isolated online world.</p>

          <p>Spike Lee's latest film, "Highest 2 Lowest," a remake of Akira Kurosawa's "High and Low," stars Denzel Washington as David King, a music producer whose life is upended by a mistaken kidnapping. The movie, which blends a hard-boiled hostage thriller with self-aware satire, sees King grappling with a profound moral dilemma when his chauffeur's son is taken instead of his own. Despite initial narrative sloppiness, the film gains momentum, showcasing Lee's signature New York City energy and Washington's sharp, darkly humorous performance. It ultimately explores themes of reclaiming one's creative edge and confronting societal inequalities, as King is plunged into a world far removed from his luxurious life.</p>

The combined entity would own 265 stations, reaching 80% of the U.S., significantly expanding Nexstar's reach and market presence. This strategic move reflects broadcasters' efforts to consolidate and achieve the scale needed to compete more effectively with Big Tech and legacy media companies, pushing for a lift on current ownership caps.

          <p>A new study on gastroenterologists in Poland suggests that doctors may quickly become overly dependent on AI systems, potentially leading to a decline in their independent diagnostic skills. The research found that doctors' ability to spot polyps during colonoscopies decreased by about 20% when AI assistance was switched off, after a period of using the AI-assisted system. While some experts are skeptical of the study's scope and statistical variations, it highlights a "safety-net effect" where clinicians subconsciously rely on AI to flag abnormalities. The findings underscore the need for further research into how AI integration impacts human medical expertise and the potential for unintended consequences in clinical settings.</p>
