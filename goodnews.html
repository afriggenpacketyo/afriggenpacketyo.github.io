The multi-day celebration reportedly included around 200 guests and sparked some local protests over the impact of tourism and wealth inequality. Festivities began on Thursday with a pre-wedding reception, with guests arriving via water taxis for the lavish event. This is the second marriage for both Bezos and S√°nchez, who finalized their previous divorces in 2019.</p>

          <p>The 1975 returned to the stage to headline Glastonbury, delivering a slick and professional set filled with their biggest hits. Frontman Matty Healy, known for his unpredictable stage presence, offered a more restrained performance, largely avoiding his past on-stage antics and political commentary. While the band was musically tight and the show was a crowd-pleaser, some critics found it lacked the raw, untamed energy of their previous performances. The set was part of a day that also featured a surprise, emotional comeback from Lewis Capaldi two years after a difficult performance.</p>

          <p>Australia claimed a decisive 159-run victory over the West Indies in the first Test match in Barbados, driven by a powerful bowling performance from Josh Hazlewood. The West Indies' batting lineup collapsed in the final session of day three, losing all ten wickets as they chased a target of 301. Hazlewood was the chief destroyer, taking five wickets for 43 runs to dismantle the hosts' top order. Despite some late resistance, Australia's relentless attack secured the win with two days to spare, highlighting their clinical approach to the game.</p>

          <p>The California legislature has approved a measure to more than double the state's annual tax incentives for film and television production, raising the total from $330 million to $750 million. The move, championed by Governor Gavin Newsom, aims to reverse the trend of productions leaving Hollywood for other states and countries that offer more generous financial benefits. Industry unions and advocates applauded the decision, seeing it as a crucial step to revitalize local production and bring jobs back to the state. The increase is intended to help California remain competitive as a premier location for filming.</p>

          <p>President Trump expressed optimism that a ceasefire agreement between Israel and Hamas could be achieved within the next week. The administration has been actively pushing for a pause in the fighting, which began after Hamas's attack on Israel in October 2023. A previous proposal for a 60-day ceasefire was rejected by Hamas. The ongoing war has resulted in a severe humanitarian crisis in Gaza, with over 56,000 people killed, according to the territory's health ministry. Trump's comments come as a separate ceasefire between Israel and Iran appears to be holding.</p>
