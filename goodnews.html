          <p>The Prince and Princess of Wales are planning a move to Forest Lodge, an eight-bedroom home in Windsor Great Park, seeking a "fresh start" for their family. This decision follows a challenging period, including the Princess's cancer diagnosis, and the move from their current Adelaide Cottage is seen as a long-term plan for their "forever home." The relocation is being privately funded, and the couple intends to maintain a private family life without live-in staff, continuing a successful transition to Windsor that began in 2022.</p>

The "X-WING" units, designed by Brian Stark, are constructed from four containers, topped with solar panels, and can be assembled in just one week. This sustainable approach aims to address the affordable housing crisis by utilizing existing materials, providing air-conditioned living spaces, and offering residents a sense of stability and a place to rebuild their lives.</p>

          <p>U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE) data shows a 13% drop in arrests nationwide during July, following a sharp increase in June. Activist groups in states like Oregon believe their efforts, including a "rapid response" hotline system that provides quick legal aid to arrestees, may be contributing to the slowdown. The lack of an ICE detention facility in Oregon, combined with its "sanctuary" law limiting local police cooperation, further complicates large-scale enforcement actions and may be a factor in the reduced arrest numbers.</p>

          <p>In their first head-to-head 100-meter race since the Paris Olympics, Jamaican sprinter Kishane Thompson claimed victory over American Olympic champion Noah Lyles at the Silesia Diamond League meet. Thompson clocked a time of 9.87 seconds, matching the meet record, while Lyles finished second at 9.90 seconds. The race was a significant moment for Thompson, who narrowly lost to Lyles for the Olympic gold by just five-thousandths of a second a year ago, establishing a compelling rivalry ahead of the upcoming world championships in Tokyo.</p>

          <p>A 46-year-old man was rescued via helicopter after being trapped for two days behind a powerful waterfall in a remote area of Tulare County, California. The man, Ryan Wardwell, had been rappelling down the Seven Teacups waterfalls when the intense force of the water pushed him off his climbing lines, trapping him. After a search involving infrared technology and a drone, a dive and rescue team located him alive, and the California Highway Patrol successfully hoisted him to safety.</p>

          <p>A top scientist from the Chinese Academy of Sciences has called for a national, top-down strategy to accelerate the development of space-based solar power. This technology involves orbiting facilities that convert solar energy to electricity and transmit it to Earth, offering a continuous power source unaffected by weather or nighttime. The expert, Ge Changchun, argued that China needs to intensify its efforts to close the technological gap with the United States and establish a stronger position in the new energy sector and the broader space race.</p>

          <h2>The Case for 'Lighthouse Parenting' as an Alternative to Intensive Child-Rearing</h2>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>The concept of the "Lighthouse Parent" is presented as a healthier alternative to the exhausting and often counterproductive trend of intensive parenting. This approach encourages parents to act as a steady, reliable guide, providing safety and illumination when needed but otherwise allowing children the space to navigate their own journeys and learn from their struggles. The article argues that resisting the impulse to constantly intervene and solve problems for children helps foster more confident and resilient individuals, while also reducing parental burnout.</p>

          <p>Devon and Cornwall Police have seized £180,000 that controversial influencer Andrew Tate paid as a deposit for an Aston Martin Valhalla supercar in 2021. A court granted the forfeiture order after the police force argued the funds were proceeds from tax evasion and money laundering, claims which Tate and his brother did not contest. This seizure adds to the £2.7 million previously confiscated from the brothers for failing to pay taxes on revenue from their online businesses, with the funds set to be reinvested into crime prevention initiatives.</p>

          <p>A program called Dec My Dorm is helping to ease the transition to college for students coming from the foster care system by providing them with essential dorm room supplies.

          <p>Samsung is challenging Apple's dominance in the U.S. smartphone market, increasing its market share from 23% to 31% in the second quarter while Apple's declined. This shift is partly driven by the growing momentum of Samsung's innovative foldable phones, like the Z Fold 7, which offer a new form factor compared to the traditional iPhone design. While Apple remains the market leader, Samsung's wider range of products and pricing, coupled with positive social media traction, signals a renewed and intense competition between the two tech giants.

          <p>A fugitive crime boss, Jamie Rothwell, was brought to justice after inadvertently revealing his location to police by sharing a selfie on the supposedly secure EncroChat network. The photo, along with images of the view from his Barcelona apartment, allowed detectives to identify and locate him, leading to his extradition and eventual conviction for running a massive drugs and firearms operation. The case highlights the success of Operation Venetic, the international law enforcement effort that compromised the encrypted network and led to thousands of criminal convictions.</p>
