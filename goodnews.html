        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>A federal judge has approved a settlement between the NCAA and its athletes, paving the way for schools to directly compensate athletes, marking a historic shift in college sports. The agreement allows schools to share up to $20.5 million with athletes annually and allocates $2.7 billion over the next decade to former players who were previously restricted from revenue sharing. NCAA President Charlie Baker stated the settlement would stabilize college sports by enabling direct financial benefits to student-athletes and regulating third-party NIL agreements. The professionalization of college athletics is expected to impact recruitment and potentially lead to program adjustments at various institutions. Optimism regarding the new framework is tempered by concerns about potential impacts on walk-on athletes and the equitable distribution of resources.</p>

          <p>A phone call between President Donald Trump and Chinese President Xi Jinping has provided a potential respite for Asian countries caught between the two superpowers. The conversation, described as "very positive" by Trump, is seen as a diplomatic breakthrough after escalating tensions between the US and China. For China's neighbors, who rely on trade with both nations, the call eases the pressure of choosing between prioritizing trade with China and navigating aggressive US policies.

          <p>Hong Kong continues to be China's primary hub for global finance, surpassing Shanghai due to its access to international capital and strong connectivity to global markets. Despite the presence of mainland exchanges like Beijing, Shanghai, and Shenzhen, companies are increasingly choosing Hong Kong for capital infusions. The city's appeal has grown, particularly as US-China relations have become strained, making New York a less attractive option for Chinese companies. Hong Kong's robust financial infrastructure and global connections solidify its position as a key player in the international financial landscape.</p>

          <p>Japan and the United States are working towards a tariff agreement by mid-June, despite ongoing disagreements on key issues. Japan's chief tariff negotiator, Ryosei Akazawa, stated that progress was made during talks with U.S. officials, but no final decision has been reached. Japan is seeking the removal of additional tariffs imposed by the Trump administration, arguing that any deal must benefit both countries. The negotiations include discussions on trade, nontariff barriers, and economic security, with Japan presenting proposals to strengthen supply chains and expand imports of U.S. farm products.</p>

Ishiba aims to reform the decades-old production adjustment system, countering opposition parties advocating for consumption tax cuts. The Prime Minister seeks to boost rice production, though challenges remain, including the risk of oversupply and price drops.
