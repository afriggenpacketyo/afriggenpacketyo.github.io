          <p>Kansas City Chiefs tight end Travis Kelce has invested in Six Flags Entertainment as part of a group led by activist investment firm JANA Partners. The group acquired a 9% stake, making them one of the largest shareholders in the amusement park company, which has been grappling with significant debt and declining attendance post-pandemic. Kelce, a self-proclaimed lifelong fan, aims to help revitalize the brand, which recently merged with Cedar Fair but continues to face financial headwinds. The investment has sparked fan hopes for new attractions and is seen as a positive move to leverage Kelce's popularity to attract a younger audience.</p>

          <div class="timestamp">2025-10-24 14:36:13 EDT</div>
        </div>
        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>With two months until Christmas, major retailers are rolling out holiday deals earlier than usual to appeal to price-conscious shoppers. Executives from companies like Kohl's and Academy Sports and Outdoors note that consumers, particularly in the lower- and middle-income brackets, are feeling the strain of their budgets and are more carefully planning their purchases. This has led to a strategy of capturing spending early and often, with shoppers making more frequent trips for smaller purchases to find the best deals. Despite concerns about a potential government shutdown and tariffs, retailers report normal inventory levels and are cautiously optimistic about the holiday season.</p>

          <p>The German women's national football team defeated France 1-0 in the first leg of the UEFA Women's Nations League semifinal. The decisive goal was scored by Bayern Munich's Klara Bühl late in the game, giving Germany a narrow advantage heading into the second leg in Caen, France. Head coach Christian Wück expressed satisfaction with the team's performance but noted their inefficiency in front of goal, stating the victory was deserved but too close. The match was the first encounter between the two rivals since their dramatic quarter-final at the European Championship, setting the stage for a highly anticipated conclusion to the semifinal matchup.</p>

          <p>Shares of Advanced Micro Devices (AMD) increased by over 7% following a report that IBM can use its chips for a quantum computing error correction algorithm. This development is part of a collaboration announced in August, where the two tech giants agreed to jointly develop quantum computing technologies. IBM confirmed the report, calling it a significant milestone toward its goal of building a large-scale, fault-tolerant quantum computer by 2029. The news has generated renewed investor interest in the quantum computing sector, boosting stocks of other related companies as major players like Google and Microsoft also advance their own quantum projects.

          <p>The German company Böcker, which manufactures the furniture lift used by thieves in a recent $102 million jewel heist at the Louvre, has capitalized on the incident with a witty advertising campaign. After recognizing their Agilo model in news reports, the company's marketing head developed an ad featuring a photo of the machine outside the museum with the tagline, "If you're in a hurry." The ad, which highlights the lift's speed and quiet electric motor, went viral on social media, garnering millions of views. While the company's co-owner emphasized that they do not condone criminal activity, they decided to embrace the publicity since no one was harmed during the robbery.</p>

          <p>Intel reported a return to profitability in its third-quarter earnings, ending a six-quarter losing streak, driven by strong demand for its chips, particularly for PCs and laptops. The report is the first since the Trump administration acquired a 10% stake in the company, part of a larger cash infusion that includes investments from Softbank. CEO Lip-Bu Tan highlighted artificial intelligence as a key driver for long-term growth, and the company expects robust demand to continue into 2026. While the core client computing division showed growth, the company's foundry business remains a work in progress, having not yet secured a major external customer. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>Homebuyers and homeowners are navigating a volatile mortgage rate environment influenced by inflation, unemployment, and the ongoing government shutdown. With the Federal Reserve expected to announce another interest rate cut at its October 29 meeting, prospective borrowers are weighing whether to lock in current rates or wait for a potential further decline. Average 30-year mortgage rates are currently around 6.19%, down from over 7% at the start of the year but slightly up since the Fed's last cut in September. Experts advise that while rates may dip, lenders often price in anticipated Fed cuts, and waiting could be risky. (not investment advice)</p>

Newsom asserted that the city is actively addressing crime and pointed to data showing a significant decline in homicides and violent crime. The governor vowed to immediately challenge any deployment in court, noting the state has already filed numerous lawsuits against the Trump administration. President Trump later announced he had called off the plan after speaking with local leaders, who assured him the city was "on the rise."</p>

          <p>After a four-month standoff, House Minority Leader Hakeem Jeffries has endorsed democratic socialist Zohran Mamdani for New York City mayor. The endorsement came just one day before the start of early voting, following months of pressure from progressives and repeated questions from the media about his reluctance. Jeffries' hesitation was reportedly due to concerns over Mamdani's past rhetoric on Israel and how his progressive policies would be implemented. The endorsement solidifies Democratic party unity around Mamdani, who holds a strong lead in the polls against his opponents, former Governor Andrew Cuomo and Republican Curtis Sliwa, ahead of the November 4 election.</p>

The artist's music, a blend of hardstyle EDM, rage trap, and emo pop punk, incorporates sounds from the event, such as wind chimes from his porch recorded just before the fire. Performing for a sold-out hometown crowd at the Shrine Auditorium, 2hollis described the creative process as a "phoenix situation," rising from the ashes to produce his most personal and impactful work yet.</p>
