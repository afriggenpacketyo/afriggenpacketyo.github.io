          <p>Tropical Storm Erin has intensified into the first hurricane of the 2025 Atlantic season, currently tracking over the ocean as a Category 1 storm. Forecasters at the National Hurricane Center anticipate it will continue to strengthen, potentially becoming a major hurricane with Category 4 winds early next week. While not expected to make a direct impact on the United States mainland, its path is projected to pass near the northern Leeward Islands, prompting tropical storm watches in the Caribbean. The development of Erin signals the approach of the hurricane season's peak period.</p>

          <p>At 49 years old, Ronnie O'Sullivan has become the oldest player to compile a 147 maximum break in a professional snooker tournament. He achieved this perfect frame during the semi-final of the Saudi Arabia Masters, marking the 16th maximum of his illustrious career and his first in seven years. The feat puts him in line to share a significant bonus prize with another player who made a 147 earlier in the tournament. O'Sullivan's performance demonstrates his enduring skill and dominance in the sport as he aims for his first ranking event title in 19 months.</p>

          <p>New York City Democratic mayoral nominee Zohran Mamdani confirmed he received a phone call from former President Barack Obama after his primary victory in June. Mamdani stated that their conversation focused on the importance of maintaining hope in a political climate often characterized by "darkness." The 33-year-old democratic socialist described the call as an honor and cited Obama as an example of how to rise above political criticism. The discussion highlights the attention Mamdani's progressive campaign is receiving from the Democratic party's establishment figures as he prepares for the general election.</p>

          <div class="timestamp">2025-08-15 14:27:09 EDT</div>
        </div>
        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>The horror film "Weapons," from director Zach Cregger, is being praised for its daring narrative that provides clear answers to its central mystery about a group of children who mysteriously vanish. The article describes the movie as a "feel-bad, feel-good" experience, where the eventual supernatural explanation and defeat of the villain offer cinematic catharsis. However, the review notes that the film smartly underlines the fallacy of this relief, emphasizing that vanquishing the evil force does not erase the trauma and grief it caused the community. This emotional complexity is highlighted as a key reason for the film's success.</p>

          <p>The health care sector was the top performer in the stock market this week, bucking a broader trend that saw technology and consumer staples stocks decline. Eli Lilly shares rebounded after a previous sell-off, driven by a series of insider stock purchases and news of a price increase for its drug Mounjaro in the U.K. The sector also received a boost after a filing revealed that Berkshire Hathaway had acquired a new stake in UnitedHealth Group. This rotation into health care stocks occurred as investors moved away from momentum-based tech companies. (not investment advice)</p>

          <h2>Fact Check: Trump's Claims of "Out of Control" Crime in Washington, D.C. Are Misleading</h2>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>A fact-check of President Trump's justification for federalizing the Washington, D.C. police force finds his claims about crime rates to be misleading. While D.C. did have a high homicide rate in 2023 when compared to states, it was not the highest among major U.S. cities. The article points out that Trump's statement omits the crucial context that violent crime and homicides in the city have seen a significant decrease in 2024 and 2025. This downward trend aligns with national statistics showing a reduction in crime across the U.S., challenging the premise of an emergency crisis.</p>

          <p>Following reports that the Trump administration is considering taking a financial stake in Intel, a technology analyst has described such an intervention as crucial for U.S. national security. Gil Luria of D.A. Davidson argued that government involvement is necessary to revive the struggling chipmaker and reduce American reliance on foreign semiconductor manufacturers like Samsung and TSMC. The potential move, which could be funded through the CHIPS Act, is framed as a strategic necessity to ensure domestic production of critical technology, especially with the rise of advanced artificial intelligence.

          <p>This article reflects on the work of Scottish author Muriel Spark, particularly her most famous novella, "The Prime of Miss Jean Brodie." It explores Spark's "steely command of omniscience" and her central concern with moral education and faith, themes rooted in her conversion to Catholicism. The review highlights how "Miss Jean Brodie" investigates the powerful influence a magnetic teacher can have on impressionable adolescents. It notes that while the story is about the students' journey, it ultimately reveals how one character's path to adulthood and religious conversion is deeply, and permanently, shaped by her formative teacher.</p>

          <p>A seismic swarm of more than 130 small earthquakes, with the largest reaching magnitude 4.0, has occurred in a Northern California geothermal field. The activity is centered in the Geysers steam field, an area known for frequent minor quakes due to the operations of its geothermal power facilities. According to the U.S. Geological Survey, these small, induced earthquakes are common and caused by the withdrawal of steam and the injection of cold water to generate electricity. The agency notes that this activity is distinct from the region's major seismic hazards, like the San Andreas fault.</p>
