          <div class="timestamp">2025-08-12 13:28:17 EDT</div>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Following the boom in data centers driven by artificial intelligence, quantum computing is emerging as the next major catalyst for the commercial real estate sector. As the technology advances toward commercial viability, a significant need for specialized real estate is anticipated, with analysts predicting a potential breakthrough around 2030 that could trigger tens of billions in investments. Unlike traditional data centers, quantum computers require unique infrastructure, such as electromagnetic shielding, suggesting a new wave of development and redevelopment for properties in research-heavy hubs like Chicago and Boston. This development is seen as accretive, creating new opportunities rather than making existing data centers obsolete. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>Shares of the Swiss sneaker company On surged after it reported a 32% increase in second-quarter sales and raised its full-year revenue and margin guidance. The popular sportswear brand, which competes with giants like Nike, now anticipates sales of 2.91 billion Swiss francs for the year. Despite sourcing 90% of its goods from Vietnam and facing new tariffs, the company successfully raised prices without seeing a drop in consumer demand. On continues its rapid expansion, with strong performance in the Americas, Europe, and particularly in China, where sales grew by 50%. (not investment advice)</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>For retirees who must take required minimum distributions (RMDs) from their retirement accounts but do not need the funds for living expenses, several strategic options exist. Financial planners suggest reinvesting the money into a brokerage account, often favoring tax-efficient exchange-traded funds (ETFs) for long-term growth. Another popular choice is a qualified charitable distribution (QCD), which allows a direct, tax-free transfer to a nonprofit to satisfy RMD requirements. For those focused on legacy planning, using the withdrawal to contribute to a 529 college savings plan for family members can also be a beneficial move. (not investment advice)</p>

The company is now accelerating the rollout of this new service model to all U.S. locations ahead of schedule.

          <p>The AI search startup Perplexity has made an unsolicited bid of $34.5 billion to acquire Google's Chrome browser, a move backed by several of its investors. This offer comes after the U.S. Department of Justice recommended that Google be forced to divest Chrome as a remedy in its landmark antitrust case, which found the company held an illegal monopoly in internet search. The DOJ argued that divesting Chrome would level the playing field for competing search engines. Perplexity, known for its AI-powered answer engine, is positioning itself aggressively in the competitive generative AI landscape.</p>

          <p>In his weekly advice column, James Parker responds to a reader who struggles with being too brusque at work and another who is contemplating giving up on sobriety and the world. To the first, he suggests that being the "common denominator" of high standards is not necessarily a bad thing and that it may be time to leave an unsatisfying job. To the second, who is struggling with alcoholism, he offers encouragement to strive for life without alcohol rather than surrendering to despair. The column provides personal and philosophical reflections on navigating life's persistent challenges.</p>

Despite posting a net loss due to IPO-related charges, the company's performance reflects surging institutional interest in stablecoins, bolstered by recent supportive legislation in the U.S. Circle also announced plans to launch a new proprietary blockchain called Arc, designed for stablecoin payments and capital markets applications.

          <p>Amid market volatility and persistent inflation, this article explores the safety of annuities as a retirement investment. It advises that an annuity's security depends heavily on the financial strength and credit rating of the issuing insurance company, as they are not FDIC-insured. While state guarantee associations offer a limited safety net, the primary long-term risk to annuity holders is often the erosion of purchasing power due to inflation. The piece differentiates between the risk profiles of fixed, variable, and indexed annuities, urging potential investors to consider these factors carefully. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>In an opinion piece, author Anne Lamott reflects on navigating the current political climate, which she describes as a terrifying time. She argues that the antidote to the overwhelming cruelty and absurdity is not just activism but also laughter, joy, and small acts of kindness. Drawing on the humor of Monty Python and a personal anecdote from a nail salon, Lamott suggests that embracing absurdity and practicing kindness can be powerful forms of resistance. She concludes that doing hopeful things, like singing and helping others, is the best way to maintain hope and sanity.</p>

The 29-year-old playmaker, who joined City for a record £100m in 2021, fell out of favor last season and is looking to rejuvenate his career with more consistent playing time. Grealish said that conversations with manager David Moyes were decisive in his move to the club.

The move is a response to the growing "cagongjok" trend, where people use coffee shops as their personal offices for hours, sometimes after buying only a single drink. While laptops and tablets are still welcome, the company aims to ensure seating is available for all customers. The announcement has been met with approval on social media from Koreans who feel the practice had gotten out of hand.</p>
