          <p>President Trump underwent a "routine yearly checkup" at Walter Reed National Military Medical Center, just six months after his annual physical, with his physician declaring him in "excellent overall health." The report highlighted "exceptional" comprehensive laboratory studies and stable metabolic, hematologic, and cardiac parameters, along with the president receiving his annual flu and an updated COVID-19 booster vaccination. This follow-up, including advanced imaging and preventive assessments, occurs as Trump, 79, prepares for a Middle East trip. His previous April physical had noted minor sun damage and scarring on his right ear from a July 2024 assassination attempt, while a later exam revealed chronic venous insufficiency.</p>

          <p>Senior U.S. officials have provided a detailed timeline of the months-long efforts that culminated in the Israel-Hamas ceasefire, initiating the first phase of President Trump's peace plan. The process involved a new ceasefire proposal accepted by Hamas in August 2025, drawing on previous negotiations, and subsequent "wordsmithing" by special envoy Steve Witkoff and Jared Kushner with Qatari and other Arab leaders. A key moment included Israeli Prime Minister Netanyahu's apology to Qatar for an airstrike in Doha, which helped build trust amid deep mistrust. The plan, which evolved into a 20-point proposal, was divided into two phases: a hostage release and prisoner swap, followed by an "almost permanent ceasefire" to negotiate broader issues like arms decommissioning and Gaza's future governance.</p>

          <p>Maria Corina Machado, a leading figure in Venezuela's pro-democracy movement, has been awarded the Nobel Peace Prize, a powerful recognition she views as a message to her fellow Venezuelans that "we are not alone." Known as Venezuela's "Iron Lady," Machado has tirelessly challenged the country's authoritarian leaders for over two decades, leading a significant political movement despite being forced to live in hiding due to repeated threats. The Norwegian Nobel Committee honored her for "keeping the flame of democracy burning amidst a growing darkness." Machado expressed profound gratitude, acknowledging the award as an achievement for the entire Venezuelan society and hoping it will provide personal protection while globally highlighting their vital struggle.</p>

          <p>Hong Kong's enduring role as a premier international financial center is critically dependent on its capacity to adapt to China's evolving economic landscape, specifically its pivot towards tech self-sufficiency and advanced manufacturing development. Wang Lei, CEO of Huatai Financial Holdings and a member of the Hong Kong Chief Executive’s Council of Advisers, asserted that this strategic shift represents a "tremendous opportunity" for the city. He advocates for Hong Kong to design specialized "financial frameworks focusing on specialised technology sectors" to effectively meet the capital demands from global companies. This proactive adaptation is deemed essential for sustaining the city's relevance and economic vitality in the coming years.</p>

          <p>An Oklahoma high school girls basketball team, the Academy of Classical Christian Studies, made an unprecedented decision to return their division championship trophy after their coach discovered a scoring error. Following a seemingly victorious buzzer-beater, coach Brendan King reviewed the game tape and realized his team had actually lost by one point. Despite league rules that prevent score changes once a game concludes, the team unanimously chose to appeal their own crowning victory, prioritizing integrity and fair play. The league agreed, awarding the title to Apache High, whose coach lauded the act of sportsmanship, emphasizing that it demonstrated "there are still good people in this world" and left a lasting positive impression.</p>

          <p>Quaker, a 15-year-old Household Cavalry Mounted Regiment horse, has officially retired to a country sanctuary after sustaining injuries during a dramatic incident last April. He was one of five horses startled by construction work, causing them to bolt through central London, colliding with vehicles. Quaker suffered bleeding and a small break, necessitating surgery. While his rider, who broke his back, has recovered and returned to duty, Quaker was deemed unable to resume military service, with his welfare prioritized. He now resides at the Horse Trust sanctuary in Buckinghamshire, joining 32 other former military horses, enjoying a peaceful retirement of eating, sleeping, and running around.</p>

          <p>China, in a significant collaborative effort with the United States and Thailand, has announced a record-breaking seizure of nearly 5,000 kilograms (over 10,900 pounds) of methamphetamine. The operation, which took place on February 24 near the disputed Scarborough Shoal in the South China Sea, involved the Chinese anti-drug agency and Coast Guard acting on intelligence provided by the US Drug Enforcement Administration and the Royal Thai Police. Seven suspects were arrested in what is now considered the largest single maritime drug seizure in the Asia-Pacific region in recent years. Representatives from the three nations have since met to strengthen cooperation and deepen efforts to dismantle behind-the-scenes drug trafficking syndicates.</p>

          <p>The Trump administration announced a deal with AstraZeneca for "most-favored-nation" drug pricing for Medicaid patients, aiming to lower prescription costs and avoid threatened tariffs. Under the agreement, AstraZeneca will charge Medicaid no more than the lowest rates offered in other high-income countries and list primary care medications on the "TrumpRx" website, offering up to 80% discounts for eligible patients. This follows a similar deal with Pfizer. While Trump exaggerated potential price cuts, experts caution that Medicaid already receives low prices, and the "TrumpRx" site's impact for most insured patients is uncertain. The agreement also includes AstraZeneca's commitment to invest in U.S. manufacturing. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>Apple is in advanced negotiations to acquire the talent and technology from computer vision startup Prompt AI, a strategic move aimed at bolstering Apple's AI research and development efforts. Prompt AI, an 11-person company founded in 2023, had developed the Seemour app, which offered sophisticated detection capabilities for home security cameras. Although the technology was deemed effective, the company's business model proved unsustainable, leading to the app's impending retirement. This "acqui-hire" reflects a broader Silicon Valley trend of tech giants acquiring top AI talent to enhance their capabilities and potentially skirt regulatory concerns, with Prompt's assets expected to be integrated into Apple's HomeKit smart home division.</p>

The announcement drew criticism from some right-wing activists, who referenced past concerns raised by President Trump regarding Qatar's alleged historical funding of terrorism. Despite this, the deal signifies a strengthening relationship, following previous security guarantees for Qatar and the acceptance of a Boeing 747 jet gift from the Qatari royal family.</p>

          <p>The popular BBC show "The Traitors," now in a celebrity edition, fascinates viewers with its core game of lying and deception, mirroring aspects of everyday human nature. Psychologists explain that deception is "in our DNA," serving both to exploit and, paradoxically, to maintain social cohesion. The show's appeal lies in its "microcosm" of human treachery, where participants attempt to discern truth amidst constant uncertainty. Experts note that good liars are often intelligent and adept at impression management, making celebrity contestants particularly intriguing as their pre-existing personas add layers of intrigue. The game exposes the "illusion of co-operation," demonstrating how loyalty can quickly collapse under pressure and changing incentives.</p>

          <p>This article provides an in-depth analysis of how President Trump's unique approach and leverage were instrumental in orchestrating the initial Israel-Hamas ceasefire, which previous administrations failed to achieve. Special emissaries Jared Kushner and Steve Witkoff led intense negotiations, culminating in a 20-point peace plan. Trump's "bellicosity in service of peace" and strong ties with both Israel and Arab nations, coupled with his willingness to pressure Netanyahu, created a new dynamic. Key factors included an Israeli apology to Qatar for an airstrike and Hamas viewing hostages as a liability. The article notes an "exhaustion factor" on both sides, and the plan includes an International Stabilization Force for Gaza's future, with U.S. military advisors already deployed.</p>
