          <p>Netflix's stock has reached an all-time high, trading positively for 11 consecutive days, marking the company's longest winning streak ever. This surge follows a strong earnings report revealing revenue growth driven by subscriptions and advertising. While traditional media stocks have suffered due to market volatility caused by Trump's trade policies, Netflix has remained largely unaffected, with co-CEO Greg Peters noting no significant impact on the business. JPMorgan analysts predict further upside for Netflix shares, citing its leadership in global streaming and the upcoming Advertising Upfronts as potential catalysts. (not investment advice)</p>

          <h2>Stock Market Recovers After Tariff-Induced Sell-Off, but Economic Concerns Linger</h2>

          <p>Wall Street has bounced back from April's sharp sell-off, fueled by hopes of trade talks, but the economic consequences of President Trump's policies continue to worry investors. The S&P 500 has rebounded to pre-tariff levels, driven by a strong jobs report and indications from the Trump administration that they are willing to engage in trade talks with China. Despite the recovery, the S&P 500 remains below its February high, and concerns persist about the potential for tariffs to slow economic growth as companies struggle to forecast future performance and may be forced to raise prices. The article underscores the volatility in the market due to uncertainty surrounding the administration's trade policies.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Germany's domestic intelligence agency, the Bundesamt f√ºr Verfassungsschutz (BfV), has formally designated the far-right Alternative for Germany (AfD) as extremist after a three-year investigation. The BfV concluded that the AfD's actions contravene the constitution's core principles, including human dignity, democracy, and the rule of law. This designation, extending to the party's national organization, is likely to further isolate the AfD, which is known for its anti-immigration and nationalist platform, despite its electoral success. The intelligence agency's designation is expected to strengthen efforts to exclude the AfD from key roles in the Bundestag.</p>

        </div>
        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Temu, the online retailer known for ultra-discounted items shipped directly from China, has suspended direct shipping from China to the U.S. as the de minimis tariff loophole expires. This change, driven by an executive order signed by President Trump and new tariffs on Chinese goods, forces Temu to rely on U.S.-based warehouses and local sellers. The company has shifted its website to only display products shipped from within the country, aiming to maintain pricing for U.S. shoppers and improve service levels. The move reflects the impact of escalating trade tensions and the end of duty-free entry for low-value shipments.</p>
