          <p>The Wimbledon 2025 men's final will feature a compelling matchup between the world's top two players, Jannik Sinner and Carlos Alcaraz, renewing their intense rivalry. This meeting comes just weeks after their classic five-set final at the French Open, which Alcaraz won. The two young stars have dominated the men's circuit, winning the last six Grand Slam titles between them, and their on-court battles are seen as the next great rivalry in tennis. While both players acknowledge the significance of their duels, they remain focused on the challenge ahead in what promises to be another thrilling encounter.</p>

          <p>British boxer Hamzah Sheeraz made a powerful debut in the super middleweight division with a fifth-round stoppage of Edgar Berlanga in Queens, New York. Sheeraz dominated the fight, dropping Berlanga twice in the fourth round before the referee intervened early in the fifth. The victory marks a significant step up for Sheeraz, establishing him as a serious contender in the 168lb weight class potentially in line for major fights against top names.

          <h2>New Study Suggests China's Tibetan Dam May Increase India's Dry-Season Water Supply</h2>

          <p>Contrary to widespread fears in India that a new Chinese mega-dam in Tibet could cause droughts, a recent study indicates it may have the opposite effect. Research based on data from two existing upstream dams, Zangmu and Jiacha, shows a significant increase in water flow downstream during the dry season. The study found that low flows in February were up by over 50%, suggesting that China's dam operations could actually augment water levels for India when it is most needed. This scientific finding provides a new perspective on the potential hydrological impact of China's massive infrastructure projects on neighboring countries.</p>

          <p>China's space economy is projected to grow rapidly, reaching an estimated US$1.8 trillion by 2035, with private investment playing an increasingly crucial role. The private sector's share of aerospace investment is expected to surge, driven by technological advancements and state support for companies like i-Space and LandSpace. This expansion creates a significant opportunity for Hong Kong to leverage its status as an international financial hub to attract capital and talent for the nation's burgeoning commercial space industry. The city's financial infrastructure can provide vital support for mainland companies aiming to compete in the global space race. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>China is strategically investing in what it terms "future industries" to create a new economic growth model centered on technological innovation and industrial upgrades. First introduced by President Xi Jinping, this initiative targets emerging sectors with immense potential, such as humanoid robots, 6G networks, brain-computer interfaces, and large-scale AI data centers. The Ministry of Industry and Information Technology has released guidelines to steer development in these foundational areas. This focus represents a concerted effort by Beijing to achieve breakthroughs in core technologies and establish a leading position in the next wave of the global tech race.</p>

          <p>Several startups, including UK-based Better Dairy, are pioneering the production of lab-grown cheese using precision fermentation to create casein, the key protein in milk. These companies aim to offer a product that tastes like traditional dairy cheese while avoiding animal agriculture, but they face significant hurdles. The high cost of production, regulatory approval processes for "novel foods," and a recent decline in plant-based cheese sales present major challenges. Despite this, companies are targeting a "silent revolution" by first replacing cheese in processed foods like frozen pizzas, hoping to improve taste and eventually compete with supermarket prices.</p>
