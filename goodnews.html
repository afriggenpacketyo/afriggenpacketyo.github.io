          <p>Jim Lovell, the renowned NASA astronaut who commanded the perilous Apollo 13 mission, has passed away at the age of 97. In a statement, NASA honored his legacy of courage under pressure, which not only helped forge a path to the Moon but also continues to inspire millions today. As a veteran of four spaceflights, Lovell's most famous moment came during the 1970 Apollo 13 flight, where his calm leadership was instrumental in navigating a catastrophic in-flight emergency and bringing the crew safely back to Earth.

Rwanda has formally agreed to take in 250 individuals, providing them with support like workforce training and healthcare to help them resettle. This strategy targets migrants whose home countries refuse their return and involves other partners like Eswatini, South Sudan, Costa Rica, and Panama.

          <p>Tonia Haddix, a Missouri woman featured in the HBO documentary "Chimp Crazy," has been sentenced to 46 months in federal prison for perjury and obstruction of justice. The charges stemmed from a lawsuit filed by PETA concerning her mistreatment of several chimpanzees, including the movie-star primate Tonka. Haddix had falsely claimed Tonka died to avoid a court order to transfer him to a sanctuary, but the chimp was later discovered alive in a cage in her basement. The sentence marks the culmination of a long-running legal battle over the welfare of the animals in her care.</p>

          <p>As personal bankruptcy filings increase, it is crucial for individuals considering this option to understand the strict eligibility criteria that can lead to disqualification. For Chapter 7 bankruptcy, a primary obstacle is the "means test," which denies eligibility to those with disposable income above their state's median. Other key disqualifiers include having a recent bankruptcy discharge within a specified period, failing to complete mandatory credit counseling, or engaging in fraudulent activities like hiding assets. The article advises that if disqualified, alternatives like debt consolidation or settlement programs should be explored with a financial professional. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>For beginner investors looking to diversify their portfolios, gold remains a popular safe-haven asset, and this article outlines several accessible methods for investment. Options range from the direct ownership of physical gold, such as bars and coins, to more abstract financial instruments like gold-backed Exchange Traded Funds (ETFs) and highly speculative gold futures contracts. Another common strategy is opening a gold IRA, which allows for tax-advantaged holding of precious metals. The guide stresses the importance of understanding the unique risks and benefits of each approach, noting gold is primarily for stability, not rapid growth. (not investment advice)</p>

          <h2>Analysis Shows AI Creating Winners and Losers in Tech Advertising Sector</h2>

          <p>Artificial intelligence is significantly reshaping the digital advertising landscape, benefiting tech giants like Meta and Alphabet while creating challenges for smaller competitors. Both Meta and Google's parent company reported strong quarterly earnings, attributing their success to AI-driven efficiencies that have enhanced their advertising systems and boosted revenue. In contrast, platforms like Snap and Pinterest delivered more modest results, with Snap struggling after a flawed ad platform update. The analysis suggests that massive AI investments are solidifying the dominance of larger companies in the increasingly competitive online ad market. (not investment advice)</p>

          <h2>Gold Prices Retreat from Record Highs After White House Pledges Tariff Clarification</h2>

          <p>Gold futures fell sharply from an all-time high following a White House announcement that it would issue an executive order to clarify "misinformation" about tariffs on imported gold. The statement came after the Swiss Precious Metals Association raised alarms that a 39% U.S. tariff on Swiss goods was being incorrectly applied to gold bars, threatening to disrupt the global physical gold market. The market's immediate, negative reaction to the tariff news and its subsequent stabilization upon the White House's promise of clarification highlight the precious metal's sensitivity to trade policy developments.

          <p>Tesla has achieved a significant milestone in its robotaxi ambitions by obtaining a permit to operate a ride-hailing business across Texas. The license, granted by the state's Department of Licensing and Regulation, allows Tesla to run a "transportation network company," moving it closer to competing with services like Uber and Lyft. The company has already been conducting a limited, invitation-only pilot program in Austin with human safety supervisors present in the vehicles. This official permit represents a crucial step forward, though Tesla still faces technological hurdles and federal scrutiny over its autonomous driving systems.</p>

          <p>Actor Gina Carano and The Walt Disney Co. have reached a settlement in her lawsuit alleging she was wrongfully terminated from the Disney+ series "The Mandalorian." Carano was dismissed in 2021 after a series of controversial social media posts, and she later sued for discrimination with legal funding provided by Elon Musk. In separate statements, both parties confirmed the settlement, with Carano calling it the "best outcome" and a Lucasfilm spokesperson expressing a desire to find opportunities to work with her in the future. The terms of the agreement, which ends a high-profile legal battle, were not disclosed.</p>

          <p>Apple's stock experienced a major resurgence this week, climbing over 13% after the company committed to a $100 billion investment in U.S. manufacturing, apparently appeasing President Trump and easing investor fears over tariffs. In other major financial news, the article reports that the Trump administration is planning a potentially historic stock offering for the government-controlled mortgage giants Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac. This complex deal, which could value the companies at over $500 billion, is reportedly being discussed with the leaders of several major Wall Street banks. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>The European Union's recent sanctioning of an Indian refinery for processing Russian crude oil has raised questions about the future of EU-India trade relations. However, this article's analysis suggests the move is largely symbolic and unlikely to derail ongoing negotiations for a comprehensive free trade agreement. Experts argue that the more significant pressure on India is the threat of high U.S. tariffs, which may paradoxically strengthen India's desire for a stable economic partnership with the EU. This complex geopolitical dynamic could ultimately push the two powers closer together, despite the friction over Russia.</p>
