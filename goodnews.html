          <p>Colorado Buffaloes coach Deion Sanders has proposed a new model for compensating college football players, suggesting they should be paid directly for participating in the College Football Playoff. Sanders argues that instead of conferences receiving large payouts, the money should go to the athletes who generate the revenue, creating a more equitable system similar to NFL playoff bonuses. This idea was discussed in an interview alongside former coach Nick Saban, who also expressed concerns about the current state of Name, Image, and Likeness (NIL) deals. Both coaches agree that more structure is needed to ensure the system benefits players' long-term futures.</p>

Zhao suggested that Hong Kong's government has shown a clear willingness to embrace Web3 technologies but needs to move quickly to capitalize on the opportunity. One key recommendation he made was to expand the limited number of cryptocurrencies currently permitted for trading on licensed exchanges to foster a more dynamic market.</p>

          <p>Naomi Osaka has advanced to the third round of the US Open with a decisive 6-3, 6-1 victory over Hailey Baptiste, continuing her strong performance on the court. Her success follows a difficult period after the Montreal final, where she was criticized for her runner-up speech, an event she described as causing her to feel shame. Since then, Osaka has won eight of her last nine matches and appears to be regaining the form that led her to two previous US Open titles. She is now set to face either Daria Kasatkina or Kamilla Rakhimova as she aims for her first Grand Slam fourth-round appearance since 2021.</p>

          <h2>Upcoming Labor Day Weekend Presents Opportunity for Electric Vehicle Savings, Experts Say</h2>
          <div class="timestamp">2025-08-28 18:25:23 EDT</div>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Automotive research firm Edmunds suggests that the upcoming Labor Day weekend is an ideal time for consumers to find deals on electric vehicles, particularly leases. A significant $7,500 federal tax credit for new EV leases is set to expire on September 30, creating a window for substantial savings. With EV prices already declining due to softer demand, leasing has become a popular option, accounting for 70% of EV transactions in July. Experts recommend leasing over buying for those new to the technology, as it mitigates risks associated with rapid technological advancements and higher depreciation rates for electric cars.

          <p>As Indonesian President Prabowo Subianto cracks down on illegal palm oil plantations to reclaim deforested land, global demand remains a key driver of the industry's environmental impact. This opinion piece argues that China, as a major importer, is uniquely positioned to influence Indonesia's palm oil sector toward more sustainable practices. By leveraging its market power, China can encourage responsible sourcing and help shift the economic incentives away from destructive deforestation. This approach could help rewrite the future of an industry that is crucial to Indonesia's economy but has come at a significant environmental cost.</p>
