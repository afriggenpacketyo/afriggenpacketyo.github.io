          <h2>Shetland Islands Consider Faroe Islands-Inspired Undersea Tunnels to Replace Aging Ferries</h2>
          <div class="timestamp">2025-07-15 01:07:31 EDT</div>
        </div>
        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>The Shetland Islands Council is advancing plans to construct undersea tunnels to connect its main island with outlying isles like Unst, drawing inspiration from the successful infrastructure projects in the Faroe Islands. Proponents argue the tunnels would revitalize island life, boost the economy, and provide a more reliable alternative to the current aging and costly ferry system. The project, likely funded through borrowing and user tolls, is seen as crucial for industries like salmon farming and the UK's most northerly spaceport. While some residents have concerns about preserving the islands' character, many see it as essential for future viability.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Norway has become a global leader in the transition to electric vehicles, with EVs now accounting for nearly 90% of new car sales and up to 40% of all passenger cars in cities like Oslo. This remarkable shift has been driven by consistent government policies over many years, including significant tax exemptions for EVs and progressively higher taxes on gasoline and diesel cars. The country has also heavily invested in a robust public charging infrastructure, which has helped alleviate range anxiety and make EV ownership a practical and popular choice for consumers, resulting in cleaner air and quieter cities.</p>

          <h2>Stockholm Suburb to Host World's Largest Wooden Construction Project</h2>
          <div class="timestamp">2025-07-15 01:02:40 EDT</div>
        </div>
        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>A district in Stockholm named Sickla is being redeveloped into what is being called the "world's largest wooden city," with a $1.25 billion investment in homes, offices, and shops built primarily from cross-laminated timber. The project aims to showcase sustainable construction, as timber buildings produce significantly lower carbon emissions compared to traditional steel and concrete structures. Developers and architects highlight that building with wood is also faster and creates a more aesthetically pleasing environment for residents. The first residential block is set for completion by the end of 2025, with thousands more homes planned for the coming years.</p>

          <h2>Nvidia to Resume Sales of H20 AI Chips to China Following U.S. Government Assurances</h2>

          <p>Nvidia announced it expects to soon resume sales of its H20 artificial intelligence chips to China, after receiving assurances from the U.S. government that it will grant the necessary export licenses. Sales of the chip, which was specifically designed to comply with earlier export controls, were halted in April, impacting Nvidia's market share in China. The potential reversal follows high-level discussions between Nvidia's CEO and the Trump administration, and it marks a significant development in the ongoing tech trade tensions between Washington and Beijing. The move is expected to be a major boost for Nvidia and provide Chinese firms with continued access to advanced AI hardware.</p>

          <p>Chinese private aerospace company Space Pioneer has successfully completed a critical ground-based stress test for its Tianlong-3 rocket. The test simulated key mission phases for the rocket's nine-engine first stage, which successfully withstood the enormous forces involved in launch and flight. This achievement is a significant step forward for the company, coming a year after a previous static-fire test ended in an explosive mishap where the rocket unexpectedly lifted off and crashed. The success demonstrates progress in developing a reusable rocket, a crucial capability for China's ambitions in the commercial space launch market.</p>

          <p>Meta founder Mark Zuckerberg has announced that the company will invest hundreds of billions of dollars to build enormous, multi-gigawatt AI data centers in the United States. These facilities, named Prometheus and Hyperion, are part of Meta's intensive effort to develop "superintelligence," or AI that can outperform humans. The first center is expected to be online in 2026, with one of the sites planned to cover an area nearly the size of Manhattan. This massive investment underscores the immense computational power and resources required for cutting-edge AI development, though it also raises concerns about the extreme energy and water consumption of such large-scale data centers.</p>

          <p>A U.S. appeals court has issued a temporary stay, blocking the Trump administration's plan to terminate Temporary Protected Status (TPS) for thousands of people from Afghanistan. The administration had intended to end the protections, which shield migrants from deportation and provide work permits, arguing that conditions in Afghanistan had improved. However, advocacy groups sued, and the court's ruling provides a brief reprieve while the case is considered, preventing the immediate revocation of status for some 11,700 Afghans. This legal battle is part of a wider conflict over the administration's efforts to curtail immigration programs established under previous presidents.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>In a first-of-its-kind study, researchers at Tel Aviv University have found evidence that animals can react to sounds produced by plants. The experiments showed that female moths avoided laying their eggs on tomato plants that were emitting high-frequency sounds associated with stress, such as dehydration. While the sounds are outside the range of human hearing, they can be perceived by many insects and some mammals. This discovery opens up a new field of research into a potential hidden ecosystem of acoustic communication between plants and animals, which could influence behaviors like pollination, feeding, and seeking shelter.</p>

The team, led by retired NASA astronaut Peggy Whitson, includes crewmates from India, Poland, and Hungary, marking the first time in over 40 years their nations have sent astronauts to space. The crew spent 18 days aboard the ISS conducting scientific experiments in a mission facilitated by SpaceX's Crew Dragon capsule. This fourth Axiom mission highlights the growing role of private enterprise in human spaceflight and the increasing international collaboration in low-Earth orbit.</p>

          <p>Scientists at Dalian University of Technology in China have developed a new manufacturing technique that could significantly improve the performance of aircraft engines, a critical area where China has historically lagged. The method involves rapidly cooling superalloy turbine discs, a core engine component that must withstand extreme temperatures and stress. By enhancing the quality and durability of these discs, the breakthrough could boost the power, efficiency, and lifespan of China's domestically produced jet engines. This development is particularly vital as China works to create advanced power plants for its next-generation fighter jets currently under development.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>The U.S. Department of Justice has formally recommended that the Supreme Court decline to hear an appeal from Ghislaine Maxwell, who is serving a 20-year prison sentence for her role in Jeffrey Epstein's sex trafficking scheme. Maxwell's lawyers argued that a co-conspirator clause in Epstein's 2007 non-prosecution agreement should have barred her prosecution. However, the DOJ countered that the agreement was limited to a specific Florida district and that Maxwell was, at most, an incidental beneficiary. This move by the DOJ makes it highly unlikely that the high court will take up the case, leaving Maxwell's conviction in place.</p>
