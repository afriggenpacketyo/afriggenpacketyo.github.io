          <p>Dr. Andrew Freeman, a cardiologist, recommends oatmeal as a go-to breakfast for maintaining a healthy heart, emphasizing its high fiber content and nutritional benefits. He suggests preparing oatmeal with water instead of milk or butter to keep it low in calories, and adding berries, flax seeds, and walnuts for extra fiber and health benefits. Oatmeal contains beta-glucan, a dietary fiber that can help maintain healthy cholesterol levels and lower blood glucose levels. Freeman advises avoiding instant oatmeal due to its processed nature and added sugars, and he recommends limiting or avoiding eggs, muffins, and pastries for breakfast due to their high cholesterol and sugar content.</p>

          <p>President Donald Trump is pushing for the early use of an upgraded Air Force One, potentially before his term concludes, which raises questions about whether necessary security modifications can be completed in time. Discussions are underway regarding retrofitting a luxury jet acquired from the Qatari royal family to meet presidential standards, but integrating security capabilities akin to the current Air Force One could lead to delays and cost overruns. To expedite the process, some security precautions may be omitted, prompting concerns about the president's safety and the integrity of classified communications.</p>

However, profit-taking after earnings reports and ongoing tensions between President Trump and Elon Musk created volatility.
