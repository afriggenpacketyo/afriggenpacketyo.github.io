          <p>A popular Taiwanese YouTuber, known as Gym Boss, is encouraging Taiwanese citizens to visit Shanghai and experience life there firsthand. Chen Chih-han, once a critic of Beijing, now describes Shanghai as a "super first-rate city" after a self-funded tour. His aim is to challenge the prevailing political narratives in Taiwan by offering an unfiltered view of mainland Chinese society. Chen's perspective shifted after observing the mainland through social media, revealing a gap between online sentiment and official messaging in Taiwan, leading him to encourage others to see for themselves.</p>

          <p>U.S. and Chinese officials have reached a framework agreement on trade after high-level talks in London, with the deal now subject to approval from President Trump and President Xi Jinping. The agreement aims to implement the Geneva consensus and the recent call between the two presidents, according to U.S. Commerce Secretary Howard Lutnick. While the framework signals a commitment to de-escalate tensions and continue dialogue, the extent of concrete agreements or substantive breakthroughs remains uncertain. The fact that both sides need to brief their leaders suggests that some disagreements or unresolved details still require internal discussion. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>Germany is expanding its infrastructure to import liquefied natural gas (LNG) from various sources, including the United States, as part of its efforts to reduce dependence on Russian gas. This move aligns with broader European strategies to diversify energy supplies and enhance energy security. The increased import capacity will enable Germany to access alternative gas sources and mitigate potential disruptions in Russian gas deliveries.
