          <p>A federal judge has temporarily blocked President Trump's move to prevent foreign students from traveling to Harvard University. The decision came hours after Harvard called the policy illegal retaliation for the university's rejection of White House demands. The university argued that the action was a vendetta against Harvard and violated its First Amendment rights. The Trump administration had sought to halt billions in federal funding to the school, citing concerns about antisemitism on campus. </p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>This article explores the growing trend of food products with fewer ingredients, driven by concerns about ultra-processed foods (UPF). More retailers and brands are offering simpler items, but nutritionists caution against sacrificing fortified nutrients for shorter ingredient lists. The article discusses the debate over whether all ultra-processed food is inherently bad and whether consumers are being misled. It also highlights how food brands are adapting to meet the demand for less processed products while justifying their higher prices. </p>

          <p>China has conducted tests on core components of quantum-based network technology during a space flight, marking a significant step towards building an integrated space-ground system for ultra-secure communications. The tests involved a laser module and a phase encoding device on board a Yuanxingzhe-1 rocket. The experiment aimed to assess the modules' robustness against the stresses of rocket ascent, such as vibration and radiation. This effort is part of China's broader strategy to develop quantum secure direct communication (QSDC) networks. </p>

          <p>The California Department of Motor Vehicles (DMV) is warning residents about a fake online advertisement on social media that poses as the DMV and offers discounted vehicle registration renewal services. The deceptive advertisement asks for personal information and payment through unofficial channels, such as Cash App. The DMV emphasizes that it never requests personal information or payment through social media or transaction applications. Residents are advised to renew their vehicle registration directly through the official DMV website, at a DMV kiosk, or by making an appointment at a DMV office. </p>

Official papers show the prime minister's frustration over slow progress obtaining the "wonder drug." Despite penicillin being a British discovery, the US was far ahead in production. Sufficient supplies were obtained, mostly from the US, but only for battle casualties, not for the general public until 1946. </p>

          <p>Beyonc√©'s 'Cowboy Carter' tour dazzled a nearly sold-out stadium in London, showcasing her new country era with elaborate costumes and a high-energy performance. The show, lasting nearly three hours, featured a 40-song setlist heavily drawn from her acclaimed 'Cowboy Carter' album. Despite the spectacle, slow ticket sales and high prices have been a topic of discussion, with some fans feeling short-changed by dynamic pricing. The performance paid homage to black performers segregated from the country scene and blended Beyonc√©'s biggest hits with her new country tracks. </p>
