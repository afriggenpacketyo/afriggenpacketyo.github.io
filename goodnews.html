          <p>Two Delta Connection planes were involved in a low-speed collision on a taxiway at New York's LaGuardia Airport. The incident occurred when an arriving flight struck a stationary aircraft awaiting departure, causing damage to the wing of one plane and the fuselage of the other. A flight attendant sustained a minor injury and was hospitalized, but airport operations were not significantly impacted. The Federal Aviation Administration and the National Transportation Safety Board are investigating the event to determine the cause of the collision.</p>

          <p>PepsiCo is accelerating its transition to natural colorants for its food and beverage products, including popular brands like Gatorade, Cheetos, and Mountain Dew. The company is responding to growing consumer demand for ingredients perceived as more natural, moving away from petroleum-based synthetic dyes. This multi-year process involves significant research to find stable, flavor-neutral alternatives such as paprika, turmeric, and carob powder. The shift presents challenges in maintaining the iconic vibrant colors and tastes that consumers expect from these products.</p>

          <p>Linda Murphy, a Massachusetts woman who battled ALS, has become a viral sensation after her death for the witty and heartfelt obituary she wrote for herself. In the tribute, she humorously reflected on her life, her love for parties, and the struggles of living with her illness, including her self-diagnosed condition. Murphy, who had previously written a book about surviving breast cancer, used her final words to encourage kindness and fun. Instead of flowers, she requested that people buy scratch tickets to give to strangers, aiming to spread happiness as her final act.</p>

          <p>Fair Isaac Corp., the company behind the FICO credit score, has announced a significant change to its business model that will allow it to license scores directly to mortgage lenders. This move, which could bypass credit bureaus like Experian, TransUnion, and Equifax, aims to eliminate markups and give lenders more choice. Following the announcement, Fair Isaac's stock surged over 20%, while shares of the major credit bureaus fell. The change is being framed as a pro-consumer move by regulators, intended to make the mortgage market more competitive and transparent. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>Actress Sarah Jessica Parker has reflected on the decision to conclude the "Sex and the City" revival, "And Just Like That," stating it was a respectful choice to end the series while it was still creatively strong. While suggesting a return isn't entirely impossible, she has shifted focus to her book imprint, SJP Lit. Parker recently selected "I Am You" by Victoria Redel, a historical novel about two female artists in 1600s Amsterdam, for her book club. She praised the novel for its skillful blend of historical fact and fiction, exploring themes of ambition, artistry, and identity.</p>

          <h2>Tesla Reports 7% Rise in Quarterly Deliveries Ahead of EV Tax Credit Expiration</h2>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Tesla announced a 7% year-over-year increase in vehicle deliveries for the third quarter, reporting 497,099 units delivered. This growth comes just as a key federal tax credit for electric vehicle buyers in the U.S. expired. The delivery numbers slightly exceeded analyst expectations, though production saw a minor decline compared to the same period last year. The results were influenced by a sales slump in Europe, which was partially offset by a rush of U.S. buyers aiming to capitalize on the tax credit before it ended. (not investment advice)</p>

          <h2>Premier League Considers Replacing Profit and Sustainability Rules with New System</h2>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>The Premier League is considering replacing its current Profit and Sustainability Rules (PSR), which have been criticized for limiting club investment. Chief Executive Richard Masters confirmed that discussions are underway about adopting an alternative system, likely a squad cost ratio (SCR) model similar to UEFA's regulations. The proposed SCR system would allow clubs to spend up to 85% of their total revenue on squad-related costs, aiming to align with European standards while still encouraging investment. A final decision on the potential changes is expected to be made at a league meeting in November.</p>

          <p>For the eighth year in a row, Finland has been ranked as the happiest country in the world, according to the annual World Happiness Report. Experts suggest this consistent ranking is less about daily joy and more about a deep sense of contentment and life satisfaction among its citizens. Key factors contributing to this include a strong social safety net, universal access to high-quality public services like libraries, a high degree of trust in institutions, and a close connection to nature. Finns themselves are often skeptical of the title, viewing their state as one of quiet contentment rather than overt happiness.</p>

          <p>An article in The Atlantic details how different forms of exercise can be tailored to improve specific aspects of mental and emotional health. While only a quarter of American adults meet federal fitness guidelines, the science shows that even moderate activity provides significant benefits by positively affecting mood-regulating neurochemicals. Aerobic exercise is particularly effective for combating low moods, yoga helps manage stress, and strength training can boost self-confidence. The article advises starting slowly to build a habit and cautions against exercise addiction, where the pursuit of fitness becomes detrimental to overall well-being.</p>

          <p>Hurricane Imelda has been downgraded to a post-tropical storm after striking Bermuda as a Category 2 hurricane, bringing powerful winds and heavy rain to the island. While a tropical storm warning remained in effect, the worst of the weather has passed, and there were no immediate reports of significant damage. The system is now moving farther into the Atlantic Ocean and is expected to continue weakening gradually. However, swells generated by Imelda and the remnants of Hurricane Humberto are still expected to cause life-threatening surf and rip currents along the U.S. East Coast.</p>

This tool is designed to provide customers with personalized product recommendations and streamline purchasing through conversational chat.

This move represents Meta's strategy to monetize its significant investments in generative AI beyond its core advertising business.</p>

          <p>A team of researchers from Purdue University believes they may have located the lost aircraft of famed aviator Amelia Earhart. They have identified a 'visual anomaly' in a lagoon on the remote Pacific island of Nikumaroro, which has been visible in imagery since 1938, a year after her disappearance. The team is launching an expedition in November to investigate the object, using sonar and magnetometers before attempting to dredge and identify it. If confirmed to be Earhart's Electra 10E plane, the university hopes to bring the historic aircraft back to its campus in Indiana.</p>
