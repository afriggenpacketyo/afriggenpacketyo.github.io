          <h2>China Develops New Superalloy Technique to Advance Aircraft Engine Manufacturing</h2>
          <div class="timestamp">2025-07-14 21:00:13 EDT</div>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Researchers at China's Dalian University of Technology have developed a new manufacturing technique that could solve long-standing issues with the country's aircraft engines. The method involves rapidly cooling forged turbine discs made of superalloy, a core engine component that must withstand extreme conditions. This innovation could significantly improve the performance, power, and durability of China's domestically produced jet engines, a critical step for the development of its next-generation fighter aircraft and a key area where it has historically lagged behind Western nations.</p>

          <p>A man in Victorville, California, has been arrested after leaving a teddy bear that appeared to be made of human skin outside a gas station, prompting a significant emergency response. The object, which was created by a South Carolina artist and sold on Etsy, was determined by the coroner's office not to contain any human remains. Authorities arrested Hector Corona Villanueva for causing a false emergency report and planting evidence, stating that such pranks waste valuable resources and can delay responses to genuine crises.</p>
