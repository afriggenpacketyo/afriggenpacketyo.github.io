          <p>Poland's Iga Swiatek won her first Wimbledon title, defeating American Amanda Anisimova in a completely one-sided final that lasted just 57 minutes. The 24-year-old Swiatek won 6-0, 6-0, a rare 'double bagel' victory not seen in a women's Wimbledon final since 1911. While it was Anisimova's first Grand Slam final appearance after a career break, her nerves were apparent through numerous unforced errors. This victory marks the sixth major title for Swiatek, who has now won on all three major court surfaces.</p>

          <p>Commissioners in Palm Beach County, Florida, have unanimously approved a measure to rename a section of Southern Boulevard as "President Donald J. Trump Boulevard." The roadway is the primary route President Trump's motorcade uses to travel between Palm Beach International Airport and his Mar-a-Lago estate. This move places Trump alongside other former presidents, such as George H.W. Bush and Barack Obama, who also have roadways named after them within the same county.</p>

          <p>England hooker Jamie George has been called up to the British and Irish Lions squad for their tour in Australia. The move comes after fellow hooker Luke Cowan-Dickie suffered a suspected concussion during a match, making him a doubt for the first Test against Australia. George, a two-time Lions tourist, was set to co-captain England in Argentina but will now join the prestigious touring squad in Brisbane. His selection is seen as a significant opportunity for him and his replacements on the England team.</p>

          <p>Adolfo Macias, the notorious Ecuadorian gang leader known as 'Fito,' has agreed to be extradited to the United States to face charges of cocaine and weapons smuggling. Macias, head of the 'Los Choneros' gang, was recaptured in June after a high-profile prison escape that unleashed a severe wave of gang violence across Ecuador. His escape prompted President Daniel Noboa to declare a state of 'internal armed conflict' and deploy the military to combat the powerful drug mafias.</p>

          <p>According to a negotiation expert, obtaining a salary increase is typically not a one-time event but rather a process that unfolds over several weeks. It is advised to initiate compensation discussions during mid-year check-ins, as annual review budgets are often predetermined. The key to success involves being patient, documenting conversations, clearly communicating your goals, and ensuring a follow-up meeting is scheduled to maintain momentum and hold both parties accountable for a resolution.</p>
