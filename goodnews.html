          <h2>UK Government Modifies Welfare Reform Bill After Facing Backlash</h2>
          <div class="timestamp">2025-06-29 07:20:59 EDT</div>
        </div>
        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>UK Health Secretary Wes Streeting acknowledged the Labour government mishandled the rollout of its welfare reform bill, stating that significant concessions have put them in a "better position" to pass it. The government was forced into a major U-turn after over 120 of its own MPs threatened to rebel against the planned cuts, which were aimed at saving ¬£5 billion annually. Critics argued the initial proposals would harm disabled people by making it harder to claim Personal Independence Payment (Pip). Following the backlash, the government agreed to limit the cuts to new claimants only and will conduct a review of the Pip assessment process, securing the support of many rebel MPs for the upcoming vote.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Amid market uncertainties despite the S&P 500 reaching new highs, some investors are turning to dividend-paying stocks for more stable returns. This article highlights three such stocks favored by top-performing Wall Street analysts: McDonald's (MCD), EPR Properties (EPR), and Halliburton (HAL). McDonald's is noted for its 49-year history of increasing dividends and strong brand power. EPR Properties, a real estate investment trust focused on experiential venues, recently increased its dividend and is seen as poised for growth. Halliburton is considered resilient due to its significant international revenue, which may not be fully reflected in its current stock price. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>A trend among younger bar patrons, particularly Gen Z, of closing their tab after each drink is causing frustration for bartenders. While some bartenders find the practice "unequivocally annoying" as it consumes valuable time during busy shifts, they also acknowledge a potential upside. This pay-as-you-go method can help customers better monitor their alcohol consumption and spending, promoting fiscal responsibility. The article notes that this habit might also stem from concerns about forgetting open tabs or credit cards, and it touches upon the rising transaction fees that multiple small payments can generate for bar owners.</p>

          <p>Fifteen years after its initial public offering on June 29, 2010, Tesla's stock has seen a monumental rise, turning a $10,000 investment into nearly $3 million. The company has grown from a niche electric sports car maker into one of the world's most valuable public companies, driven by the success of its Model Y and Model 3 vehicles. However, CEO Elon Musk now asserts that the company's future value lies not in car sales but in solving autonomous driving and developing humanoid robots. Despite this vision, the stock has underperformed in 2025 amid sluggish sales, increased competition, and concerns over Musk's unpredictable behavior and political entanglements.

The liquid-fuel rocket lifted off from Tanegashima Space Center, concluding a long and successful career supporting Japan's space development efforts since its debut. The H2A series, developed by Mitsubishi Heavy Industries and the Japan Aerospace Exploration Agency (JAXA), has been a reliable workhorse for the nation.

After lengthy negotiations with GOP leadership, they secured a promised vote on an amendment and agreed to advance the legislation, avoiding the need for a tie-breaking vote from the Vice President.

          <p>A century after a devastating earthquake struck Santa Barbara in 1925, experts say the event still holds important lessons for California's seismic preparedness. The quake, estimated at magnitude 6.5 to 6.8, exposed the deadly vulnerability of unreinforced brick buildings, a danger that took decades for many cities to address with mandatory retrofitting laws. The event also highlighted the risk to homes not bolted to their foundations, a common issue that persists today. Historically, the earthquake prompted Santa Barbara to adopt new building codes and famously reshape its downtown with a mandatory Spanish Colonial Revival architectural style, creating the distinctive look it's known for today.</p>

The article argues that when global stability is at risk, China prioritizes its own economic interests and relations with the West over its alliance with Iran. This cautious approach suggests that the "no limits" partnership between these nations is more transactional than ideological and may not be as robust as often portrayed.</p>
