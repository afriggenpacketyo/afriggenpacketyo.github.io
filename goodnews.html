        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>The predictable four-year price cycle of bitcoin, historically centered around its "halving" event, appears to be breaking down due to fundamental market shifts. Previously, bitcoin would rally to new highs post-halving, but the recent approval of spot Bitcoin ETFs in the U.S. caused a price surge before the event. This influx of institutional investment, combined with a more supportive regulatory environment, is altering the cryptocurrency's behavior. Analysts suggest that the era of massive 80% price crashes may be over, replaced by more stable, macro-correlated movements. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>For individuals finding debt consolidation unaffordable due to high interest rates, several alternative strategies exist to regain financial control. Experts suggest first contacting creditors directly to negotiate lower interest rates or more flexible repayment terms. Other options include debt settlement, where a lump sum is paid to clear a reduced total, or transferring balances to a 0% introductory APR credit card. For those needing more structured help, non-profit credit counseling agencies can create manageable debt management plans and provide essential financial education. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>Jim Cramer's CNBC Investing Club is purchasing shares of Texas Roadhouse, viewing the recent post-earnings stock drop as a buying opportunity. The restaurant chain reported strong comparable sales growth, driven by increased customer traffic, indicating continued brand popularity despite menu price increases. However, the stock fell because rising commodity costs, particularly for beef, pressured profit margins and led analysts to lower future earnings forecasts. The club believes the core business remains strong and that the company is well-positioned for future growth, including accelerated expansion. (not investment advice)</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>After a significant surge over the past two years, the price of gold could see a temporary decline, offering a potential buying opportunity for investors. One key factor is cooling inflation; since gold is often used as an inflation hedge, a decrease in the inflation rate could lead to a corresponding drop in its price. Similarly, an easing of geopolitical tensions, which have historically driven demand for safe-haven assets, could also cause its value to retreat. A combination of these factors might reduce overall investor demand, creating downward pressure on the currently high prices. (not investment advice)</p>

Discovered last month, the high-speed comet is moving at 130,000 mph and poses no threat to Earth. Hubble's observations helped refine the size of its icy core to no more than 3.5 miles across, revealing a teardrop-shaped dust plume around its nucleus. The comet, which originated from another star system, will make its closest approach to the sun in late October before continuing its journey.</p>

          <p>Archaeologists from East Carolina University have discovered four shipwrecks at a historic site in North Carolina, one of which is believed to be a Spanish privateer from 1748. Wood samples suggest the vessel, potentially the 'La Fortuna,' was built with materials from Spanish Caribbean colonies. The ship famously exploded during an attack on the colonial port of Brunswick during King George's War. The team has recovered over 40 timbers from the wreck for conservation and further study, aiming to preserve the remains from erosion and better understand the region's colonial maritime history.</p>

          <p>Following the launch of the advanced GPT-5 model, OpenAI CEO Sam Altman stated the company will continue to prioritize growth and investment in training and computing power, even if it means operating at a loss. Despite annual recurring revenue being on track to exceed $20 billion, the company is not yet profitable due to the high costs of developing its AI models. Altman emphasized that as long as the models are rapidly improving, it is rational to run a loss. This strategy is supported by investors, with OpenAI reportedly in talks for a stock sale at a valuation around $500 billion.</p>

          <p>Byron Allen's Allen Media Group has agreed to sell 10 of its network-affiliated television stations to Gray Media in a deal valued at $171 million. The sale includes stations in markets across Alabama, Indiana, Louisiana, and Kentucky and is part of a strategic retrenchment for Allen's company. After a period of rapid expansion aimed at becoming the largest independent TV operator, the company faced significant debt in a challenging broadcast television market. Allen Media Group continues to own other assets, including the Weather Channel, while Gray Media expands its presence.</p>

          <p>German football club Bayern Munich has altered its partnership with Rwanda, ending the commercial sponsorship aspect that promoted the country's tourism. The move follows months of pressure and criticism related to Rwanda's alleged support for the M23 rebel group in the Democratic Republic of Congo. The new arrangement will now focus exclusively on football development through the club's youth academy in Kigali, rather than displaying "Visit Rwanda" advertising. The club had previously sent employees to monitor the situation after receiving a letter from DR Congo's foreign minister.</p>

          <p>The competition for control of NHS landlord Assura is escalating as a UK regulator steps up its investigation into a proposed takeover. Primary Health Properties (PHP) had its £1.7bn deal to acquire Assura put on hold by the Competition and Markets Authority over concerns it could reduce competition. Meanwhile, U.S. private equity firm KKR, the rival bidder, is urging Assura's board to accept its slightly higher all-cash offer, arguing it faces no such regulatory hurdles. Assura, which owns over 600 medical properties across the UK, stated its board still supports PHP's offer.</p>
