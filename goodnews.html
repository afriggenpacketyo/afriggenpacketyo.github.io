          <p>House Speaker Mike Johnson voiced his hope that President Trump and Elon Musk could reconcile after their recent public fallout. Johnson believes it's in the country's interest for everyone to collaborate, downplaying Musk's criticisms of the GOP-led spending package. Musk had previously called the bill a "disgusting abomination" that would lead to exploding federal deficits. Johnson defended the bill, stating that it was crafted to assist hardworking Americans rather than to please the world's wealthiest individual.</p>

          <p>A U.S. marshal in Arizona was briefly detained by Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE) agents after being mistakenly identified as someone they were seeking. The deputy marshal matched the general description of the subject and was detained at a federal building in Tucson before his identity was quickly confirmed by other law enforcement officers. This incident occurs amid pressure on ICE from the White House to increase arrests, with reports suggesting a target of 3,000 arrests per day. The administration appears to be shifting from targeting suspected gang members to more generalized detentions of undocumented immigrants.</p>

Yusuf initially resigned, citing exhaustion after 11 months in the role, but returned two days later to lead the party's unit focused on identifying spending cuts at councils. Tice insisted the party knows "exactly what it is doing" and that the reorganization was necessary due to the demanding nature of the chairman's position.
