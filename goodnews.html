          <h2>Financial Planning Icon Ric Edelman Says Traditional 60-40 Portfolio is Obsolete</h2>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Ric Edelman, former head of Edelman Financial Engines, argues that the classic 60-40 portfolio is no longer sufficient for retirement planning due to increasing longevity. He asserts that individuals are living longer than ever, necessitating a greater allocation to equities to ensure financial security throughout retirement. Edelman suggests that investors should consider allocating 70% to 80% of their portfolio to stocks to mitigate the risk of outliving their savings. The article emphasizes the need for investors to adapt their strategies to account for longer lifespans and potential advancements in health technology.</p>

          <p>Kendrick Lamar and SZA's co-headlining Grand National Tour balances both artists' strengths, intertwining Lamar's introspective intensity with SZA's exuberant moodiness. The New York Times article describes their performance at MetLife Stadium as a dynamic interplay of contrasting styles, where Lamar grapples with his career arc and recent controversies while SZA explores themes of spiritual rebirth. The show highlights Lamar's shift towards anthemic songs and SZA's ability to extract joy from drama, creating a complex and engaging concert experience. Despite their differing approaches, the tour underscores the power of competing visions of vengeance and healing coexisting side by side.</p>

          <p>President Trump intends to sign an executive order aimed at discouraging the criminal enforcement of regulatory offenses, with the goal of reducing the burden on small businesses. The order would require agencies to publicly list regulatory violations that could lead to criminal charges and provide guidance on when violators would be referred for prosecution. The order would also discourage prosecutors from pursuing charges not on the lists or those that do not require proof of criminal intent. The article notes that the order will not apply to immigration or national security matters.</p>
