        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Sig Hansen, the veteran captain from the television series "Deadliest Catch," has admitted that his perspective on retirement is changing due to a growing fear of his own mortality. After decades on the treacherous Bering Sea, the 59-year-old says the loss of fellow fishermen and his own health scares have made him more fearful each time he goes out. Hansen explained that his priorities are shifting towards spending more time with his wife and four grandchildren. While not ready to retire immediately, he acknowledged that the call of home is becoming stronger than the call of the sea.</p>

          <p>Ukraine's independent anti-corruption bodies, NABU and SAPO, have exposed a significant graft scheme involving the procurement of military drones at inflated prices. A sitting lawmaker, local officials, and national guard personnel are accused of taking kickbacks of up to 30% on state contracts, with four people arrested. The announcement came just two days after the agencies' independence was restored by parliament following public protests against a government move to curb their powers. President Volodymyr Zelenskiy praised the investigation, emphasizing a "zero tolerance" policy for corruption.</p>

          <p>The nonprofit organization Black People Will Swim is working to combat a legacy of aquatic segregation and save lives by making swimming lessons more accessible to Black communities. Founder Paulana Lamonier started the group to address the stark statistic that Black people are significantly more likely to drown than their white counterparts, a disparity rooted in historical exclusion from public pools. The organization provides lessons and aims to create a ripple effect of more Black swim instructors and lifeguards. The initiative highlights a public health crisis and a determined effort to ensure everyone has a safe connection to water.</p>

          <p>Global pop star Dua Lipa has been granted Kosovo citizenship in a ceremony hosted by President Vjosa Osmani. Born in London to Kosovan-Albanian parents, Lipa has often spoken of her deep connection to the country where she lived for a period as a child. President Osmani hailed her as an iconic cultural figure who has carried Kosovo's story with pride on the world stage. Lipa, who now holds British, Albanian, and Kosovan citizenship, said the honor "completes the duality I have always had within" and means a great deal to her and her family.</p>

          <p>Florida has emerged as a new leader in solar energy, adding more utility-scale solar capacity than California last year despite a state policy that removed climate change from official consideration. This growth is primarily driven by large utilities like Florida Power & Light, which are building solar farms because it has become cheaper than natural gas. Streamlined state regulations for projects under 75 megawatts have also accelerated development. However, the future faces headwinds from the rollback of federal tax credits and increasing constraints on the state's power grid. (not investment advice)</p>

The loss in Sydney denied the Lions a 3-0 series whitewash, but Farrell emphasized that the overall achievement should be celebrated. He praised the team's togetherness and the outstanding rugby played throughout the tour, culminating in the series-clinching victory in Melbourne the previous week. Farrell acknowledged that Australia was the better team on the night in the final, rain-soaked match.</p>

          <p>Ferrari's Charles Leclerc delivered a stunning performance to claim a surprise pole position at the Hungarian Grand Prix, narrowly beating the favored McLaren drivers. Leclerc, who had not seemed competitive until the final qualifying session, pipped Oscar Piastri by a mere 0.026 seconds. McLaren's Lando Norris qualified third, while their main rival, Red Bull's Max Verstappen, struggled with his car's balance and could only manage eighth place. Leclerc expressed his own shock and delight after the lap, calling it one of the best pole positions of his career given he did not expect it.</p>

          <p>Berkshire Hathaway reported a significant drop in second-quarter profit, largely due to a $3.76 billion writedown on its investment in Kraft Heinz. The conglomerate's operating earnings, a measure favored by CEO Warren Buffett, saw a smaller decline to $11.16 billion as its diverse businesses like BNSF railroad and its utility group performed well. Buffett has previously admitted overpaying for the food company, which has struggled with changing consumer tastes. The company's massive cash reserve dipped slightly to $344.1 billion, with Buffett still finding few attractive large-scale acquisition deals. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>A new study indicates that aligning your fitness routine with your personality type could help you enjoy workouts more and stick with them longer. Researchers found correlations between the "Big Five" personality traits and exercise preferences. For example, extroverts tend to enjoy high-intensity group classes and team sports, while more conscientious individuals may prefer goal-oriented activities like marathon training. The findings suggest that if a particular exercise isn't enjoyable, trying a different type that better suits one's personality could be a more effective approach to fitness.</p>

          <p>A newly declassified annex from special counsel John Durham's report has further weakened claims by National Intelligence Director Tulsi Gabbard of a "deep state" conspiracy against Donald Trump. The document confirms that emails used by Trump supporters as evidence of a plot by Hillary Clinton's campaign were likely fabricated by Russian intelligence. This finding contradicts the narrative that U.S. officials manufactured intelligence about Russian interference in the 2016 election. The revelation presents a significant challenge to Gabbard's ongoing efforts to prove a "treasonous conspiracy" by the Obama administration.</p>
