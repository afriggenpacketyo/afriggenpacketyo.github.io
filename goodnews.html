        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Two viral videos on Chinese social media have sparked a discussion about the erosion of traditional values of respect for the elderly. The videos depict incidents where young people refused to give up their seats on public transportation to elderly individuals, leading to confrontations. This has raised concerns about the decline of Confucian ideals like filial piety in modern, fast-paced Chinese society. The incidents highlight a tension between traditional values and the pressures of contemporary life, as well as questions about empathy and societal norms.</p>

          <p>Columbia University activist Mahmoud Khalil was released from ICE custody in Louisiana after a federal judge granted bail, a decision criticized by the Trump administration. Khalil, a green card holder married to an American citizen, had been detained for over three months. The judge's order superseded an immigration judge's denial of asylum and order to remain detained. Conditions for Khalil's release include surrendering his passport and restricting domestic travel, as his attorneys argue he is being punished for speech protected by the First Amendment.</p>

Stylists suggest that wearing shorts to the office depends heavily on the context and the formality of the workplace, with tailored shorts being more acceptable than casual styles. While some companies trust employees to dress professionally and comfortably, others maintain stricter guidelines, especially for client-facing roles. Personal comfort and expression are increasingly valued, but navigating office dress codes requires careful consideration.</p>
