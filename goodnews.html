          <p>This BBC article discusses the anticipated departure of Carlo Ancelotti from Real Madrid, potentially to coach the Brazilian national team, and the expected succession of Xabi Alonso. Internal issues, including tensions between key players like Vinicius and Mbappe, have reportedly destabilized the team's dynamics. Ancelotti's request for reinforcements was rejected, leading to friction with the club's management. Discussions with the Brazilian Football Confederation have intensified, and Ancelotti seeks a resolution to his contract situation with Real Madrid. His assistant, Davide Ancelotti, is also expected to pursue his own head coaching career.</p>

          <p>This CBS News article reports that a Soviet-era spacecraft, Kosmos 482, launched in 1972, is expected to re-enter Earth's atmosphere. Due to a rocket malfunction, the spacecraft never reached Venus and has been orbiting Earth for over five decades. Experts predict the object, potentially weighing over 1,000 pounds, could partially survive re-entry. While the risk of it hitting someone is low, the article notes the increasing concern of space debris impacting aircraft and highlights recent incidents of space junk crashing back to Earth.</p>

Scientists believe that the ability to produce rhythm predates humans. Chimpanzees use drumming as a way of socially checking in and each chimp has its own individual signature, or pattern of beats. The research also showed that chimps from different regions of Africa drum with distinctly different rhythms.</p>
