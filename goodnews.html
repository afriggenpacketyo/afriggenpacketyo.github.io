          <p>SpaceX's Super Heavy-Starship launched for its ninth test flight from Boca Chica, Texas, featuring upgrades after previous failures. The Super Heavy first stage successfully separated from the Starship, aiming for a splashdown in the Gulf, while the Starship targeted the Indian Ocean. The mission tested a previously flown Super Heavy stage and aimed for a steeper descent to gather data on stress endurance. The flight included deploying dummy Starlink satellites, reigniting a Raptor engine in space, and stress-testing heat shield tiles, all critical for future missions to the moon and Mars. Optimism surrounds the successful launch and incremental tests, but the ultimate success of the mission will determine future deep space exploration plans.</p>

          <p>China is showcasing its humanoid robots in real-world sports competitions, including kickboxing contests and marathons. These events expose the robots to unpredictable environments and generate valuable data to advance their development. Analysts note that while China excels in hardware and supply chains, efforts are now focused on developing the "brains" of these robots. This push is part of an intensifying tech rivalry between China and the United States, with both countries aiming to boost investor confidence in the rapidly advancing field of humanoid robotics.</p>

          <p>Tesco shoppers are mocking the supermarket's introduction of AI technology at self-checkouts, which they compare to the Video Assistant Referee (VAR) used in football. The cameras aim to reduce shoplifting by identifying when shoppers fail to scan an item properly, showing a replay of the attempt. While some customers find the technology humorous, others express concerns about increased surveillance. The move comes as shoplifting in the UK has reached record highs, costing retailers billions.</p>
