          <p>In this New York Times article, columnists Gail Collins and Bret Stephens discuss the end of their weekly dialogue, "The Conversation," after eight years. Joined by editor Aaron Retica, they answer reader questions about how they maintained civil conversations despite political differences. They reflect on the transformation of the Republican Party and the degradation of public discourse, attributing some of it to the social media revolution. Collins and Stephens emphasize the importance of humor and approaching conversations with a willingness to understand the other side's perspective, rather than aiming to "win" the argument.</p>

          <p>Barstool Sports founder Dave Portnoy received praise for his handling of an antisemitic incident at one of the company's bars in Philadelphia. After initially expressing anger and a desire to "ruin" those responsible for an antisemitic sign, Portnoy decided to use the incident as a "teaching moment." He is sending the individuals involved to Auschwitz in Poland to learn about the Holocaust. Portnoy also fired two waitresses involved in the incident.

          <p>Berkshire Hathaway shares experienced a dip after Warren Buffett announced his retirement, effective January 1, 2026, with Greg Abel succeeding him as CEO. The board voted unanimously on the decision for Abel to take over, while Buffett will remain as chairman. The news marks the end of Buffett's 60-year run leading the company, which has grown from a failing textile mill into a juggernaut worth nearly $1.2 trillion. Despite the initial market reaction, some analysts view this as a transparent transition and are confident in Buffett's continued mentorship.</p>

Despite the ship's sinking, other exercises proceeded as planned.

          <p>General Motors has been engaged in a decade-long effort to revive Cadillac as a leading American luxury car brand. The strategy involves focusing on all-electric vehicles, sporty sedans, and the flagship Escalade to regain prominence.

While challenges remain, particularly in China, Cadillac's momentum is building in North America.

The author highlights research showing that the quality of relationships and community acceptance are more influential for children's well-being than household arrangements.
