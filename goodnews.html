        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>A private survey indicated that China's factory activity unexpectedly grew in June, contrasting with official government data that showed a contraction for the third straight month. The Caixin/S&P Global manufacturing PMI, which focuses on smaller, export-oriented firms, rose to 50.4, beating expectations. This divergence is partly attributed to exporters front-loading shipments to avoid potential U.S. tariffs. While the official PMI surveys a larger sample of companies, the Caixin survey suggests some resilience in the export sector, though analysts note this momentum may taper off.

          <h2>Chinese Scientists Discover Compound Produced During Exercise That Slows Aging</h2>

        </div>
        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>A team of Chinese scientists has identified a naturally occurring compound called betaine, which is produced in the kidneys during long-term exercise and appears to slow the aging process. The research, published in the journal Cell, reveals that betaine acts as a messenger that prevents inflammation and the aging of multiple organs. It functions by inhibiting a specific enzyme associated with aging. These findings provide a deeper understanding of the molecular mechanisms behind the anti-aging benefits of exercise and could lead to new strategies that simulate these positive effects.</p>

          <p>China's booming coffee culture is spreading beyond its major cities and into the countryside, leading to a surge in new rural cafes. This trend is driven by a growing domestic coffee market, now valued at over $42 billion, and a desire among consumers for unique, scenic experiences perfect for social media. However, some question the sustainability of this craze, as many cafes rely on novelty and an "influencer-driven vibe" to attract customers. While tea remains a traditional staple, China's coffee consumption continues to grow rapidly, reflecting a significant shift in consumer tastes.</p>

In response, the Lakers agreed to a two-year, $12-million deal with forward Jake LaRavia.

          <p>The UK government has announced a comprehensive review of parental leave and pay, aiming to modernize a system that campaigners say has been neglected for years. The review will examine maternity, paternity, and shared parental leave policies, which have been criticized as flawed and among the worst in the developed world. Issues to be addressed include low take-up of shared parental leave and the fact that many fathers cannot afford to take paternity leave. The goal is to create a system that better supports working families, though any changes will likely require significant investment.</p>

          <p>The U.S. military commander overseeing National Guard troops in Los Angeles has asked the Trump administration to return 200 troops to California's command. The request comes as the state enters fire season with its specialized National Guard firefighting unit at just 40% of its regular staffing levels. Many of these troops were federalized and deployed to Los Angeles to respond to immigration-related unrest. Governor Gavin Newsom, who has legally challenged the federalization, supports the move, emphasizing the critical need for these troops to return to their firefighting duties.</p>

          <p>CNBC's Jim Cramer suggests that a new wave of younger investors is significantly influencing the stock market by rewarding bold, idea-driven companies over established ones. He argues these investors are less concerned with traditional metrics and Federal Reserve moves, and more interested in the growth stories of companies like Robinhood, Reddit, and Palantir. This shift has created an "idea market" where individual company narratives and potential for disruption are valued highly. According to Cramer, these investors punish companies that prioritize stock buybacks over innovation, viewing it as a sign of stagnation. (not investment advice)</p>

Separately, he mentioned that despite widespread tariffs, Amazon has not yet seen significant price increases on its platform. He attributed this to mitigation strategies like forward-buying by both Amazon and its third-party sellers to build up inventory before the tariffs took full effect.</p>
