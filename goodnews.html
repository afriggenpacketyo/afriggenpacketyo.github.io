        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>President Trump's announcement that the U.S. would lift sanctions on Syria caught senior Treasury Department officials off guard, leading to internal discussions to determine the scope and speed of the rollback. Syria's transitional government, led by interim President Ahmed al-Sharaa, has been lobbying for sanctions relief to address economic challenges, including paying civil service salaries and rebuilding infrastructure. While some work was underway at Treasury for an incremental lifting of sanctions, the president's sweeping statement prompted confusion. Secretary of State Marco Rubio indicated that relief may come in the form of waivers, allowing foreign partners to provide aid without facing penalties. The sanctions were initially imposed on the Assad regime for human rights abuses and support for terrorist organizations.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Japan's economy experienced a contraction of 0.2% in the March quarter, marking the first decline in a year, primarily due to a sharp decrease in exports, according to preliminary government data. The contraction was more pronounced than economists had anticipated, with exports falling by 0.6% quarter-on-quarter. The Bank of Japan had previously cautioned that the country's economy was likely to moderate due to global trade policies. Despite these concerns, the central bank appears poised to continue raising its policy rate, with some board members expressing confidence in achieving the 2% inflation target.</p>

          <p>Ben Roberts-Smith, Australia's most-decorated living soldier, has lost his appeal against a landmark defamation judgement that found he committed war crimes. A judge in 2023 ruled that news articles alleging Roberts-Smith murdered four unarmed Afghans were substantially true. The civil trial marked the first time a court assessed claims of war crimes by Australian forces. Roberts-Smith maintains his innocence and has not been charged in a criminal court. The Federal Court judges upheld the original verdict, concluding that the judge had not erred in his assessment of the evidence presented by the newspapers.</p>

The dense strumming of the bajo quinto echoes across the entire LP, but most prominently in ‚ÄúSirena‚Äù. The album marks a turning point in his early career, from a once-bedroom covers artist to headline-worthy act.</p>

          <p>President Trump stated that his administration is nearing a nuclear deal with Iran, a key objective of his second term, but the exact terms of the deal remain unclear. Both sides are far from a consensus on key issues, including whether Iran would be able to enrich uranium at a lower grade for civilian use. Iranian officials have stated that they would never give up its right to civilian nuclear energy and that "none of our nuclear enrichment facilities will be dismantled." Trump wants Iran to become a great country, but ‚Äúthey can‚Äôt have a nuclear weapon.‚Äù</p>
