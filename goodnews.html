The study, published in Nature Plants, examined domesticated and wild rose samples, revealing that the common ancestor of roses probably had single-petal flowers with a yellow color. The team stated that roses are known as the 'queen of flowers' and are regarded as a symbol of love and beauty.</p>

They highlight the rise of Chinese AI models, like DeepSeek, and the popularity of Chinese apps such as TikTok and Temu. The article emphasizes the need for the U.S. to innovate faster, openly share AI technologies, and integrate AI throughout its economy to maintain its competitive edge and prevent China from dominating the future of technology. The authors suggest that China's capacity to innovate, combined with its manufacturing prowess, poses a significant challenge to U.S. technological leadership.</p>

          <p>Japan's official development assistance (ODA) ranking among OECD members is estimated to have fallen to fourth place in 2024, with Britain reclaiming third place. The United States remained the top ODA donor, followed by Germany. The decline in Japan's donations is attributed mainly to the yen's depreciation. Japan views ODA as a critical diplomatic tool in promoting a "free and open" Indo-Pacific region, but faces fiscal challenges with its high public debt.</p>
