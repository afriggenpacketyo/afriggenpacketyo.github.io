          <p>A team of researchers from China and Singapore has developed a novel nanovaccine that showed promising results in animal trials by suppressing cancer recurrence and metastasis. The bio-inspired approach, detailed in Nature Nanotechnology, targets cancer stem cells, which are responsible for tumor growth and spread. This innovative method holds significant potential for creating personalized cancer vaccines, offering a new frontier in the fight against the disease by addressing its root causes of relapse.</p>

          <p>Venture capitalists employ a principle known as the "power law" to guide their investment decisions, focusing on startups with the potential for massive, outlier returns. This strategy accepts that most investments may fail but anticipates that a few highly successful companies will generate the vast majority of the fund's profits, compensating for all losses. Founders seeking funding are advised to pitch a compelling vision for how their company can achieve outsized growth and dominate its category. (not investment advice)</p>

          <div class="timestamp">2025-07-21 03:27:40 EDT</div>
        </div>
        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>A comprehensive review of the water industry in England and Wales has recommended the most significant reforms since its privatization over 30 years ago. The proposals, authored by Sir Jon Cunliffe, include abolishing the current regulator, Ofwat, and implementing stricter environmental regulations and capital requirements to improve resilience. These changes aim to tackle systemic issues like sewage spills and leaking infrastructure, which have resulted from years of underinvestment, though they will likely be funded by higher consumer bills.

          <p>The British government has officially confirmed that a national inquiry will be held into the "Battle of Orgreave," a violent confrontation between police and striking miners in 1984. The announcement by Home Secretary Yvette Cooper fulfills a long-standing demand from campaigners seeking justice and answers about the events and their aftermath, which included the collapse of prosecutions against 95 miners amid allegations of falsified police evidence. The inquiry aims to uncover the truth of one of the most contentious episodes in UK industrial history.</p>

          <p>Chinese investors are increasingly channeling funds into bond-focused exchange-traded funds (ETFs), pushing the total assets under management in this category past US$50 billion. This surge is driven by a search for low-risk, fixed-income returns in an economic environment marked by persistent deflation and weak consumption. These ETFs offer advantages like lower costs, better liquidity, and diversified exposure, particularly to corporate debt, as investors hedge against an uncertain economic outlook.
