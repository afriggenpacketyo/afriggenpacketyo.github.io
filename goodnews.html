          <p>The U.S. Army is accelerating its integration of artificial intelligence on the battlefield, labeling the counter-drone fight as its top priority. New initiatives include a pilot program where soldiers use AI-enabled smart glasses to receive real-time repair instructions for vehicles, demonstrating a push to adopt consumer technology more rapidly. Army leaders emphasize the need for cheap, fast, and automated systems to defend against drone swarms, which are considered nearly impossible for humans to handle alone. This modernization effort also includes overhauling brigades and fast-tracking the next-generation M1E3 tank.</p>

          <p>South African police have arrested five North American citizens and a local farm caretaker after discovering a large-scale methamphetamine lab on a farm near Johannesburg. Acting on a tip about a strange chemical smell, authorities raided the property and seized approximately $20 million worth of crystal meth, along with precursor chemicals and manufacturing equipment. The five foreign suspects, who were in the country illegally, attempted to flee but were apprehended. The operation is being hailed by local law enforcement as a significant step in combating the region's drug trade.</p>

          <p>The UK's Liberal Democrat party has proposed establishing emergency "Nightingale processing centres" to address the country's significant asylum application backlog and reduce reliance on costly hotels for housing applicants. The plan, modeled after the temporary hospitals set up during the COVID-19 pandemic, would be coupled with an increase in the number of caseworkers to expedite decisions. Speaking at the party's annual conference, home affairs spokeswoman Lisa Smart argued this approach would be more humane for asylum seekers and more cost-effective for taxpayers. The party is also advocating for increased police visibility in community spaces.</p>

          <p>A 1,000-pound American-made bomb from World War II was discovered at a construction site in Hong Kong's bustling Quarry Bay district, prompting the evacuation of thousands of residents. Police confirmed the ordnance dated back to the war, when Allied forces conducted air raids on the then Japanese-occupied city. An extensive operation to defuse the nearly five-foot-long bomb began late Friday and concluded successfully on Saturday morning without any injuries. The discovery is one of several recent instances across the globe where unexploded WWII munitions have been found during construction work.</p>

          <p>Personal finance expert Jaspreet Singh offers a five-point strategy for individuals to save, invest, and build wealth from their paychecks, addressing the fact that nearly half of Americans spend their entire monthly income. He recommends systemizing money into three separate accounts for spending (75%), investing (15%), and saving (10%) to create a disciplined financial habit. Other key steps include strategically asking for a raise by demonstrating value to an employer and being intelligent about managing and paying down debt. Singh emphasizes that wealth is determined by financial habits, not just income level. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>The artificial intelligence boom, ignited by OpenAI's ChatGPT, has propelled a select group of seven private tech companies to a staggering combined valuation of $1.3 trillion. This surge, which has nearly doubled in the past year, is led by AI-focused firms like OpenAI, Anthropic, and Elon Musk's xAI, attracting massive capital inflows that reshape private market dynamics. While this rapid growth reflects genuine expansion and high demand for AI exposure, some industry leaders, including OpenAI's CEO Sam Altman, have acknowledged that the market may be in a bubble.

          <p>Meta has unveiled its new $799 Ray-Ban Display smart glasses, the company's first consumer model with a built-in translucent screen in the right lens. The device allows users to read messages, preview photos, and see live captions, controlled by hand gestures detected via an accompanying EMG sensor wristband. While the technology marks a step toward CEO Mark Zuckerberg's vision of glasses replacing smartphones, the experience is more utilitarian than immersive. The display can appear murky against real-world backgrounds, and mastering the pinch-and-swipe gestures requires practice, highlighting the novelty and current limitations of the platform.</p>

Beyond his on-screen achievements in films like "Butch Cassidy and the Sundance Kid" and "All the President's Men," his most lasting legacy may be the Sundance Institute and Film Festival. By creating a platform for independent and risk-taking filmmakers, he launched the careers of countless influential artists, including the Coen Brothers and Quentin Tarantino.

          <h2>Financial Planners Recommend the '20-4-10' Rule for Affordable Car Purchases</h2>
          <div class="timestamp">2025-09-20 07:30:01 EDT</div>
        </div>
        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>To determine if a car purchase is affordable, financial experts recommend following the "20-4-10" rule as a guideline to manage costs effectively. This framework suggests making a down payment of at least 20% of the vehicle's price, financing the car with a loan term no longer than four years, and ensuring that total monthly vehicle expenses do not exceed 10% of your income. Adhering to these principles helps lower overall interest payments, prevents becoming "underwater" on the loan, and ensures that the depreciating asset does not compromise long-term financial goals like retirement savings.

While no immediate land threats have been issued, its projected path could bring it east of Bermuda early next week as it continues to intensify. The formation of Gabrielle comes after a relatively quiet period in what was initially predicted to be a busier-than-usual hurricane season.</p>

          <div class="timestamp">2025-09-20 06:00:00 EDT</div>
        </div>
        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>A powerful anti-corruption movement, largely organized and led by Gen Z activists, has resulted in the overthrow of Nepal's government in less than 48 hours. Protests erupted after the government suspended social media platforms that activists were using to expose the lavish lifestyles of politicians' families. The ensuing violence led to the prime minister's resignation and the appointment of Sushila Karki, the country's first female chief justice, as its first female prime minister. This dramatic upheaval reflects a broader trend of youth-driven frustration with corruption and economic hardship across South Asia.</p>
