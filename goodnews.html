          <h2>Analysis Reveals Why Penalty Kicks Are Increasingly Missed in Women's Soccer</h2>
          <div class="timestamp">2025-07-20 08:11:04 EDT</div>
        </div>
        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>The Euro 2025 tournament has seen a historically low penalty success rate of just 58.5%, prompting analysis into the reasons behind the trend. Experts suggest a combination of factors is at play, including the increased pressure on players due to the sport's growing popularity and media spotlight. Additionally, goalkeepers are now better prepared with data-driven scouting on penalty takers' habits, and the overall physical and technical abilities of female keepers have significantly improved. This evolution marks a shift from the days when penalties were considered almost certain goals in the women's game.</p>

          <p>Following a landmark court ruling, the Atlanta Police Foundation has released hundreds of documents related to the controversial "Cop City" police training center. The records, obtained after a lawsuit by a news outlet and a research group, reveal the foundation's efforts to lobby city officials against a public referendum on the project. This case sets a significant precedent for the transparency of private police foundations, which often operate without public scrutiny. While the ruling doesn't classify all police foundations as public agencies, it opens the door for further accountability efforts nationwide.</p>

          <p>A series of five powerful earthquakes, the largest registering a magnitude of 7.4, struck in the Pacific Ocean off Russia's Kamchatka Peninsula. The seismic activity initially prompted tsunami warnings for the Russian coast and a tsunami watch for Hawaii. However, the Pacific Tsunami Warning Center later confirmed that the danger of significant tsunami waves had passed for all areas. There have been no immediate reports of casualties or damage from the quakes or the minor sea level changes that occurred. The region has a history of major seismic events.</p>

          <p>A new book, "The Beast in the Clouds" by Nathalia Holt, chronicles the 1928 expedition of Theodore Roosevelt's sons, Ted and Kermit, into the unmapped regions of China. Their secret goal was to find and capture a giant panda, a creature so elusive at the time that many believed it to be mythical. The book excerpt highlights the era's spirit of exploration, where vast parts of the world remained unknown and every expedition held the promise of fame. The panda was the last large mammal on Earth that had not been acquired for museum collections.</p>

          <p>Amid conservative criticism of the new "Superman" film's focus on the hero as an immigrant, author Grant Morrison highlights the character's forgotten progressive roots. Morrison, whose work influenced the film, notes that Superman was created by the sons of Jewish immigrants and was originally portrayed as a "socialist figure" and "champion of the oppressed." Early comics depicted him fighting corrupt bosses and tearing down slums to force the construction of affordable housing. The character's identity has evolved over the decades, reflecting the changing social and political landscapes of America, from a patriotic warrior to a cosmic seeker.</p>

          <p>China could mitigate the effects of US technology restrictions by fostering AI innovation and cooperation with countries in the Global South, according to policy analysts. This strategy would involve promoting collaborative development and equitable sharing of advanced technologies, thereby creating an alternative to the US-led tech ecosystem. A researcher from the South China University of Technology suggests that by partnering on inclusive AI infrastructure and co-developing ethical frameworks, China can move beyond its direct rivalry with the US. This approach could offer a more effective response to American "decoupling" strategies.</p>

          <p>Following the unexpected retirement of veteran wide receiver Mike Williams, the Los Angeles Chargers are adopting a "next man up" mentality, with Quentin Johnston poised to take on a larger role. Williams' departure leaves a significant gap in the receiving corps, particularly in terms of veteran leadership and his unique ability to win contested catches. Johnston, who showed significant improvement in his second season, is now expected to step up further. He states his confidence is at an all-time high, supported by his coaches and teammates, as the team looks to its younger players to deliver.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Amid growing public dissatisfaction with the two major political parties, experts like Lee Drutman argue that the American two-party system has outlived its usefulness. The primary obstacle for third parties is the "single-winner" electoral system, which renders votes for smaller parties as "spoilers" and discourages ambitious candidates from joining them. Drutman advocates for a shift to a multi-member proportional representation system, common in other democracies, where parties gain seats proportional to their vote share. This reform would make gerrymandering irrelevant and allow for a more diverse and representative range of political voices.</p>

          <p>While book-to-film adaptations are often met with skepticism from fans, a new feature from The Atlantic highlights six movies that arguably improved upon their source material. The list includes "Jurassic Park," praised for its tighter story and iconic characters, and "The Talented Mr. Ripley," noted for its heightened suspense and clearer exploration of the protagonist's psychology. Other selections are "Tinker Tailor Soldier Spy," "The Devil Wears Prada," "The Social Network," and "Clear and Present Danger." Each film is celebrated for elevating the original story through superior pacing, character development, or visual storytelling.</p>

          <h2>Rugby Analysis Suggests Australian 'Desperation' May Not Be Enough to Overcome Lions</h2>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Following the British and Irish Lions' first Test victory over Australia, much of the narrative has focused on the "desperation" of the Wallabies to keep the series alive. However, this analysis suggests that desperation alone may not be enough to bridge the gap in quality between the two teams. While the Lions had a period of sloppiness that allowed Australia to score late, their performance in the first 50 minutes showed a team on a different level, both physically and creatively. The article posits that if the Lions can maintain their focus, they are likely to win convincingly in the next match.</p>

          <p>The UK's environment secretary has announced a plan to halve the number of sewage discharges into English and Welsh waterways by 2030, calling it a "water revolution." Acknowledging that the water sector is "broken" and its regulator is "failing," the government plans tougher measures for water company bosses, including potential prison sentences for non-compliance. The pledge marks the first time a clear numerical target has been set for reducing pollution spills, following widespread public anger. The government ruled out nationalizing the industry, citing prohibitive costs of over £100 billion.</p>

The bear's fate became the subject of intense legal battles and protests after an initial order for her euthanasia was challenged by animal rights groups. The bear, also called Gaia, arrived safely at the Alternative Wolf and Bear Park in the Black Forest, where she will live in a secure, specially constructed enclosure.

          <p>A remarkable fossil of a pterosaur discovered in northeastern China is challenging long-held beliefs about the diet of these ancient flying reptiles. The stomach contents of the Sinopterus atavismus fossil contained microscopic plant mineral deposits, known as phytoliths, and quartz crystals, which were likely ingested to help grind tough plant matter. This is the first direct evidence confirming herbivory in this type of pterosaur, suggesting that not all of these creatures were fish-eaters or carnivores. The finding, published in Science Bulletin, sheds new light on the diverse ecosystems of the dinosaur era.</p>
