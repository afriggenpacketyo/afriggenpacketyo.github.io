          <p>This article critiques the panic surrounding ultra-processed baby food, particularly pouches, and argues that it contributes to maternal guilt. The author, a mother herself, points out that mothers are already aware of the nutritional differences between pouches and homemade meals. She suggests that the focus on pouches is part of a larger effort to re-domesticate women, placing undue pressure on them to prioritize foodwork over other aspects of their lives. The article advocates for a more supportive society for parents, rather than one that shames them for choosing convenience. Optimism score: 70</p>

          <p>The European Court of Justice has ruled against Malta's 'golden passport' program, ending the last such scheme in the EU. The court found that offering citizenship for investment undermines the solidarity and mutual trust between member states. While purchased passports are now banned, 'golden visa' programs offering residency permits remain in place, raising concerns about security and money laundering risks. Optimism score: 65</p>
