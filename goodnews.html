          <p>A recent study from SmartAsset identifies the best U.S. cities for first-time homebuyers, considering affordability, housing inventory, demand, and expected home price shifts. McAllen, Texas, ranks as the top overall city due to stable housing prices and moderate home prices relative to local income. Midwestern metro areas like Peoria and Decatur, Illinois, lead in affordability, while Cape Coral and Port St. Lucie, Florida, offer the most robust housing inventory per capita. The study aims to provide a helpful guide for prospective homebuyers navigating elevated mortgage rates and housing prices (not investment advice).</p>

          <p>President Trump and Elon Musk addressed reporters in the Oval Office as Musk concluded his tenure as a "special government employee." Musk thanked Trump for the opportunity to reduce wasteful spending, while Trump praised Musk's contributions and confirmed he would remain an advisor. Musk's time leading DOGE (Department of Government Efficiency) saw significant cuts to the federal workforce and cancellation of federal grants, but also faced criticism for errors and potential costs. Musk publicly disagreed with Trump's domestic policy package, citing concerns about the budget deficit.</p>

          <p>An Alaska man survived after being pinned face-down in an icy creek by a 700-pound boulder for three hours, sustaining only minor injuries. His wife's quick thinking, holding his head above water, and the assistance of a sled dog tourism company that provided helicopter transport for rescuers were crucial to his survival. It took seven rescuers using inflatable air bags to lift the boulder off him, and he was subsequently airlifted to a hospital. The man acknowledged his luck and expressed gratitude for his wife's actions.</p>

          <p>China has agreed to begin procedures to resume imports of Japanese seafood, which were banned after the release of treated radioactive wastewater from the Fukushima nuclear plant. Japan's chief tariff negotiator will hold further talks with the U.S. Treasury Secretary to explore a possible trade agreement. Japan's parliament has begun debating a bill that would allow married couples to keep different surnames for the first time in 28 years. North Korea reportedly provided Russia with 100 ballistic missiles last year in exchange for air defense systems, violating U.N. sanctions.</p>

The court emphasized that the Constitution grants Congress the power to regulate commerce with foreign nations.

The decision imposes a nationwide permanent injunction blocking the tariffs.</p>
