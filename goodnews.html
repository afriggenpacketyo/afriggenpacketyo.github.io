          <p>Microsoft's market value exceeded $4 trillion in after-hours trading, making it the second company, after Nvidia, to reach this milestone. The surge followed a strong earnings report where the company announced 18% revenue growth, its fastest in over three years, largely driven by its Azure cloud computing business. Microsoft's stock jumped 8%, reflecting investor confidence in its performance and its key position in the booming artificial intelligence sector. This achievement solidifies Microsoft and Nvidia as the two most valuable companies, pulling ahead of Apple in the market capitalization rankings. (not investment advice)</p>

Taylor Rogers was traded by the Cincinnati Reds to the Pittsburgh Pirates, while his brother Tyler was sent from the San Francisco Giants to the New York Mets. The brothers had previously been teammates on the Giants in 2023 and 2024 before Taylor was traded to the Reds. Tyler has been a standout reliever this season with a 1.80 ERA, and his acquisition is expected to bolster the Mets' bullpen for their playoff push.</p>

          <p>The Federal Reserve has decided to keep its benchmark interest rate unchanged, continuing its cautious approach in light of economic uncertainties, including the impact of tariffs. The rate-setting committee's statement noted that economic growth moderated in the first half of the year but that labor market conditions remain solid. In a rare display of public disagreement, two Fed governors, Michelle Bowman and Christopher Waller, voted to lower the rate, marking the first such dissent from board members since 1993. Fed Chair Jerome Powell emphasized that the economy remains in good shape but faces risks. (not investment advice)</p>

          <div class="timestamp">2025-07-30 18:14:08 EDT</div>
        </div>
        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>This article explores why intensely stressful television shows like "The Bear" and "The Pitt" have become so popular with audiences. These series use hyperrealistic filmmaking techniques, such as long, unbroken takes, to immerse viewers in high-pressure environments like a chaotic kitchen or a busy emergency room. Psychologists suggest that watching such scenarios can induce a form of "vicarious stress," a fight-or-flight response that can be satisfying because it carries no real-world risk. The trend may also reflect a cultural shift away from pure escapism, with viewers finding catharsis in seeing relatable characters navigate realistic, high-stakes workplace challenges.</p>

          <p>Meta CEO Mark Zuckerberg outlined his vision for the future of artificial intelligence, centered on the concept of "personal superintelligence." He described this as AI that surpasses human cognition and acts as a personalized companion to help individuals achieve their goals, from personal growth to creative endeavors. Zuckerberg also emphasized the role of wearable devices, predicting that AI-integrated glasses will become our primary computing platforms. This focus on AI, a strategic shift from the metaverse, appears to be succeeding, as Meta reported strong second-quarter financial results with a 36% increase in profit.</p>

          <p>Figma, the developer of collaborative design software, has priced its initial public offering at $33 per share, exceeding its initial target range of $30 to $32. The offering values the company at $19.3 billion and raised $1.2 billion, with the stock set to debut on the New York Stock Exchange. This IPO comes after a planned $20 billion acquisition by Adobe was terminated in 2023 due to regulatory opposition. Figma's successful pricing indicates a gradually reopening market for technology IPOs, following strong debuts from other tech companies earlier in the year. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>Kamala Harris has officially announced she will not be a candidate for governor of California in the upcoming election, ending months of speculation about her political future. The former vice president and 2024 Democratic presidential nominee stated that her public service will not be in elected office for now, leaving the race to lead the nation's most populous state wide open. Harris's decision was highly anticipated and had effectively frozen the field of potential candidates, as polls showed her as the top choice among Californians. She indicated she will focus on helping elect Democrats nationwide.</p>

          <p>This article advocates for greater recognition of independent and avant-garde artists at the Latin Grammy Awards, which often favor major commercial acts. It highlights six specific artists from across Latin America whose innovative work during the 2024-25 season merits consideration. Among those featured are Argentine digital artist Juana Aguirre, Chilean songwriter Gepe, and Guatemalan-born cellist Mabe Fratti. The piece argues that their forward-facing and creatively rich albums deserve to be celebrated in major categories, pushing the boundaries of what is typically acknowledged by the Latin Recording Academy and reflecting the genre's true diversity.</p>

          <p>Singer Nezza has released her Spanish-language rendition of "The Star-Spangled Banner," titled "El Pendón Estrellado," as an official single. She gained national attention last month after performing the song at Dodger Stadium, reportedly against the wishes of a team representative who had asked her to sing in English. Nezza stated her performance was a response to ongoing immigration sweeps in Los Angeles and an act of solidarity with the Latino community. A portion of the proceeds from the single will be donated to A Place Called Home, a South-Central L.A. youth organization, and various immigrant rights groups.</p>

          <h2>Analysis: Kamala Harris's Decision Not to Run for Governor Keeps Presidential Option Open</h2>
          <div class="timestamp">2025-07-30 17:19:37 EDT</div>
        </div>
        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>This political analysis suggests that by declining to run for California governor, Kamala Harris has strategically kept the door open for a potential 2028 presidential bid. Running for governor would have likely required her to forswear a presidential campaign and presented the practical difficulty of governing the nation's largest state while campaigning nationally. While she would enter a 2028 Democratic primary with high name recognition, she would also face a potentially crowded field and questions about the 2024 election loss. The decision avoids these immediate hurdles and allows her to chart a different path toward a possible future White House run.</p>

          <p>The UCLA football team has started its preseason training camp at a new off-campus location in Costa Mesa, with a strong emphasis on building team chemistry. With 55 new players and eight new assistant coaches, head coach DeShaun Foster organized the camp to foster connection, rooming offensive and defensive players together and planning bonding exercises. The move to the cooler coastal location was a change from the team's previous camps in the high heat of San Bernardino. The initial practice featured new quarterback Nico Iamaleava, who has reportedly grasped the playbook quickly since transferring to the program.</p>
