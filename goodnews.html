        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>The article addresses concerns about Hong Kong's legal system after 2047, when the 'one country, two systems' framework is set to expire. It references a presentation by activist investor David Webb, who questioned the applicability of existing laws post-2047 and suggested the need for law students to familiarize themselves with mainland law. The author urges calm and recalls similar anxieties leading up to 1997, emphasizing the need to address the issue of land leases and borrowing for property purchases to ensure stability and confidence in Hong Kong's future. The author hopes to avoid a repeat of past alarmism by proactively discussing legal and economic implications.</p>

          <p>Poland began voting in a high-stakes presidential election that will significantly influence the country's political direction, particularly concerning abortion rights, LGBTQ+ protections, and its relationship with the European Union. The leading candidates are Rafa≈Ç Trzaskowski, a pro-EU Warsaw mayor supported by Prime Minister Donald Tusk's centrist Civic Coalition, and Karol Nawrocki, a nationalist historian backed by the conservative Law and Justice party. Trzaskowski champions abortion rights and LGBTQ+ protections, while Nawrocki emphasizes conservative values and national sovereignty. The outcome will determine whether the current political gridlock between the prime minister and the outgoing conservative president eases or intensifies.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>A new internal study by the Bundeswehr Center of Military History and Social Sciences found that less than 1% of German soldiers harbor consistent right-wing extremist attitudes. However, the study also identified problematic chauvinist and xenophobic views among some soldiers. While the findings offer some relief amidst past reports of far-right networks within the military, researchers remain skeptical about the effectiveness of voluntary surveys and the timing of the study, which coincided with increased scrutiny of right-wing extremism in the Bundeswehr and police. Some experts argue that the military needs to do more to address the complexity of modern right-wing mindsets, especially given the rise of far-right attitudes in broader society.</p>

          <p>China is increasingly using public-private partnerships (PPPs) to fund large infrastructure projects in Africa, shifting away from direct government loans through the Belt and Road Initiative. This model involves Chinese companies gaining long-term operating rights in exchange for providing construction financing. Projects like Nairobi‚Äôs mega-highway and Zambia‚Äôs Lusaka-Ndola dual carriageway are being developed under this framework. During Kenyan President William Ruto‚Äôs visit to China, he sought funding for a railway extension, with Chinese financiers expected to contribute 40% of the project cost and gain exclusive construction and operating rights for at least 25 years.</p>
