          <p>Yellow heat health alerts have been issued for most of England, forecasting temperatures as high as 33C. The alert, effective from Wednesday to Sunday, covers Yorkshire and The Humber, East Midlands, West Midlands, East England, the South East, the South West, and London. While the alert is the lowest level, the UK Health Security Agency (UKHSA) warns of potential impacts on health and social services, particularly for vulnerable individuals such as those over 65 or with pre-existing conditions, with hospitals and care homes potentially posing risks due to internal temperatures. The UKHSA advises checking on vulnerable family, friends, and neighbors, and taking sensible precautions while enjoying the sun, as minor to significant impacts are possible depending on the region. The overall tone of the article is cautionary, emphasizing the need for preparedness and awareness amidst the rising temperatures.</p>

          <p>President Donald Trump expressed his affinity for the United Kingdom, attributing the country's protection from further tariffs to his personal liking for them. This sentiment was conveyed during the Group of Seven summit, where Trump and British Prime Minister Keir Starmer formalized a U.S.-U.K. trade deal. Trump highlighted the "fantastic" relationship and high level of enthusiasm between the two nations, despite acknowledging ideological differences with Starmer. The article suggests that personal relationships and cultural links play a significant role in international trade agreements, alongside economic policy.</p>

          <p>The Mayor of London is moving forward with plans to pedestrianize parts of Oxford Street, aiming to revitalize the busy shopping area. The proposal involves banning vehicles from a 0.7-mile stretch between Oxford Circus and Marble Arch, diverting 16 bus routes. While the plan has faced opposition and raised concerns about traffic diversion and accessibility, City Hall claims that two-thirds of people support the principle of the ban. The mayor seeks permission to establish a new mayoral development corporation to provide planning powers for the project, which aims to attract investment and create jobs.</p>

          <p>The Federal Reserve is widely expected to hold its benchmark interest rate steady at its upcoming meeting, maintaining the current range of 4.25% to 4.5%. This cautious approach reflects ongoing uncertainty surrounding the impact of President Trump's tariffs and a desire to monitor economic conditions. While consumer sentiment has improved, the inflation rate ticked up slightly in May, and the labor market remains robust. Experts predict a low probability of a rate cut, emphasizing that the current data does not support the theory of rapidly rising prices or a weakening labor market. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>Pharmaceutical companies are making strides in developing antibody-drug conjugates (ADCs) as targeted cancer therapies, potentially replacing chemotherapy for some patients. ADCs deliver chemotherapy directly to cancer cells while sparing healthy cells, unlike traditional chemotherapy. Companies like AstraZeneca, Daiichi Sankyo, Pfizer, and Merck are investing billions in ADC development, and while widespread replacement of chemo may take years, some ADCs have shown the ability to replace chemotherapy in certain settings.
