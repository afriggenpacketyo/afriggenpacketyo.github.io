          <p>The Labour Party has delayed its annual Women's Conference after advice stemming from a recent Supreme Court ruling on the legal definition of a woman. The court's decision, which defines a woman based on biological sex, has led to concerns about the conference's compliance, as Labour previously allowed trans women to participate. A leaked paper recommended restricting attendance to biological women to avoid legal challenges and protests. A Labour Party spokesperson emphasized the need to ensure procedures comply with the Supreme Court's ruling and to treat everyone with dignity and respect.</p>

          <p>President Donald Trump has announced plans to construct a new missile defense shield called the ‚ÄúGolden Dome,‚Äù estimating a cost of $175 billion with operational capabilities within three years. The project, led by Gen. Michael Guetlein, aims to intercept missiles launched from any location, including space, and echoes President Reagan's 'Star Wars' program. Trump cited Israel's Iron Dome as inspiration, but critics question the necessity for the U.S., given its geographic advantages and existing defense systems. The plan has garnered support at rallies and was included in the Republican party platform, but concerns remain about funding and potential impacts on other vital programs.</p>

          <p>This article by the BBC details how the Philippines-controlled island of Pagasa is standing up to Beijing's increasing dominance in the South China Sea. Despite its small size and population, Pagasa is strategically important to the Philippines, as it strengthens its legal claims in the area. The island's civilian population, runway, and territorial sea make it a linchpin for the Philippine presence. However, the island's residents face challenges due to the constant presence of Chinese ships, which intimidate fishermen and disrupt their livelihoods.</p>

          <p>This New York Times article explores the debate over whether companies are justified in raising prices in response to tariffs, with President Trump criticizing Walmart for doing so. While economists generally agree that companies pass along tariff costs, populist thinkers argue that companies have more pricing power than believed. Factors like competition and consumer sensitivity to price increases also play a role. Some argue that large companies can absorb costs or shift supply chains to avoid tariffs, while others suggest that companies exploit inflation concerns to manipulate prices.</p>

While the EU will maintain weapons-related sanctions, the removal of economic restrictions aims to help reinvigorate Syria's economy and foster stability.
