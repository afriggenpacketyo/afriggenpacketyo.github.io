As part of the agreement, humanitarian aid, including 137 trucks of food, has begun entering the Gaza Strip to address urgent needs. Meanwhile, the remains of several deceased hostages are also being transferred back to Israel. The developments come as former President Trump addressed the Israeli Knesset, stating that the disarming of Hamas would happen "pretty quickly."</p>

          <p>Indiana Pacers All-Star Tyrese Haliburton, a former Milwaukee Brewers fan, has been actively rooting against his childhood team during the MLB postseason. Haliburton wore jerseys of the Brewers' opponents, the Chicago Cubs and then the Los Angeles Dodgers, to his own preseason games. He explained on a podcast that his change of allegiance came after the Brewers allegedly canceled his scheduled ceremonial first pitch last summer, following the Pacers' playoff victory over the Milwaukee Bucks. The Wisconsin native now considers himself a "free agent" baseball fan.</p>

          <p>This opinion article reflects on the profound social and personal transformation of women in China, symbolized by the contrast between a modern urban professional and her rural roots. It traces this evolution back to the 1950 Marriage Law, one of the first pieces of legislation in the People's Republic, which established a commitment to equal rights for men and women. The piece uses the popular social media meme of "Tracy" returning home to become "Cuihua" to explore the deeper societal shifts that have enabled generations of women to forge new identities and futures beyond traditional expectations.</p>

          <p>Writer and food historian John T. Edge has released a new memoir, "House of Smoke," which turns inward to explore his own family's troubled history and his complex relationship with Southern identity.

          <p>With England having secured qualification for the next World Cup, this analysis examines ten players who face intense competition to earn a spot in manager Thomas Tuchel's final squad. High-profile names like Jude Bellingham and Phil Foden, who were left out of the recent squad, must prove they can fit into the coach's team-focused ethos. Other talents such as Cole Palmer and Jack Grealish are in crowded positions and will need to demonstrate consistent, high-level performance at their clubs to make a compelling case for inclusion in the highly competitive national team.</p>

        </div>
        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Federal Reserve Chair Jerome Powell indicated that a significant slowdown in hiring poses a growing risk to the U.S. economy, hinting that the central bank will likely proceed with two more interest rate cuts this year. Speaking to economists, Powell noted that despite a government shutdown delaying official data, the outlook for employment has weakened, shifting the balance of risks. He also suggested the Fed may soon stop shrinking its balance sheet. These comments suggest a greater concern for the job market over low-level inflation, reinforcing expectations of further monetary easing. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>Despite an increase in flight delays due to air traffic controller shortages during the government shutdown, aviation experts assert that air travel safety is not compromised. Officials and experts explain that delays and ground stops are precautionary measures implemented by the FAA to maintain safety standards with fewer staff. While travelers are advised to be patient, the core safety protocols remain intact, and pilots retain final authority to ground a flight if any conditions are deemed unsafe. The primary impact on passengers is inconvenience rather than increased risk.</p>
