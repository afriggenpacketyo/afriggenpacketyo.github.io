        </div>
        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>The Federal Reserve's recent interest rate reduction has lowered the average 30-year fixed mortgage rate to 6.13%, a three-year low that offers significant savings for homebuyers. For a $300,000 loan, the monthly principal and interest payment is now approximately $1,824, which is about $180 less per month compared to rates from January 2025. This decrease in borrowing costs has spurred a rise in both new mortgage applications and refinancing activity. Over the full term of the loan, today's lower rates could save a homeowner tens of thousands of dollars in interest payments. (not investment advice)</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>A new partnership between Hertz and Amazon Autos is set to create a powerful new channel for the rental company to sell its used vehicles directly to consumers, potentially disrupting the traditional auto dealership model. While Amazon provides the e-commerce platform, Hertz will supply a vast inventory of several hundred thousand cars annually. Analysts warn this could undercut dealerships, as rental companies can purchase vehicles in bulk at a discount and resell them at lower prices. This collaboration leverages Amazon's retail dominance and Hertz's massive fleet, intensifying the competitive pressure on conventional car lots.</p>

          <p>The Scottish government has issued new guidance requiring schools to provide separate toilet facilities for boys and girls based on biological sex. This marks a shift from previous advice, which allowed transgender pupils to use the facilities aligning with their gender identity and stated no law required sex-based separation. The updated rules, influenced by recent court rulings, clarify that single-sex spaces must be available, although schools can still offer additional gender-neutral toilets. The guidance also advises supporting transgender youth by respecting their pronouns and chosen attire to avoid causing distress.</p>

          <p>President Trump is meeting with Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu at the White House to push for an agreement on a new U.S.-led plan to end the nearly two-year-long war in Gaza. The proposal reportedly involves an end to Israeli military operations, an increase in humanitarian aid, and the release of all remaining Israeli hostages by Hamas within 48 hours. The high-stakes meeting occurs amid growing international pressure and frustration from the Trump administration over the prolonged conflict. Trump has expressed optimism about reaching a deal, though it remains unclear if both Israel and Hamas will accept the terms.</p>

          <p>Following a period of turbulence and a comprehensive series defeat to Australia, England's women's cricket team enters the 50-over World Cup in India under significant pressure. With new leadership under coach Charlotte Edwards and captain Nat Sciver-Brunt, the team is expected to at least reach the semi-finals. However, they face formidable opponents in defending champions Australia and a rapidly improving Indian team on home soil. Key challenges for England include their batting performance against spin, inconsistent fielding, and ability to handle high-pressure situations, with success depending heavily on whether they have learned from past mistakes.</p>

          <p>CNBC's Jim Cramer voiced confidence in Nike's long-term prospects, stating that the apparel giant is effectively working through its excess inventory issues. He believes that once the company introduces new products, it will return to strong growth under the leadership of CEO Elliot Hill, making the stock an attractive early investment. Cramer also described Costco's stock as a "bargain" following a recent dip, suggesting it presents a rare buying opportunity below its typical valuation. He recommended purchasing shares of the wholesale retailer, despite some market disappointment with its membership renewal figures. (not investment advice)</p>

          <h2>Five Common Mistakes to Avoid When Repaying Debt</h2>
          <div class="timestamp">2025-09-29 11:54:57 EDT</div>
        </div>
        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Financial experts advise against several common but counterproductive strategies when trying to pay off debt. These include tapping into retirement funds like a 401(k), which can incur steep penalties and sacrifice future growth, and neglecting to build at least a small emergency fund, which leaves one vulnerable to new debt from unexpected expenses. Other pitfalls to avoid are relying too heavily on balance transfer cards without a clear payoff plan and focusing exclusively on large debts while allowing smaller ones to accumulate fees. Seeking help from predatory debt-relief companies can also worsen one's financial situation. (not investment advice)</p>

          <div class="timestamp">2025-09-29 11:51:47 EDT</div>
        </div>
        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>The UK government announced that maintenance grants, which do not need to be repaid, will be reinstated for some university students in England by 2029. Education Secretary Bridget Phillipson stated the grants will be available to tens of thousands of students from lower-income families who are enrolled in "priority courses" aligned with the country's industrial strategy. The plan will be funded by a new tax on international student fees, a move criticized by Universities UK as the wrong approach. This policy change aims to alleviate the financial burden on students who increasingly rely on part-time work to cover living costs.</p>

          <p>The Canadian government has officially listed the Bishnoi gang, a transnational criminal organization operating from India, as a terrorist entity. This designation grants authorities the power to freeze the group's assets, seize property, and prosecute individuals for offenses like financing and recruitment. The move follows allegations by Canadian police that the Indian government has used Bishnoi members to carry out violence and extortion against diaspora communities, particularly supporters of the Khalistan movement. Public Safety Minister Gary Anandasangaree said the action provides more effective tools to combat the group's climate of fear and intimidation in Canada.</p>

          <p>Scientists in Patagonia, Argentina, have unearthed the fossils of a new species of megaraptor, named Joaquinraptor, which is believed to be at least 70 million years old. The research team discovered parts of the dinosaur's skull, jaw, and other bones, estimating its length at 23 feet and weight at over 2,000 pounds. Significantly, the fossil was found with the arm bone of a crocodile in its mouth, providing direct evidence of its diet. This discovery adds to the rich fossil record of the region and offers new insights into the ecosystems of the late Cretaceous Period.</p>
