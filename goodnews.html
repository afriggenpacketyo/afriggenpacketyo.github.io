          <p>A California appeals court sided with a former middle school student, Eleri Irons, who sued the El Segundo Unified School District for failing to protect her from bullying. The court upheld a $1-million jury verdict awarded to Irons, finding the district negligent in supervising and training its employees. Irons sued the district in 2019, alleging she was bullied and verbally assaulted by students from November 2017 to June 2018. The appeals court rejected the district's arguments, stating that El Segundo had a duty to protect Irons and that school employees did not follow basic bullying procedures.</p>
