          <p>Fraudsters managed to steal ¬£47 million from HM Revenue & Customs (HMRC) by impersonating taxpayers in a phishing attack.

HMRC has stated that they are contacting the affected individuals to assure them that their accounts are secure and that no money has been lost.

          <p>The defusal of World War II bombs in Cologne's city center has been delayed due to a resident's refusal to evacuate, according to city officials. Despite orders to leave, one individual in the old town resisted, prompting public order officials, police, and the fire department to enforce removal measures. Until the area is fully cleared, the bomb squad cannot begin the defusal process. Large areas of Cologne's center have been closed off as experts prepare to defuse three unexploded bombs from World War II, affecting approximately 20,000 people who were ordered to evacuate.</p>

The author contends that a robust state is necessary to address societal needs and provide essential services, and that reforms should focus on strengthening oversight mechanisms rather than shrinking government. The article also warns that reducing government power can lead to the rise of big business and privatization, which can be detrimental to democracy.</p>

          <p>A federal judge ordered the unsealing of several documents in the case of Kilmar Abrego Garcia, a Salvadoran migrant deported to El Salvador, after a request from a media coalition including CBS News. The Justice Department opposed the request, citing the protection of national security and sensitive information, but the judge found that these arguments did not withstand scrutiny. The Trump administration has acknowledged that Abrego Garcia's deportation was a mistake, as he had been granted a legal status that forbade his removal to El Salvador due to likely persecution by local gangs.</p>
