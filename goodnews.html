        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Yellow heat health alerts have been issued for most of England, forecasting temperatures as high as 28C in London. The alert, effective from Wednesday to Sunday, warns of potential impacts on health and social services, particularly for those aged 65 and over or with health conditions. The UKHSA anticipates a possible rise in deaths and increased demand for health services, with internal temperatures in hospitals and care homes posing a risk to vulnerable individuals. Yorkshire and The Humber is expected to experience only minor impacts, while temperatures across western Europe are expected to rise further into the weekend. The alert aims to mitigate the adverse effects of the anticipated heatwave. </p>

          <p>A new WalletHub study analyzing data from 148 of the largest U.S. cities has ranked Provo, Utah, as the best-run city in the nation. The study assessed the "quality of services" across public finances, education, health, safety, and infrastructure, comparing these metrics against each city's per-capita budget. Provo stood out due to its robust business growth, high school graduation rate, infrastructure, and low violent crime rate. Nampa, Idaho, and Manchester, New Hampshire, followed Provo in the rankings, noted for their low government debt and safety ratings, and low pollution levels and steady growth in home values, respectively.</p>

          <p>Despite political differences, President Donald Trump has a strong affinity for the UK and Prime Minister Keir Starmer, citing personal liking as a key factor in their positive relationship. The UK was the first to secure a trade deal with the U.S. under Trump, benefiting from lower tariffs on car and steel exports. Trump's Anglophilia, rooted in familial links and appreciation for British culture, has also contributed to the special relationship. This cultural connection, combined with strategic alignment on trade and foreign policy, has allowed the UK to maintain a privileged position with the U.S. administration.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>The Mayor of London is moving forward with plans to pedestrianize parts of Oxford Street, aiming to revitalize the area and attract more visitors and investment. The plan involves banning vehicles from a 0.7-mile stretch between Oxford Circus and Marble Arch, diverting 16 bus routes, with potential changes towards Tottenham Court Road. While City Hall claims two-thirds of people support the ban, concerns remain about traffic diversion, accessibility for disabled individuals, and the quality of retail offerings. The proposals depend on the establishment of a new mayoral development corporation to provide planning powers, with detailed consultations planned for later this year.</p>

          <p>A security expert has lauded Israel's defensive systems for preventing greater destruction during recent Iranian missile attacks. Despite the destructive potential of Iranian ballistic missiles, Israel intercepted approximately 95% of those launched toward its territory. The country employs a multi-layered defense system, including Iron Dome, David's Sling, Arrow 2, and Arrow 3, along with the new Magen Or laser system and the U.S. THAAD system. In addition to defense, Israel has also targeted Iranian missile storage sites and launching infrastructure, aiming to neutralize the Islamic Republic's military capabilities, though the conflict has caused civilian casualties and disruptions.</p>

          <p>Mercedes team principal Toto Wolff has criticized Red Bull's protest against George Russell following the Canadian Grand Prix, calling it "petty" and "embarrassing." Russell secured Mercedes' first win of the season, finishing ahead of Max Verstappen, but Red Bull protested, alleging Russell drove "erratically" behind the safety car. The stewards rejected the protest, leading Wolff to suggest the FIA needs to address such far-fetched claims. Red Bull boss Christian Horner defended the team's right to protest, stating they saw something that was not quite right, leading them to put it in front of the stewards.</p>

        </div>
        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>The pharmaceutical industry is optimistic that antibody-drug conjugates (ADCs) could eventually replace chemotherapy for some cancer patients, offering more targeted treatment with fewer side effects. Companies like AstraZeneca, Pfizer, and Merck are investing heavily in developing ADCs, which deliver chemotherapy directly to cancer cells while sparing healthy ones. While ADCs have shown promise, some experts caution that more refinement is needed before they can fully replace chemotherapy. Newer ADCs, like Enhertu from AstraZeneca and Daiichi Sankyo, deliver more chemotherapy per dose and use smart linkers to release the drug only inside tumors, showing potential to become standard treatments for certain cancers.</p>

          <p>Kraft Heinz announced that it will remove FD&C artificial dyes from its U.S. products by the end of 2027, and will not launch any new products in the U.S. containing those ingredients. This decision follows pressure from the U.S. Food and Drug Administration and Department of Health and Human Services, led by Secretary Robert F. Kennedy Jr., for the food industry to pull back on artificial dyes as part of a larger so-called Make America Healthy Again platform. The FDA in April announced a plan to phase out the use of petroleum-based synthetic dyes by the end of next year and replace them with natural alternatives. Kraft Heinz has made more than 1,000 recipe changes over the past five years to improve product nutrition.</p>

Readers express varying views on Brooks's analysis, with some commending his honesty and others critiquing his lionization of the Reagan administration. Several letters emphasize the importance of organized labor and the need for conservatives to separate themselves from reactionaries to achieve civic renewal. The responses also highlight concerns about climate change and the need for bipartisan cooperation to address national issues.</p>

British maritime security firm Ambrey reported that the collision was not security-related, and Frontline confirmed the incident was a navigational issue unrelated to the conflict between Israel and Iran. The Front Eagle experienced a fire on deck, which was extinguished, while the Adalynn was bound for Egypt's Suez Canal.
