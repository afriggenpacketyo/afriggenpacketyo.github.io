          <p>President Trump reiterated his intention to impose tariffs on semiconductor imports from companies not shifting production to the U.S., but indicated firms like Apple, with domestic investments, would be exempt. Speaking at a White House dinner with tech leaders, including Tim Cook, Trump emphasized his pro-business and AI stances. Major semiconductor companies like TSMC and Samsung Electronics have already committed billions to U.S. plants in recent years, likely qualifying them for exemptions. While details remain unclear, Trump suggested that companies building or planning to build in the U.S. would avoid tariffs, praising the tech leaders for their innovation. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>The Trump administration has asked the Supreme Court to allow the president to fire a Federal Trade Commission (FTC) member, a move challenged by lower courts. The Justice Department argues that the FTC is under presidential control and commissioners can be removed without cause. This challenge could lead the Supreme Court to reconsider a 1935 decision that restricted presidential power over independent agency members. The case centers on Rebecca Slaughter, an FTC commissioner who was fired and rehired multiple times, with the FTC being a regulator enforcing consumer protection and antitrust laws.

          <p>Bidders seeking to acquire a portion of Starbucks' China operations have reportedly valued the business at around $5 billion. This potential deal could be one of the largest China unit divestments by a global consumer company in recent years. The offers, which Reuters reported last month, would allow Starbucks to proceed with the sale amid sluggish growth and competition from local brands. The valuation is based on approximately 10 times the expected earnings before interest, taxes, depreciation and amortization (EBITDA) of $400 million to $500 million in 2025, similar to rival Luckin Coffee.</p>

          <p>The Philadelphia Eagles commenced their Super Bowl title defense with a 24-20 victory over the Dallas Cowboys in a game overshadowed by an early ejection. Eagles defensive tackle Jalen Carter was ejected just six seconds into the game for spitting on Cowboys quarterback Dak Prescott. Despite the setback, the Eagles managed to secure the win, with Jalen Hurts accounting for 214 yards and Saquon Barkley rushing for 60 yards and a touchdown. The game featured a 65-minute lightning delay in the third quarter, and both offenses struggled to score after the resumption.</p>

          <p>Asia-Pacific markets mostly increased after President Trump formalized a lower Japanese auto import tariff of 15%, down from 27.5%. The order also confirmed a $550 billion Japanese investment in U.S. projects. Japan's Nikkei 225 and Topix indices saw gains, while South Korea's Kospi also climbed. Several Asian chip stocks rose after Trump announced potential tariffs on semiconductor imports from companies not moving production to the U.S., with Advantest and Lasertec among the gainers. U.S. equity futures remained stable ahead of the August jobs report. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>A federal appeals court has halted a lower court ruling that would have required Florida and the Trump administration to dismantle parts of "Alligator Alcatraz," an immigration detention site in the Everglades. The 2-1 ruling allows the detention center to remain open while a lawsuit challenging it on environmental grounds proceeds. The court found that state and federal officials are likely to succeed in showing the site isn't subject to the National Environmental Policy Act. DHS lauded the ruling, while environmental groups expressed disappointment but vowed to continue the fight.</p>
