          <p>Lowe's has maintained its full-year forecast, buoyed by increased sales to home professionals, which offset a decline in demand from do-it-yourself customers. The home improvement retailer's quarterly sales slightly missed Wall Street's expectations, but earnings exceeded estimates. CEO Marvin Ellison attributes the company's resilience to investments in stores, technology, and customer service, helping navigate challenges in the housing market. Lowe's anticipates total sales ranging from $83.5 billion to $84.5 billion for the year, with comparable sales projected to be flat to up 1% year over year. (not investment advice)</p>

Same-store sales fell 1.7%, which was better than the anticipated 2.04% decline, attributed to unfavorable weather offset by growth in professional and online sales. The company reiterated its 2025 fiscal year guidance, projecting total sales between $83.5 billion and $84.5 billion, with same-store sales expected to remain flat to increase by 1%.

          <p>The UK Health Security Agency (UKHSA) has reported the first detection of West Nile virus in UK mosquitoes, though there have been no cases of human transmission within the UK to date. Fragments of the virus were found in Aedes vexans mosquitoes collected in Britain in 2023. While the risk to the general public is considered "very low," health officials are issuing advice to healthcare professionals. Experts suggest this detection is part of a broader trend of mosquito-borne diseases expanding to new areas due to climate change, necessitating measures to control mosquito populations and prevent the spread of infectious diseases.</p>

        </div>
        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>The Supreme Court has upheld the legal right to wild camping on Dartmoor, rejecting an appeal by landowners who argued that permission was required. The ruling centers on the interpretation of the 1985 Dartmoor Commons Act, which grants the public the right to access the commons for open-air recreation, including camping. This decision is likely to reignite the debate over public access to land in England, where Dartmoor National Park is a rare exception to the general lack of wild camping rights. The Dartmoor National Park Association welcomed the ruling, emphasizing responsible access and respect for landowners and farmers.</p>
