          <p>Asian stock markets, including South Korea's Kospi and Japan's Nikkei 225, experienced a significant rally, tracking Wall Street gains after Federal Reserve Chair Jerome Powell signaled potential monetary policy easing next month.

Investors are now closely monitoring upcoming economic data, such as Singapore's consumer price index, for further insights into market direction and the global economic outlook.

          <p>Jim Cramer offers his market playbook following a powerful stock rally, attributing it to Federal Reserve Chair Jerome Powell's signals for upcoming rate cuts, driven by a dramatic deceleration in hiring. He critiques the common focus on "Magnificent Seven" stocks, advocating for a diversified approach and highlighting opportunities in housing, mergers and acquisitions, and IPOs, with specific bellwethers like Toll Brothers and Goldman Sachs. Cramer also identifies underperformers such as enterprise software and autos as potential areas for caution. The article warns of a seasonally challenging September, with anticipated price increases and rising joblessness, which the Fed views as a primary concern. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>Jerry Adler, a distinguished Broadway veteran who transitioned to a successful acting career in his 60s, has died peacefully in his sleep at the age of 96. Known for his memorable roles as Tony Soprano's adviser Hesh Rabkin in "The Sopranos" and law partner Howard Lyman in "The Good Wife," Adler spent decades behind the scenes. He contributed as a stage manager, producer, and director for 53 Broadway productions, including the original "My Fair Lady." His unexpected late-career pivot to acting, which spanned over 30 years, underscored his belief that "retirement is a road to nowhere," leaving behind a legacy in both theater and television.</p>
