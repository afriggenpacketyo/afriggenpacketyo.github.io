          <p>Dick's Sporting Goods plans to acquire Foot Locker for $2.4 billion, aiming to expand internationally, attract new consumers, and dominate the Nike sneaker market. The merger would create a global sports retail platform, giving Dick's a competitive advantage, especially in the wholesale sneaker market. The deal would allow Dick's to enter international markets and reach a younger, more diverse customer base, though some analysts view the acquisition as a strategic mistake due to Foot Locker's struggles and potential integration challenges.

          <p>Walmart reported strong quarterly earnings but cautioned that tariffs implemented by President Trump could lead to price increases later this month. CFO John David Rainey stated that the magnitude of tariff increases is too significant for retailers to absorb, impacting consumers. While Walmart aims to maintain competitive pricing, the company anticipates reducing the size of some purchases due to anticipated lower sales from higher prices. Walmart's Q1 earnings beat expectations, with e-commerce sales increasing 21% in the U.S., and the company is often seen as a barometer for the health of the U.S. consumer.</p>

          <p>Americans for Prosperity (AFP) is partnering with GOP representatives to advocate for extending Trump's 2017 Tax Cuts and Jobs Act (TCJA) in competitive congressional districts. The initiative involves grassroots organizing, including door-knocking and phone banks, to encourage constituents to urge their senators and representatives to support the tax cuts. AFP is urging Republicans to offset budget cuts by eliminating former President Joe Biden's "Green New Deal giveaways." The focus on competitive districts reflects the expectation of contentious races in 2026.</p>

          <p>The UK economy is 'beginning to turn a corner,' according to Chancellor Rachel Reeves, after it grew by more than expected in the first three months of the year, at 0.7%. The growth was driven by increases in consumer spending and business investment. Shadow Chancellor Mel Stride said it was 'a bit premature to be popping the champagne corks', and analysts warned the strong rate of growth was unlikely to continue.

          <p>The UK economy grew by 0.7% at the start of this year, which was better than expected, but this level of growth is not predicted to last. It was the highest in the G7, which is a group of countries that includes the US, Canada, France, Germany, Italy and Japan. All of these countries have had to deal with a big shock to global trade - the tariffs brought in by the US at the start of the year. The article does not mention any investment advice.</p>

          <p>Liz Stead, a 78-year-old woman, unknowingly had a criminal record for 56 years for being a lesbian in the military. Stead was discharged from the RAF in 1969 when her same-sex relationship was discovered and she was given a criminal conviction for "perceived same-sex sexual activity". She is encouraging more women to apply to a government pardons scheme to uncover unknown convictions. Since the expansion of the scheme in 2023, 40 people have been given pardons, with the majority granted to former military personnel.</p>
