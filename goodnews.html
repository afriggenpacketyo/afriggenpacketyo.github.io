          <p>Oscar Piastri led Lando Norris in both Friday practice sessions at the Emilia-Romagna Grand Prix, showcasing McLaren's strong performance. Lewis Hamilton, driving for Ferrari in Italy for the first time, finished 11th fastest in the second session after encountering brake issues following minor adjustments to his car. Pirelli's decision to use the softest three tyre compounds for the race could influence strategy due to high tyre degradation. The first practice session was prematurely ended when Sauber's Gabriel Bortoleto crashed, while Isack Hadjar also spun into the barriers during the second session.</p>

          <p>Gold prices are currently falling after a steady surge, presenting potential investment opportunities for those with a longer-term view. Physical gold bullion, gold ETFs, and gold mining stocks are three gold investments that could pay off as prices fall. Investors may be able to capitalize on lower prices by purchasing gold-related assets before the next upswing, as gold has historically rebounded after similar dips, particularly during economic uncertainty. It's important to remember that timing the bottom perfectly is nearly impossible, but for those with a disciplined approach and a belief in gold's enduring value, today's falling prices could lay the groundwork for tomorrow's gains.

          <p>Southern California is expected to experience chilly temperatures and drizzle this weekend due to a strong onshore flow and persistent marine layer, with temperatures ranging 10 to 15 degrees below normal. However, a rapid warmup is forecast for next week, with temperatures in the valleys potentially reaching close to 100 degrees by Tuesday, Wednesday, and Thursday. This heat wave is expected to be more persistent than the previous one, potentially foreshadowing a hot and potentially fiery summer for much of the West, including California.

          <p>Staff employees at the Kennedy Center for the Performing Arts in Washington, D.C., are seeking to unionize across departments due to job uncertainty following changes implemented by the Trump administration. More than 150 employees are concerned that the mission and legacy of the arts institution are at risk without stability in operations. The staff hopes unionization will restore security, improve transparency, and enhance communication from leadership, which they say has been lacking. The petition filed with the National Labor Relations Board indicates that 172 employees plan to vote to unionize with the International Union, United Automobile, Aerospace and Agricultural Implement Workers of America.</p>

          <p>President Donald Trump took to social media to criticize the Supreme Court, fellow Republicans, and several celebrities, including Bruce Springsteen and Taylor Swift. Trump called Springsteen overrated and claimed Swift was no longer ‚ÄúHOT‚Äù. The posts underscore the domestic political challenges Trump faces and the personal grievances he won't let go. Trump also accused the U.S. Supreme Court of getting "played," and he admonished Republican "grandstanders" threatening to derail his legislative agenda in Congress.</p>

          <p>Just Stop Oil (JSO) activists who plotted to glue themselves to a runway at Heathrow Airport have been spared jail terms. The nine campaigners were convicted of conspiracy to cause a public nuisance after police stopped them from causing "unprecedented disruption" at the west London airport on 24 July. The defendants had either already served the time they were sentenced to or they were handed suspended sentences. Judge Hannah Duncan said the defendants had not breached the perimeter fence and they caused no disruption or "actual harm" but added they had shown "no remorse".</p>
