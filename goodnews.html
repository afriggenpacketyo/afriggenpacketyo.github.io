          <p>President Trump has suggested reopening and expanding the Alcatraz prison, emphasizing the need for judges who won't demand trials for every illegal immigrant due to the overwhelming number of cases. Trump views immigration policy overhaul as a top priority, citing delays caused by judges as a hindrance to deportations. He argues that lengthy trials for every criminal, including murderers, entering the country illegally are unsustainable and threaten national security. Trump believes the Supreme Court should support his stance to prevent the country's collapse, stressing the urgency of addressing immigration issues.</p>

          <p>The article discusses the concept of "bolters," or unexpected and inexperienced players, who might be selected for the British and Irish Lions tour to Australia in 2025. It references past bolters who have become Lions greats and those who didn't fare as well, highlighting the risk and reward of selecting overlooked players. The article then lists nine potential picks who are currently considered less probable but not entirely impossible, suggesting that these players could emerge as surprise selections for the squad. The announcement of the squad by Ieuan Evans is eagerly anticipated.</p>

          <h2>Study Reveals Roses Were Originally Yellow, Challenging Traditional Red Association</h2>
          <div class="timestamp">2025-05-05 01:00:09 EDT</div>
        </div>
        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>A new evolutionary genetic analysis conducted by Chinese and Dutch researchers has revealed that the first roses were likely yellow, contrary to the common association of roses with the color red. The study, published in Nature Plants, examined domesticated and wild rose samples to trace the flower's evolutionary history. Researchers determined that the common ancestor of Rosa most likely had single-petal flowers with yellow color and seven leaflets. Roses are widely cultivated and seen as symbols of love and beauty, but their genetic history shows a different origin than typically perceived.</p>

          <p>Eric Schmidt and Selina Xu argue that China is rapidly catching up to the United States in various technologies, particularly in artificial intelligence, and has developed an edge in disseminating, commercializing, and manufacturing tech. They note that while the U.S. initially led in AI development with models like ChatGPT, China has swiftly developed cheap yet state-of-the-art competitors, with some Chinese models now surpassing U.S. versions in certain benchmarks. The authors emphasize the importance of the U.S. openly sharing more of its AI technologies and research, innovating faster, and doubling down on diffusing AI throughout the economy to maintain its competitive edge in the AI race.</p>

          <p>Japan has likely fallen to the fourth-largest provider of official development assistance (ODA) among OECD members, with Britain reclaiming the third position, according to preliminary data. The United States remains the top donor, followed by Germany. The decline in Japan's donations is attributed mainly to the yen's depreciation and a contrast with sharp increases in previous years when development projects resumed after COVID-19 suspensions. Despite the decline, Japan views ODA as a crucial diplomatic tool in pursuing a "free and open" Indo-Pacific amid China's growing influence, although it faces fiscal constraints due to its high public debt.</p>
