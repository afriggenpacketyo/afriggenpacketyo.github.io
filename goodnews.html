Both sides expressed optimism for reaching a deal before the new July 9 deadline, but significant obstacles remain.

Negotiators are exploring options such as cutting tariffs on industrial goods to zero, but disagreements persist over key issues like the trade deficit. The EU is also preparing retaliatory tariffs in case negotiations fail (not investment advice).</p>

          <p>Katie Boulter secured her first-ever French Open win by defeating Jessika Ponchet in the first round, overcoming her previous struggles on clay surfaces. Her win comes after a string of improvements on clay, which has been a difficult surface for her to master, by dropping down to the second-tier of the WTA Tour and being rewarded with a maiden clay title in the French capital. Other British players experienced mixed results, with Dan Evans losing to Holger Rune and Jack Draper defeating Jesper De Jong. Boulter's victory marks a significant milestone in her career and demonstrates her commitment to improving on all surfaces.</p>
