          <p>Voters in South Texas, largely SpaceX employees, overwhelmingly approved the creation of Starbase, a new city near Elon Musk's rocket launch facility, with a vote of 212 to 6. The area, previously known as Boca Chica, will now have the authority to manage its own roads, utilities, and potentially close a local beach and state park for launch operations. Critics worry about Musk's increased control over the area, while SpaceX officials emphasize the need for community growth and streamlined launch procedures. The city's establishment comes as SpaceX seeks permission to increase launch frequency, and Musk celebrated the victory on X, calling it "now a real city!".</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>A recent survey in Japan revealed that nearly 30% of individuals in common-law relationships chose not to legally marry due to the country's surname law, which requires couples to adopt the same last name. The rate is higher among people in their 20s, with over 60% of that group stating they would marry if separate surnames were permitted. While some political parties support the option of separate surnames, others fear it would undermine traditional family values. Common-law couples in Japan lack access to the same benefits as legally married couples, such as tax deductions and inheritance rights.</p>

          <p>China's coffee market is experiencing rapid growth, with 66,920 coffee shops opening in the past year, resulting in a net increase of nearly 12,000 stores. This expansion is driven by increased accessibility and price competition, with President Xi Jinping promoting domestic beans from Yunnan province. While the market is booming, Starbucks' market share has decreased from 34% in 2019 to 14% in 2024, as domestic and international chains compete for market dominance. Much of the growth is concentrated in second-tier and new first-tier cities, indicating a broader adoption of coffee culture beyond major urban centers.</p>
