          <p>Jeff Bezos's company, Blue Origin, successfully completed its 13th passenger spaceflight, launching six tourists to the edge of space and back. The New Shepard rocket lifted off from West Texas, carrying the crew to an altitude of over 65 miles, where they experienced several minutes of weightlessness. The mission included Owolabi Salis, who became the first Nigerian to fly in space. Both the crew capsule and the reusable booster returned safely to Earth. This flight marks another step in the growing sub-orbital tourism market, a sector Blue Origin currently dominates as competitor Virgin Galactic upgrades its fleet.</p>

          <p>With rising temperatures, this article provides essential advice for keeping dogs safe, emphasizing that exercising them in hot weather is a leading cause of heat-related illness. The RSPCA warns that dogs have a limited ability to cool down and can overheat quickly, leading to serious health issues or death. Key signs of heatstroke include heavy panting, lethargy, and vomiting. The advice is to avoid walks in the heat, check pavement temperature before going out, and provide plenty of cool water and shade. If a dog shows signs of overheating, it should be cooled with water immediately and taken to a vet.</p>

          <p>President Donald Trump announced that a buyer has been secured for TikTok's U.S. operations, describing them as "a group of very wealthy people" and stating he would reveal their identity in about two weeks. The sale is part of an effort to address national security concerns that the Chinese government could access American user data through TikTok's parent company, ByteDance. Trump has repeatedly extended the deadline for the sale, with the current deadline set for September 17. The deal will likely require approval from the Chinese government, which President Trump expressed confidence in obtaining from President Xi. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>LeBron James will make NBA history by becoming the first person to play 23 seasons, after exercising his $52.6 million player option to remain with the Los Angeles Lakers for the 2025-26 season. The 40-year-old superstar, who is the league's all-time leading scorer, was previously tied with Vince Carter for the most seasons played. This will be his eighth season with the Lakers, and he is now just 50 games away from breaking the record for most regular-season games played. The decision resolves a key offseason question for the Lakers as they work to build their roster around him.</p>
