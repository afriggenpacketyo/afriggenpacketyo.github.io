          <h2>Financial Therapist Criticizes TikTok's 'Manifesting Money' Trend as Unrealistic</h2>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>A financial therapist has cautioned against the popular TikTok trend of "manifesting" wealth, arguing that simply believing in financial abundance without taking concrete action is ineffective. The trend, particularly prevalent among younger generations, suggests that positive thinking alone can attract money. While acknowledging the power of a positive mindset, financial therapist Aja Evans emphasizes that achieving financial goals like paying off debt or saving for a home requires practical steps and grounding in reality. She warns that relying solely on manifestation can be a form of delusion, and that pairing a positive outlook with actionable financial planning is essential for true progress.</p>

          <p>Maya Rogers, the CEO of Tetris, advises professionals that sometimes the best career moves involve trusting one's own judgment over conventional wisdom. She recounts an instance where she pursued a partnership for the game "Puyo Puyo Tetris" against a trusted advisor's counsel, a decision that resulted in a globally successful series that sold millions of copies. Rogers emphasizes that while seeking advice is valuable, making bold decisions and even failing are crucial parts of learning and innovation. She also highlights the importance of mentorship, particularly for women in business, and co-founded a venture accelerator to support women-led businesses and help them take thoughtful risks.</p>

          <p>Dan Porter, CEO of the digital sports media company Overtime, states that the questions a job candidate asks can reveal whether they are a good fit for the company. He considers inquiries about benefits like dental plans or basic company history that is easily found online to be red flags when asked of a CEO. Instead, he values candidates who come prepared with numerous thoughtful questions about the business itself. Career expert Suzy Welch agrees that while benefits are important, such questions are better directed to HR after an offer is made, and time with a CEO should be used to discuss strategy, markets, and how the candidate can contribute value.</p>

          <p>The 2025 governor's race in New Jersey is being closely watched as a potential bellwether for the national political climate during President Trump's second term. Democratic nominee Mikie Sherrill, a former Navy pilot, is facing Republican Jack Ciattarelli in what is expected to be a competitive election in the traditionally blue state. Although New Jersey has not voted for a Republican president in decades, the state has been trending rightward, and the governor's office has often switched parties. A victory for Sherrill would be seen by Democrats as a crucial pushback against the Trump administration ahead of the 2026 midterm elections.</p>

The month-long stoppage placed immense financial pressure on JLR's supply chain, with many smaller firms at risk of bankruptcy.

        </div>
        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>The portrayal of fathers in American sitcoms provides a cultural roadmap of how the concept of fatherhood has evolved, especially in the post-World War II era. From the stoic, suburban ideal of Ward Cleaver in "Leave It to Beaver" to the generational clashes embodied by Archie Bunker, television has both reflected and shaped societal norms. Later, characters like Cliff Huxtable represented a more modern, co-parenting model influenced by feminism. This cultural analysis suggests that the TV dad has often been a liberalizing figure, moving away from a purely disciplinary role toward one of support and presence, though this model is now being challenged by more patriarchal visions.</p>
