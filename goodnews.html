          <p>President Trump announced he would double tariffs on steel imports to 50% during a visit to a U.S. Steel mill near Pittsburgh. This announcement follows earlier teases of a "planned partnership" between U.S. Steel and Nippon Steel, a Japanese competitor. Trump characterized the agreement as one that will ensure the American company stays American, adding that the deal includes protections to ensure steel workers keep their jobs. Senator David McCormick provided details on the agreement, saying that U.S. Steel would have an American CEO and a majority of its board members will be from the U.S., and that the U.S. would have a golden share.

This mission is part of a broader 10-year plan that includes the "Tianwen-3" Mars sampling return mission in 2028 and the "Tianwen-4" mission to Jupiter. Samples from 2016HO3 are expected to return in about two years and could provide clues about Earth's formation, but NASA is restricted from cooperating with CNSA due to the Wolf Amendment.</p>

          <p>A commercial truck carrying an estimated 70,000 pounds of honeybee hives overturned in northwestern Washington state, resulting in the escape of approximately 250 million bees. Roads in the area have been closed as bee experts work to manage the situation, aiming to allow the bees to return to their hives and find their queen. The goal is to save as many bees as possible, considering their critical role in pollination and food production. Bees pollinate over 100 crops, including nuts, vegetables, berries, citrus, and melons.</p>

The 13-meter radio antenna, jointly developed by the Shanghai Astronomical Observatory and the National Astronomical Research Institute of Thailand, was inaugurated in Chiang Mai. This telescope, along with a second one under construction in southern Thailand, will improve deep-space tracking and Earth monitoring, contributing to more accurate GPS, climate research, and earthquake forecasting.
