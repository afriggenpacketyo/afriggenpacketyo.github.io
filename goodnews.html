          <p>Despite ongoing trade tensions between the U.S. and China, Chinese companies are continuing to expand into the U.S. market. Camera company Insta360, for example, considers the U.S. one of its biggest markets, and home appliance company Hisense aims to become the top seller of television sets in the U.S. within two years. This expansion trend is evolving as Chinese businesses build international brands with offices in different regions, hiring local employees. While growth at home has slowed, these companies remain unfazed by geopolitical risks, focusing on user-centric research and development to meet consumer needs.</p>

          <p>China is entering the photonic chip market with the production of high-performance photonic chips that could power advances in artificial intelligence (AI), 6G, and quantum computing. Shanghai Jiao Tong University Chip Hub for Integrated Photonics Xplore (CHIPX) has begun producing 6-inch wafers for thin-film lithium niobate (TFLN) photonic chips. These chips use light instead of electrical signals for information transmission, potentially overcoming limits for high-speed optical links. While Europe and the US are already established in this field, China's entry signifies a major step in its technological advancement.</p>

Four Democrats are vying for the position: Stephen Lynch, Jasmine Crockett, Robert Garcia, and Kweisi Mfume. The new ranking member will confront Republicans on issues like immigration, LGBTQ rights, and former President Biden's age, while also having the potential to become chair if Democrats regain the majority. Democrats are considering factors such as communication skills, support for lawmakers in battleground districts, and the ability to challenge President Trump.</p>
