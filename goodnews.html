          <p>The Los Angeles Dodgers achieved a crucial 5-4 extra-innings win against the Arizona Diamondbacks, bringing their magic number to clinch the National League West down to one. This victory highlighted the unexpected effectiveness of starting pitchers Roki Sasaki and Clayton Kershaw in relief roles, helping to stabilize the team's otherwise faltering bullpen. Sasaki, recently activated from the injured list, displayed promising velocity and command in his first major league appearance since May, while veteran Kershaw made a rare relief outing. Their contributions were vital in a game where the Dodgers' traditional relievers again struggled, underscoring the team's urgent search for reliable pitching ahead of the postseason.</p>

          <p>London's leading bank executives are calling for increased policy clarity and stability as the U.K. approaches its Autumn Budget, fearing potential tax hikes could negatively impact the financial services sector. CEOs from Barclays, Citi, and J.P. Morgan acknowledged recent improvements in corporate profitability but expressed caution regarding Finance Minister Rachel Reeves' potential plans for a bank windfall tax to address a £62 billion budgetary deficit. They argue that excessive taxation stifles investment and competition, jeopardizing London's status as a global financial hub. The banking leaders emphasize the need for a consistent approach to regulation and taxation to maintain the sector's competitiveness. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>Brazilian President Luiz Inácio Lula da Silva has stated that Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky appears "much more willing to talk" than in previous meetings, as Lula revives a Brazil-China peace plan for the conflict. Lula also noted a similar openness from Russian President Putin, suggesting both leaders might be recognizing the limits of negotiation. The Brazilian president emphasized the critical role of the UN in leading peace talks and expressed his desire for the organization to regain its authority as a spokesperson for member states. This renewed diplomatic push follows a rare alignment between China and Brazil on a US-led ceasefire initiative earlier in the year.</p>

          <p>Asia-Pacific markets largely climbed on Thursday, diverging from Wall Street's second consecutive day of tech stock declines, particularly impacting Nvidia and Oracle. Hong Kong's Hang Seng index saw a modest rise, buoyed by Chery Automobile's strong IPO debut and Xiaomi's device launches. South Korea's Kospi was near flat, but defense stocks and internet firm Naver showed gains. Meanwhile, Taiwan's Taiex dipped, influenced by TSMC's decline amid reports of Intel seeking investment from Apple. Investors globally are closely watching upcoming U.S. jobless claims data, which could influence Federal Reserve monetary policy amid concerns about a weakening labor market.

          <p>Chery Automobile, China's largest vehicle exporter, experienced an impressive 11% jump in its shares during its Hong Kong debut, raising US$1.2 billion through its initial public offering. The company is actively expanding its international presence, with plans to launch SUV sub-brands in Europe and already selling vehicles in the UK. While Chery faces global headwinds like 100% tariffs on Chinese EVs in the U.S. and Canada, its strategy of local manufacturing in regions like the Middle East and Southeast Asia helps mitigate some of these risks. This successful IPO highlights Chery's growing strength and emergence in the global automotive market, despite protectionist trade policies. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>Nvidia's substantial investment, potentially up to $100 billion, in OpenAI will primarily be used by the AI startup to lease Nvidia's advanced graphics processing units (GPUs), rather than for outright purchases. This arrangement allows OpenAI to spread out the significant costs of building AI supercomputing facilities, with Nvidia bearing more of the financial risk. While the equity investment supports OpenAI's operational needs, the majority of funds are directed towards securing the crucial compute power provided by Nvidia's chips, essential for training large language models. This deal has raised concerns among some analysts about the "circular nature" of the AI boom, where investment flows back to the capital provider. (not investment advice)</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Africa is experiencing a record surge in solar capacity, driven by a significant increase in imports of Chinese-made solar panels, as highlighted by an Oxford Economics study. In the first seven months of this year, the continent welcomed 9,516 megawatts worth of panels, up from 6,625MW in the same period last year, with South Africa, Algeria, and Nigeria leading the charge. This rapid expansion is largely attributed to large-scale energy plants developed by Chinese firms and falling costs of solar technology. China's dominance in global solar production makes these imports a key indicator of Africa's accelerating shift towards renewable energy.</p>

          <p>Fourth-generation cranberry farmers in Massachusetts are increasingly participating in a state program that pays them to restore unproductive bogs back into wetlands. This initiative, driven by falling cranberry prices, rising costs, and extreme weather, helps farmers preserve their land as they face significant economic headwinds. The Massachusetts Division of Ecological Restoration's Cranberry Bog Program has already restored over 500 acres and plans for another 500, allocating around $1 million annually. These restored wetlands offer environmental benefits like water filtration, carbon storage, and storm resilience, while also providing public access for recreation, offering a sustainable alternative for retiring farmers.</p>

          <p>Matthew McConaughey reveals he acted alongside his 93-year-old mother and 17-year-old son, Levi, in "The Lost Bus," a film depicting the devastating 2018 California wildfires. McConaughey plays Kevin McKay, a bus driver evacuating schoolchildren through the inferno, with his family members cast in key roles to enhance the film's realism, a choice made by director Paul Greengrass. The movie portrays the real-life event where a power line sparked fires that killed 85 people and displaced over 50,000. McConaughey praises the real-life first responders, noting the film speaks to universal themes of grappling with extraordinary situations and the global dangers of wildfires.</p>

          <p>Orange County officials are cross-referencing voter rolls with pet registration data to ensure no animals are registered to vote, following charges against a woman who allegedly registered her dog and cast ballots for it. Supervisors Dan Wagner and Janet Nguyen initiated the measure to restore public confidence in election integrity, despite some colleagues arguing the issue isn't indicative of widespread fraud. The Registrar of Voters has already checked nearly 8,000 unincorporated pet records without finding issues and is expanding the review to incorporated cities. This effort comes as California faces a special election with significant political ramifications, emphasizing the county's commitment to accurate voter rolls.</p>

          <p>Jimmy Kimmel's return to "Jimmy Kimmel Live!" after a week-long suspension saw a massive surge in viewership, with broadcast audiences quadrupling his average and achieving the highest ratings since March 2015. This rebound occurred despite the show being preempted by about a quarter of ABC affiliate TV stations. The suspension followed comments Kimmel made regarding the killing of conservative activist Charlie Kirk, which prompted criticism from FCC Chair Brendan Carr and led to major station owners like Nexstar and Sinclair to indefinitely preempt the show. Kimmel addressed the controversy, stating his intention was not to make light of the tragedy.</p>

          <p>A 6.2-magnitude earthquake struck western and northern Venezuela on Wednesday, with its epicenter located near the oil town of Mene Grande at a depth of 7.8 kilometers. The tremor, also felt in neighboring Colombia and Caribbean islands, caused buildings to shake and alarm in cities like Caracas and Maracaibo. Despite its strength, there were no immediate reports of casualties or serious damage. While 80% of Venezuelans live in seismic zones, the country has not experienced a major fatal quake since 1997. This event serves as a reminder of the region's seismic activity.</p>
