          <p>The National Hockey League has entered into a multi-year licensing agreement with prediction markets Kalshi and Polymarket, a first for a major U.S. sports league. The deal grants the platforms access to official NHL data and logos in exchange for brand exposure and enhanced customer protection measures. The NHL views the partnership as an opportunity to engage a new and broader audience beyond traditional sports fans. However, the move has drawn criticism from the American Gaming Association, which raises concerns about unregulated gambling and the platforms' accessibility to individuals under 21.</p>

          <p>Shares of GE Vernova experienced a significant drop before partially recovering, despite the company reporting better-than-expected quarterly results. The market's reaction reflects high investor expectations in the AI-driven tech sector. In a subsequent interview, GE Vernova CEO Scott Strazik revealed ongoing discussions with OpenAI CEO Sam Altman, suggesting a potential partnership for providing power equipment to support OpenAI's ambitious growth. This development points to a strategic move by GE Vernova to capitalize on the immense energy demands of the artificial intelligence industry. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>With the Federal Reserve anticipated to announce further interest rate cuts, prospective homebuyers are debating whether to lock in current mortgage rates or wait for potentially lower ones. Locking a rate now provides certainty and protects against unexpected market spikes, allowing for confident budgeting and house hunting. However, with a high probability of future Fed cuts, waiting could lead to additional savings on a home loan. The decision is complicated by the fact that lenders may have already priced in expected cuts, and unlocking a rate later often incurs a fee. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>The CEO of Western Alliance stated that a case of alleged loan fraud that recently unsettled investors appears to be a "one-off issue." The regional bank had set aside $30 million for potential losses on a $98 million loan to the Cantor Group, whose borrowers it is now suing for fraud. CEO Kenneth Vecchione assured analysts that the bank has since reviewed its portfolio, reverified collateral for all large loans, and found no other irregularities. The reassurances helped calm markets, but analysts note that such events have created lasting investor anxiety, likely capping share gains for regional banks.</p>

          <p>Amazon has introduced a new robotic system named "Blue Jay" that can perform multiple warehouse functions simultaneously, including picking, sorting, and consolidating items. The system consists of robotic arms with suction cups suspended from a track, which the company says can handle about 75% of the items it stores. Amazon frames the technology as a way to assist employees with strenuous tasks and improve safety, but the announcement comes amid scrutiny of its automation strategy. A recent report suggested Amazon's automation could eliminate the need to hire over 160,000 workers by 2027, raising concerns about the long-term impact on its workforce.</p>

Forecasters predict widespread rainfall of 20-30mm, with localized flooding possible, and wind gusts potentially reaching 45-55 mph inland and up to 75 mph on exposed coasts. While the storm will likely be a typical autumn weather event, it could cause some travel disruption.</p>

        </div>
        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>For married retirees considering a reverse mortgage to supplement their income, the process involves specific rules that differ from those for single borrowers. When a couple applies for a Home Equity Conversion Mortgage (HECM), both spouses are typically listed as co-borrowers, and both must meet the age requirement of 62. The loan amount is calculated based on the age of the younger spouse, which can result in access to less equity than if based on the older spouse's age. This financial tool can help eliminate existing mortgage payments and create a safety net, but couples must carefully consider the long-term implications.</p>

Goodell stated that the decision was "carefully thought through" and that backlash is common when selecting an artist for such a massive platform. Bad Bunny, a vocal opponent of Trump, was chosen for his immense global popularity, and the league is confident he will deliver an "exciting and a united moment." Trump had previously criticized the choice, stating he had never heard of the Puerto Rican artist and calling the decision "ridiculous."</p>

          <p>A social media trend known as "Group 7" has gone viral on TikTok, created by singer-songwriter Sophia James as a "science experiment" to promote her new single. James posted a series of seven videos to see which one the platform's algorithm would show to the most users, labeling them as different "groups." The seventh video, in which she welcomes viewers to "Group 7," exploded in popularity, attracting millions of likes and engagement from celebrities and brands. Digital media experts explain her success came from turning the post into a participatory game, effectively leveraging the algorithm's preference for user engagement.</p>

          <p>Tesla is scheduled to report its third-quarter earnings, with analysts expecting a return to revenue growth after two consecutive quarters of year-over-year declines. The company's performance is being closely watched following the expiration of federal EV tax credits, which had previously pulled sales forward. Investors are focused on updates regarding the company's Robotaxi service, production of new lower-cost models, and the adoption of its driver assistance systems in key international markets. The report comes as Tesla faces a sales slump in Europe and increased competition, which has impacted its global brand ranking. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>A large-scale study published in The Lancet has found that different antidepressants cause a wide range of physiological side effects, with clinically significant variations in their impact on weight, heart rate, and cholesterol. Researchers analyzed data from over 58,000 participants and found some drugs were associated with weight gain, while others were linked to weight loss. Similarly, some medications increased heart rate while others decreased it. The study's authors emphasize that these findings should not discourage use of the effective medications, but rather encourage doctors to better tailor treatments to individual patient health profiles and preferences.</p>

          <p>Seventy years after her execution, the grandchildren of Ruth Ellis are formally requesting a posthumous pardon for her 1955 murder conviction. Ellis, a 28-year-old nightclub hostess, was hanged for shooting her lover, David Blakely, whom her family's lawyers now describe as an "abusive, violent partner." The application argues that the long-standing abuse Ellis suffered would likely lead to a manslaughter charge today, under a modern understanding of domestic violence and battered woman syndrome. The case was highly influential in turning public opinion against the death penalty in the UK, which was abolished for murder in 1969.</p>

          <p>The National Football League has officially approved the sale of a 10% minority stake in the New York Giants to Julia Koch, a transaction that values the team at a record $10.3 billion. This valuation is the highest ever for an NFL team in a sale. The league also approved smaller minority stake sales for the New England Patriots and the San Francisco 49ers at high valuations. The escalating values of NFL franchises are attributed to the anticipation of much larger media rights deals and the recent introduction of private equity firms as approved investors.</p>
