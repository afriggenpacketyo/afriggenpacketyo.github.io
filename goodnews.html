          <p>Georgian-Spanish fighter Ilia Topuria became a two-division UFC champion after securing a spectacular knockout victory over Charles Oliveira at UFC 317 in Las Vegas. Moving up to the lightweight division, Topuria captured the interim championship, maintaining his undefeated record and becoming only the tenth fighter in UFC history to hold titles in two different weight classes. After the fight, Topuria declared that he represents the "new generation" of mixed martial arts. A potential future matchup was teased with a post-fight confrontation with Paddy Pimblett in the octagon.</p>

          <p>Despite facing criticism from UK politicians and a terrorism charge against one of its members, Irish-language rap group Kneecap delivered a defiant performance at the Glastonbury Festival. The trio, known for its pro-Palestinian stance and republican symbolism, led the crowd in political chants and thanked organizers for resisting pressure to cancel their appearance. One member, Liam √ìg √ì hAnnaidh, is currently on bail for allegedly waving a Hezbollah flag at a previous concert. The performance highlights the ongoing tension between artistic expression, political activism, and national security concerns in the UK.</p>

          <p>Influencer-turned-boxer Jake Paul defeated former world champion Julio Cesar Chavez Jr. by a unanimous decision in a cruiserweight bout in California. Paul controlled the fight from the start, as Chavez Jr. appeared passive and reluctant to engage, drawing boos from the crowd and visible frustration from his father at ringside. Despite the clear victory, the match raises further questions about the caliber of Paul's opponents, as Chavez Jr. showed little of the form that once made him a middleweight champion. Following the win, Paul called out current champions, signaling his ambition for a future title shot.</p>

          <p>France is leading a significant investment in satellite operator Eutelsat, positioning it as a European competitor to Elon Musk's Starlink, but industry experts question its ability to catch up. Eutelsat's OneWeb constellation of 650 low-Earth orbit satellites is vastly outnumbered by Starlink's 7,600, and analysts note that a massive increase in scale and technological upgrades would be required for parity. While the move is seen as a strategic push for Europe's technological sovereignty, Eutelsat is considered more likely to succeed in specialized government and enterprise sectors rather than the mass consumer market currently dominated by its U.S. rival.</p>

          <p>Quemoy, a small island group administered by Taipei but located less than 10 kilometers from mainland China, serves as a unique case study in the cross-strait relationship. Once a heavily militarized front line, it is now a quiet community caught between two powerful political systems. The article suggests that despite its history as a symbol of Taiwanese deterrence, the island's current state reveals the practical limitations of influence for both Beijing and Taipei. It exists in a delicate balance, reflecting the complex and often contradictory dynamics of the broader regional conflict.</p>

          <p>Los Angeles Dodgers star Shohei Ohtani demonstrated further progress in his return to the mound, pitching two scoreless innings against the Kansas City Royals. During the outing, he recorded the fastest pitch of his major league career, a four-seam fastball clocked at 101.7 mph. This was his third start since returning from elbow surgery, and he allowed one single and one walk while striking out one batter. Despite his solid pitching performance, Ohtani went hitless in four at-bats, and the Dodgers ultimately lost the game 9-5, snapping their five-game winning streak.</p>

          <p>New regulations banning smoking in many public outdoor areas across France went into effect on Sunday, aiming to protect children from secondhand smoke and move toward a "tobacco-free generation." The ban covers beaches, parks, bus shelters, and areas near schools and swimming pools, with violators facing fines up to ‚Ç¨700. The rules, however, do not apply to the terraces of bars and restaurants or to e-cigarettes. Health officials hope the measure will help reduce the country's high smoking rate, where over 30% of adults still smoke.</p>

          <p>Pride Month culminated in major parades across the United States, including in New York City and San Francisco, with events blending joyful celebration with a defiant tone of political protest. This year's festivities come amid efforts by the Trump administration to roll back LGBTQ+ rights, particularly those affecting transgender people. Organizers adopted themes like "Rise Up: Pride in Protest" to reflect the current political climate. The events also faced challenges from reduced corporate sponsorship, as many companies have pulled back from diversity and inclusion initiatives amid shifting public sentiment.</p>

          <p>The UK government has announced new plans for a partnership with supermarkets and food manufacturers to combat rising obesity rates. Under the voluntary scheme, food retailers will be encouraged to make healthy food more accessible and appealing through promotions, loyalty point incentives, or store layout changes. The plan, part of a broader 10-year strategy for the NHS, will require major retailers to report on healthy food sales to increase accountability. Critics note that while welcome, the plan's impact may be limited unless it addresses the significant cost disparity between healthy and unhealthy foods.</p>
