          <p>OpenAI has inaugurated the first site of its ambitious $500 billion Stargate project in Abilene, Texas, marking a significant step in securing the vast computing power required for future artificial intelligence. This flagship data center, leased by Oracle and equipped with Nvidia chips, is designed to scale past a gigawatt of capacity, enough to power 750,000 U.S. homes. OpenAI, alongside partners like Oracle and SoftBank, plans five additional Stargate sites across the U.S., aiming for nearly 7 gigawatts and over $400 billion in investment within three years. The project underscores a global "compute crunch" and the unprecedented demand for AI infrastructure, with construction efforts accelerating to deploy next-generation chips by 2026.</p>

          <p>Actor Marlon Wayans has taken to social media to defend his latest film, "HIM," which received negative critical reviews, currently standing at a 29% score on Rotten Tomatoes. Wayans urged his followers to form their own opinions, emphasizing that critical reception doesn't always reflect audience appreciation or a film's eventual classic status. He highlighted past projects like "White Chicks" and "Scary Movie," which were initially criticized but later found widespread popularity. This article notes that while critics remain largely unimpressed, the film has achieved a more favorable 58% audience score, suggesting a disconnect between professional reviews and public sentiment.</p>

          <p>Los Angeles Mayor Karen Bass announced that her administration has successfully averted all planned layoffs for city workers this year, a significant achievement given an initial $1 billion budget shortfall that threatened over 1,600 positions. This outcome resulted from months of negotiations and agreements with various city unions, which included voluntary unpaid holidays and other cost-cutting measures. Scaling back hiring in departments like the LAPD and fire department also played a crucial role in preserving jobs. While celebrating this immediate success, city officials emphasized the ongoing need for long-term fiscal strategies to address persistent budget challenges and safeguard the city's workforce and services.</p>

This reversal comes after his meeting with Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy at the U.N. General Assembly, contrasting his previous stance that Kyiv might need to cede some land. Trump, who earlier expressed frustration with Putin, indicated that Russia appears like a "paper tiger" due to the prolonged war. He also supported NATO members shooting down Russian aircraft if they violate airspace and urged European nations to stop buying Russian energy, though he has resisted tougher sanctions himself.</p>

          <h2>MLB Adopts Automated Ball-Strike Challenge System for 2026 Season</h2>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Major League Baseball will implement an automated ball-strike (ABS) challenge system starting in the 2026 season, allowing players to dispute umpire calls on balls and strikes. This new system, tested extensively in the minor leagues and in spring training, aims to balance the umpire's role with correcting missed calls in high-leverage situations, without significantly slowing down the game. Each team will receive two challenges per game, retaining a challenge if the call is overturned. MLB Commissioner Rob Manfred stated the system strikes the right balance, preserving the human element while leveraging technology for accuracy, a change largely favored by players over a fully automated strike zone.</p>

          <p>YouTube announced a significant policy reversal, allowing creators previously banned for COVID-19 or election-related misinformation to apply for reinstatement. This change, outlined in a letter to House Judiciary Chair Jim Jordan, rolls back lifetime bans for these offenses, aligning with YouTube's updated Community Guidelines that now permit a wider range of content. The move follows mounting Republican pressure on tech companies regarding Biden-era speech policies. YouTube stated it will launch a limited pilot program soon for eligible creators and channels terminated under retired policies, affirming its commitment to "free expression" and rejecting the empowerment of third-party fact-checkers for moderation, though information panels with context will remain.</p>

          <p>President Trump's recent decision to hike H-1B visa application fees to $100,000 has prompted calls for Canada to capitalize on the opportunity to attract highly skilled foreign workers deterred from the U.S. Canadian Prime Minister Mark Carney acknowledged the potential, while organizations like Build Canada urged swift action, citing Canada's world-class institutions and quality of life. Past U.S. visa restrictions have shown companies redirecting talent to Canada. However, some experts caution that Canada's immigration system also faces challenges, including scaled-back policies and lower wages, suggesting significant reforms are needed to become a truly attractive long-term destination for these professionals.</p>

          <p>Nvidia plans to invest $100 billion in OpenAI, providing the AI developer with substantial capital to construct data centers powered by Nvidia's advanced chips. This strategic partnership aims to deploy 10 gigawatts of power for future AI infrastructure, with the first gigawatt data center expected online in late 2026. Nvidia's GPUs are critical in the booming AI ecosystem, making this investment a key move in global AI geopolitics. Critics, however, raise concerns about "circular financing," where a company invests in customers who then buy its products, potentially overestimating demand. Supporters view it as a sign of massive unmet AI demand and a multiplier impact for Nvidia's revenue. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>Following the Federal Reserve's recent interest rate cut, the monthly costs for a $40,000 home equity loan have slightly decreased, making it a more affordable borrowing option for homeowners. For example, a 10-year loan now costs around $494.45 monthly at 8.43%, down from $497.44 in February. Home equity lines of credit (HELOCs) also offer competitive rates, averaging 8.05%, with potential for further reductions if the Fed continues to cut rates. Borrowers are advised to compare fixed-rate home equity loans with variable-rate HELOCs, considering long-term affordability and the risk of rate fluctuations before committing.
