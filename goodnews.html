          <p>Mercedes driver George Russell has publicly stated that his team is in discussions with reigning world champion Max Verstappen regarding a potential move for the 2026 season. This revelation resurfaces speculation about Verstappen's future, as his Red Bull contract, which runs until 2028, is believed to contain exit clauses. The potential move is fueled by Red Bull's recent performance dip and key personnel losses, alongside Mercedes' perceived strength heading into the 2026 regulation changes. Russell expressed no personal concern over his own future with the team, trusting in his performance.</p>

          <p>New York City Mayor Eric Adams has formally announced his bid for reelection, positioning himself as a "blue-collar" candidate with a record of reducing crime and boosting job growth. Running as an independent, Adams contrasted his practical achievements with what he termed the "empty promises" of his primary Democratic rival, Zohran Mamdani. The launch follows a tumultuous first term for Adams, which included a federal investigation that was later dropped. Adams is framing the election as a choice between his experienced leadership and Mamdani's socialist-aligned progressive platform.</p>

          <p>Contemporary Amperex Technology Co. Ltd. (CATL), the world's largest electric vehicle battery manufacturer and a key Tesla supplier, is aggressively expanding its global operations. Following a major IPO in Hong Kong, the company is investing heavily in new European factories in Hungary and Spain, adding to its existing German plant. This push is driven by intense price competition and overcapacity in its domestic Chinese market. CATL also plans to introduce its battery-swapping technology to Europe, a move that could significantly alter the region's EV landscape and address consumer concerns about charging times.</p>

For example, Dayton is now home to a thriving Ahiska Turk community, while Indianapolis hosts the largest Burmese community in the U.S. This positive impact contrasts with new immigration restrictions from the Trump administration, which community leaders argue will harm both the newcomers and the American communities they enrich.</p>

Mamdani, a 33-year-old socialist, defeated former governor Andrew Cuomo by running a disciplined, charismatic campaign focused on affordability and backed by motivated young volunteers. The author suggests this win proves the party's progressive flank is an asset, not a liability, and reflects a base that is tired of the leadership's passivity. Mamdani's success offers a potential new vision for a party that many feel has lost its way.</p>

By the early 2000s, major chains began removing them in favor of more modern solutions.

          <p>Karen Russell's new novel, "The Antidote," explores the fantasy of erasing painful memories against the historical backdrop of the Dust Bowl. The book is set in a Nebraska town where "prairie witches" can store unwanted memories for their clients, allowing them to forget personal traumas and collective guilt, such as the theft of Native American land. The reviewer notes that the novel complicates traditional Dust Bowl narratives by focusing on this "Invisible Loss." Ultimately, the article argues, the book's project is to show that memories, both good and bad, are essential for individual and societal health and identity.</p>
