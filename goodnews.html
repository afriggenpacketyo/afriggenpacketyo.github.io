          <p>First-quarter results from tech giants like Meta and Alphabet exceeded analyst expectations, driven by strong revenue and earnings in the digital advertising market. Amazon's online advertising unit also saw substantial growth. However, executives expressed concerns about slower Asia-specific ad sales and broader macroeconomic uncertainty heading into the rest of the year due to Trump's tariffs. Meta CFO noted reduced spending from Asia-based e-commerce exporters, while Snap withdrew its second-quarter guidance due to economic unpredictability, suggesting a potential shrinking of corporate ad budgets. Optimism remains tempered by concerns about future economic conditions and the impact of tariffs.</p>

          <p>Epic Games has resubmitted Fortnite to Apple's App Store following a court ruling that favored Epic in a contempt case. The game was removed in 2020 after Epic bypassed Apple's commission fees. The recent ruling prohibits Apple from charging commissions on link-outs, paving the way for Fortnite's potential return. Apple is appealing the ruling and could still reject the submission. This move is the latest in the ongoing legal battle between Epic and Apple over app store policies and economics.</p>

          <p>A federal appeals court ruled that Columbia student Mohsen Mahdawi can remain free from immigration custody while he challenges his detention. The court denied the Trump administration's request to re-detain Mahdawi, finding that the government was unlikely to succeed in its arguments. Mahdawi, a pro-Palestinian activist, was detained under a law allowing visa revocation for actions with "adverse foreign policy consequences." His legal team argues his detention violates the First Amendment, while the administration accuses him of antisemitic statements.</p>

          <p>Eli Craig's "Clown in a Cornfield" is reviewed as a generic teens-in-peril slasher film adapted from Adam Cesare's novel. The movie features a murderous clown emerging from cornfields to kill misbehaving teens in a small town. While self-reflective and reverent to genre tropes, it lacks the creativity and sophistication of similar films. The film touches on themes of teens, phones, and the blurring lines between reality and screens, but ultimately prioritizes bloodbaths and bad-guy speeches over deeper social commentary.</p>
