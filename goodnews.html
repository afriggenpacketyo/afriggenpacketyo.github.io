          <p>Thames Water has decided to pause its retention scheme to pay out large bonuses to senior executives after facing heavy criticism. The company had been accused of trying to circumvent forthcoming rules to ban water companies from paying bonuses. Downing Street stated that bosses at the troubled firm rewarding themselves for failure is not acceptable. The company will await guidance from the regulator Ofwat to ensure its approach supports turnaround objectives and public expectations, following concerns over sewage discharges and leaks.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>A new test has been developed that significantly reduces the time it takes to diagnose brain tumors, from weeks to just hours, according to researchers. The "ultra-rapid" method of genetic testing is being hailed as a "game changer" by surgeons, potentially improving care and treatment for thousands of patients. The method, developed by scientists at the University of Nottingham in partnership with Nottingham University Hospitals NHS Trust, has already been used in 50 operations with a 100% success rate. Faster diagnosis allows for more timely and effective treatment, reducing patient anxiety and potentially eliminating the need for multiple surgeries.</p>

The ban, affecting approximately 150,000 food stamp recipients in the state, is intended to steer taxpayer dollars toward wholesome foods. Other states are seeking similar waivers, following decades of Agriculture Department denials. Past resistance stemmed from concerns over feasibility and the complex politics involving corporate interests and anti-poverty groups.</p>
