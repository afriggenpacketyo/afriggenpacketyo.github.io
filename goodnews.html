          <p>This article assesses the earning potential of an 18-month certificate of deposit (CD) in early June 2025, considering the Federal Reserve's interest rate cut campaign. Despite the slight decrease in interest rates, the article illustrates how savers can still earn a substantial return, providing calculations for various deposit amounts at different interest rates. The benefits of an 18-month CD include extended protection against market uncertainty due to its fixed interest rate and the fact that alternatives like high-yield savings accounts have variable rates that may decline. An 18-month CD could be a beneficial place to keep some money, offering both growth potential and financial protection. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>Aston Villa striker Ollie Watkins has withdrawn from the England squad due to a minor injury, causing him to miss the World Cup qualifying match in Andorra and a friendly against Senegal. There are no plans to call up a replacement, and England will prepare for both games with a 25-man squad. Watkins scored 17 goals in 54 games last season for Villa as they finished sixth in the Premier League. Thomas Tuchel is assessing his options before the World Cup next year.</p>

          <p>The International Pride Orchestra performed at the Strathmore Music Center in Maryland after being snubbed by the Kennedy Center. The event was a celebration of WorldPride and a rebuke to Donald Trump's policies toward the LGBTQ+ community.

The event included performances by drag queens, a pianist, and the Gay Men's Chorus of Washington, with both Stars and Stripes and rainbow flags hoisted at the close.</p>

          <p>Alex Warren's song "Ordinary" has achieved its 12th week at number one in the UK, making it the longest chart reign since Ed Sheeran's "Shape of You" in 2017. The song, written for Warren's wife, has been streamed 107 million times in the UK and has broken the record for the most consecutive weeks at number one by a US artist. Despite its success, changing media habits mean "Ordinary" hasn't become a ubiquitous phenomenon in the way that previous long-running number ones have. The song has also become a popular wedding song, with Warren's label releasing a Wedding Version.</p>
