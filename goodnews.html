          <h2>Dodgers Unlikely to Alter Trade Deadline Strategy Despite Max Muncy's Knee Injury</h2>
          <div class="timestamp">2025-07-04 22:27:47 EDT</div>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>The Los Angeles Dodgers are maintaining their trade deadline plans after third baseman Max Muncy sustained a knee injury that was less severe than initially feared. Muncy suffered a bone bruise, not a ligament tear, and is expected to miss approximately six weeks, allowing him to return before the playoffs. Confident in his recovery and content to rely on internal options like Tommy Edman in the interim, the team's management has indicated they do not feel pressured to make a major trade to replace him. This cautious optimism stems from avoiding a season-ending catastrophe for a key offensive player.</p>

          <p>Authorities in New York City temporarily closed a portion of the beach in Far Rockaway, Queens, on the Fourth of July after multiple sharks were spotted swimming very close to beachgoers. City officials utilized drone technology to monitor the situation and ensure public safety, reopening the beach after about an hour. This incident comes as New York state officials, including Governor Kathy Hochul, have been increasing shark surveillance measures along Long Island's popular beaches to protect residents and visitors during the busy summer holiday season.</p>

          <p>As the United States increases scrutiny of China's shipbuilding industry, South Korea and Japan are strategically moving to strengthen their own sectors. South Korea's new presidential administration has labeled the domestic industry as being in a "major crisis" and has committed to revitalizing it through new growth policies. These measures focus on advancing the development of future vessels, including autonomous and eco-friendly ships, through enhanced digitalization and automation. The goal is to re-establish the nation as a global maritime power that leads in innovation and production.</p>

          <h2>Indian Artisans Criticize Luxury Brand Prada for Uncredited Use of Kolhapuri Sandal Design</h2>

          <p>Artisans in Kolhapur, India, have accused the Italian luxury brand Prada of cultural appropriation after it released a line of sandals that strongly resemble the traditional, handcrafted Kolhapuri design without any attribution. The controversy has shed light on the struggles of the nearly 5,000 local artisans, many from marginalized communities, who craft the iconic leather footwear for modest wages. While the backlash has prompted Prada to acknowledge the sandals' origins, local politicians and trade groups are now pushing for better legal protection and financial recognition for the craft's cultural legacy.</p>

          <div class="timestamp">2025-07-04 19:10:52 EDT</div>
        </div>
        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>A new study has revealed that tiny marine animals called zooplankton are unsung heroes in the fight against climate change, locking away vast amounts of carbon in the Southern Ocean. Through an epic annual migration, these creatures feast on carbon-rich phytoplankton near the surface, grow fat, and then sink hundreds of meters into the deep ocean to hibernate. This process effectively sequesters an amount of carbon equivalent to the annual emissions of 55 million cars, a far greater contribution to regulating the planet's climate than scientists had previously understood.</p>

          <p>Dr. Bishara Bahbah, a Harvard-educated Palestinian-American professor from Arizona, has become a key, if unlikely, figure in Gaza ceasefire negotiations. This article details how Hamas contacted Dr. Bahbah due to his influential connections within the Trump administration, establishing him as a crucial backchannel for communication with the U.S. He played a role in building trust between the parties, which contributed to the "good faith" release of an Israeli-American hostage in May, demonstrating the potential of this unconventional diplomatic channel to make progress in the intractable conflict.</p>

          <p>A pair of male Humboldt penguins, named Scampi and Flounder, are successfully raising a chick at the Chester Zoo in the U.K. Zoo experts gave the pair one of two eggs laid by another couple, a strategy to improve the survival odds for both chicks. The birth is especially significant as Humboldt penguins are listed as a vulnerable species, and the zoo's colony is part of an international conservation breeding program. This heartwarming story also highlights that same-sex parenting is not unusual in the penguin world, with couples sharing incubation and feeding duties.</p>

          <p>Hamas has delivered what it calls a "positive response" to the latest US-backed proposal for a ceasefire and hostage release in Gaza, stating it is ready to enter negotiations. However, a senior Palestinian official familiar with the talks clarified that Hamas accepted the general framework but requested several key amendments. These include a US guarantee that hostilities will not resume if permanent ceasefire talks fail and changes to aid distribution and Israeli troop withdrawal plans. This development puts the focus back on Israel and the US to address the requested changes and continue the diplomatic process.</p>

          <p>A board-certified cardiologist, drawing on two decades of experience treating heart attacks, has identified five common foods he considers "toxic" and never gives to his own children. The list includes microwave popcorn due to chemicals in the lining, sugary flavored yogurts, processed meats like bacon and hot dogs, sugary cereals and drinks, and deep-fried foods. He argues that these items contribute to inflammation and chronic illness later in life. The article provides healthier, home-prepared alternatives for each category, advocating for a diet focused on whole, unprocessed foods.</p>
