          <p>CNBC's Jim Cramer is challenging Warren Buffett's long-standing advice for average investors to primarily use low-cost S&P 500 index funds. While Buffett advocates for this passive strategy, arguing it consistently outperforms most active managers, Cramer suggests a hybrid approach. He recommends dedicating half of a portfolio to index funds and the other half to a select few individual stocks that investors have thoroughly researched. Cramer contends that average investors can achieve above-average returns by picking winning stocks, a view that contrasts with Buffett's caution that stock picking is a difficult endeavor best left to professionals.

          <p>DoorDash has introduced a new fleet of autonomous delivery robots, named "Dots," on the streets of Mesa, a suburb of Phoenix. These five-foot-tall red bots are designed to handle smaller orders, carrying up to 30 pounds at speeds of up to 20 miles per hour. The company states that Dots are the first of their kind capable of navigating bike lanes, roads, and sidewalks to optimize delivery routes. An AI-powered platform determines which orders are most suitable for robotic delivery, aiming to create a more efficient and economical system for local commerce that doesn't always require a full-sized vehicle.</p>

The devices feature faster processors and an "Omnisense" platform that provides Alexa with enhanced contextual awareness, allowing it to recognize users and offer personalized insights. This hardware refresh is seen as Amazon's response to the growing competition in the generative AI space from rivals like OpenAI and Google. The new devices, which start at $99, represent a significant step in Amazon's effort to modernize its hardware for the AI era.</p>

        </div>
        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Following a recent interest rate cut by the Federal Reserve, a Home Equity Line of Credit (HELOC) has become a more affordable borrowing option for homeowners. For an $80,000 HELOC, current average rates would result in monthly payments of approximately $966 for a 10-year repayment period or $759 for a 15-year period. These costs are lower than those for home equity loans, personal loans, or credit cards. Because HELOCs have variable rates, borrowers could see their payments decrease further if the Fed continues to cut rates, though they also face the risk of rates increasing in the future.

          <p>Conductor Gustavo Dudamel has launched his 17th and final season as music director of the Los Angeles Philharmonic, an event marked by a blend of nostalgia and forward-looking artistry. The opening concert at Walt Disney Concert Hall featured the premiere of "Earth Between Oceans," a new work by Ellen Reid jointly commissioned with the New York Philharmonic, where Dudamel will soon take the helm. The performance, which also included Richard Strauss’s “Alpine Symphony,” was met with enthusiastic applause. The evening highlighted the orchestra's dynamic sound and showcased new principal players, signaling a vibrant, albeit transitional, period for the acclaimed ensemble.</p>

          <h2>Understanding the 7-Year Rule for Credit Card Debt on Credit Reports</h2>
          <div class="timestamp">2025-09-30 13:48:22 EDT</div>
        </div>
        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>The widely discussed "7-year rule" for credit card debt primarily refers to the Fair Credit Reporting Act, which mandates that most negative information, such as late payments and charge-offs, must be removed from a credit report after seven years. This clock typically starts from the date of the first missed payment. Additionally, states have statutes of limitations, often around seven years, that prevent creditors from suing to collect old debts. However, the debt itself does not disappear and collectors may still attempt to contact the individual. Making a payment on an old debt can sometimes restart the statute of limitations, making it crucial for consumers to understand their rights.</p>

          <p>The Trump administration has reached an agreement with Pfizer to significantly reduce the cost of certain prescription drugs for American consumers. As part of the deal, Pfizer will offer many medications at discounted prices on a new government-operated website called "TrumpRx" and will sell drugs to Medicaid at the lowest prices offered to other developed nations. In exchange, Pfizer will receive a three-year exemption from threatened pharmaceutical tariffs, contingent on the company investing $70 billion to move its drug manufacturing and research facilities to the U.S. The move is part of a broader White House push to align U.S. drug prices with lower international costs.</p>

          <p>Prime Minister Keir Starmer has announced a new educational target for the UK, aiming for two-thirds of young people to attend university, pursue further education, or enter a high-quality apprenticeship by age 25. This marks a significant policy shift from the previous Labour government's goal of sending 50% of young people to university, placing a greater emphasis on vocational and technical skills. The new ambition includes seeing at least 10% of young people in higher technical courses or apprenticeships by 2040. The move has been welcomed by industry and education groups as a step toward valuing skills training equally with traditional academic degrees.</p>

Drawing from her own experience of collapsing from exhaustion in 2007, she argues that scientific evidence shows people are more effective, creative, and resilient when they prioritize rest and well-being. Huffington believes there is a "collective delusion" that equates long hours with achievement, particularly affecting young professionals. She advocates for taking small, incremental "micro steps" to build healthier habits, asserting that taking time to recharge is not a luxury but a crucial strategy for sustainable success.</p>

Parker shares his own experience of losing his writerly fire, a quality he and a friend termed "the odeness," after publishing a book of odes. He advises that to rekindle inspiration, a writer should broaden their range beyond familiar topics and explore more abstract or unusual subjects. He suggests that odes don't always need to be rapturous or joyful; they simply need to connect with the essential, unique quality of their subject.

          <p>A new Hulu documentary, "Lilith Fair: Building a Mystery," revisits the groundbreaking all-female music festival of the late 1990s, challenging the caricatures that have overshadowed its significance. Co-founded by Sarah McLachlan, the festival was a pragmatic response to an industry that marginalized female artists, refusing to play their songs back-to-back on the radio. The film highlights the sense of community, safety, and empowerment the tour created for both performers and audiences. It serves as a historical corrective, exploring how Lilith Fair proved the commercial and cultural power of women in music and what its sense of collective purpose means today.</p>

          <p>Despite recent interest rate cuts by the Federal Reserve, savers can still earn a substantial return of $1,000 or more with a certificate of deposit (CD) account by using a strategic approach. With current rates around 4.50%, depositing $24,000 into a one-year CD can yield over $1,000 in interest. Alternatively, a smaller deposit of $8,200 in a three-year CD could achieve a similar return over a longer period. As rates are expected to continue falling, financial experts advise savers to act promptly to lock in today's relatively high rates before they decline further. (not investment advice)</p>
