          <h2>Chinese Army Scientists Propose More Powerful 'X-Railgun' Design</h2>
          <div class="timestamp">2025-07-18 23:00:10 EDT</div>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Scientists from the People's Liberation Army Engineering University have proposed a new design for an electromagnetic railgun that could nearly double the power of the current naval version. The innovative 'X-railgun' design involves cross-stacking two railguns, which would increase bore pressure and allow for heavier projectiles. This addresses a key limitation of the existing technology, where shells are too light for significant impact against large targets like ships. The research aims to overcome power constraints that have hampered the military application of China's pioneering railgun technology.</p>

          <h2>Poll Finds Strong Public Support for US Return to the Moon and Mars Exploration</h2>

          <p>A recent CBS News/YouGov poll indicates that a majority of Americans, approximately two-thirds, favor the United States returning to the moon and eventually sending astronauts to Mars. Support is particularly strong among younger Americans who did not witness the original moon landing. The survey also reveals that most people continue to view the 1969 moon landing as a worthwhile achievement that contributes to national pride. This broad, bipartisan support suggests a sustained public interest in space exploration and its potential technological benefits for society.</p>

          <h2>China's Open-Source AI Models Challenge Dominance of US Tech Giants</h2>
          <div class="timestamp">2025-07-18 22:00:14 EDT</div>

          <p>Chinese technology firms like DeepSeek and Alibaba are redefining the global artificial intelligence landscape by championing open-source AI models. This approach, which makes source code publicly available for use and modification, presents a significant alternative to the closed, proprietary systems of US companies like OpenAI and Google. The release of powerful, free-to-use Chinese models has spurred a wave of AI applications in China and gained support from developers worldwide. Analysts suggest this open-source movement poses a serious challenge to Silicon Valley's established dominance in the field.</p>

          <p>President Donald Trump announced that ten more hostages held in Gaza are expected to be released "very shortly," as his administration continues to push for a 60-day ceasefire between Israel and Hamas. The proposed truce deal involves the return of these hostages and the remains of others in exchange for Israel releasing an unspecified number of Palestinian prisoners. The announcement comes amid ongoing diplomatic efforts, including a recent visit by Israel's Mossad director to Washington to discuss relocating Palestinians from Gaza with US support. Trump has been optimistic about a ceasefire deal being finalized soon.</p>

          <p>The Australian government has delivered M1A1 Abrams tanks to Ukraine as part of a significant military aid package to support the country's defense against the ongoing Russian invasion. The tanks are a component of a A$245 million ($160 million) assistance package, with most of the 49 promised vehicles now in Ukrainian possession. As one of the largest non-NATO contributors, Australia has provided over A$1.5 billion in total aid, including ammunition and defense equipment. This move underscores Australia's continued commitment to supporting Ukraine and holding Russia accountable for the conflict.</p>

          <p>President Trump has signed the GENIUS Act, a landmark bipartisan bill establishing a regulatory framework for stablecoins, a type of cryptocurrency pegged to assets like the U.S. dollar. The legislation provides consumer protections and allows banks and other financial institutions to issue their own stablecoins, a move hailed by the administration as a major step in financial technology. The signing follows a week of crypto-focused legislation in Congress, which the White House and industry leaders see as a way to integrate digital currency into the mainstream financial system.

          <p>An adviser for the Bank for International Settlements (BIS) has warned that the global financial system must adapt its regulations for a future dominated by tokenized assets. The rise of stablecoins, which are digital tokens backed by real-world assets, presents new challenges for anti-money laundering efforts and customer verification due to their cross-border and pseudonymous nature. This call for new rules comes as the market for digital currencies gains momentum, driven by the Trump administration's supportive stance and rising asset values, attracting increased scrutiny from global regulators.

          <p>President Trump was recently diagnosed with chronic venous insufficiency (CVI) after experiencing mild swelling in his lower legs. According to his physician, the condition is benign, common in older adults, and involves vein valves not working effectively, causing blood to pool in the legs. CVI affects about one in three U.S. adults and can cause aching or heaviness, which typically worsens throughout the day. Standard treatments include lifestyle changes like exercise, leg elevation, and wearing compression stockings, with minimally invasive procedures available for more serious cases.</p>

          <p>The group of Silicon Valley billionaires behind the "California Forever" new-city project has announced plans for a large-scale manufacturing hub within its proposed development in Solano County. Dubbed the "Solano Foundry," the 2,100-acre site aims to attract companies in defense, aerospace, robotics, and other advanced industries, with the goal of bringing manufacturing jobs back to the state. The project's CEO, Jan Sramek, promoted the vision as restoring the magic of "designed in California, made in California."

          <p>Pest control experts and entomologists in the UK report that conditions are ripe for a strong wasp season, following a warm and dry spring. While official data is not yet available, anecdotal evidence suggests an increase in wasp activity and larger nests appearing earlier than usual. Although often disliked, experts emphasize the crucial ecological role of wasps as apex predators and natural pest controllers. To coexist peacefully, they advise against swatting at wasps and suggest distracting them with a small amount of a sugary substance placed away from picnic areas.</p>

          <p>A new stage show in Liverpool, "The Legend of Rooney's Ring," is a fantasy spoof inspired by the lives of football star Wayne Rooney and his wife, Coleen. Written by a co-creator of the sitcom "Motherland," the play merges a local myth about Coleen's lost engagement ring with a J.R.R. Tolkien-style quest. The production is a comedic, medieval caper that portrays the famous couple as heroic fantasy characters. The writer and cast emphasize that the show is an affectionate homage, celebrating the couple's resilience rather than targeting them with ridicule.</p>

          <p>Northern Ireland is expanding its respiratory syncytial virus (RSV) immunization program to include premature babies, who are at high risk from the common respiratory virus. Starting this autumn, a long-acting injection will be offered to eligible infants who were born too early to benefit from the maternal vaccination program. RSV is a leading cause of hospitalization in young children, and this new vaccine offers approximately 80% protection. Health officials say the move will strengthen the health service's winter preparedness and better protect the most vulnerable infants.</p>
