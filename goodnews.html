          <p>The US Supreme Court has allowed the Trump administration to continue freezing over $4 billion in foreign aid, siding with the executive branch's power in foreign affairs. The court's conservative majority stated that the potential harm to Trump's conduct of foreign affairs outweighed the potential harm to aid recipients, though liberal justices dissented, arguing the move conflicts with the separation of powers. The Trump administration has been downsizing US foreign aid operations, criticizing them as wasteful or contrary to US foreign policy. Humanitarian groups warn that these cuts could have dire consequences for global health, potentially leading to millions of additional deaths. Optimism score is 65.</p>
