          <p>Following a week of aerial attacks, President Trump announced that Israel and Iran have agreed to a ceasefire. The agreement includes two 12-hour ceasefire periods before the war is considered over. This announcement came after Iran reportedly launched a missile attack on the United States‚Äô Al Udeid Air Base in Qatar, in response to the U.S. bombing of Iranian nuclear sites. While there were no reported casualties at the base, the situation remains tense as both sides navigate the fragile ceasefire agreement.</p>

He criticized the administration's portrayal of him as violent and a terrorist, stating there is no place for antisemitism in the Palestinian movement.

One robotaxi was seen driving the wrong way, while another braked abruptly in traffic.

This launch falls short of Elon Musk's promises of full autonomy, while competitors like Waymo are already operating commercial robotaxi fleets.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Iran retaliated for the U.S. strike on its nuclear facilities, but the damage was limited, and there were no American casualties. President Trump claimed that all parties had agreed to a ceasefire and that Iran had gotten it out of their "system." If no additional Iranian attacks occur, Trump seems inclined to hold his fire, hoping for earnest negotiations. This scenario suggests that Trump's high-risk maneuver may yield positive results, similar to the aftermath of the Soleimani killing in 2020.</p>

Disney remains optimistic that "Elio" will be discovered by families and moviegoers throughout the summer, similar to "Elemental."

          <p>China is unlikely to deploy its navy to secure the Strait of Hormuz if Iran threatens to close it, according to a top U.S. analyst. Instead, China would likely rely on quiet negotiations and self-interest, as demonstrated by its agreement with Houthi rebels in the Red Sea. China's primary focus is protecting its own interests rather than policing global waterways, even though it depends heavily on Middle Eastern oil. Its approach will remain shaped by long-standing economic interests.</p>
