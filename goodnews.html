The executive order also allows corporations to sponsor individuals for $2 million. This initiative is expected to replace existing EB-1 and EB-2 visa categories, with officials suggesting it provides a clear measure of a person's value to the country. Additionally, a new $100,000 fee will be imposed on H-1B visas for skilled foreign workers. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>Qingzhou Wang, a principal executive of the Wuhan-based company Amarvel Biotech, has been sentenced to 25 years in a U.S. prison for trafficking fentanyl precursor chemicals. Wang and a colleague were convicted of shipping hundreds of kilograms of these chemicals into the United States, often disguised as everyday goods, and laundering the profits through cryptocurrency. This case marked the first time the U.S. prosecuted Chinese companies for trafficking the chemicals directly into the country, rather than through Mexico, drawing protests from Beijing.</p>

        </div>
        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Recent threats from the Trump administration to revoke television networks' broadcast licenses have raised questions about the Federal Communications Commission's (FCC) actual powers. The FCC, an independent agency, is responsible for issuing licenses to local TV and radio stations, requiring them to operate in the "public interest." While it does not directly regulate national networks or cable channels, it can effectively block corporate mergers by denying the transfer of licenses. Experts note that while the FCC has significant leeway, revoking a license is a complex process and would likely face major legal challenges based on First Amendment rights.</p>

          <p>President Trump has announced that he and Chinese President Xi Jinping approved a deal concerning the future of TikTok's U.S. operations during a phone call, though Beijing's confirmation was less definitive. The reported deal would see TikTok's U.S. business sold to a group of American investors, allowing it to continue operating while using algorithm technology licensed from its Chinese parent company, ByteDance. A key point of negotiation remains the ownership of the powerful algorithm that serves content to its 170 million American users. Some U.S. lawmakers have expressed concern over potential continued influence from the Chinese Communist Party.</p>

          <p>Tejasvi Manoj, a 17-year-old from Plano, Texas, has been recognized as Time magazine's "Kid of the Year" for her work in protecting senior citizens from financial scams. After her own grandfather was targeted, she created a website and an AI-powered app called Shield Seniors to educate older adults on how to identify and report fraudulent messages. Manoj visits senior centers to teach cybersecurity, addressing a growing problem that saw adults over 60 lose $4.8 billion to scams in 2024. She hopes to launch her app publicly by the end of the year.</p>

          <p>Facing saturated markets and slowing demand in Europe and the U.S., many Chinese export companies are now targeting Southeast Asia as a key growth area. A major trade fair in Nanning is serving as a testing ground for these firms to connect with buyers from the region, which offers fast-growing economies and a large, young consumer base. Companies that have long relied on Western markets see the geographic and demographic advantages of Southeast Asia as offering significant new potential for expansion and sales.

          <p>A U.S. federal judge has thrown out a $15 billion defamation lawsuit filed by President Trump against The New York Times, criticizing the complaint's language as improper and politically motivated. The judge ruled that the 85-page filing was excessively long and resembled a "megaphone for public relations" rather than a serious legal document. While the judge did not rule on the legal merits of the case, Trump's lawyers were given 28 days to refile an amended, more professional complaint. The lawsuit had alleged that several articles and a book by two reporters were intended to undermine his presidential campaign.</p>

          <h2>Explainer: How Broadcast TV Licenses Work Amid Threats from Trump Administration</h2>
          <div class="timestamp">2025-09-19 19:21:49 EDT</div>
        </div>
        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Recent threats by President Trump and the FCC Chairman to revoke broadcast licenses have highlighted the federal government's regulatory power over media. Unlike cable channels, broadcast networks like ABC, NBC, and CBS require licenses from the FCC to use public airwaves, obligating them to operate in the "public interest." While revoking a license is a complex process that would face legal challenges, the threat itself can create pressure, especially for station owners like Nexstar seeking federal approval for mergers. Experts consider the use of this power to police political content to be an unprecedented and contentious issue.</p>

This influx of capital is seen as a plan to sprinkle "Silicon Valley stardust" on the UK's research hubs, potentially defining the nation's economy for decades, though it also raises questions about economic dependency.

          <p>Actor Cillian Murphy, reflecting on his role as Tommy Shelby, has emphasized that he is nothing like the "psychopathic gangster" he portrayed for nearly a decade in "Peaky Blinders." He described the opportunity to grow with a character over six series as a defining "gift and a privilege." While promoting his new film "Steve," Murphy confirmed a "Peaky Blinders" movie is forthcoming from Netflix, but stated the plot remains a closely guarded secret. He attributes the show's massive success to its writing and its arrival at a specific moment in time.</p>
