          <p>Johnathan Walton, a podcaster who was instrumental in the capture and conviction of international con artist Marianne "Mair" Smyth, has voiced his disappointment with her four-year prison sentence in Northern Ireland. Smyth was convicted of defrauding mortgage clients of over $155,000, but this represents only a fraction of her extensive history of scams across the US and UK. Walton, who chronicled his own victimization by Smyth in a popular podcast, believes the sentence is too lenient for a serial fraudster he describes as incapable of changing. The case highlights the long reach of modern cons and the difficult path to securing justice for victims.</p>

          <p>Pratika Rawal, a 25-year-old opening batter for India, has become a key player at the Women's World Cup, realizing a dream her father once held for himself. Supported unwaveringly by her father, a former university-level cricketer, Rawal began playing at age three and quickly showed immense promise in a country where women's cricket has fought for recognition. Despite being overlooked in the Women's Premier League auction, she earned her first national call-up shortly after and has since become a consistent top-scorer. Her journey highlights a story of personal dedication, familial support, and breaking barriers in professional sports.</p>

          <p>A new blood test called Galleri has demonstrated significant potential for early cancer detection, according to results from a large-scale trial in North America. The test successfully identified DNA fragments from over 50 different types of cancer, more than half of which were found at an early, more treatable stage. Notably, three-quarters of the cancers detected are types that currently have no routine screening programs, such as pancreatic and ovarian cancer. While researchers are optimistic that this could revolutionize cancer screening, further data, including from an ongoing NHS trial, is needed to confirm if it reduces mortality rates.</p>

          <p>As the global resale market for luxury goods is projected to reach $360 billion by 2030, robust authentication has become the new gold standard for credible platforms. With counterfeit items becoming increasingly sophisticated "superfakes," companies like Carousell and Bunjang are investing heavily in verification processes that combine expert inspection with AI technology to build consumer trust. This focus on authenticity, often backed by money-back guarantees, is fueling the market's expansion, which is growing three times faster than the primary luxury market. Affordability and access to rare items are the primary drivers for consumers entering the pre-owned space.</p>

          <p>A weekend trip to a Butlin's holiday park unexpectedly saved Charlotte Morjaria's life after a minor accident led to the discovery of a large, cancerous tumor on her kidney. The 31-year-old from Newport went to the hospital believing she had a broken rib after being playfully lifted over someone's shoulder. A precautionary CT scan revealed the previously undetected tumor, leading to a diagnosis of a rare form of kidney cancer. Following successful surgery to remove her kidney, she is now cancer-free, attributing the life-saving diagnosis to what she calls a "miracle" mishap during her holiday.</p>

          <p>A suitcase found under his late father's bed led Antony Easton on a decade-long journey to uncover a hidden family history and a vast fortune lost under Nazi rule. The documents revealed his father, born Peter Eisner, was part of a wealthy Jewish family in Berlin whose billion-dollar steel empire and properties were forcibly sold or seized in the 1930s. The investigation has enabled the family to begin reclaiming stolen artwork from museums, including a painting that was a key clue in the discovery. The process has been less about money and more about reconnecting with the real people his ancestors were before the Holocaust.</p>

          <p>Alibaba Cloud has introduced a new computing solution named Aegaeon that it claims can reduce the number of Nvidia graphics processing units (GPUs) needed to run AI models by up to 82 percent. The system works by efficiently pooling GPU resources to serve multiple AI models concurrently, addressing the common issue of underutilized hardware. During a three-month beta test in Alibaba's model marketplace, the system cut the required number of high-end Nvidia GPUs from 1,192 to just 213. This innovation could lead to significant cost savings and improved efficiency for cloud service providers running large-scale AI operations.</p>
