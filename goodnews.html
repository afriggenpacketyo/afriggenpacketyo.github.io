          <p>U.S. Steel shares experienced a surge following President Trump's approval of its merger with Japan's Nippon Steel, contingent upon a national security agreement with the U.S. government. The agreement includes a golden share for the U.S. government, granting the president veto power over decisions to relocate U.S. Steel's headquarters, move the company outside the U.S., rename U.S. Steel, transfer production or jobs outside the U.S., and close or idle plants before certain time frames. Trump has described the deal as a "partnership" rather than a merger, while U.S. Steel has confirmed it will become a wholly-owned subsidiary of Nippon Steel North America. The transaction is expected to be completed promptly, pending customary closing conditions. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>All 50 states, along with Washington, D.C., and four U.S. territories, have agreed to a $7.4 billion settlement with Purdue Pharma and the Sackler families over their role in the opioid crisis. The settlement will end the Sacklers' ownership of Purdue and bar them from making, selling, or marketing opioids in the U.S. The funds will support opioid addiction treatment, prevention, and recovery programs over the next 15 years. A significant amount of the funds will be distributed in the first three years, with the Sacklers paying $1.5 billion and Purdue paying approximately $900 million in the first payment.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>A majority of Canadians do not want the Canada Pension Plan Investment Board (CPPIB) to prioritize investing in Canada over maximizing returns, according to a new survey. Seventy-two percent of respondents believe the CPPIB should invest wherever it earns the most returns for Canadians. Support for the fund investing more in Canada is highest among people aged 18 to 24, with 39 percent in favor. The CPPIB's primary goal is to maximize long-term investment returns without undue risk, and it had assets of $714.4 billion as of the end of March.</p>

          <p>Consumer Reports has released its latest recommendations for the best sunscreens to protect against sun damage. The report highlights that sunscreen should be worn year-round, not just in the summer months, to shield skin from harmful rays. Lotion sunscreens are preferred because it is easier to see how much is being applied, with a teaspoon advised for each body part. The report also advises choosing sunscreens with an SPF of 30 or higher, and applying 15-30 minutes before sun exposure and reapplying every two hours after swimming or sweating.</p>
