        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Japanese Finance Minister Katsunobu Kato and U.S. Treasury Secretary Scott Bessent concurred that the dollar-yen exchange rate accurately reflects economic fundamentals during bilateral tariff negotiations. This acknowledgment implies that the yen's previous weakness against the dollar should not be a point of contention in tariff discussions, contrasting President Trump's view that it contributes to the U.S. trade deficit with Japan. Kato voiced concerns about the impact of the Trump administration's tariffs on the global economy and financial markets. Japan remains firmly opposed to additional tariffs, particularly on auto exports to the U.S., a key economic driver. (not investment advice)</p>

          <h2>UK Politics Grapples with Lingering Concerns Over Immigration</h2>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>The article analyzes the enduring impact of immigration on UK politics, tracing its evolution from a class-based system to one influenced by identity politics. The 1968 Race Relations Act and Enoch Powell's "Rivers of Blood" speech are highlighted as pivotal moments that shifted voter allegiances. Despite efforts by successive prime ministers, public concerns about immigration persist, driven by factors like the influx of Eastern European workers after the EU expansion in 2004. The current Labour government, elected on a promise to reduce migration, faces the challenge of balancing economic needs with public anxieties, navigating a complex landscape of evolving attitudes and concentrated hostility in certain segments of the population.</p>

          <p>Ford Motor Co. has filed a $100 million lawsuit against several Southern California law firms and attorneys, accusing them of a fraudulent scheme involving the state's Lemon Law. Ford alleges that these firms inflated their legal fees by billing for hours never worked or reporting being in multiple places at once. The lawsuit claims the lawyers violated the Racketeering Influenced and Corrupt Organizations (RICO) Act by working together in the scheme. Ford's investigation uncovered payments for legal work that was physically impossible to have occurred.</p>

Ulbrich said he was never concerned about his job security and felt supported by the organization, including owner Arthur Blank. He said he is still deciding on disciplinary measures for his son, but believes the experience will ultimately make him a better person.

While President Trump has offered special treatment to Afrikaner asylum applicants, some community members argue that Whites remain economically strong in South Africa. They acknowledge violent attacks on farmers, but emphasize that racial motives are not generally a factor.

The weather service's heat advisory expired, but inland areas still experienced high temperatures. A brush fire in the Sepulveda Basin caused minor injuries and disruptions. Forecasters warn of a heightened risk of brush fires due to breezy conditions, but recent rains have lowered the overall risk.</p>
