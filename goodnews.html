        </div>
        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>The English government plans to extend free school meals to an additional 500,000 pupils by September 2026, regardless of parental income for those receiving Universal Credit, which will save parents ¬£500 a year and lift 100,000 children out of poverty. This initiative, costing ¬£1 billion up to 2029, aims to address child poverty, although the Institute for Fiscal Studies suggests other measures, like lifting the two-child limit, might be more effective. The announcement has been welcomed by the education sector and anti-poverty organizations, who see it as a significant step towards alleviating hunger in schools, though some call for further action to address child poverty comprehensively. The government is expected to announce its broader child poverty strategy in the autumn.</p>

          <p>Serena Williams considers winning the 2017 Australian Open while nine weeks pregnant as the most important moment of her career. She recalls the physical challenges of early pregnancy, including fatigue and breathlessness, which forced her to rely on aces and short points. Williams kept her pregnancy a secret, with only Venus knowing, and she expressed feeling bad about competing against her sister in the final under those circumstances. Early pregnancy can be intense, with the body undergoing a huge transformation and a surge in hormones often leading to fatigue, breathlessness and nausea.</p>

          <p>Women using weight-loss jabs like Wegovy and Mounjaro have been warned by the UK's medicines regulator to use effective contraception. The Medicines and Healthcare products Regulatory Agency (MHRA) states it's unknown if these medicines could harm an unborn baby and warns they may reduce the effectiveness of the contraceptive pill, particularly in overweight or obese women. The MHRA advises using contraception while taking GLP-1 medicines and for a period afterward before trying to conceive, specifying two months for Wegovy/Ozempic and one month for Mounjaro. There are concerns that the growing popularity of these 'skinny jabs' means many women aren't using them safely or receiving proper advice.</p>
