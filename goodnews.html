          <p>Independent movie theaters are adopting creative business models to thrive amidst competition from streaming services and high ticket prices. The article highlights several examples, including filmmaker Kevin Smith's Smodcastle Cinemas in New Jersey, which operates as a non-profit and hosts special events. Similarly, Los Angeles' Vidiots has evolved from a video store into a non-profit community hub with a theater, while New York's Metrograph succeeds as a for-profit by offering a boutique experience with a restaurant, bar, and bookstore. These theaters emphasize community-building to ensure their survival.</p>

          <p>In recognition of the U.N.'s International Day of the Girl on October 11, this article showcases the work of photojournalist Danielle Villasana. Her photographs, taken over the last decade across the globe, celebrate the strength and persistence of girls and young women facing significant adversity, from migration to gender-based violence. The article features an image of a young Venezuelan migrant, Yefreannys Isamar Muñoz López, joyfully doing math with her father at the U.S.-Mexico border. Villasana's work aims to convey the message that with proper support and resources, girls are an unstoppable force for positive change.</p>

Berkshire has been actively increasing its holdings, with recent disclosures showing its stake in Mitsui and Mitsubishi has surpassed 10%.

          <p>Wales's Plaid Cymru party has announced a plan to offer trainee teachers incentive payments of up to £30,000 if they win the next Senedd election. The policy aims to address a teacher recruitment crisis by encouraging new educators to remain and work in Wales for at least five years after qualifying. The incentives would be targeted toward priority subjects like math and science, as well as Welsh-medium teaching, with the goal of matching similar financial packages offered in England by 2030. The party estimates the program would cost £6-7 million, funded from money already designated for curriculum support.</p>

          <p>Speaking at the Cliveden Literary Festival just days after the author's death, Queen Camilla shared a humorous and affectionate memory of her friend, Dame Jilly Cooper. The Queen recalled an anecdote where the beloved 88-year-old novelist once declared her intention to "get so absolutely plastered tonight, darling." Camilla also noted that the Vesper Martini, famous as James Bond's drink, was a favorite of Dame Jilly's. The tribute was part of the Queen's opening speech at the festival, where she also met with authors like Sir Salman Rushdie and Sir Ian Rankin.</p>

          <p>This article reflects on the nature of regret, describing it as the emotional consequence of free will and an unavoidable part of the human experience. While looking back with "what if" questions can be painful, the piece suggests that regret doesn't have to be solely about the past. By allowing oneself to experience the sadness, disappointment, or guilt associated with past mistakes, it's possible to learn something valuable about oneself in the present. The article posits that engaging with regret thoughtfully can be a tool for self-discovery rather than just a source of wallowing.</p>

          <p>The world is on track to produce a record amount of grain this year, highlighting a major modern achievement: the dramatic reduction in large-scale famines. Thanks to advancements like the Green Revolution, synthetic fertilizers, and improved irrigation, global food production and calories available per person have steadily climbed for decades. While hunger and malnutrition persist, famines today are now far rarer and are more often caused by political failures, such as war and trade restrictions, rather than crop failures. The article celebrates this progress while warning that climate change and protectionist policies remain significant threats to global food security.</p>

          <p>Jennifer Choate, a 27-year-old woman, is sharing her story of surviving an amniotic fluid embolism, a rare but often fatal complication of childbirth. During what seemed like a normal induced labor, Choate's heart suddenly stopped after amniotic fluid entered her bloodstream, causing a catastrophic shutdown of her major organs. Thanks to the quick action of her medical team, she was resuscitated, and her daughter was delivered safely via C-section.
