          <p>Chinese President Xi Jinping has stressed the importance of regulating the exercise of power as a crucial measure in the fight against corruption. Speaking at an event, he called for an improved institutional mechanism to unify the authorization, use, and control of power, making it transparent and traceable. Xi urged party members to remember that all power is granted by the people and must be used responsibly. This statement comes as millions of Chinese officials participate in an education campaign focused on implementing Xi's austerity rules to improve the party's conduct and public image.</p>

          <p>Pakistan has begun its one-month term as the rotating president of the U.N. Security Council, a largely symbolic role that comes at a time of heightened global geopolitical tensions. This is the eighth time Pakistan has served on the council and its first presidency since 2013. Pakistan's U.N. Ambassador stated the country would work cooperatively to promote peaceful conflict resolution. The presidency is expected to see Pakistan raise the issue of its recent conflict with India over the disputed Kashmir territory, while India is reportedly preparing a counter-strategy focused on economic development and cross-border terrorism.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>A recent wave of French films is starting to address France's significant but often overlooked history in the transatlantic slave trade and colonialism. For years, French audiences learned about slavery primarily through American productions, but new films like "No Chains No Masters" and a biopic on anti-colonial thinker Frantz Fanon are bringing these narratives to the forefront. These films explore the brutal realities of French slavery and its psychological aftermath, moving beyond sanitized historical accounts. While these movies have found audience success, they still struggle for visibility at major festivals, highlighting a continued reluctance within the industry to fully embrace these topics.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Analysts are forecasting that China's yuan will continue to strengthen against the U.S. dollar, following its strongest daily reference rate since last November. In June, the onshore yuan gained 0.41% against the dollar, driven by resilient macroeconomic data that has eased bearish sentiment on China's growth outlook. According to Goldman Sachs, this trend is also fueled by growing investor concerns over the sustainability of U.S. government debt and loose fiscal policies. The investment bank predicts the yuan will appreciate further, potentially breaking the 7-per-dollar mark within six months. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>As artificial intelligence becomes more widespread, experts argue it is crucial for emerging economies to develop their own "sovereign AI" capabilities to ensure strategic autonomy. Panelists at a CNBC conference noted that prominent AI models are predominantly English-based, failing to capture different cultural and linguistic nuances. They suggest that the use of open-source AI models and accessible cloud computing services can democratize AI development. This would allow nations, particularly in digitally savvy regions like Southeast Asia, to create AI systems tailored to their specific languages, cultures, and national priorities, fostering inclusive growth.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>A private survey has revealed that China's factory activity among export-oriented manufacturers unexpectedly returned to growth in June, despite trade disruptions. The Caixin/S&P Global manufacturing PMI rose to 50.4, surpassing expectations and rebounding from a contraction in May, largely supported by an expansion in production. This contrasts with the official PMI report, which showed a third consecutive month of contraction, a divergence attributed to differences in survey timing and company coverage. Despite the positive headline figure, new export orders declined and employment in the sector remained weak amid cautious hiring. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>California has enacted significant housing reform legislation championed by Governor Gavin Newsom, designed to accelerate homebuilding by easing environmental review standards. The new laws, Assembly Bill 130 and Senate Bill 131, exempt most urban housing projects from the lengthy California Environmental Quality Act (CEQA) process, a move developers say will unlock stalled projects. Newsom forced the legislation through by tying it to the state budget, overcoming opposition from some progressive lawmakers and labor unions. The reform is considered one of the most consequential changes to state housing policy in decades.</p>

          <p>The Canadian government has rescinded its planned digital services tax on large U.S. technology companies following pressure from the Trump administration, which had threatened retaliatory tariffs. The White House declared the move a victory, stating that Prime Minister Mark Carney "caved" to President Trump's demands. Canadian officials framed the decision as part of a broader trade negotiation, which has now resumed. The 3% tax would have affected giants like Amazon, Meta, and Google, and its removal resolves a significant point of friction in U.S.-Canada trade relations, though it drew criticism from Canada's opposition party.</p>

          <p>A top U.S. military commander has proposed reassigning some of the California National Guard troops currently deployed in Los Angeles to help prepare for the state's wildfire season. The request involves moving 200 of the 4,000 Guard members, who were federalized by President Trump to handle immigration-related protests, to wildfire duty. This potential shift comes after California officials warned that the controversial Los Angeles deployment could interfere with its wildfire response capabilities during a peak season. The state had previously sued the Trump administration, arguing the initial deployment was an illegal overreach of federal power.</p>
