          <p>Cillian Murphy stars as a troubled but dedicated head teacher at a reform school in the new film "Steve," directed by Tim Mielants. The movie, adapted from Max Porter's novel "Shy," focuses on the intense relationship between Murphy's character and a volatile student over the course of a single day. The review praises Murphy's immersive performance and the film's raw energy, comparing it to the work of British director Alan Clarke. While the article finds the overall film somewhat scattered and reliant on narrative shorthands, it highlights the powerful acting and compelling character dynamics as its core strengths.</p>

        </div>
        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>The future of TikTok in the United States may depend on a licensing agreement for its highly valued algorithm, a central issue in ongoing talks between the U.S. and China. Previously, both the Chinese government and TikTok's parent company, ByteDance, were unwilling to sell the proprietary technology that drives the app's user engagement. However, a potential deal could involve U.S. owners licensing the algorithm, allowing ByteDance to retain some ownership and revenue while addressing U.S. national security concerns about data access. Experts suggest this arrangement would be more like renting the algorithm than an outright sale, raising questions about ongoing Chinese influence.</p>

          <h2>California Governor Signs Climate Bill Package to Lower Energy Costs and Support Oil Industry</h2>
          <div class="timestamp">2025-09-19 18:14:51 EDT</div>
        </div>
        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Governor Gavin Newsom signed a comprehensive package of climate and environment bills designed to lower electricity and gasoline costs while also supporting California's oil sector. The legislation extends the state's cap-and-trade program to 2045, directing billions toward utility bill relief and public transit. However, the package includes controversial provisions, such as allowing up to 2,000 new oil wells annually in Kern County and giving the governor power to suspend summer-blend gasoline standards during price spikes. While some environmental groups criticized these trade-offs, others see the package as crucial progress, especially given the lack of federal climate leadership.</p>

          <p>Canada's women's rugby team achieved a historic victory, defeating six-time world champions New Zealand 34-19 to advance to the World Cup final. The win ended New Zealand's 11-year, 4,063-day undefeated streak in the tournament. Canada, a team that had to crowdfund to support their journey to the competition, dominated the first half and successfully held off a second-half push from the defending champions. The performance was described as "seismic" and a "fairytale," setting up a final showdown against either France or England at Twickenham.</p>

          <p>A federal judge in Florida has dismissed President Trump's $15 billion defamation lawsuit against The New York Times and four of its reporters, calling the original 85-page complaint "decidedly improper and impermissible." U.S. District Judge Steven Merryday criticized the filing for its excessive length and "florid" detail, which he said violated federal rules requiring allegations to be simple and concise. The judge has granted Trump's legal team 28 days to file a shorter, amended complaint with a 40-page limit. A spokesperson for Trump's legal team vowed to continue pursuing the lawsuit in accordance with the judge's instructions.</p>

          <p>A new documentary, "Megadoc," chronicles the ambitious and challenging production of Francis Ford Coppola's self-financed film, "Megalopolis." Directed by Mike Figgis, the film provides a useful behind-the-scenes look at Coppola's creative process but is criticized for being too respectful and failing to delve deeply into the project's significant troubles. While it captures moments of on-set conflict and resolution, the review notes that it avoids addressing more serious allegations and controversies that arose during production. The documentary is seen less as a critical examination and more as a portrait of an artist pursuing a deeply personal, and perhaps elusive, vision.</p>

          <p>President Donald Trump and Chinese President Xi Jinping have made significant progress toward a deal regarding TikTok's U.S. operations, but a final agreement was not reached during their phone call on Friday. A White House official indicated that while the two leaders moved closer to a resolution, more work remains. Trump later told reporters a deal is "well on its way" and could be a "formality." The negotiations aim to resolve U.S. national security concerns that led to a law requiring TikTok's parent company, ByteDance, to divest its American business or face a ban, a deadline Trump has repeatedly extended.</p>

          <p>The Liberal Democrats have announced a policy proposal to establish police counters in public venues such as supermarkets, shopping centers, and libraries across England and Wales. The party argues the move would increase police visibility, build public confidence, and make it easier for citizens to report crimes. They suggest the plan could be funded by abolishing the elected Police and Crime Commissioner (PCC) roles, which they claim would free up significant funds. The announcement comes at the start of the party's annual conference as they aim to appeal to voters concerned about community policing and government spending.</p>

However, shortly after the report surfaced, Musk posted on his social media platform X that the news was fake and that xAI is not currently raising capital. The funds would likely be used to acquire AI chips and build out the computing infrastructure needed for advanced AI development. (not investment advice)</p>

          <div class="timestamp">2025-09-19 16:19:19 EDT</div>
        </div>
        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Recent threats by President Trump and the FCC to revoke broadcast licenses of networks like ABC have highlighted the federal government's regulatory power over media. Broadcast networks such as ABC, CBS, NBC, and Fox rely on government-licensed public airwaves, requiring them to operate in the "public interest." The FCC can revoke these licenses, effectively taking a local station off the air, though the process is complex and subject to legal challenges. While historically focused on issues like obscenity or children's programming, the current threats are centered on political content, representing what legal experts call an unprecedented use of this regulatory authority.</p>
