          <p>Former North Carolina basketball star Rashad McCants shared his insights on various sports topics, including the NBA Finals, where he predicts Indiana will win in seven games due to OKC's inexperience. McCants highlighted Tyrese Haliburton's team-oriented approach as preferable to Shai Gilgeous-Alexander if building a team focused on chemistry. Reflecting on his time with Kevin Garnett on the Timberwolves, McCants described Garnett as a fun and intense individual who emphasized details, similar to Kobe Bryant. McCants also touched on college athletics, discussing the transfer portal's lack of structure and his experiences with Michael Jordan at UNC, and he expressed mixed feelings about Bill Belichick's move to UNC, citing potential controversies. </p>

          <p>WWE held a double-header event in Los Angeles, featuring Worlds Collide with AAA stars and Money in the Bank, which produced mixed reactions. Worlds Collide was a success, celebrating Mexican lucha libre and breaking viewership records on YouTube, with over 4.1 million views in the first 24 hours. However, Money in the Bank received criticism for its ladder matches, with Naomi's victory in the women's match and Seth Rollins' win in the men's match being controversial. The return of R-Truth during the main event pairing Cody Rhodes and Jey Uso against John Cena and Logan Paul was a pleasant surprise for fans, potentially saving the event from further disappointment. </p>

          <p>Los Angeles is in recovery mode after a weekend of protests against President Trump's immigration policies and the deployment of the National Guard, with clean-up crews working to remove graffiti from federal buildings. The protests, which were mostly peaceful, were marred by vandalism and violence, including rocks thrown from freeway overpasses and Waymo vehicles set on fire. City officials and union leaders gathered in Grand Park to demand the release of David Huerta, a union leader arrested during an immigration raid. The National Guard, which played a minimal role in policing the protests, was absent from the streets on Monday, with law enforcement largely represented by neighboring police forces. </p>

          <p>The UK government has committed ¬£14.2 billion of investment to build the Sizewell C nuclear plant on the Suffolk coastline, with the final investment decision due later this summer. The Treasury said that this project will create 10,000 direct jobs, thousands more in firms supplying the plant, and generate enough energy to power six million homes. While Chancellor Rachel Reeves hailed it as a "landmark decision" that would kickstart "economic growth", Alison Downes, director of pressure group Stop Sizewell C, condemned the announcement and believed the government would "come to regret" this move. The government insists that nuclear power provides enormous amounts of low carbon, non-intermittent energy that forms a crucial part of the UK's energy future. </p>

          <p>Chinese electric car manufacturers are making significant inroads into the global market, offering cheaper and technologically advanced vehicles. BYD, already the biggest player in China, is expanding aggressively into Europe, posing a challenge to established automotive brands. While consumers may benefit from more affordable EVs, concerns are growing about potential security risks, with some experts suggesting Chinese vehicles could be vulnerable to hacking and spyware. The US government has responded by raising import tariffs on Chinese-made EVs, while the EU has imposed extra tariffs, though the UK has not taken similar action, as European manufacturers race to develop their own affordable electric cars. </p>

The Daily Telegraph highlights Greta Thunberg's detention by Israeli authorities and also notes Energy Secretary Ed Miliband's declaration of a new "golden age" for the British nuclear industry. </p>

In a city famous for its potently strong ales, Wales might have said: "Hold my beer." </p>

Uber CEO Dara Khosrowshahi and Goldman Sachs chief David Solomon also expressed support for the savings account plan, which is part of the Republican-backed budget bill moving through Congress.

          <p>The Walt Disney Co. has agreed to pay Comcast Corp. an additional $438.7 million to finalize the purchase of streaming service Hulu, bringing the total amount paid for Comcast's stake to $9.2 billion. The resolution represents a major step in Disney's years-long pivot to streaming. Disney CEO Bob Iger acknowledged the company's productive partnership with Comcast and said the completed acquisition paves the way for a deeper integration of Hulu's content with Disney+ and ESPN's direct-to-consumer product. Comcast said Hulu generated nearly $10 billion in proceeds for them and created an important audience for NBCUniversal's content. </p>
