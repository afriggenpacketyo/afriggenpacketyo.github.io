          <p>President Trump delivered the commencement address at West Point, highlighting his administration's efforts to roll back diversity, equity, and inclusion (DEI) programs in military academies. Trump's speech emphasized changes made since his administration began, including the disbanding of student clubs like the National Society of Black Engineers. He also mentioned the removal of books related to diversity from U.S. Naval Academy libraries, which sparked criticism from former West Point teachers who argued against indoctrination. The president touted high recruiting numbers and plans for a military parade in Washington, D.C., while also referencing past health concerns during a 2020 West Point address.
