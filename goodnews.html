          <p>Former Florida Senator Marco Rubio has assumed multiple roles within the Trump administration, including Secretary of State, acting administrator of U.S.A.I.D., acting archivist for the National Archives, and interim national security adviser. This accumulation of titles raises questions about his capacity to effectively manage all responsibilities, especially given President Trump's unconventional approach to governance. The appointment to multiple positions has been met with surprise, even within the State Department, highlighting the unconventional nature of the decision-making process. Some analysts have expressed concerns about potential conflicts of interest, particularly regarding the archivist's role in overseeing record preservation across federal agencies, including those Rubio also leads.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Former National Security Advisor John Bolton provides insights into President Trump's second term, characterizing it as even more incoherent than his first. Bolton suggests that Trump's primary motivation is to be the center of attention, lacking a coherent philosophy or grand strategy. He points to instances of retribution and constitutional infringements, but expresses confidence in the strength of American institutions to withstand any existential threat. Bolton notes that many of Trump's actions in the first 100 days are likely to be challenged in court and ultimately fail, setting precedents that will make it harder for future presidents to pursue similar policies.</p>

          <p>Amid declining birth rates and President Trump's push for a second baby boom, more couples are choosing to remain child-free. Factors influencing this decision range from financial considerations and concerns about climate change to prioritizing careers and simply not wanting children. Amy Blackstone, a sociology professor, notes that child-free individuals often value their relationship with their partner and don't want to alter that dynamic. While some may have moments of uncertainty about the future, they have made the choice carefully.</p>

          <p>Santa Cruz has implemented a "soda tax" on sugar-sweetened beverages, defying a statewide ban that prohibits local governments from imposing such taxes until 2031. The tax adds 2 cents per ounce to nonalcoholic beverages with added sweeteners and a certain calorie count. Proponents of the tax framed it as a battle against the American Beverage Association, arguing that it allows the city to make its own decisions. Opponents argue that the tax violates the statewide ban and unfairly burdens working families already struggling with high prices.</p>

High costs halted Trump's push for a parade in his first term, and the tanks and other heavy vehicles that are part of the Army's latest plans have raised concerns from city officials about damage to roads.</p>
