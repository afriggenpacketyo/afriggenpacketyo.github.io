          <p>China's central bank and financial regulators unveiled comprehensive measures, including interest rate cuts and a reduced reserve requirement ratio, to bolster the economy amid ongoing trade concerns. These actions aim to support key sectors like technology and real estate, and establish a 500-billion-yuan relending tool for consumption and elderly care. The move signals increased urgency from Beijing to counteract the economic impact of tariffs, as Vice Premier He Lifeng is set to engage in trade talks with U.S. Treasury Secretary Scott Bessent in Switzerland. This comes after heightened trade tensions, with the U.S. imposing tariffs on Chinese goods and China retaliating with levies on U.S. imports. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>Despite economic headwinds, China's tourism sector is experiencing a surge, with domestic trips far exceeding pre-pandemic levels. This growth is fueled by increased interest in cultural experiences, enhanced transportation infrastructure connecting smaller cities, and strategic investments in tourism by local governments. The article highlights Datong's Yungang Buddhist grottoes as a prime example, with popularity soaring after being featured in a video game, while cities like Chengdu are leveraging drones and robotics to enhance the visitor experience. This trend suggests a shift in consumer spending priorities toward travel and experiences, presenting opportunities for brands to connect with consumers through cultural collaborations.</p>

          <p>For the second time in a week, a U.S. Navy F/A-18E Super Hornet assigned to the USS Harry S. Truman was lost in the Red Sea, with the pilots sustaining minor injuries after an arrestment failure during landing. This incident follows a previous loss where a Super Hornet fell overboard during towing in the hangar bay. While initial reports suggested possible evasive action against Houthi militants, the Pentagon denies the jet was struck. The Truman Carrier Strike Group has experienced multiple incidents since deploying to the Middle East, including an accidental shooting down of a friendly aircraft and a collision with a merchant vessel.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>President Trump intends to declare that the U.S. will officially refer to the Persian Gulf as the Arabian Gulf or the Gulf of Arabia during his upcoming trip to Saudi Arabia. This move aligns with the preferences of Arab nations but contrasts with Iran's historical ties to the term "Persian Gulf." The decision could inflame tensions with Iran, which views the name as a matter of national pride. While Trump can alter the official U.S. designation, the International Hydrographic Organization's established naming conventions may limit the global impact of the change.</p>

          <p>Long Beach has partnered with Washington, D.C.-based Throne Labs to place four ‚Äúsmart‚Äù public restrooms throughout the city. The 7-by-8-foot restrooms cost $6,200 apiece per month, which amounts to a total price tag of just under $100,000 for the four-month trial, Kurtzman said. A digital sign alerts users on whether the bathroom is available, in use, being cleaned or closed. But those with a penchant for leisurely loo visits should take note: The Thrones come with a time limit. After 10 minutes, ready or not, the doors are opening.</p>

          <p>President Trump adopted a friendly tone during a meeting with Canada's new Prime Minister, Mark Carney, after months of criticizing the country and suggesting it become the 51st state. Despite his previous rhetoric, Trump expressed his love for Canada and emphasized the strong relationship between the two nations. The meeting covered a wide range of topics, and Trump appeared to avoid addressing the complications his previous remarks had created. Carney firmly asserted Canada's independence, stating that it is not for sale, and the meeting concluded with both leaders expressing a commitment to friendship.</p>

          <p>A plant in China's Shanxi province is being upgraded with French technology that will enable it to produce aluminium from China‚Äôs low-grade ore that was previously unusable. The technology, developed by French chemist Yves Ocello, neutralizes silica and sulphur, meaning high-silica bauxite can be refined using the Bayer method. In 2023, IB2 signed a 22-year agreement with Chinese firm Liulin Senze Coal & Aluminum to switch over to the technology, which could reduce China's reliance on imported aluminium ore from Guinea and Australia.</p>

          <p>The government will make it a crime to climb on Winston Churchill's statue in Parliament Square, it will be announced today. The new law is contained in the flagship Crime and Policing Bill currently progressing through Parliament. Churchill was said to have personally picked the spot where he wanted his statue to stand when approving plans for the redevelopment of Parliament Square in the 1950s. In recent years, the statue has become a regular target for demonstrators. The statue was infamously sprayed with red paint and adorned with a green turf Mohican during May Day protests in 2000, for which the perpetrator received a 30-day jail sentence.</p>

          <p>Faced with deepening trade tensions, stock shortages, and tariff headaches in the US, a Canadian retailer, Luke Therrien, CEO of his company, is cutting out US middlemen and forging direct ties with Chinese suppliers.

The shift has added weeks of legwork and logistical hurdles but may also be steering him toward a more sustainable and cost-efficient supply chain. ‚ÄúFor anybody in business right now, you‚Äôre going to have to finesse and find new ways to source products; that‚Äôs just the reality of things.</p>
