          <h2>Experts Weigh Pros and Cons of Annuities for Seniors Receiving Social Security</h2>
          <div class="timestamp">2025-07-30 12:57:38 EDT</div>
        </div>
        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>This article explores whether senior citizens who already receive Social Security benefits should also purchase annuities for additional financial security. While annuities can offer a diversified and guaranteed income stream, supplementing Social Security and protecting against outliving savings, they also have drawbacks. These include illiquidity, complexity, and various fees that can reduce returns. The decision depends heavily on an individual's financial situation, risk tolerance, and life expectancy, making it a choice that requires careful consideration. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>Following a powerful earthquake off Russia's coast that triggered tsunami alerts across the Pacific, a wave of misinformation has spread online. This article from DW Fact Check debunks several false claims, including misleading accusations against Oprah Winfrey and the circulation of old or AI-generated footage. Videos from previous tsunamis in Greenland and South Africa, as well as an earthquake in Myanmar, were falsely presented as current events. The report highlights the prevalence of fake content during breaking news and provides tools to verify information, such as reverse image searches.</p>

          <div class="timestamp">2025-07-30 12:52:01 EDT</div>
        </div>
        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>The U.S. apartment rental market is showing signs of softening as a massive influx of new supply continues to outpace demand. The national vacancy rate hit a record 7.1% in July, according to a report from Apartment List. Consequently, median rent was flat month-over-month and down 0.8% from the previous year, stalling during what is typically the peak moving season. While this creates a more favorable market for renters, macroeconomic uncertainty is dampening overall demand, with the largest rent declines seen in southern and Mountain West cities.

          <p>Meta CEO Mark Zuckerberg has detailed his strategic vision for artificial intelligence, framing it as a tool for "personal superintelligence" and empowerment rather than centralized automation. This announcement comes as Meta invests billions in AI talent and infrastructure, including a new lab led by recently hired Chief AI Officer Alexandr Wang. Zuckerberg's letter to investors aims to justify the heavy spending, drawing parallels to the company's long-term, costly investment in the metaverse. He positions the current decade as a critical period for shaping the future direction of AI technology.</p>

          <p>While the Federal Reserve is widely expected to hold interest rates steady at its upcoming meeting, several underlying factors are creating significant intrigue. Two Fed governors, Christopher Waller and Michelle Bowman, have advocated for a rate cut, setting up the potential for a rare multi-governor dissent. The meeting will also be the first since President Trump's public criticism of the Fed's new building costs.

          <p>The U.S. economy expanded at a 3% annualized rate in the second quarter of 2025, a significant rebound from the 0.5% contraction in the first quarter. This growth was largely driven by a sharp decrease in imports, a volatile metric influenced by the Trump administration's trade tariffs. While consumer spending also accelerated, a key underlying measure of private domestic demand showed its weakest growth since late 2022. Economists caution that the headline GDP number may overstate the economy's true strength, suggesting a slowdown is still expected later in the year. (not investment advice)</p>

FFR officials believe the strength of French club rugby and the proximity for traveling fans make a tour of France an enticing prospect. They propose creating new opportunities within the revised global rugby calendar, such as a special game every four years, without disrupting the Lions' traditional tours. This revival of the rivalry, last seen in a 1989 fixture, could provide new, high-stakes challenges for a strong French national team.</p>

          <p>A new form of geothermal energy, known as "superhot geothermal," is being developed to meet the massive power demands of the artificial intelligence era. This technology involves drilling miles deep to access extremely hot rocks, which can generate five to ten times more power per well than conventional geothermal methods. Startups like Quaise Energy are pioneering the technology, which uses electromagnetic beams to vaporize rock and reach temperatures over 900 degrees Fahrenheit. The approach is seen as a way to provide a consistent, carbon-free energy source essential for powering data centers.</p>
