          <p>Senate Republicans are scheduled to meet with former President Trump to discuss the 'One Big Beautiful Bill Act'. Members of the Senate Finance Committee will meet with Trump at the White House to discuss the tax policy components of the bill, including the extension of the Trump 2017 tax cuts. The whole committee, along with Majority Leader John Thune and GOP Whip John Barrasso, are expected to attend the meeting. Senate Republicans are also expected to meet behind closed doors to discuss the parameters of the bill as a group, as GOP leadership looks to chart a path forward for the package in the upper chamber.</p>

          <p>The England women's national football team, the Lionesses, experienced a mixed week as they prepare for Euro 2025. Goalkeeper Mary Earps announced her international retirement, and key defender Millie Bright withdrew from the squad. England responded with an impressive display, thrashing Portugal, but then lost to Spain in the Nations League semi-finals. The team used the matches to give players minutes and fitness, with coach Sarina Wiegman emphasizing the importance of learning from the Spain loss. The team is in a good position for the Euros going into the group stages.</p>

          <p>The UK has been exempted from former US President Donald Trump's executive order that doubles steel and aluminum tariffs from 25% to 50%. The order raises import taxes for US firms buying from other countries, but the levy remains at 25% for the UK. A UK-US tariff pact signed in May will eventually eliminate all import taxes on steel and aluminum, but it has not yet come into force. The UK government has stated its commitment to protecting British business and jobs across key sectors. There is an optimism for a stronger UK-US trade relationship.</p>

          <p>A U.S. judge has ruled that the Bureau of Prisons must continue providing gender-affirming care for transgender inmates, despite an executive order from former President Trump to halt funding for such care. The judge allowed a lawsuit challenging the order to proceed as a class action, covering over 2,000 transgender inmates. The ruling requires the bureau to provide hormone therapy and accommodations, but does not mandate surgical care. The ACLU hailed the ruling as a reminder that transgender people have constitutional rights. The legal dispute will continue to unfold.</p>

          <p>Mondelƒìz International, the company behind Oreo cookies, is suing Aldi in the US for allegedly copying the packaging of its snacks. The lawsuit claims Aldi's similar packaging is likely to deceive consumers and capitalize on Oreo's brand recognition. Mondelƒìz also accuses Aldi of copying packaging for other products like Wheat Thins and Ritz crackers. Aldi UK stated that it is not involved in the lawsuit, as it operates as a separate business. The lawsuit seeks to prevent Aldi from continuing its product lines, claiming they will irreparably harm the Mondelƒìz brand. The lawsuit includes side-by-side comparisons of the product packaging.</p>

          <p>The Federal Reserve Board announced Tuesday that it is finally lifting the $1.95 trillion asset cap imposed on Wells Fargo since February 2018. The asset cap had prevented one of Wall Street's largest banks from growing key lines of its business for years. The removal of the growth restriction reflects the substantial progress the bank has made in addressing its deficiencies and that the bank has fulfilled the conditions required for removal of the growth restriction. Wells Fargo shares are up more than 2% in after-hours trading Tuesday. (not investment advice)</p>
