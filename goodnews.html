          <p>The US State Department's Office of Science and Technology Cooperation (STC), responsible for negotiating international science and technology agreements, may be eliminated as part of a broader agency restructuring. The potential closure has raised concerns among analysts about the impact on US science diplomacy and international research collaboration, particularly with countries like China. The STC office advises the administration on national and economic security safeguards in science and technology cooperation, while also promoting the open exchange of basic research. The State Department has not confirmed the elimination of the office.</p>

          <p>The U.S. Army is considering a large-scale military parade in Washington, D.C., potentially involving nearly 7,000 troops, tanks, helicopter flyovers, and parachute jumps, scheduled for June 14. The proposed parade would coincide with the Army's 250th-anniversary celebration and President Donald Trump's 79th birthday, sparking speculation that it fulfills Trump's previous desire for a grand military display. While city officials have raised concerns about potential infrastructure damage from heavy vehicles, the Army plans to include soldiers from each of its divisions if the parade is approved.</p>

          <p>President Trump announced that his administration intends to revoke Harvard University's tax-exempt status, escalating a conflict with the institution. This action follows previous measures, such as freezing grants and contracts, after Harvard rejected demands related to diversity, equity, and inclusion programs. Harvard President Alan Garber has questioned the legality of revoking the tax-exempt status, which enables universities to carry out their educational and research missions. Harvard argues that such a move would severely impair its ability to provide financial aid, conduct medical research, and foster innovation.</p>

          <p>Elon Musk's Department of Government Efficiency (DOGE) has identified several instances of significant tax waste, fraud, and abuse within the federal government, claiming to have cut at least $160 billion in waste.

DOGE has also targeted DEI spending, cancelling numerous contracts and grants.

          <h2>Analysis of Recent Election Results Reveals Shifts in Political Landscape</h2>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Recent election results across England reveal significant shifts in the political landscape, indicating challenges for both the Labour and Conservative parties. Labour has experienced a decline in support since their landslide victory, facing criticism over policies like means-testing the winter fuel allowance. The Conservatives are facing even greater difficulties, with Reform UK gaining ground and the Liberal Democrats making inroads in traditional Tory strongholds. These results suggest a fragmentation of the British political landscape, with smaller parties playing an increasingly important role.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Temu, the Chinese e-commerce platform known for ultra-discounted items, has stopped shipping products directly from China to the United States after the Trump administration ended the de minimis rule, which allowed low-value shipments to enter the country duty-free. The company has shifted its website to display only products shipped from U.S.-based warehouses. This change comes as new tariffs on China have forced Temu to raise prices and alter its selection of goods available to American shoppers. Temu is actively recruiting U.S. sellers to join the platform and claims that pricing for U.S. shoppers remains unchanged.</p>

          <p>Temu, the Chinese e-commerce platform, has ceased shipping products directly from China to the United States, transitioning to a model where all U.S. orders are shipped from local warehouses.

The company stated that pricing for U.S. consumers remains unchanged and that they are actively recruiting U.S. sellers to join the platform. The move is designed to help local merchants reach more customers and grow their businesses.</p>
