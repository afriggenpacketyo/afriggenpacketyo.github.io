          <p>Hong Kong's ambition to significantly expand its use of green marine fuels, particularly methanol, is critically dependent on establishing a reliable supply chain, according to CM Energy President Wang Yongxin. While the city has already implemented liquefied natural gas and biodiesel fueling operations, green methanol requires a streamlined system to bring mainland-produced fuel into Hong Kong, store it, and sell it tax-free. The company's new dual-fuel vehicle carrier, CM Hong Kong, currently uses a quarter green methanol and plans to increase this from 2027, driven by Europe's carbon emissions-based import tariffs.</p>

          <p>Golfer Rory McIlroy reflected on the intensely hostile and often abusive fan behavior he experienced at the Ryder Cup at Bethpage Black, where he was a frequent target of heckles and insults throughout the event. Despite enduring personal attacks, including one instance where he directly responded to a fan's taunts, McIlroy maintained his composure for the majority of the competition. His European team ultimately secured a 15-13 victory over the Americans, a triumph McIlroy had boldly predicted two years prior. He humorously suggested he would be open to the Ryder Cup returning to New York if the outcome remained the same.</p>

          <p>Moldova's pro-EU Party of Action and Solidarity (PAS) achieved a decisive victory in the parliamentary election, securing nearly 50% of the votes with 98% of ballots counted. The pro-Russia Patriotic Bloc came in second with around 25% of the vote. This high-stakes election was crucial for the country's geopolitical alignment, with President Maia Sandu accusing Russia of "massive interference" in the electoral process. Despite initial pre-election polls suggesting PAS might lose its majority, their strong win reaffirms Moldova's commitment to a path towards closer ties with the European Union.</p>

The Commonwealth Bank of Australia noted "real tension" in recent economic data, citing material upside risks to Q3 inflation and a cyclical upswing in activity, balanced by signs of softer employment and moderating wage growth. Japan's Nikkei 225 saw a decline after hitting a record high, while South Korea's Kospi and Australia's S&P/ASX 200 posted gains. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>Jim Cramer contends that the current AI boom and data center buildout are fundamentally different from the dot-com bubble, dismissing comparisons as uninformed. He highlights that current investments come from financially robust hyperscalers and that the infrastructure being built has clear, immense demand, unlike the debt-fueled, client-lacking connectivity bubble of 2000. Cramer acknowledges skepticism about AI's immediate, visible impact but asserts its necessity for major tech players like Microsoft, Meta, and Google. He believes the ongoing innovation and demand make it an industrial revolution, not a speculative bubble. (not investment advice)</p>
