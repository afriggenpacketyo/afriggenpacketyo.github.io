          <h2>Canada Seeks Stronger Ties with UK and EU Amid Tensions with US</h2>
          <div class="timestamp">2025-05-07 19:57:10 EDT</div>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Canada's Foreign Minister Melanie Joly stated that Canada has been "over reliant on the US for too long" and aims to strengthen ties with the UK, the EU, and other nations. This announcement follows recent tensions between the US and Canada, particularly after Trump imposed tariffs on Canada's auto, aluminum, and steel industries. Joly's remarks came after Prime Minister Mark Carney met with President Trump to discuss a new partnership. The article notes that Joly emphasized the importance of asserting Canada's sovereignty while negotiating a "new trade and security partnership" with the US.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>President Trump's meeting with Canadian Prime Minister Mark Carney has generated headlines due to several moments where Trump appeared to lack basic knowledge about Canada. These instances included uncertainty about the volume of trade between the US and Canada, confusion over the meaning of the word "concession," mistakenly identifying Russian hockey player Alex Ovechkin as Canadian, and suggesting that Canada could be for sale despite Carney's insistence otherwise. The article presents these moments as examples of Trump's apparent unfamiliarity with key aspects of the US-Canada relationship.</p>
