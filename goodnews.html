          <h2>Immigration Arrests Declined in July Amid Activist Efforts</h2>
          <div class="timestamp">2025-08-16 11:38:34 EDT</div>
        </div>
        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Nationwide immigration arrests conducted by U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE) saw a 13% decrease in July compared to the previous month. Activist groups in states like Oregon believe their efforts, including a "rapid response" hotline system and nightly protests, may be contributing to the slowdown. The system connects arrestees with immediate legal aid, sometimes resulting in court orders that prevent their transfer out of state, where ICE lacks detention facilities. This, combined with Oregon's "sanctuary" law limiting local cooperation with federal agents, complicates ICE's ability to increase its arrest totals in the region.</p>

This marked their first head-to-head competition since the Paris Olympics, where Lyles narrowly won gold by five-thousandths of a second. Thompson finished with a meet-record time of 9.87 seconds, while Lyles came in second at 9.90 seconds. The event was a highly anticipated rematch, with Thompson successfully turning the tables on his rival in a powerful performance on the track.</p>

          <p>A 46-year-old man was rescued via helicopter after being trapped for two days behind a powerful waterfall in a remote area of California. The man, Ryan Wardwell, was rappelling down a series of waterfalls known as the Seven Teacups when the force of the water pushed him off his lines, trapping him behind the cascade. A search was launched after he failed to return to his car, and a rescue team eventually located him using a drone. He was hoisted to safety and treated for minor injuries and dehydration before being reunited with his family.</p>

          <p>A top scientist from the Chinese Academy of Sciences is urging China to accelerate its development of space-based solar power technology to secure a leading position in the global energy and space sectors. The technology involves building large solar power stations in orbit that would transmit electricity back to Earth using microwaves or lasers, offering a continuous power source unaffected by weather or nighttime. The call to action emphasizes the need for a top-down national strategy to close the technology gap with the United States, which has been experimenting with similar concepts for decades.</p>

        </div>
        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>The concept of "Lighthouse Parenting" is being presented as a healthier alternative to the modern trend of intensive, hands-on parenting. This approach encourages parents to act as a steady, guiding presence for their children, offering safety and clarity without controlling every aspect of their lives, much like a lighthouse for ships. Proponents argue that while the instinct to solve every problem for a child is strong, stepping back allows children to develop confidence and resilience. This philosophy aims to reduce parental exhaustion while fostering greater independence and capability in children as they navigate their own challenges.</p>

          <p>Devon and Cornwall Police have seized £180,000 from controversial influencer Andrew Tate, which was a deposit he placed for an Aston Martin Valhalla supercar in 2021. A court heard that the funds were determined to be the proceeds of tax evasion and money laundering, and the forfeiture order was not opposed by Tate or his brother. This seizure is in addition to £2.7 million previously confiscated from the brothers for failing to pay taxes on revenue from their online businesses. Authorities stated the money will be reinvested into crime prevention and victim support services in the local community.</p>

          <p>A program called Dec My Dorm is providing essential supplies to students from the foster care system as they begin their college careers. Many of these students arrive on campus with minimal belongings and are often unaware of the basic items needed for dorm life, such as bedding, towels, and lamps. The initiative, which started after a former foster youth described arriving at college with only a trash bag, aims to level the playing field by providing these necessities. By doing so, the program helps alleviate the stress of the transition and ensures these students feel prepared and equal to their peers.</p>

          <p>Sadie Salazar, a therapist and COO of Sage Therapy, emphasizes the importance of a consistent morning ritual to ground herself and set a positive tone for the day. Her primary rule is to get up as soon as her alarm goes off, no matter what, which creates valuable personal time before work and family obligations begin. She uses this extra time for non-work-related activities like reading, listening to a podcast, or taking a longer walk with her dog. This flexible but disciplined approach allows her to start the day feeling rejuvenated and in control, rather than rushed and chaotic.</p>

          <p>Recent data indicates that Samsung is gaining ground on Apple in the U.S. smartphone market, with its market share of shipments rising from 23% to 31% in the second quarter. This surge is partly attributed to the growing popularity of its innovative foldable phones, such as the Z Fold and Z Flip models, which offer a new form factor compared to the traditional smartphone slate. While Apple still leads the market, its share has declined, signaling a renewed competition between the two tech giants. Analysts suggest Apple may release its own foldable device by 2026 to counter Samsung's momentum. (not investment advice)</p>

Believing the network was secure, Rothwell inadvertently revealed his identity and location in a high-rise Barcelona apartment, from which he ran a multi-million-pound drug and weapons trafficking operation. The photo was a key breakthrough for detectives who had gained access to the network as part of a major international law enforcement operation.

          <p>Columbia University-trained psychologist Becky Kennedy suggests three powerful steps for developing emotional endurance, which is the ability to withstand stress without being overwhelmed by negative feelings. The first step is to visualize the learning process as a winding path, accepting that frustration is a normal part of growth. The second involves engaging in positive self-talk to reframe difficult moments as manageable challenges. Finally, she recommends taking on small, uncomfortable experiments, like having a difficult conversation, to build the body's tolerance for discomfort and foster resilience over time.</p>

          <p>A new Gallup survey indicates that the percentage of Americans who drink alcohol has fallen to 54%, the lowest level since the question was first asked in 1939. The data also shows that those who do drink are consuming less, with a growing number of people viewing even moderate drinking as unhealthy. This trend is particularly pronounced among younger people, with underage drinking rates having plummeted over the past few decades. This cultural shift toward lower alcohol consumption is seen as a major public health positive, potentially reducing alcohol-related deaths, illnesses, and social harms.</p>
