          <p>A U.S. District Judge issued an emergency order to block the Trump administration from deporting hundreds of unaccompanied Guatemalan children, some of whom were reportedly already on planes ready for departure. The ruling came after immigrant advocates filed a lawsuit arguing the plan was illegal and deprived the children of due process to seek asylum. Government lawyers contended they were reuniting the children with their families at their request, a claim disputed by the children's attorneys. The judge's 14-day restraining order ensures the minors are returned to government shelters while the legal case proceeds.</p>

          <p>Liverpool defeated Arsenal 1-0 in a key early-season Premier League match, thanks to a late free-kick from Dominik Szoboszlai. The game was largely a cautious and tactical affair, with Arsenal adopting a conservative approach that limited their attacking opportunities against the reigning champions. Despite missing key players to injury, Arsenal's defense was solid, but they ultimately failed to make a significant impact offensively. The result extends Liverpool's strong start to the season and continues Arsenal's long winless streak at Anfield.</p>

          <p>Verizon customers nationwide experienced a significant service outage, with many phones being restricted to "SOS mode," which only allows for emergency calls. The company acknowledged a "software issue" was impacting its wireless service and confirmed its engineers were working to resolve the problem. Reports of the outage peaked with nearly 23,000 complaints on the tracking site DownDetector. Verizon later announced that service was being restored in affected areas and that the issue had been fully resolved by midnight.</p>

          <p>Formula 1 driver Lando Norris experienced a significant setback in his championship pursuit after an oil leak forced him to retire from the Dutch Grand Prix. The retirement, combined with a victory by his McLaren teammate Oscar Piastri, increased the points gap between them to 34. Despite the frustration, Norris stated the larger deficit now allows him to "just go for it" and try to win every remaining race without the same pressure. The incident highlights the intense and close competition between the two McLaren drivers this season.</p>

          <p>Representative James Comer, Chairman of the House Oversight Committee, has formally requested all Suspicious Activity Reports (SARs) related to Jeffrey Epstein and Ghislaine Maxwell from the U.S. Treasury Department. The request is part of the committee's broader investigation into potential mismanagement of the federal government's probe into the pair's sex trafficking activities. The committee has set a September 15 deadline for the Treasury to produce the documents. This action follows the committee's establishment of a task force to declassify federal secrets and its subpoenas of several high-profile former government officials.</p>

          <p>The United Kingdom has finalized its largest-ever warship export deal, a £10 billion agreement to supply Norway with at least five new Type 26 anti-submarine frigates. The warships will be built at BAE Systems' shipyards in Glasgow, a move the UK government says will support thousands of jobs into the 2030s. The deal strengthens defense cooperation between the two NATO allies, creating a combined fleet of 13 frigates to operate in the North Atlantic and enhance security on NATO's northern flank.</p>

          <p>At an informal meeting, EU foreign ministers discussed a range of new potential measures to support Ukraine, signaling a search for more impactful strategies as the war with Russia continues. Among the ideas floated were secondary sanctions targeting Russia's trading partners and a plan to establish Ukrainian arms production facilities on EU soil as a "safe haven." Ministers also revisited the contentious idea of seizing frozen Russian central bank assets to aid Kyiv. While no official decisions were made, the discussions indicate a deepening commitment to finding long-term solutions to bolster Ukraine's defense.</p>

          <p>One of the world's largest kelp restoration projects has achieved remarkable success off the coast of Southern California by removing millions of kelp-devouring sea urchins. Over the past decade, divers have smashed nearly 5.8 million purple urchins, clearing over 80 acres of "urchin barrens" and allowing the vital kelp forests to regrow. The project, led by The Bay Foundation, has helped revive an ecosystem that supports hundreds of marine species and protects the coastline. This manual restoration effort serves as a hopeful model for reversing marine ecosystem collapse in other parts of the world.</p>

The process had been stalled for months due to new security check requirements, leaving thousands in limbo. Following pressure from human rights groups and German court rulings, the government is resuming the admissions process. For these families, who face persecution if returned to Afghanistan, the resumption of visa processing is a matter of survival.</p>
