        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Justin Fields, the New York Jets' new quarterback, returned to the practice field, easing concerns after an injury scare. Fields suffered a dislocated toe during a training camp session, prompting fears of a significant setback reminiscent of Aaron Rodgers' season-ending injury last year. While he participated in limited drills, head coach Aaron Glenn indicated a gradual re-integration process is planned. Glenn also downplayed the initial social media reaction, stating the alarm was unwarranted and that the team would be transparent about player diagnoses moving forward.</p>

          <p>More than two decades after its original release, a sequel to the hit film 'Bend It Like Beckham' is officially in the works, director Gurinder Chadha has confirmed. The 2002 movie, which starred Parminder Nagra and Keira Knightley, is credited with inspiring a generation of female football players. Chadha stated that the recent success of England's Lionesses and the ongoing relevance of challenging stereotypes about women in sports make it an opportune time to revisit the characters. She is targeting a 2027 release to coincide with the film's 25th anniversary and hopes to reunite the original cast.</p>

          <p>Tech company Astronomer has hired actress Gwyneth Paltrow as a "very temporary" spokesperson to help manage the fallout from a viral scandal. The company's CEO and an HR executive resigned after they were caught in an intimate embrace on a stadium KissCam during a Coldplay concert, with Paltrow's ex-husband Chris Martin joking about the moment on stage. In a short video, Paltrow deftly avoided the controversy, instead highlighting a newfound public interest in the company's data workflow automation services. The incident had previously led to widespread online mockery and memes.</p>

          <p>India mounted a strong resistance on the fourth day of the fourth Test against England, closing at 174-2 and trailing by 137 runs. After an early collapse to 0-2, an unbroken partnership between Shubman Gill (78 not out) and KL Rahul (87 not out) frustrated the English attack. England's captain Ben Stokes, who had earlier scored his first century in over two years to help his team to a total of 669, did not bowl during the day. While England remains the favorite to win the match and the series, India's determined performance has kept their hopes of a draw alive.</p>

The 27-year-old, who signed a five-year contract, cited Arsenal's impressive performance against his former team in the Champions League as a key factor in his decision. Gyokeres has been a prolific scorer in Portugal, with 97 goals in 102 matches for Sporting. The signing is a major addition to Arsenal's squad, with manager Mikel Arteta praising the striker's power, speed, and clinical finishing ability, bringing the club's summer spending to approximately £204 million.</p>

With only the final processional stage in Paris remaining, where the leader is traditionally not challenged, Pogacar's victory is all but guaranteed. The win was emotional for Groves, who has now won a stage in all three of cycling's Grand Tours, providing a significant victory for his Alpecin-Deceuninck team.</p>

          <p>The debate over how much coffee is healthy continues, with experts advising that the right amount depends on the individual. While some research links moderate daily coffee intake to health benefits and longevity, other studies suggest high consumption can increase risks for dementia and cardiovascular issues, especially for those with hypertension. The FDA recommends a general limit of 400 milligrams of caffeine per day, equivalent to about four cups of coffee. However, dietitians stress that personal tolerance varies, and people should be mindful of symptoms like anxiety or poor sleep, adjusting their intake accordingly.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>An international team of scientists has discovered that a significant portion of what was once considered "junk" DNA actually plays a crucial role in regulating gene expression. The study focused on transposable elements, or "jumping genes," which make up nearly half of the human genome. Researchers found that a specific family of these elements, called MER11, can act like genetic switches, influencing which genes are turned on or off without altering the underlying DNA sequence. This finding challenges previous assumptions and suggests that these ancient viral remnants have evolved to become integral components of our genetic machinery.</p>

This gives McLaren a front-row lockout, but Norris now faces the challenge of defending his lead from championship rival Max Verstappen on the long run to the first chicane.

Despite his age and initial reluctance, he was approved for the transplant, which ultimately saved his life. Now, with his lung capacity at 98%, he is returning to his passions, including training Bernese Mountain dogs to be hospital therapy animals, a mission now more meaningful after his own journey.</p>

While initial media reports suggested a possible visit in September for a military parade, sources indicate this is no longer being considered. A potential meeting between Trump and Chinese President Xi Jinping could occur either as a bilateral visit to Beijing or on the sidelines of the APEC summit in South Korea. The planning follows a recent meeting between the two countries' top diplomats, which was described as a positive and essential step toward a leaders' summit.</p>
