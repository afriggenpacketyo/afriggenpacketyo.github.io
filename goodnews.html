          <p>Red Bull's Max Verstappen claimed a dominant win at the Azerbaijan Grand Prix, strengthening perceptions of a team revival in Formula 1. The race was marked by an early crash from championship leader Oscar Piastri of McLaren, who made a significant error on the first lap. Despite the crash, Piastri's main rival and teammate, Lando Norris, was unable to capitalize significantly, finishing seventh and only slightly closing the points gap. The event also highlighted strong performances from Mercedes' George Russell and Williams' Carlos Sainz, who secured second and third place respectively.</p>

          <p>A new mural by artist Adam Cvijanovic has been unveiled at the entrance of New York's St. Patrick's Cathedral, marking the first major art addition to the landmark in 75 years. Titled "What's So Funny About Peace, Love and Understanding," the artwork depicts the Apparition at Knock alongside scenes celebrating America's history of immigration. Cardinal Timothy Dolan, who commissioned the piece, acknowledged that while not intended as a political statement, it reflects the Church's call to treat all people with respect amid contemporary debates on immigration, which he finds painful.</p>

          <p>Ahead of the Women's Rugby World Cup final against Canada, former winner Kat Merchant has advocated for Lucy Packer to start as scrum-half for England. Merchant argues that Packer's speed could be a decisive factor, suggesting that the more experienced Natasha Hunt could make a greater impact coming off the bench. The debate over the starting fifteen also includes potential changes in other key positions to counter Canada's strengths. This strategic discussion highlights the critical decisions facing coach John Mitchell as England aims to secure the championship title.</p>

          <p>Warren Buffett's Berkshire Hathaway has completely sold its highly profitable investment in the Chinese electric vehicle company BYD. The initial $230 million investment, made in 2008 at the urging of Charlie Munger, grew exponentially over 17 years. Berkshire began reducing its position in August 2022 and has now confirmed the full exit, with a subsidiary's financial filing showing the investment value at zero. While Buffett has praised BYD, the sale aligns with a broader re-evaluation of geopolitical risks associated with Chinese and Taiwanese investments. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>In response to inconsistent and changing federal health recommendations, several U.S. states are forming regional collaboratives to strengthen public health guidance. Seven northeastern states and New York City have created the Northeast Public Health Collaborative, mirroring a similar West Coast alliance, to coordinate on issues like vaccine policy, emergency preparedness, and lab capacity. This trend reflects a growing state-level effort to create a stable health framework as federal agencies face political pressure, leading to a patchwork of regulations across the country. Experts warn this could create significant disparities in access to care.</p>

          <p>Apple has taken full control of the core chips in its new iPhone lineup, introducing the A19 Pro system-on-a-chip with a new architecture designed to prioritize artificial intelligence tasks. This new design adds neural accelerators to each GPU core, significantly boosting its on-device AI processing capabilities. Alongside the A19 Pro, Apple also debuted its first custom wireless chip, the N1, and a second-generation modem, the C1X, reducing its reliance on suppliers like Broadcom and Qualcomm. This strategic shift underscores Apple's focus on enhancing AI performance, efficiency, and user privacy by handling more processing directly on the device.</p>

          <p>Fertility doctors and health experts are advocating for the inclusion of comprehensive fertility education within school-based sex education programs. They argue that current curriculums often focus exclusively on pregnancy prevention, leaving many adults ill-informed about their own reproductive biology, such as the impact of age and lifestyle on fertility. This lack of knowledge can lead to misconceptions and difficulties for those who later decide they want to have children. Proponents believe that teaching topics like ovulation and fertility cycles earlier in life could empower individuals to make more informed decisions about family planning.</p>

          <p>British scientists are using a new high-tech method to fight the spread of invasive Asian hornets by attaching miniature tracking devices to them. This technology allows response teams to follow the hornets directly back to their hidden nests, which can then be located and destroyed within an hour instead of several days. Asian hornets pose a significant threat to native honeybees and other crucial pollinators. The effort is supported by public participation through the Asian Hornet Watch app, which helps authorities quickly investigate sightings and eradicate colonies before they become permanently established.</p>
