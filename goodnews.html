          <p>Aryna Sabalenka, the world number one, and American Amanda Anisimova are set to face each other in the US Open final, with both players seeking redemption after recent adversities. Sabalenka has faced defeats in this year's Australian and French Open finals, while Anisimova is recovering from a significant loss at Wimbledon. The match is anticipated to be a contest of powerful ball-striking and emotional resilience, as both athletes have a history of letting their emotions influence their performance. This final represents a critical opportunity for Sabalenka to secure a Grand Slam title in 2025 and for Anisimova to demonstrate her mental fortitude on a major stage.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>A fisherman's recent catch of several suckermouth catfish, or common plecos, in a local waterway has drawn attention to the environmental damage caused by releasing aquarium pets into the wild. These fish, native to South America, are considered an invasive species in the U.S., primarily introduced through aquarium releases. Their presence can lead to significant ecological problems, including shore erosion, a reduction in native biodiversity, and economic losses for local fisheries, as they outcompete native species for resources. Experts and environmentalists often recommend managing such invasive populations by encouraging their consumption, a method some online commenters appeared ready to embrace.</p>

          <p>The Harlem Hellfighters, the decorated all-Black 369th Infantry Regiment from World War I, have been posthumously awarded the Congressional Gold Medal, Congress's highest civilian honor. The ceremony recognized the soldiers' extraordinary bravery and service, which was largely ignored for decades due to racial discrimination within the segregated U.S. military of the era. Despite facing racism at home, the regiment fought ferociously alongside French forces for 191 days, earning their legendary nickname. The recognition comes amid a broader national debate about how American history is remembered, with the medal set to be housed at the Smithsonian Institution for public display and research.</p>

          <p>The increasing popularity of GLP-1 drugs like Ozempic and Wegovy is causing a measurable shift in consumer grocery spending, presenting a new challenge for the processed food industry. Research indicates that users of these drugs reduce overall grocery spending and are trading ultra-processed snacks and sugary drinks for healthier options, impacting sales of traditional tailgating foods like hamburgers and chips. While the drugs reduce overall calorie consumption, studies suggest users still crave junk food, just in smaller quantities. This trend is forcing retailers and food companies to adapt, reformulating products and promotions as a new, health-conscious consumer segment with more disposable income emerges.</p>

          <h2>Composer Terry Riley, a Pioneer of Minimalism, Celebrated at Age 90</h2>

          <p>Terry Riley, the influential American composer widely credited as a father of musical Minimalism, recently turned 90, prompting celebrations of his vast and varied career. His 1964 work "In C" is considered a landmark piece that launched the genre, characterized by its rhythmic repetitions and harmonic trance, which influenced classical, rock, and pop music. However, Riley's own musical journey has been maximalist, exploring everything from ragtime and raga to keyboard improvisation and graphic scores. Now living in Japan, he continues to compose prolifically, with his work being celebrated in concerts like an upcoming tribute in Los Angeles.</p>

          <p>Nathaneo Johnson, a 21-year-old senior at Yale University, successfully co-founded an AI-powered social networking startup called Series while also being a full-time student. He and his co-founder raised $3.1 million in pre-seed funding for the platform, which automates "warm introductions" to connect people via iMessage for various purposes. Johnson manages his dual responsibilities through intense time management, often working 120-hour weeks and prioritizing his startup over typical college extracurriculars and social activities. Raised by a single mother, he states that not having a financial safety net motivates him to be fully committed to his venture as he prepares for a Series A funding round.</p>

          <p>The Trump administration has taken an unprecedented step by converting federal grants into a roughly 10% equity stake in chipmaker Intel, making the government its largest single shareholder. This move is not a bailout but a strategic industrial policy aimed at bolstering domestic manufacturing of cutting-edge microchips to compete with China and reduce reliance on foreign suppliers like Taiwan's TSMC. The goal is to mitigate supply chain risks, particularly the threat of a Chinese invasion of Taiwan, and enhance national security by ensuring critical systems use U.S.-made components. While the government will not have voting rights, the investment signifies a deep commitment to revitalizing a key American technology company.</p>

          <p>Prince Hisahito, nephew of Emperor Naruhito, has officially reached adulthood in a formal coming-of-age ceremony, becoming the first male royal to do so in 40 years. At 19, he is second in line to the Chrysanthemum Throne and is widely expected to become emperor one day. The event has reignited Japan's long-standing debate over its male-only succession law, as there are currently no other young male heirs to continue the imperial line after him. This shortage of successors has put the tradition under scrutiny, with public support growing for allowing female members, like the Emperor's daughter Princess Aiko, to ascend the throne.</p>

          <p>The influential Bauhaus art and design school is celebrating the 100th anniversary of its move to Dessau, Germany, with a series of exhibitions and events. However, the centennial has been met with political controversy, as Germany's far-right AfD party has warned against "glorifying" the school, echoing the Nazi party's condemnation of Bauhaus as "degenerate art" before it was shut down in 1933. Despite these attacks, the Bauhaus Dessau Foundation is proceeding with its celebration, focusing on the movement's legacy and ongoing relevance. The foundation's director expressed fear of the party's growing influence but noted the strong public support Bauhaus now enjoys.</p>

          <p>This personal essay explores how becoming a fan of the Buffalo Bills provided the author, previously indifferent to sports, with a powerful sense of community and belonging. The team serves as a metaphor for the city of Buffalo itself—resilient, tough, and perpetually striving for a victory that remains just out of reach, a narrative that fosters a deep, unbreakable bond among its supporters. The author describes how the "Go Bills" mantra permeates the city's culture, creating a shared identity that transcends geography. The experience illustrates that allegiance to a team can be a gifted connection, offering a sense of home and shared identity.</p>

          <p>Tesla's board of directors has proposed a new long-term incentive package for CEO Elon Musk that could potentially make him the world's first trillionaire. The plan, which requires shareholder approval, would grant Musk up to 12% of Tesla's stock over a decade if he meets a series of extremely aggressive growth targets, including increasing the company's market capitalization to at least $8.5 trillion by 2035. The proposal is designed to retain Musk, who has reportedly threatened to leave, and incentivize him to lead Tesla's transformation into an AI and robotics leader. The move has raised questions about corporate governance and the scale of executive compensation.</p>

          <p>Scotland's national football team began its World Cup qualification campaign with a valuable point earned in a draw against Denmark in Copenhagen. Manager Steve Clarke praised his team's work-rate and resilience in a performance that puts one of their main group rivals on the back foot early in the short, six-game qualification sprint. The result is a promising and uncharacteristically strong start for Scotland, whose past World Cup aspirations have often been derailed by early losses. Key players like Grant Hanley and Aaron Hickey delivered outstanding performances, giving the team a hopeful foundation for their upcoming matches.</p>

          <p>Thirty years ago, Colombian goalkeeper Rene Higuita performed one of football's most audacious and memorable saves, the "scorpion kick," during a friendly match against England at Wembley Stadium. Known as 'El Loco' (The Madman), Higuita's flamboyant style and willingness to play far outside his penalty box made him a pioneer of the modern sweeper-keeper role. The iconic save was the most famous moment in a unique career that included scoring 43 goals and a controversial association with drug lord Pablo Escobar, which led to a prison sentence. The scorpion kick cemented his legacy as a beloved, eccentric, and revolutionary figure in the sport.</p>
