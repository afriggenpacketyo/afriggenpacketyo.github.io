          <p>CoreWeave's CEO, Michael Intrator, defended the company's substantial capital expenditure plans, projecting $20 billion to $23 billion for the year, surpassing analyst estimates.

Despite investor concerns about the company's debt and the sustainability of AI server demand, Intrator assured that financing remains robust and lenders are confident in CoreWeave's contracts and business model. The company's client roster includes tech giants like Microsoft and Nvidia, with a recent deal inked with OpenAI totaling nearly $12 billion. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>A federal judge appointed by President Clinton issued a preliminary injunction against the Trump administration, preventing it from curtailing collective bargaining rights for foreign service workers. The lawsuit was filed by the American Foreign Service Association following an executive order by President Trump aimed at ending collective bargaining within government entities with national security missions. The judge's order stated that Trump's executive order was unlawful as applied to the heads of agencies with employees represented by the plaintiff. A White House spokesperson defended the executive order, asserting that President Trump would always prioritize public safety and national security.</p>

          <p>Federal Reserve Chair Jerome Powell cautioned that the U.S. could face more frequent and persistent supply shocks, posing challenges for the economy and central banks. This warning comes after the Fed decided to hold interest rates steady amidst economic uncertainty and concerns over the Trump administration's tariff policies. Powell acknowledged that the economic environment has changed significantly since 2020, with longer-term interest rates now considerably higher. Recent trade deal announcements have boosted the stock market, but analysts note that high tariffs are likely to persist.</p>

          <p>Republicans are facing potential difficulties in recruiting competitive Senate candidates for the 2026 elections, particularly in key states like Georgia and New Hampshire. High-profile Republicans like Governors Brian Kemp and Chris Sununu have declined to run, raising concerns about the party's ability to attract centrist candidates. Some Republicans believe that Trump's influence and demand for absolute loyalty are hindering recruitment efforts. However, others argue that these decisions do not necessarily indicate broader challenges in candidate recruitment, pointing to Trump's past success in Georgia.</p>

          <p>The Supreme Court heard arguments regarding President Trump's executive order aiming to limit U.S. citizenship to children born to lawful permanent residents. The case focuses on whether district court judges can issue nationwide injunctions blocking presidential policies.
