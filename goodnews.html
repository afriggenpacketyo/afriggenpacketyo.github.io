          <h2>UK and US Aim for Further Trade Opportunities After Initial Deal</h2>

          <p>Lord Mandelson, the UK's ambassador to the US, views the recent UK-US trade agreement as a foundation for future trade expansion and tariff reductions. The deal addresses tariffs previously imposed by former US President Donald Trump on UK imports like cars, steel, and aluminum. While discussions on the UK's Digital Services Tax (DST) occurred during negotiations, abolishing the DST was not part of the agreement. Mandelson noted that other ambassadors in Washington expressed envy at the UK's successful negotiation of the deal, and he also recounted a compliment he received from President Trump about his appearance.</p>

          <p>For years, China's leader Xi Jinping has been strategically positioning the country to become indispensable to the global economy through its exports and technological dominance. This plan, conceived well before the Trump administration's trade war, aims to give China leverage against potential economic sanctions or disruptions. By controlling key supply chains, particularly in critical minerals and manufacturing, China seeks to deter foreign powers from interfering with its policies. While this strategy has strengthened China's global influence, it has also strained relationships with trading partners and created economic challenges for many Chinese households.</p>

          <p>The UK steel industry has welcomed the removal of 25% tariffs on steel exports to the US, a move that provides some relief to struggling businesses.

Marcegaglia Stainless Sheffield, a major exporter to the US, anticipates increased demand but remains cautious about the future.

          <p>A judge has temporarily blocked the Trump administration from implementing sweeping cuts and layoffs at 20 federal agencies, part of a cost-cutting drive led by Elon Musk's Department of Government Efficiency (DOGE). The ruling favors federal employee unions who argue that the administration is overstepping its legal authority. The judge stated that President Trump likely needs Congressional approval to make such changes. The restraining order prevents further layoffs and program cuts, remaining in effect for at least 14 days.</p>
