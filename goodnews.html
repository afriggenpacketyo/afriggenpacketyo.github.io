          <h2>Chinese Scientists Make First Direct Observation of Quantum Friction Effect</h2>
          <div class="timestamp">2025-07-24 22:00:15 EDT</div>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>A research team in China has become the first to experimentally observe and measure quantum friction between two solid surfaces, using folded graphene. Their findings, published in Nature Communications, revealed a surprising effect where some thicker folds of the material slid more easily, challenging classical physics principles. The scientists traced this phenomenon to how bending the material altered its electronic structure, making it harder for motion to convert into heat. This breakthrough could pave the way for creating ultra-efficient nanodevices and machines with minimal wear and tear.</p>

          <p>Princeton, Texas, has been named the fastest-growing city in the U.S., with its population surging from 17,000 in 2020 to 37,000 in 2023. The boom is driven by affordable housing, attracting first-time homeowners from the expensive Dallas-Fort Worth metroplex. However, this explosive growth has created significant growing pains, forcing the city to temporarily halt construction to allow its infrastructure, including sewer lines, water, and roads, to catch up. With another 13,000 homes already approved, Princeton is racing to manage its development and is expected to reach 100,000 residents within five years.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Venus Williams' attempt to secure her first back-to-back tour wins since 2019 was ended by a 6-2, 6-2 loss to Magdalena Frech at the DC Open. The 45-year-old tennis legend had won her first-round match, becoming the oldest woman to win a tour-level singles match in two decades. This tournament marked her return to the sport after more than a year away due to surgery for uterine fibroids. Despite the loss, Williams received a standing ovation from the crowd, acknowledging her inspiring effort to compete at the highest level.</p>

          <p>The D.C. city council and the Washington Commanders have reached an amended agreement for a new stadium at the RFK Stadium site, moving the project forward despite recent threats from President Trump. Trump had stated he would block any deal unless the team reverted to its former name, but the council chairman characterized his comments as an unhelpful distraction. The deal, which includes $950 million in revenue benefits for the district, has widespread local support and is seen as a driver for jobs and investment. The council is confident it has the votes to pass the proposal.</p>

          <p>A Chuck E. Cheese employee in Tallahassee, Florida, was arrested while in full mascot costume on charges of debit card theft. Police allege the employee, Jermel Jarreau Jones, stole a customer's card during a child's party in June and used it multiple times. The victim reportedly identified the suspect after obtaining security footage from a store where the card was used and then worked with police to set up the arrest. Officers confronted the costumed mouse inside the restaurant and escorted him out in handcuffs, finding the stolen card in his pocket.</p>

          <p>CNBC's Jim Cramer believes major tech companies are underspending on artificial intelligence, arguing that the field represents a "winner-take-all" opportunity. He asserts that increased capital expenditures, such as Alphabet's recent $10 billion addition, are both urgent and necessary to secure dominance. Cramer dismisses skepticism about the technology's profitability, comparing the current AI race to the early days of internet search. He predicts the company that develops the most accurate AI chatbot will achieve a near-monopoly and reap hundreds of billions in profits. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>As the U.S. moves to phase out artificial food colorings like Red Dye No. 3, technology and food science firms are racing to develop natural alternatives. Companies are exploring sources like microalgae and specially grown vegetables to create stable, vivid pigments that can replace their synthetic counterparts. The challenge lies in matching the vibrancy and shelf life of artificial dyes, which consumers have come to expect. This shift is driven by new FDA regulations and pledges from major food giants to eliminate synthetic dyes from their products amid growing health concerns.</p>
