          <p>Three Merseyside Police officers have been recognized for their bravery in confronting Axel Rudakubana, the teenager who murdered three young girls and injured others at a Southport dance workshop in July 2024. Sgt Gregory Gillespie, PC Luke Holden, and PCSO Timothy Parry were the first to arrive and entered the building to face the attacker, who was armed with a large knife. They successfully disarmed and arrested Rudakubana, who was later jailed for a minimum of 52 years, with the officers receiving their honors at the 2025 Police Federation bravery awards.</p>

          <p>Astronomers have identified a new interstellar object, named 3I/Atlas, which could be the oldest comet ever observed, potentially predating our solar system by three billion years. A team from Oxford University suggests the object, which is only the third of its kind ever detected, originated in the Milky Way's "thick disk" of ancient stars. Made largely of water ice, 3I/Atlas is expected to develop a glowing tail as it approaches the Sun later this year, potentially becoming visible with amateur telescopes.</p>

          <p>This article draws parallels between the current US men's national team's preparation for the 2026 home World Cup under Mauricio Pochettino and South Korea's successful 2002 campaign under Guus Hiddink. It highlights how Hiddink overcame early struggles and media criticism by focusing intensely on fitness and fostering a strong team cohesion, leading to a historic semi-final run. The analysis suggests that while the circumstances differ, Pochettino could learn from Hiddink's methods of building a resilient and well-prepared team for a home tournament.</p>

          <p>Amid concerns that billions of dollars from opioid lawsuit settlements may be misused, two advocacy groups have launched a public database to track the spending. The Opioid Policy Institute and Popular Democracy created a website allowing people to report suspected cases of waste or fraud, aiming to pressure state attorneys general into providing better oversight. This initiative comes as states face criticism for diverting funds to fill budget gaps instead of using them for addiction and recovery services as intended.</p>

          <p>The Pentagon has invested $400 million in American miner MP Materials in an effort to decrease U.S. dependence on China for rare earth elements, which are crucial for technology and defense.

The executive estimates that even with a concerted effort, the U.S. might only achieve 40-50% self-sufficiency in strategic rare earths by 2027 or 2028. (not investment advice)</p>

Authorities have now prohibited its use for treating Alzheimer's, stating it remains in an exploratory research stage and requires proper clinical trials to validate its potential benefits.</p>

While effective for alerting people outdoors in rural areas like Kerr County, experts caution that sirens are just one part of a comprehensive warning system that must also include mobile alerts and public education. The article notes that the county had previously considered sirens but faced resident opposition, and that funding and maintenance for such systems remain significant challenges.</p>
