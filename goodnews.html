          <p>President Trump is scheduled to deliver remarks after the White House revealed Saudi Arabia's commitment to invest $600 billion in various deals with the United States. This announcement follows Trump's visit with Saudi Crown Prince Mohammed bin Salman in Riyadh. A significant part of the agreement includes a nearly $142 billion defense sales deal, providing Saudi Arabia with advanced warfighting equipment and services from over a dozen U.S. defense firms. The White House indicated that this commitment is almost double Saudi Arabia's 2025 defense budget, marking a substantial deepening of U.S.-Saudi economic ties.</p>

          <p>Microsoft announced it is laying off 3% of its employees across all levels, teams, and geographies as part of organizational changes to better position the company in a dynamic marketplace. Despite reporting better-than-expected quarterly results with $25.8 billion in net income and a positive forecast in late April, the company is making these cuts. The move will affect thousands of employees out of Microsoft's 228,000 worldwide workforce. This round of layoffs is likely the largest since the elimination of 10,000 roles in 2023, but unlike previous performance-based cuts, these new job cuts are not related to employee performance.</p>

With a capacity of 39,572, Goodison Park will become the largest dedicated women's football stadium in the country. This move reflects Everton's commitment to investing in women's football and ensuring Goodison Park continues to play a significant role in the community.</p>

          <p>Following the first set of talks since President Trump's tariffs, both Beijing and Washington have claimed victory after most of those steep import duties were removed. However, analysts contend that Beijing emerged with the upper hand, consolidating its status as a credible global counterweight to Washington. China entered the negotiations from a position of strength, having learned from dealing with Trump during his first term. Geopolitical strategist Sebastian Contin Trillo-Figueroa suggests that the performative aspect of power projection is more significant than immediate economic gains.</p>

          <p>An article in The Atlantic examines the debate over neoliberalism following Donald Trump‚Äôs 2024 restoration to power. After Trump's 2016 victory, many Democrats blamed neoliberal economic policies for his win, leading to the adoption of "Bidenomics," which emphasized government intervention. However, working-class voters abandoned Democrats in 2024, prompting economists to question the success of Biden's approach. The article explores whether Democrats lost despite or because of Biden's post-neoliberal policies, examining the successes and failures of the administration's economic agenda.</p>

GM plans to use lithium manganese-rich (LMR) prismatic battery cells in full-size electric vehicles like the Chevrolet Silverado and Escalade IQ, starting in 2028. These batteries utilize more prevalent and less expensive minerals, such as manganese, instead of larger amounts of cobalt and nickel.
