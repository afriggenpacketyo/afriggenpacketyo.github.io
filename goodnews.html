        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>World No. 1 golfer Scottie Scheffler won his first British Open at Royal Portrush, finishing 17-under par with a four-stroke lead. This victory marks his fourth major title, placing him in an elite group with Jack Nicklaus, Gary Player, and Tiger Woods as the only players to win The Open, Masters, and PGA Championship before age 30. The dominant performance has solidified his status as the most commanding figure in men's golf, drawing frequent comparisons to the peak era of Tiger Woods. Scheffler now only needs a U.S. Open victory to complete the career Grand Slam.</p>

          <p>Officials in Texas have significantly lowered the number of people considered missing after the catastrophic Hill Country floods, from over 100 down to just three. The Kerr County Flood Disaster Joint Information Center announced that extensive follow-up work by state and local agencies successfully located many individuals who were initially unaccounted for. The historic flash floods killed at least 135 people, with most fatalities occurring along the Guadalupe River. In response to the disaster, the Texas Legislature is set to convene a special session to address flood-related issues, including the potential for improved early warning systems for the region.</p>

          <p>For only the second time in its 116-year history, the UK's Girlguiding organization has launched a new set of 72 achievement badges to reflect contemporary interests. The new additions, developed with input from over 20,000 girls and volunteers, include badges for 'fandoms,' 'laughter,' 'booktivist,' and 'grooving.' This move aims to keep the organization relevant by recognizing a broader range of skills and passions, from environmental conservation to digital literacy and personal confidence. The update provides new challenges for all age groups, from the youngest Rainbows (age 4) to the oldest Rangers (age 18), empowering them to explore modern activities.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>The UK government has confirmed a national inquiry will be held into the violent 1984 confrontation between police and striking miners known as the 'Battle of Orgreave'. Home Secretary Yvette Cooper stated that those affected have had unanswered questions for over 40 years about the clash outside a coking plant in Rotherham. The inquiry will examine the events of the day, which left over 100 people injured, and the subsequent failed prosecutions of 95 miners, which collapsed amid allegations of falsified police evidence. Campaigners, who have sought an inquiry for 13 years, expressed cautious elation at the long-awaited announcement.</p>

          <p>The global demand for mezcal, an agave-based spirit from Mexico, has surged, transforming the lives of traditional distilling families in Oaxaca. Once overshadowed by tequila, artisanal mezcal is now a half-billion-dollar industry, celebrated in high-end bars worldwide. The report from CBS News profiles the Hernandez brothers, fourth-generation mezcaleros who, after migrating to the U.S. for work, returned to expand their family's distillery, Mal de Amor. Their story reflects the broader trend of mezcal's rise from a locally-produced spirit to a premium global commodity, driven by a growing appreciation for its handcrafted, traditional production methods.</p>

The tool acts as a Socratic guide, prompting students to think critically rather than providing direct answers, and assists teachers with time-consuming tasks like lesson planning. A unique feature allows teachers to monitor student conversations with the AI, which has raised some privacy concerns but also proven effective in identifying students in emotional distress. The system can flag conversations about self-harm, enabling school counselors to intervene, demonstrating a potential life-saving application beyond academic support.</p>

          <p>Following a viral incident at a previous show, Coldplay frontman Chris Martin issued a friendly warning to his audience in Wisconsin before the band's 'Jumbotron Song' segment. He humorously advised attendees to "do your makeup now" as the cameras would soon be scanning the crowd. This comes after two executives from the tech company Astronomer were caught on camera in a compromising embrace during the song at a recent concert, leading to a public fallout and the CEO's resignation. The company has since launched a formal investigation into the matter, while the viral clip continues to generate memes and commentary online.</p>

        </div>
        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>According to parenting expert Reem Raouda, the single most important skill to teach a child for lifelong success is self-connection, which is the ability to understand their own emotions and needs. Raouda, who has studied over 200 parent-child relationships, argues that this skill builds emotional resilience, fosters healthy boundaries, and cultivates authentic confidence. She suggests that common parental responses like dismissing a child's fears or sadness can inadvertently teach them to distrust their own feelings. To foster self-connection, she advises parents to validate emotions, avoid micromanaging, and model healthy emotional regulation, which ultimately protects a child's long-term mental health.</p>

This new consumer champion will serve as a single point of contact and will have legal powers to protect customers in disputes with water companies. The announcement is part of a broader overhaul of the water industry, which has faced intense public criticism for rising bills and a record number of sewage spills into UK waterways. Environment Secretary Steve Reed described the sector as "broken" and vowed to hold companies accountable for improving water quality.</p>

Created by Mexican-American artist Robert Vargas, the artwork depicts Valenzuela in his famous wind-up pose and tipping his cap, symbolizing his connection with the Latino community. Valenzuela, who played for the Dodgers from 1980 to 1990, sparked the phenomenon known as 'Fernandomania' and helped bridge the gap between the team and its Latino fanbase.

          <p>When asked how to get rich from Bitcoin, the AI tool ChatGPT outlined several potential strategies, while also cautioning about inherent risks. The primary method suggested was the long-term 'buy and hold' strategy, which has yielded massive gains for early investors who weathered market volatility. Other approaches included active day trading to capitalize on short-term price fluctuations, earning Bitcoin directly through freelance work or e-commerce, and investing in Bitcoin-related stocks or ETFs for a less direct exposure. The AI emphasized that all methods carry significant risk and that past performance does not guarantee future returns. (not investment advice)</p>
