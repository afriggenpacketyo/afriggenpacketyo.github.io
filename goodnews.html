          <h2>Complete Skeleton of Medieval Knight Discovered Beneath Polish Ice Cream Parlor Site</h2>
          <div class="timestamp">2025-07-16 10:56:10 EDT</div>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Archaeologists in Gdańsk, Poland, have unearthed the complete skeleton of a medieval knight under the former location of a popular ice cream shop. The remains, found just beneath an engraved limestone tombstone, are believed to date back to the 13th or 14th century. Initial analysis suggests the knight was around 40 years old at the time of his death and stood between 5'6" and 5'10". Researchers are now conducting further studies on the well-preserved skeleton and tombstone to determine his identity and the historical context of his burial.</p>

          <p>Morgan Stanley announced second-quarter financial results that exceeded Wall Street's predictions, largely due to a surge in trading revenues. The bank reported earnings of $2.13 per share on revenue of $16.79 billion, outperforming analyst expectations. The institutional securities and wealth management divisions both showed significant strength, with the latter's net revenues rising to $7.76 billion. CEO Ted Pick highlighted this as the sixth consecutive quarter of consistent earnings, demonstrating the firm's resilience across different market conditions. (not investment advice)</p>

          <h2>Upcoming iPhone 17 Air May Feature Titanium Frame to Enhance Durability</h2>
          <div class="timestamp">2025-07-16 10:37:00 EDT</div>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>According to recent rumors, Apple's forthcoming iPhone 17 Air, which is expected to replace the Plus model, may feature a titanium frame. This design choice is speculated to be a strategic move to ensure the structural integrity of the ultra-thin device, which is rumored to be just 5.5 mm thick. The use of titanium, a strong yet lightweight material, could help Apple avoid a "Bendgate"-style controversy similar to the one that affected the iPhone 6. This would be a key marketing point, addressing durability concerns for the large-screen, slim-profile phone.</p>

          <p>Bank of America reported mixed second-quarter results, beating earnings estimates but falling short on revenue, making it the only major U.S. bank to do so this quarter. The company's profit climbed to $7.12 billion, or 89 cents per share, while revenue was $26.61 billion, slightly below expectations. A key factor was its net interest income, which missed analyst estimates, as lower interest rates offset gains from loan and deposit growth. CEO Brian Moynihan highlighted consumer resilience and positive momentum in the bank's markets businesses. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>The cryptocurrency market saw a rebound, with Bitcoin and Ether prices rising, as optimism grew that key stablecoin legislation could pass the House this week. Prices had dipped briefly after a procedural vote failed to advance the GENUIS and CLARITY acts. However, a subsequent social media post from President Trump indicated that several opposing Republicans had changed their minds after a White House meeting, boosting investor confidence. Analysts suggest the passage of these regulatory bills is a matter of "when" not "if," which could bring much-needed clarity to the digital asset space. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>An independent review of the UK's National Health Service has recommended that physician associates (PAs) and anaesthesia associates (AAs) be renamed "assistants" to avoid patient confusion. The review also suggests that these professionals should wear standardized uniforms and only see patients with minor ailments after triage by a doctor. The recommendations follow safety concerns and the deaths of patients who were treated by PAs they believed were qualified doctors.

          <p>A novel insurance program in Ahmedabad, India, is providing financial relief to informal workers, like waste pickers, who lose wages due to extreme heat. The parametric insurance plan automatically pays out a small sum when temperatures exceed a specific threshold for consecutive days. This system helps vulnerable daily wage earners avoid having to choose between their health and their income during record-breaking heatwaves. The program, which doesn't require claims or proof of loss, is being hailed as an effective climate adaptation strategy for a population highly exposed to climate risks.</p>
