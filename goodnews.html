          <p>Seven young trapeze artists from Guadalajara, Mexico, known as “Los Polémicos Hermanos Caballero,” received the highest honor at the 47th annual Monte Carlo Circus Festival. The group, representing the sixth generation of the Caballero circus family, earned the "Golden Clown" award for their exceptional talent and execution of the quadruple somersault. The award was presented by Prince Albert of Monaco and Princess Stephanie, marking a significant achievement for Mexican circus arts on the global stage. The troupe is composed of cousins between the ages of 14 and 22.</p>

          <p>Sam Altman's Worldcoin, an eye-scanning identity verification project, has officially launched in the United States with six retail locations. The project uses a biometric device called an Orb to scan irises, creating a unique "IrisCode" to verify humanness and prevent fraud. In exchange for having their irises scanned, users receive Worldcoin's cryptocurrency, WLD, and can use their World ID for sign-ins with integrated platforms. The company has also announced partnerships with Visa for the "World Visa card" and Match Group for age verification on Tinder in Japan.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Migrant crossings at the U.S. southern border have remained at historically low levels for three months following President Trump's immigration crackdown. Border Patrol agents recorded approximately 8,400 apprehensions in April, consistent with the numbers from February and March. This represents a significant decrease compared to the record-breaking influx experienced under the Biden administration. The Trump administration attributes this decline to its strict immigration policies, including the near-closure of the asylum system and the deployment of additional troops to the border. Colleen Putzel-Kavanaugh of the Migration Policy Institute suggests that the administration's tough rhetoric and actions are deterring migrants from attempting to cross the border.</p>

          <p>A lynx born in a zoo in Cornwall could become the first UK zoo-born cat to be successfully released into the wild. Due to a shortage of female lynxes in the European breeding programme, the cat from Newquay Zoo has been moved to Germany's Black Forest, where it will be monitored in an enclosure to assess its survival skills. The goal is to introduce new cats to increase genetic diversity, particularly in central Europe, where habitat fragmentation has led to inbreeding. If successful, this initiative could pave the way for the reintroduction of lynx to the UK, where they were driven to extinction centuries ago.</p>

          <p>President Trump is closing a duty-free loophole for low-value packages, which will likely increase prices for US consumers who shop at online retailers like Shein and Temu. The "de minimis" exemption, which applied to parcels worth less than $800, allowed these companies to ship goods directly to the US without paying duties or import taxes. The move is aimed at tackling the illegal importation of synthetic opioids and supporting American businesses. Shein and Temu have already begun to adjust their prices in anticipation of the change, and similar reviews are underway in the UK and EU.</p>

          <p>The latest Marvel Cinematic Universe installment, "Thunderbolts*", distinguishes itself by delving into the personal traumas of its characters while maintaining an organic sense of humor. The film follows a group of antiheroes, including Yelena Belova (Florence Pugh), as they confront their inner demons and battle a sinister CIA director. Despite featuring numerous characters from previous productions, the movie remains accessible to viewers without extensive knowledge of the Marvel saga. Pugh's performance is a highlight, balancing action and emotional depth, while director Jake Schreier effectively manages complex themes within a science fiction context.</p>

          <p>Apple is bracing for a $900 million impact from tariffs this quarter, despite President Trump's decision to spare key electronics from import taxes. The tech giant is shifting iPhone production for the American market away from China, with most iPhones now being made in India. While Apple is increasing investments in the US, India and Vietnam are set to be the primary beneficiaries of the supply chain shift. The company's first-quarter revenues rose 5% to $95.4 billion, showing that sales remain unaffected for now. </p>

          <p>Apple's second-quarter financials surpassed Wall Street's expectations, with revenue reaching $95.4 billion. However, the company anticipates tariffs to add $900 million to costs in the upcoming quarter, leading to a drop in stock value. Despite the positive results, investors remain cautious due to ongoing trade policy chaos and concerns about declining iPhone sales in China. CEO Tim Cook stated that China will remain a major manufacturer for the company, but production is shifting to India and Vietnam to mitigate the impact of tariffs. </p>

Despite the miss, AWS operating income totaled $11.55 billion, and the segment's operating margin was the widest it has been since 2014. Amazon CEO Andy Jassy stated that the cost of AI for customers will decrease over time, partly due to Amazon's custom chips.
