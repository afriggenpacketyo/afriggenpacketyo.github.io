        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Nearly a decade after the acrimonious split between creator Hideo Kojima and publisher Konami, the "Metal Gear Solid" series has returned with a remake of its third installment, "Metal Gear Solid Delta." The article explores the history of the franchise, the likely reasons for Kojima's 2015 departure, and Konami's subsequent shift away from major console game development. Amidst a lucrative industry trend of remaking classic games, this release is seen as a pivotal moment for the series. Early impressions from fans suggest the remake is a faithful recreation that honors the original's legacy while modernizing its graphics and controls.</p>

          <p>The BBC is launching a new dating show, "Stranded on Honeymoon Island," hosted by Davina McCall, which combines elements of survival and romance. The format involves couples being matched by experts after a brief speed date, having a fake wedding, and then being left on a remote tropical island to build a relationship under harsh conditions. Contestants and critics suggest the show's focus on authenticity and overcoming adversity could lead to stronger connections compared to more superficial dating programs. The show also features a slightly older cast, reflecting a trend of people settling down later in life.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Scientists in the UK are using an innovative combination of technology and animal instinct to fight the invasive spruce bark beetle, a significant threat to the nation's forests. The beetle, which has devastated millions of spruce trees across Europe, is now being carried to the UK on winds across the English Channel. To combat the infestation, Forestry Research is deploying drones for aerial surveillance, sniffer dogs trained to detect the beetles' pheromones, and adapted nuclear fallout models to predict their spread. These efforts have successfully eradicated the pest from controlled zones in southeast England, though the threat remains due to climate change stressing tree populations.</p>

          <p>Australia's Alex de Minaur has reached the fourth round of the US Open for the fifth time after his opponent, Daniel Altmaier of Germany, retired due to injury. De Minaur was leading the match when Altmaier, who was struggling after a grueling previous round, could no longer continue. As the last Australian player remaining in the singles draw, de Minaur now faces a favorable matchup against a qualifier for a spot in the quarterfinals. Meanwhile, fellow Australian Daria Kasatkina was knocked out in the third round by two-time champion Naomi Osaka, who advanced to face Coco Gauff.</p>

          <h2>Data Shows First Week of School is Crucial for Student Attendance Throughout the Year</h2>
          <div class="timestamp">2025-08-30 19:09:40 EDT</div>
        </div>
        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>New data from England's Department for Education reveals a strong correlation between student attendance in the first week of the school year and their attendance for the remainder of the year. According to the figures, 57% of pupils who were absent at all during the first week of the 2024 term went on to become "persistently absent," meaning they missed at least 10% of school. In contrast, only 14% of students with perfect attendance in the first week became persistently absent. Education Secretary Bridget Phillipson is urging parents and schools to prioritize getting children into classrooms from day one to combat post-pandemic attendance issues.</p>

          <p>An opinion article suggests that Indonesian President-elect Prabowo Subianto is positioned to introduce a new, pragmatic model for international relations amid global dysfunction. As a leader of a major economy that is not aligned with a single ideological bloc, Prabowo can act as a bridge between competing powers. The piece argues that his philosophy of "constructive pragmatism" could serve as a road map for a new world order that prioritizes practical cooperation over ideological confrontation. This approach is presented as a necessary corrective for an international system often paralyzed by competing national interests and institutional gridlock.</p>

          <p>Facing significant U.S. tariffs, Indian Prime Minister Narendra Modi and Chinese President Xi Jinping are meeting with the potential goal of resetting their countries' strained relationship. Both economic powerhouses are dealing with the impact of President Trump's trade policies and may see mutual benefit in closer cooperation, despite long-standing border disputes and geopolitical mistrust. The visit is seen as a potential turning point, signaling a shift toward a more multipolar world where the two Asian giants could reshape global trade flows. Potential outcomes include the resumption of direct flights and other economic deals, though deep-seated rivalries remain a challenge.</p>

          <p>Director Guillermo del Toro's long-awaited adaptation of "Frankenstein" has debuted at the Venice Film Festival, fulfilling a lifelong dream for the acclaimed filmmaker. The Netflix-funded project, starring Oscar Isaac as Victor Frankenstein and Jacob Elordi as his creation, is described as an ambitious and large-scale production. Del Toro emphasized his desire to reconstruct the world of the story and explore the humanity of the creature, portraying him as a beautiful, newborn being rather than a grotesque accident. Early reviews are mixed, with some praising its artistry and emotional depth, while others find it lacks substance despite its impressive visuals.</p>

          <p>Ahead of the 80th anniversary of Victory Day, an article explores how shared history from World War II could serve as a foundation for improving strained U.S.-China relations.

This historical alliance is presented as a potential formula for fostering better bilateral ties from a grassroots level. The piece suggests that focusing on this period of mutual support and shared sacrifice could help bridge current diplomatic divides between the two global powers.</p>

          <p>The town council of Machynlleth, Powys, has denied a request from a local hotel to silence the town's 150-year-old clock during nighttime hours. The hotel owner argued that the clock, which chimes every fifteen minutes, has led to regular complaints from guests, forcing them to move rooms. However, councillors rejected the proposal, stating that the chimes are an integral part of the town's character, especially after a recent £55,000 restoration project. Local sentiment appears to support the council's decision, with many residents considering the sound to be unobtrusive background noise and a cherished feature of the town.</p>

The album presents a gallery of disappointing men, from crybabies to those too focused on self-improvement to be intimate. The sound combines '70s-era pop influences with country and dance music, produced with collaborators like Jack Antonoff. While the review suggests it isn't as consistently sharp as her breakout album "Short n' Sweet," it praises her versatile vocal performance and highlights standout tracks that showcase her witty and cynical take on modern romance.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Despite a lack of uniform international rules, medical and psychological experts generally agree on precautionary principles for children's screen time based on developmental stages. For toddlers, the recommendation is to be screen-free until age three to encourage exploration of the physical world and development of self-controlled attention. For kindergarten-aged children, limited and supervised screen time is advised to foster imagination and social interaction. As children grow, the focus shifts from strict time limits to the quality of content and maintaining open communication, ensuring digital activities do not replace essential real-world experiences and social development.</p>
