          <p>Mortgage rates remain high in June 2025, presenting challenges for prospective homebuyers and those seeking to refinance. As of June 9, 2025, the average 30-year mortgage rate is 6.97%, and the 15-year mortgage rate is 6.14%. Refinance rates are similar, with 30-year refinance averaging 6.90% and 15-year refinance at 6.17%. Experts suggest that borrowers may see some relief if the Federal Reserve pauses rate hikes, and improving one's credit profile is essential to secure a favorable rate. (not investment advice)</p>

Online banks often provide the best high-yield savings accounts due to lower overhead costs.

          <p>China appears to have eased restrictions on rare earth exports to Western auto giants, following warnings from industry groups about potential production threats. China's Ministry of Commerce expressed willingness to establish a "green channel" for eligible export license applications to EU firms. This breakthrough follows trade talks between Chinese and EU officials, and licenses have also been granted to suppliers of U.S. auto giants like General Motors, Ford, and Stellantis. The move comes after China imposed export restrictions on rare earth elements and magnets in April, a response to U.S. tariffs.</p>

This automation has doubled production speed and eliminated quality rejects, challenging traditional stereotypes of Chinese manufacturing.
