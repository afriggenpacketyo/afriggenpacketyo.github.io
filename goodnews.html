          <p>The article discusses China's potential role in leading the global green energy transition, particularly as the United States steps back from the climate stage. The author emphasizes that China's leadership in clean energy manufacturing and renewable deployment is not only a matter of duty but also in its own interest, citing the increasing impact of climate change on China, such as extreme weather events causing significant economic damage. The piece argues that the green transition can drive progress across political and economic divides, presenting clean energy and climate-smart investments as economic opportunities for China to push the frontier of international investment.</p>
