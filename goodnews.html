          <p>The European Court of Justice has ruled against Malta's "golden passport" program, the last of its kind in the EU, deeming it a mere "commercial transaction" that undermines the solidarity and mutual trust between member states. The program, which offered citizenship to foreign investors, raised concerns about security, money laundering, tax evasion, and corruption risks. While Malta's Prime Minister defends the scheme, stating it earned the country over ‚Ç¨1.4 billion, the ruling highlights the need for stricter regulations on "golden visa" programs that offer residence permits for investments, ensuring due diligence and background checks.</p>
