          <p>China has announced the mass production of the world's first ultra-low noise, four-channel single-photon detector, dubbed the "photon catcher." Developed by the Quantum Information Engineering Technology Research Centre, this device can detect a single photon, making it crucial for quantum communication and quantum radar systems. This technology has significant implications for national defense, including the potential to detect and track stealth aircraft like the F-22.</p>

Despite President Trump's softened stance on China, the fees mark an escalation in trade tensions. Japan's Nikkei 225 declined, while South Korea's Kospi rose, boosted by Samsung Electronics' strong profit projection. Singapore's economy also reported faster-than-expected growth in the third quarter. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>Missouri has implemented a new hands-free law to combat distracted driving, making it illegal to use handheld cellphones while operating a vehicle. The legislation, championed by Adrienne Siddens after her husband's death in a distracted driving crash, aims to reduce the estimated nine daily fatalities nationwide. The state's Department of Transportation is now using anonymous smartphone and vehicle data to identify distracted driving "hot spots," revealing higher rates than previously reported. This data will inform targeted educational programs and increased law enforcement visibility to improve road safety.</p>

          <p>California Governor Gavin Newsom has signed legislation to significantly raise the wages of state prisoners battling wildfires, increasing their pay from approximately $1 an hour to the federal minimum wage of $7.25 per hour. This new law, taking effect immediately, allocates $10 million for the wage increase, though it remains below the state's general minimum wage. The measure addresses a social justice concern regarding the dangerous work performed by incarcerated firefighters, who are a critical part of the state's wildfire response efforts.</p>

          <p>The Gaza peace plan, brokered by President Trump, advanced significantly with Hamas releasing all 20 living Israeli hostages in exchange for hundreds of Palestinian prisoners, alongside increased humanitarian aid. World leaders convened in Egypt to discuss the future of Gaza, yet major questions persist regarding subsequent phases. Key challenges include Hamas's refusal to disarm, Israel's rejection of a Palestinian state, and the complex issue of Gaza's postwar governance. Reconstruction efforts are estimated to require at least $53 billion, underscoring the fragility of the situation.</p>
