IBM's stock also saw a gain of about 6% on the news. A paper expected next week will detail IBM's ability to run a quantum error-correction algorithm on AMD's chips, building on an existing agreement between the two companies to develop quantum computing capabilities. This development highlights renewed interest in the quantum space, boosting other related stocks like D-Wave Quantum and Rigetti Computing, as technology giants race to develop this advanced computing technology (not investment advice).</p>

          <p>Six men have been jailed for their roles in a Russian-ordered arson attack on a London warehouse that provided aid to Ukraine, causing £1.3 million in damage. Ringleader Dylan Earl, recruited by the proscribed Wagner Group, received a 17-year sentence for the "planned campaign of terrorism and sabotage" carried out in the interests of the Russian state. Earl, who was also plotting to kidnap a wealthy Russian dissident, brought in other men to carry out the fire at the Ukrainian-owned facility. The warehouse had been used to send critical goods, including Starlink satellite terminals, to Ukraine, highlighting the broader geopolitical context of the attack.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>A viral chart claiming the UK is Europe's "sexual assault capital" is misleading, as comparing international sexual assault statistics is inherently problematic due to vast differences in legal definitions, reporting practices, and cultural factors. DW Fact check, citing World Population Review and Eurostat, explains that the UK's high reported rate largely reflects its broader, consent-based legal definition and specific counting methods, where a group sexual assault can be counted as multiple offenses. Criminologists recommend victim surveys over police statistics for a more accurate measure, debunking claims that mass immigration is a driving factor, as evidence does not support such assertions.</p>

          <p>The North Shore Library's new $8.2 million, state-of-the-art building in Bayside is set to open on February 2, 2026, replacing its outdated Glendale facility. Located within Bayside's One North Development, which also includes apartments and retail, the new library will serve four communities: Glendale, River Hills, Bayside, and Fox Point. While the building is on track for occupancy permits in December, with construction crews installing fixtures and carpeting, a grand opening celebration is planned for mid-March. Despite the imminent opening, the library's fundraising foundation continues to withhold $800,000 in pledged donation funds, creating a legal dispute over the project's financing gap.</p>

          <p>Police in Bavaria, Germany, have dismantled a three-country plot to sell sophisticated forgeries of masterpieces by artists including Rembrandt, Pablo Picasso, and Frida Kahlo, for sums up to $150 million. The main suspect, a 77-year-old German man, allegedly attempted to sell 20 fake paintings, aided by 10 accomplices, including an 84-year-old Swiss woman. The investigation gained traction after his attempts to sell Picasso portraits and a Rembrandt copy, despite the original being publicly displayed in Amsterdam, raised suspicions. Raids across Germany, Switzerland, and Liechtenstein led to arrests, with authorities now meticulously examining the confiscated artworks to confirm their lack of authenticity.</p>

          <p>President Trump announced he would not proceed with a planned federal law enforcement "surge" in San Francisco, crediting Mayor Daniel Lurie for "very nicely" persuading him to stand down. Lurie confirmed the president initiated the call, assuring reporters that no demands were made in return for the decision. Trump also cited endorsements from prominent Silicon Valley leaders, including Salesforce CEO Marc Benioff and Nvidia CEO Jensen Huang, who vouched for San Francisco's "substantial progress" under Lurie's leadership. This unexpected reversal comes amidst reported decreases in the city's crime rates and showcases the intricate political negotiations between the federal government and Democratic-led cities.</p>

          <p>Filmmaker Guillermo del Toro shares his profound connection to Mary Shelley's "Frankenstein," viewing horror as a refuge for spirituality that illuminates our inner selves and the human condition. He describes the novel as a primal parable, imprinted emotionally, that explores the "absolute horror of a life without a reason." Del Toro emphasizes the tragedy of the Creature, abandoned by its creator Victor Frankenstein, who usurps divine and procreative roles without calculating consequences. For del Toro, "Frankenstein" is a "travelogue of the soul," a cautionary tale of solitude and abandonment that continues to resonate with urgent, unanswered questions about existence and redemption.</p>

          <p>A new study in Current Biology, led by Nicolás Rascovan of the Pasteur Institute, utilized ancient DNA from the teeth of Napoleon's fallen soldiers to uncover previously unknown causes of death during the disastrous 1812 Russian campaign. Beyond the long-suspected typhus and trench fever, researchers identified bacteria causing paratyphoid fever and relapsing fever, transmitted by body lice. These findings, derived from advanced molecular techniques applied to remains from a mass grave in Lithuania, highlight the complex microbial assault faced by the army. The study underscores the harsh realities of historical warfare and how understanding past disease spread can inform modern pathogen challenges.</p>

          <p>Inglewood High School's once-storied marching band has experienced a remarkable resurgence under the leadership of director Joseph Jauregui, known as Mr. J. Facing broken instruments, old uniforms, and only eight students upon his arrival, Jauregui tirelessly recruited and secured resources, growing the band to over 120 members. For students like sophomore Joan Rosas, who struggled academically, the band provides a crucial protective factor and a path to success, including scholarship opportunities at Historically Black Colleges and Universities (HBCUs). Jauregui's dedication has not only restored the band's former glory but also transformed students' lives and academic prospects.</p>

          <p>Procter & Gamble reported better-than-expected fiscal first-quarter earnings and revenue, driven by strong demand in its beauty and grooming sectors. Despite this success, the company noted flat volume growth overall, indicating a slowdown in consumer demand for some products amidst inflation and a "K-shaped" economy where lower-income consumers are cutting back. P&G reiterated its fiscal 2026 sales and earnings forecast, adjusting expected tariff costs down to $400 million from $800 million due to rescinded Canadian retaliatory tariffs. However, President Trump's recent termination of all trade talks with Canada could introduce new cost uncertainties for the company (not investment advice).</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>With Americans facing record credit card debt, many worry about debt collection lawsuits, which can occur for surprisingly small amounts. There's no strict threshold, but collectors typically consider lawsuits for debts between $1,000 and $5,000, weighing potential recovery against legal costs and state laws. Unsecured debts like credit cards are more frequently litigated, while older debts beyond the statute of limitations cannot legally be sued for. To avoid legal action, individuals should proactively communicate with creditors, explore debt management programs, consider debt settlement for larger sums, or look into debt consolidation loans. Acting quickly is crucial to protect finances and prevent the long-term damage of a judgment (not investment advice).</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>A significant change for inherited IRAs in 2025 will require many non-spouse beneficiaries, like adult children, to begin taking annual required minimum distributions (RMDs) while still depleting the account within 10 years. This new IRS regulation, released in 2024, clarifies previous ambiguity and aims to avoid a 25% penalty for missed RMDs. Financial experts advise heirs to strategically plan withdrawals, potentially "playing the income tax bracket game" by taking distributions during lower-earning years to mitigate tax impacts. Understanding these changes is crucial for beneficiaries navigating the "great wealth transfer" and optimizing their tax situation (not investment advice).</p>
