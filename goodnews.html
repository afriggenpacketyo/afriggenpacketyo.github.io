          <div class="timestamp">2025-08-03 15:48:10 EDT</div>
        </div>
        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Florida has surpassed California in new utility-scale solar energy capacity, driven primarily by large power companies rather than rooftop installations. This growth is attributed to streamlined state regulations for projects under 75 megawatts and favorable economics, making solar a cheaper alternative to natural gas. Despite this progress, the industry faces headwinds from the rollback of federal tax credits, which is expected to decrease residential solar installations. The state's ability to maintain this momentum will depend on grid upgrades and navigating a shifting political landscape without consistent policy support.</p>

The event, held at Tannahill's Tavern & Music Hall, will feature country music artists including headliner Amanda Shires. All proceeds from ticket sales, a live-streamed donation drive, and an online silent auction will go to the Salvation Army's flood relief efforts.

          <p>A 3.0 magnitude earthquake centered in Hasbrouck Heights, New Jersey, was felt across parts of the state and New York on Saturday night. This is the second seismic event in the region in less than two weeks, following a series of smaller quakes in mid-July. While no immediate damage was reported, officials have warned of potential aftershocks. Geologists note that such minor quakes are common along the Ramapo Fault line but are rarely strong enough to cause significant issues or be widely felt.</p>

          <p>Dr. Mehmet Oz, the administrator for the Centers for Medicare & Medicaid Services, announced that applications for a $50 billion rural hospital stabilization fund will be available in early September. The fund is part of President Trump's recently passed legislation and is intended to offset the impact of Medicaid cuts on rural healthcare providers. Oz stated the money is designed to support workforce development, system right-sizing, and the expansion of telehealth services. The legislation also introduces new Medicaid work requirements, which Oz defended as a way to connect people to the job market. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>The Los Angeles Dodgers defeated the Tampa Bay Rays 3-0, relying on strategic baserunning and timely singles rather than power hitting to score. The team has been struggling offensively, prompting another lineup change that moved Shohei Ohtani back to the leadoff spot. Despite the low-scoring victory, concerns remain about the lineup's performance, particularly Mookie Betts's ongoing slump. The win, anchored by a strong pitching performance from Yoshinobu Yamamoto and the bullpen, allowed the Dodgers to conclude their nine-game road trip with a winning record.</p>

          <p>A number of former Justice Department career attorneys are running for elected office for the first time, motivated by what they describe as the politicization of the agency under the Trump administration. Individuals like Ryan Crosswell in Pennsylvania and Erika Evans in Seattle have resigned from their posts to launch campaigns, directly criticizing recent DOJ decisions and purges. These candidates are leveraging their backgrounds as prosecutors to argue for the protection of the rule of law. This trend marks a notable shift, as career DOJ staff typically avoid partisan politics.</p>

The Smithsonian clarified that the removal was due to the placard not meeting museum standards for presentation and was not requested by any government official. The updated section is expected to be completed in the coming weeks.</p>

          <p>Construction on the new $9.5 billion Terminal 1 at New York's JFK Airport is progressing, with the first phase scheduled to open in mid-2026.
