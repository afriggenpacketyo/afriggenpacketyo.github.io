Journalism, the Preakness winner, finished in second place, while Baeza, the Derby third-place finisher, was also in the race. The Belmont took place at Saratoga Race Course due to renovations at Belmont Park, shortening the race to 1 1/4 miles. </p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Confusion over budget airline baggage rules has led to a legal row in the EU, with passengers often caught out by inconsistent or unclear regulations. Different airlines have varying rules on the acceptable size and weight of hand luggage, with some charging extra for overhead cabin bags. This has prompted the EU's largest consumer group to push for fairer and more consistent hand luggage rules. EU transport ministers have proposed standardised sizing for free underseat baggage on EU airlines, but the European Consumer Organisation believes the proposals do not go far enough.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>UK doctors are testing "poo pills" containing freeze-dried faeces from healthy donors to combat dangerous superbug infections. The stool samples are packed with beneficial bacteria that can flush out superbugs from the bowel. Early data suggests this new approach can replace antibiotic-resistant bacteria with a mix of healthy gut bacteria. The trial, involving 41 patients, showed that patients were willing to take the pills and that the donor bacteria were detected in the bowels a month later. This research signifies a shift in understanding the importance of bacteria for overall health.</p>

          <p>Chinese officials are rushing to comply with President Xi Jinping's austerity orders, ensuring their offices are modest and their spending is in order. This campaign, running since 2012, targets overspending among Communist Party and government bodies, aiming to improve the party's image and cut wasteful spending. Analysts suggest this also ensures wise spending to prevail in its rivalry with the United States. Questions remain over the campaign's effectiveness due to strict media control and the lack of an independent watchdog.</p>

Gizmo, the sister of Sunny, could be seen on the Big Bear Eagle Nest Cam standing on a branch before beginning to flap her wings and soar off into the air. She took flight at 89 days old, after some "intense wingersizing sessions yesterday on the High Perch," Friends of Big Bear Valley wrote on Facebook. The eaglets will remain in the habitat for one to three months after fledging, and FOBBV said they will likely be in and out of the nest during this time.</p>
