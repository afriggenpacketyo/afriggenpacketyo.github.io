          <p>President Trump signed agreements with the United Arab Emirates to establish a 10-mile artificial intelligence campus, aiming to transform the UAE into a major AI hub. The project, located in Abu Dhabi, will be powered by 5 gigawatts of electricity and built by Emirati AI firm G42 in collaboration with U.S. companies. Concerns have been raised about potential risks to U.S. AI dominance and the transfer of sensitive technology to a country with close ties to China. The agreement includes security measures to prevent technology diversion, according to Commerce Secretary Howard Lutnick.</p>

DeSantis argued that adding fluoride to water is "forced medication" and that individuals should have the choice to use fluoride through toothpaste and mouthwash. The law takes effect on July 1.</p>

Currently, about 40% of Social Security recipients pay federal income taxes on their benefits, supporting the Social Security and Medicare programs.</p>

          <p>Belgium's parliament voted to drop the country's planned nuclear phaseout, reversing a policy adopted over two decades ago. The decision follows a previous delay in the phaseout due to energy uncertainty caused by Russia's invasion of Ukraine. The government aims to create a realistic and resilient energy model, with nuclear energy currently accounting for around 40% of Belgium's power generation. Other European countries are also considering shifts in nuclear policy.</p>
