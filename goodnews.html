While a survey shows low utilization, these plans offer tax-free growth and withdrawals for qualified expenses, including vocational programs, professional licensing, and K-12 tutoring. The article also introduces "Trump accounts," new investment accounts for newborns starting in 2026, allowing annual contributions and a federal seed contribution for early participants. It contrasts the benefits of 529 plans, particularly their tax-free withdrawals for education, with the later-in-life access of Trump accounts. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>Health experts are advocating for the mandatory labeling of pine nuts and goat's milk as allergens on food packaging in the UK and EU, citing a rising frequency of allergic reactions. An article in Clinical & Experimental Allergy suggests adding these, along with buckwheat and peas/lentils, to the current list of 14 common allergens. The recommendation stems from an analysis of nearly 3,000 anaphylaxis cases, with a notable number linked to these emerging allergens, including two fatalities. The article emphasizes the importance of clear labeling and ongoing vigilance for new allergy trends, such as pea protein.</p>
