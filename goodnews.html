        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>To commemorate the 60th anniversary of normalized diplomatic ties, Japan will introduce fast-track entry lanes for South Korean visitors at Tokyo's Haneda and Fukuoka airports throughout June, while South Korea will reciprocate at Gimpo in Seoul and Gimhae in Busan. This marks the first time Japan has implemented lanes exclusively for a specific nationality, aiming to boost mutual exchange between the two nations. The initiative targets visitors who have traveled between Japan and South Korea within the past year, requiring them to complete pre-boarding procedures to utilize the expedited service, available for flights arriving between 9 a.m. and 4 p.m. This measure underscores the growing tourism between the two countries, fueled by cultural interests despite occasional historical tensions.</p>

          <p>China's youth unemployment rate saw a slight decrease in April, dropping to 15.8% from 16.5% in March, as the country prepares for a record number of university graduates entering the job market. This is the lowest youth unemployment rate recorded in China this year, yet it remains higher than the same period last year. An estimated 12.22 million students are expected to graduate this year, putting additional pressure on the economy to create sufficient high-quality jobs. The government continues to grapple with the challenge of absorbing the growing number of graduates amid concerns that the jobless rate may rise again after the summer.</p>

          <p>Thames Water has suspended its bonus scheme for senior executives following public criticism and government intervention. The scheme, potentially worth up to 50% of senior bosses' pay, was linked to securing a ¬£3bn rescue loan. The decision came after Downing Street deemed rewarding executives for failure unacceptable. The company will await guidance from the regulator Ofwat to ensure its approach aligns with turnaround objectives and public expectations. Thames Water has faced heavy criticism over its performance, including sewage discharges and leaks, leading to government standby for special administration.</p>

          <p>A new test that reduces the time it takes to diagnose types of brain tumors from weeks to just hours has been developed by scientists at the University of Nottingham. Surgeons have described the "ultra-rapid" method of genetic testing as a "game changer" and say it could improve care and treatment for thousands of patients. The method has already been used in 50 operations at Nottingham University Hospitals NHS Trust with a 100% success rate. The new technique has seen results returned in as little as 90 minutes, and could allow patients to get radiation treatment or chemotherapy more quickly.</p>
