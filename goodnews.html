          <p>The White House announced a partnership between the U.S. and the United Arab Emirates to build a 5-gigawatt artificial intelligence data campus in Abu Dhabi, described as the largest such facility outside the U.S. The project, led by UAE firm G42, will involve several U.S. companies, though their identities remain undisclosed. Commerce Secretary Howard Lutnik emphasized that American companies will operate the data centers and provide American-managed cloud services, with security measures to prevent technology diversion.

          <p>Walmart CFO John David Rainey announced that the retail giant will be raising prices on some items due to tariffs, despite a temporary reduction in duties on Chinese imports. The price increases are expected to begin towards the end of May and become more noticeable in June. The company will absorb some of the costs, but consumers will likely see higher prices on items such as toys, electronics, bananas, avocados, and coffee. Walmart is also taking steps to mitigate the impact of tariffs by switching to alternative materials and sourcing merchandise from different countries.</p>

          <p>House Republicans are proposing a bill to make the $2,000 child tax credit permanent and increase it to $2,500 from 2025 through 2028, after which it would revert to $2,000 and be indexed for inflation. However, the plan excludes 17 million children in low-income families who do not owe federal taxes and requires both parents to have a Social Security number, affecting 4.5 million children who are U.S. citizens or lawfully present. The refundable portion of the credit is capped at $1,700 for 2025, and the tax break phases out for married couples with AGI exceeding $400,000 and other taxpayers with AGI over $200,000.</p>

          <p>Jim Cramer identifies Walmart, Costco, and Amazon as the retailers best positioned to mitigate the impact of tariff-related price hikes due to their scale and buying power. He argues that these companies can better absorb costs or negotiate with suppliers to maintain lower prices for consumers. While Walmart warned of potential downside risks to profits due to tariffs, Cramer believes the company, along with Costco and Amazon, can leverage their strong balance sheets and private label brands to remain competitive. Costco's steady membership revenue and Amazon's profitable AWS cloud unit further bolster their ability to manage tariff costs.</p>

          <p>Belgium's parliament voted to drop the country's planned nuclear phaseout, reversing a law passed in 2003. The decision aims to pave the way for a realistic and resilient energy model, according to Energy Minister Mathieu Bihet. The move follows a 2022 decision to delay the phaseout by 10 years due to energy uncertainty caused by Russia's war in Ukraine. Nuclear energy currently accounts for around 40% of Belgium's power generation. Other European countries, including the Netherlands and Sweden, are also planning to build new nuclear plants.</p>
