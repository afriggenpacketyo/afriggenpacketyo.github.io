          <p>China has achieved a significant milestone with the successful electromagnetic catapult launch of its J-35 stealth fighter from the Fujian aircraft carrier. This event marks the J-35 as the world's second carrier-based stealth fighter, signifying a major advancement in China's naval air capabilities. The operation confirms the Fujian's electromagnetic catapult and recovery systems are functional, representing a breakthrough in the nation's aircraft carrier development. This development enhances China's naval power and transforms its maritime defense strategy.</p>

          <p>The UK Transport Secretary has approved plans for a £2.2bn privately-financed second runway at London Gatwick Airport, aiming to boost economic growth. This project involves repositioning the existing Northern Runway by 12 meters for regular use and expanding terminals, projected to increase annual flights from 280,000 to 389,000 by the late 2030s. While proponents highlight job creation and investment, environmental groups and opposition parties criticize it for ignoring climate science and increasing pollution. New conditions include stricter noise controls, enhanced insulation for residents, and a target for 54% public transport use for passengers.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>A recent call between President Trump and President Xi, described by China's People's Daily as "pragmatic, positive and constructive," indicates a shift towards managed rivalry rather than escalating conflict between the US and China. This emerging reality reflects a pragmatic acceptance of mutual dependence despite strategic competition, establishing a crucial framework for global stability. While Trump's return initially heightened fears of American primacy through tariffs, the economic asymmetry and interdependence between the two powers necessitate cautious competition to avoid mutually devastating conflict. The article suggests this approach could lead to a more stable international dynamic.</p>

          <p>Saudi Arabia's new mutual defense pact with Pakistan is unlikely to disrupt its energy relationship with India, a key crude consumer. A source familiar with the matter stated that Saudi Arabia is broadening alliances for security without sacrificing commercial ties, with India remaining a top oil customer. The source also dismissed speculation about a shift away from the US dollar for Saudi oil trade, reaffirming its foundational role. India's government is studying the pact's implications for national security and regional stability, while experts remain skeptical of any long-lasting impact on oil prices.

          <p>Kansas City Chiefs head coach Andy Reid defended Travis Kelce's "passion" after their second sideline confrontation in as many weeks during the Chiefs' 22-9 victory over the New York Giants. Reid acknowledged the team's sluggish offense in the first half but stated he was "OK" with Kelce's emotional displays, viewing them as signs of being "all-in." This follows a similar incident in a previous game where Kelce yelled at Reid and threw his helmet. Quarterback Patrick Mahomes also affirmed the strong relationship between the coach and player, despite Kelce's visible frustration and perceived decline in performance at 36.</p>

          <p>A US congressional delegation, led by Democrat Adam Smith, has met with Chinese Premier and Defense Minister, marking the first such visit by House members since 2019. The delegation aims to re-establish military communication channels, which Beijing halted in 2022 following Nancy Pelosi's visit to Taiwan. Smith expressed the US's willingness to "open lines of communication" on peace and security, while the Chinese defense minister hoped the visit would foster better understanding of China and its military. The group emphasized the need to "recalibrate the bilateral relationship on diplomatic, economic and security issues."</p>

          <p>Sociologist Christina Cross's new book, "Inherited Inequality," challenges the long-held belief that single-parent Black families are the main driver of racial inequality, arguing that two-parent Black families still face significant disadvantages compared to their white counterparts. Her research reveals that Black children in two-parent homes experience higher rates of school suspension and unemployment, performing only as well as white children from single-parent families. The article criticizes the singular focus and substantial government spending on marriage promotion, advocating instead for exploring other strategies like direct cash assistance or childcare subsidies to address resource gaps exacerbated by structural racism.</p>

          <h2>Key Differences Between ETFs and Mutual Funds for Investors</h2>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>This article outlines the key differences between Exchange-Traded Funds (ETFs) and mutual funds, crucial for investors making financial choices. ETFs trade like stocks throughout the day, offering real-time pricing, while mutual fund transactions are priced at day's end. A significant advantage of ETFs is their greater tax efficiency, as they rarely distribute capital gains to investors in taxable accounts, unlike many mutual funds. ETFs also tend to have lower expense ratios, making them generally cheaper to own. However, mutual funds offer a larger universe of options and are more commonly available in 401(k) plans.

          <p>A Citi Private Bank survey reveals that ultra-wealthy family offices are optimistic about their 2025 returns, with most expecting 5-10% or more. They remain keen on direct investments in private companies, with 70% making such deals in the past year, often increasing exposure to specific long-term themes like AI. However, optimism for direct private equity has slightly dimmed, and interest in early-stage startup funding has notably decreased, especially in North America. Family offices are becoming more selective, focusing on growth-stage investments and opportunistic secondary sales, leveraging reliable cash flows from operating businesses to acquire controlling stakes.

        </div>
        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Neurologists recommend walnuts as a top food to potentially reduce dementia risk, citing their rich content of omega-3 fatty acids, antioxidants, and benefits for heart health. Walnuts are a primary source of alpha-linolenic acid (ALA), a plant-based omega-3 linked to slower cognitive decline, and their antioxidants combat oxidative stress in the brain. Furthermore, walnuts support cardiovascular health, which is closely tied to brain function, by improving lipid profiles. The article also advises other cognitive health strategies, including following the MIND diet, regular physical activity, green tea consumption, quality sleep, continuous learning, and managing other health conditions.</p>
