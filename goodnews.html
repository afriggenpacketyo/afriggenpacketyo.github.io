          <p>Alaska Airlines has lifted a nationwide ground stop that was implemented due to a significant information technology outage affecting both its and Horizon Air's flight systems. The airline announced early Friday that operations were restored, but warned that disruptions, including over 229 cancellations, are likely to continue as it works to reposition aircraft and crews. The Seattle-based carrier has implemented a flexible travel policy to assist passengers whose plans were affected by the system failure. The specific cause of the tech outage was not detailed.</p>

          <p>The total assets managed by the global hedge fund industry have reached an unprecedented $5 trillion, according to data from Hedge Fund Research (HFR). This milestone was driven by a combination of strong investment returns and the largest quarterly net inflow of new capital from investors in 18 years. The third quarter saw net new allocations of $33.7 billion, with the industry's assets growing by over $238 billion in total. This growth reflects investor confidence fueled by rising M&A activity, the AI technology boom, and expectations of lower interest rates. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>This article provides an overview of current interest rates for certificates of deposit (CDs), highlighting them as a way for savers to earn returns that can outpace inflation. While national average yields for one- to five-year CDs are below 2%, top online banks are offering significantly higher rates, with some short-term CDs exceeding 4% APY. The piece explains that the current inverted yield curve makes short-term CDs more lucrative than long-term ones and suggests strategies like "laddering" to maximize returns while maintaining flexibility.

          <p>Researchers have confirmed the discovery of the Jinlin crater in China's southern Guangdong province, identifying it as the country's fifth known asteroid impact structure. The impact is estimated to have occurred approximately 10,000 years ago, releasing energy equivalent to about 600,000 tonnes of TNT, or roughly 40 atomic bombs. This is the first impact crater to be found in southern China, a region covering about a quarter of the nation's land area.

          <h2>Review of Springsteen Biopic Suggests It Overly Simplifies the Artist's Creative Process</h2>

          <p>A review of the new film "Springsteen: Deliver Me From Nowhere" argues that it reduces the creation of the seminal 1982 album "Nebraska" to a simplistic narrative of paternal conflict. The film, starring Jeremy Allen White, frames the album's dark, acoustic songs as a direct result of Springsteen processing trauma from his difficult relationship with his father. The critic contends that this autobiographical focus overlooks the album's broader engagement with American musical traditions and iconography, such as folk ballads and outlaw stories, ultimately underselling the scope of Springsteen's artistic achievement.</p>

          <p>The Welsh nationalist party Plaid Cymru has secured a significant by-election win in Caerphilly, a constituency historically dominated by the Labour Party for over a century. The result is a major blow to Labour, which finished a distant third, and a setback for Reform UK, which came in second despite a strong campaign. Plaid Cymru's success is attributed to positioning itself as the primary alternative for change and focusing on issues like funding and healthcare rather than Welsh independence. The outcome reshapes the political landscape in Wales ahead of the full Senedd election in May.</p>

          <h2>Analysis Explores How Philip Pullman's New Trilogy Reframes Debates on Dangerous Ideas and Censorship</h2>

          <p>An article examines Philip Pullman's "Book of Dust" trilogy, a companion to his controversial "His Dark Materials" series, in the context of modern book-banning debates. While the original series was frequently banned for its anti-religious themes, the new books explore the danger of ideas from a different angle, portraying a world where relativist philosophies cause people to become estranged from their souls. The analysis suggests Pullman believes some books can be dangerous, but the solution is not censorship, but rather countering harmful narratives with better, truer stories that value our material world and embodied experiences.</p>

          <p>A court in Turkey has thrown out a corruption case against the country's main opposition party, the Republican People's Party (CHP), ruling that the lawsuit was without merit. The case sought to invalidate the party's 2023 congress, where a new leader was elected, by alleging procedural violations and vote-buying. CHP officials have maintained that the legal action was a politically motivated attempt by President Recep Tayyip Erdoğan's government to undermine them using the judiciary. The dismissal is seen as a potential easing of the legal pressure faced by the opposition party.</p>
