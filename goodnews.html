        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>The UK and European Union have reached a deal to reset relations after Britain's exit from the bloc in 2020, focusing on security, trade, and youth mobility. The agreement includes reciprocal access to fishing waters until June 2038, energy cooperation, and a security and defense partnership. A 'balanced youth experience' scheme will enable young people from the UK and EU to work, study, volunteer, or travel in each other's countries for a limited time. The UK and EU will also deepen cooperation on irregular migration and explore the potential use of e-gates by UK passport holders in European airports. This deal aims to strengthen ties amid unpredictable global dynamics and a shift towards U.S. isolationism.</p>

          <p>The NJ Transit strike has ended after the Brotherhood of Locomotive Engineers and Trainmen (BLET) approved a new deal, bringing relief to commuters who rely on the system to travel to New York City and Philadelphia. New Jersey Gov. Phil Murphy announced that train service will resume on Tuesday, May 20, after a three-day strike. The agreement, described as fair and fiscally responsible, involves concessions related to work rules to fund the wage increases requested by the union. The agency needs about 24 hours to preposition equipment and conduct safety checks on hundreds of trains and miles of rail lines before resuming full service.</p>

          <p>Top officials from Britain and the European Union gathered in London to announce a freshly struck deal meant to tighten their trade and defense relationships, signaling a pivot toward a post-Brexit future. The summit, billed as a major reset of relations, addresses how Europe and Britain can reorient themselves in a world where America is a less reliable ally on defense and trade. Officials unveiled a defense and security partnership, outlining future military cooperation, and agreed to extend access to fishing waters. Tensions had emerged over a youth mobility program, with Europe pushing for lower tuition for E.U. students who study at U.K. universities.</p>

          <p>The U.S. Department of Education has rescinded a $37.7 million fine against Grand Canyon University for alleged deceptive practices. The proposed fine was the largest ever issued by the department against a university. University President Brian Mueller welcomed the decision, stating that the accusations were without merit. The fine was initially imposed in October 2023 after the government reported that many doctoral students required additional courses and incurred extra costs to complete their programs.</p>

          <h2>The Challenges of Switching to Natural Food Dyes</h2>

        </div>
        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>The Trump administration's effort to eliminate synthetic dyes from the food supply faces challenges, as manufacturers grapple with finding suitable all-natural substitutes. While FDA commissioner Marty Makary suggests natural alternatives like watermelon or beet juice, companies like Oliveria Peppers have found the switch can be complex. Factors such as color stability, sourcing, and cost pose difficulties for larger companies reliant on dyes like Red No. 40 or Blue No. 1. Consumers may also resist changes in color, as they often "eat with their eyes."</p>

          <p>Recent studies have challenged the long-held belief that animal protein is superior to plant protein for muscle growth. A new trial found that vegan and omnivore diets offer the same muscle-building potential, provided that enough plant-based protein is consumed. While animal protein may be of higher quality on a gram-for-gram basis, the differences are negligible in the context of a balanced meal. Researchers emphasize the importance of adequate protein intake and resistance training for maximizing muscle gains.</p>
