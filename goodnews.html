          <p>The release of a 2023 audio recording of President Biden's interview with Special Counsel Robert Hur has reignited debate over his mental fitness. The recording captures Biden's halting speech and memory lapses, providing context for Hur's description of him as an "elderly man with a poor memory." The article details the political fallout from the recording, including criticism from Democrats and renewed scrutiny of Biden's cognitive abilities. The release of the audio coincides with a forthcoming book detailing Biden's mental and physical decline, further fueling concerns about his fitness for office.</p>

          <p>Representative Al Green, a Democrat from Texas, is pushing for the impeachment of President Trump, alleging that the president has devolved American democracy into authoritarianism. Green filed articles of impeachment, claiming that Trump has engaged in authoritarian rule, violated due process, denigrated federal judges, and ignored court orders. This is not Green's first attempt to impeach Trump, as he made multiple attempts during the president's first term. The article also mentions that Green was previously censured for heckling the president during a joint session of Congress.</p>

The first involves an operational restructuring to improve margins, while the second explores a sale of the company to a strategic or financial acquirer. Couchbase faces pressure to deliver high growth, leading to high selling, general, and administrative expenses. A sale could allow Couchbase to right-size its costs and pursue more organic growth away from public market pressures.

          <p>President Trump is advocating for the revival of the coal industry by using coal plants to power AI data centers, but this proposal clashes with the tech industry's environmental goals. While the tech industry acknowledges the short-term need for fossil fuels, they prefer natural gas over coal, which emits more carbon dioxide. Companies like Amazon, Nvidia, and Anthropic remain noncommittal to using coal. Trump's executive order is seen as a gesture to coal mining constituents, while the tech industry continues to invest in renewable energy and nuclear power to meet growing electricity demands while reducing emissions.</p>

The growing availability of naloxone and policies resulting from the COVID-19 pandemic have contributed to this reversal.

          <p>An unofficial copy of the Magna Carta, acquired by Harvard Law School for $27.50 in 1946, has been confirmed as an original, making it one of the world's most valuable documents. Professors at King's College London and the University of East Anglia used spectral imaging and other tests to verify the document's authenticity. The Magna Carta, first issued in 1215, declared that all people had personal rights, including royalty. The true wealth of the Magna Carta lies in its enduring principles of justice and individual rights.</p>

The audio, obtained by Axios, reveals Biden's halting tone of voice and difficulty remembering dates, particularly surrounding the death of his son, Beau. The interview, which was part of an investigation into Biden's handling of classified records, has renewed concerns about his cognitive abilities. The Biden White House released transcripts of the interview last year, but the audio provides additional context on Biden's demeanor and memory problems.</p>
