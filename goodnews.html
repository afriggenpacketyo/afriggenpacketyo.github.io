          <p>A Kentucky mom faced a sweet surprise when her eight-year-old son, Liam, ordered 70,000 Dum-Dum lollipops using her Amazon account. The accidental purchase resulted in a $4,200 charge, but the community rallied to help her sell the excess candy. With the help of friends, family, and strangers, she was able to distribute the lollipops, and Amazon eventually refunded her money. The Spangler Candy Company, which makes Dum-Dums, even offered Liam a job interview in the future. Optimism Score: 90</p>

          <p>President Donald Trump has signed a proclamation designating May 8 as "Victory Day for World War II," following criticism that the U.S. does not adequately celebrate its military victories. This action coincides with Europe's 80th anniversary of Victory in Europe Day. Trump also announced plans for a national holiday to commemorate the end of World War I on November 11, despite only Congress having the authority to create or rename holidays. The move follows Trump's earlier complaints about insufficient recognition of U.S. military achievements. Optimism Score: 70</p>

          <p>In response to state laws banning unofficial flags on government property, Salt Lake City and Boise have adopted new official city flags. Salt Lake City approved flags featuring the rainbow Pride flag, the transgender Pride flag, and a Juneteenth symbol, while Boise designated the rainbow Pride flag and a flag promoting organ donation as official. These actions are seen as a direct response to state measures perceived as targeting L.G.B.T.Q. flags, with city officials emphasizing their commitment to diversity and inclusion. The moves have sparked controversy, with some state legislators criticizing the cities for bypassing state law. Optimism Score: 65</p>

          <p>The long-postponed deadline for Real ID enforcement at U.S. airports has arrived, with many travelers showing up early with passports or Real ID-compliant identification.

          <p>The minimum age to become a train driver in the UK has been lowered from 20 to 18 in an effort to tackle driver shortages. The government hopes this will open up opportunities for school or college leavers and address frequent disruptions caused by a lack of available drivers. The average age of a UK train driver is 48, with 30% set to retire by 2029. The change aims to create a younger, more diverse workforce, though only a small percentage of current drivers are female or from an ethnic minority. Optimism Score: 75</p>
