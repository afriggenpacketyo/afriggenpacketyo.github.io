As part of a sprint weekend format, this was the only practice opportunity for teams before sprint qualifying. Norris finished ahead of Sauber's Nico Hulkenberg and his McLaren teammate, Oscar Piastri, whom he trails in the championship standings. The session saw various teams testing different tire compounds, with Mercedes' George Russell and Ferrari's Lewis Hamilton finishing further down the timesheets after setting their best laps on medium tires.</p>

          <p>During a meeting at the White House, President Trump and Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy discussed the possibility of the U.S. providing Ukraine with Tomahawk missiles. While Trump acknowledged the potential for a trade involving Ukrainian-made drones, he also expressed concern about depleting U.S. stockpiles of the crucial weapon. The discussion occurs as Trump prepares for a summit with Russian President Vladimir Putin in Budapest, where he hopes to broker an end to the war. Zelenskyy emphasized the need for continued pressure on Putin, stating he believes the Russian leader is not yet ready for peace.</p>

          <p>Amid market volatility and shifting interest rates, many Americans are considering annuities for retirement planning due to their guaranteed income streams. The article suggests that fixed annuities currently offer the best combination of safety and stability, functioning similarly to a certificate of deposit but often with higher, tax-deferred yields. It explains that the ideal choice depends on individual goals, such as income generation, principal protection, or growth potential. The article advises potential investors to assess their personal risk tolerance and consult with a financial advisor to navigate the complexities of different annuity products.

          <p>The popular Swiss running shoe company On is being sued in a class-action lawsuit filed by customers who allege a design defect causes the footwear to emit a loud and embarrassing squeaking sound. The complaint claims the noise originates from the company's signature CloudTec sole design, where rubber components rub together with each step. The plaintiffs argue they would not have purchased the premium-priced shoes, which retail for $140 to $180, had they known about the issue. According to the lawsuit, the company has dismissed the squeaking as 'normal wear and tear,' refusing returns under its warranty policy.</p>

          <p>Homebuyers may see a drop in mortgage interest rates before the Federal Reserve's upcoming meeting on October 29, where another rate cut is widely expected. While the Fed's actions influence mortgage rates, they are not directly tied, and historical patterns show that rates often fall in anticipation of an official announcement. The article suggests that lenders frequently 'price in' expected cuts, meaning borrowers could see more favorable rates in the coming days rather than after the meeting. To prepare, potential borrowers are advised to improve their credit scores, shop around for lenders, and monitor the market daily to capitalize on any temporary dips. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>South Africa secured a dominant 10-wicket victory over Sri Lanka in a rain-shortened match at the Women's Cricket World Cup, moving them to second place in the tournament standings. After a lengthy rain delay, the Proteas were set a revised target of 121 runs in 20 overs, which they chased down comfortably in under 15 overs. Captain Laura Wolvaardt and her opening partner Tazmin Brits both scored unbeaten half-centuries to lead their team to its fourth consecutive win. The defeat leaves co-hosts Sri Lanka winless and with diminishing hopes of advancing to the semi-finals.</p>

          <h2>California Sues Plastic Bag Makers Over Deceptive Recyclability Claims</h2>

        </div>
        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>California's Attorney General has filed a lawsuit against three major manufacturers for allegedly misleading consumers by marketing their plastic bags as recyclable when they are not. The state claims that the thicker, reusable plastic bags sold in stores since the 2014 ban on single-use bags are not accepted by the vast majority of California's recycling facilities. As a result, these bags end up in landfills or the environment. Alongside the lawsuit, the state announced a $1.7 million settlement with four other producers who have agreed to halt sales of the non-recyclable bags in California.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>The recent surge in gold and cryptocurrency prices is leading some market strategists to advocate for a shift away from the classic 60/40 stock-and-bond investment portfolio. The proposed alternative is a 60/20/20 model, which maintains a 60% allocation to stocks but splits the remainder between bonds and alternative assets like gold and bitcoin. This change is driven by the belief that bonds no longer provide adequate protection against inflation and geopolitical risk. With gold reaching record highs above $4,300, it is being viewed less as a fringe asset and more as a core portfolio holding. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>In the new film 'Blue Moon,' directed by Richard Linklater, Ethan Hawke portrays Lorenz Hart, the gifted but troubled lyricist of the Rodgers and Hart duo. The story is set on the opening night of 'Oklahoma!', the first major success for his former partner Richard Rodgers with a new collaborator, Oscar Hammerstein II. The film captures Hart's bitterness, jealousy, and self-loathing as he confronts his professional irrelevance while holding court at a New York bar. The review praises Hawke's poignant and egoless performance, which powerfully conveys the fragility and envy of an artist facing the end of his creative prime.</p>

This move is part of a broader trend of drugmakers adopting direct-to-consumer models and comes amid pressure from the Trump administration to lower prescription drug costs in the U.S. ahead of the winter flu season.</p>

          <p>Actress Reese Witherspoon has co-authored her first adult fiction novel, a thriller titled 'Gone Before Goodbye,' with bestselling author Harlan Coben. The book centers on a talented female surgeon who becomes entangled in a conspiracy, a character Witherspoon wanted to be defined by her skills rather than her sex appeal. She explained that her upbringing in a medical family and her desire to see more complex female-led stories inspired the project. Witherspoon, who founded the production company Hello Sunshine to champion such narratives, says she continues to see a gap in Hollywood for strong, multifaceted female roles.</p>

          <p>NATO members are demonstrating increased unity and resolve in response to recent, aggressive Russian airspace violations over countries like Poland and Estonia. An opinion piece in The Atlantic argues that Vladimir Putin's attempts to intimidate the alliance have backfired, prompting NATO to establish a more coordinated defense on its eastern flank. This alignment is bolstered by President Trump's recent affirmations of support for defending Baltic nations. European leaders are now calling for an integrated 'drone wall' and are taking a more assertive stance, signaling that further provocations will be met with force.</p>
