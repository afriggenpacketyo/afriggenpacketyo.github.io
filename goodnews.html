          <p>An independent Water Commission review has concluded that the water sector in England and Wales is failing, necessitating stronger regulation to protect billpayers and the environment. Public trust has been eroded by issues such as pollution, financial difficulties, mismanagement, and infrastructure failures, prompting the government to initiate the review. While the government has ruled out nationalizing the sector due to cost concerns, the review emphasizes the need for improvements to address the growing public concern regarding sewage spills and rising bills.</p>

This move coincides with the easing of international restrictions on Syria's financial systems and a recent power deal with international companies.</p>

          <p>President Donald Trump has pardoned two Florida shark divers who were convicted of theft for cutting 19 sharks and a goliath grouper free from a fisherman's longline. The divers claimed they believed the longline was illegal and were acting to protect shark populations. Defense attorneys argued that the prosecution was government overreach, while prosecutors contended that the divers knew the line was legal. The pardon restores the men's rights as they are no longer felons.</p>
