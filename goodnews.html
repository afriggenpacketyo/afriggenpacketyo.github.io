          <p>The U.S. Navy, in collaboration with Skydweller Aero, successfully completed a 73-hour nonstop flight of its solar-powered drone, Skydweller. This test, conducted in Mississippi, demonstrates the viability of renewable energy for long-endurance missions, reducing fuel reliance and costs. The drone, with a wingspan comparable to a Boeing 747 but weighing as much as a Ford F-150, stores solar energy in batteries for night flights. This article highlights Skydweller's potential for intelligence, surveillance, and reconnaissance (ISR) as a cost-effective alternative to satellites, with further tests planned for the SOUTHCOM region.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>As of September 2, 2025, average mortgage rates are 5.83% for a 15-year loan and 6.62% for a 30-year loan, while refinance rates are 6.08% for 15-year and 6.77% for 30-year terms. High rates and limited inventory continue to challenge homebuyers and those looking to refinance. Experts suggest strengthening credit profiles and comparing multiple lenders to secure better rates, especially if the Federal Reserve pauses rate hikes.
