          <p>The New York Times analyzes the stock market's response to President Trump's tariffs, noting that the market is now higher than before the tariffs sent share prices into a tailspin. While investors feel they can't sit on the sidelines as stocks climb, they remain cautious due to the uncertainty surrounding the final level of tariffs. The Federal Reserve is also in a wait-and-see mode, unwilling to lower interest rates until the inflationary effect of the new tariffs is known. Investors are still trying to parse how the tariffs that remain in place are affecting consumer spending and corporate profits.</p>
