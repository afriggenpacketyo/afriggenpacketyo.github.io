        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>With the Powerball jackpot reaching a historic $1.8 billion, a data analysis explores the financial outcomes for winners based on their location. The report details how state taxes significantly impact take-home winnings, with states like California and Florida offering the highest payouts due to no state lottery tax. Conversely, states with high income taxes, such as New York, result in substantially lower net prizes for winners choosing either the annuity or lump-sum option, highlighting the importance of geography in massive lottery wins.</p>

The workers, part of a project to produce electric vehicle batteries, were arrested in an operation tied to the Trump administration's immigration policies. Seoul plans to send a charter plane to bring the workers home, expressing "concern and regret" over the incident which targeted a major economic development project.</p>

          <p>English all-rounder Jacob Bethell has reflected on a challenging first home summer in international cricket, admitting he feels he should have played more. The 21-year-old, who had a strong debut Test series last winter, found himself in a secondary role this summer, missing one Test for the Indian Premier League and serving as a spare batter for others. Bethell acknowledged that he could have participated more in domestic cricket to maintain his form but also suggested the break might prove beneficial for his future performance.</p>

        </div>
        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>The number of federal student loan borrowers using deferment and forbearance to pause payments has more than doubled in the past year. The article explains the key differences between these options, noting that deferment may prevent interest from accruing on subsidized loans, making it a preferable first choice for those who qualify. While forbearance is more accessible, it typically results in interest accumulation, which can significantly increase the total debt. Consumer advocates stress that these are short-term solutions and encourage borrowers to explore income-driven repayment plans for long-term affordability.</p>

          <p>Hypertension, or high blood pressure, is a widespread and often asymptomatic condition affecting over half of Americans by age 40, significantly increasing the risk of heart disease, stroke, and dementia. New American Heart Association guidelines advocate for earlier intervention, including lifestyle changes like a low-sodium diet and exercise, once blood pressure exceeds 130/80 mm Hg. For higher readings, starting with medication is recommended, as proactive management can add years of healthy life by preventing damage to the heart, kidneys, and brain.</p>

          <p>As gold prices surge to new records, driven by economic uncertainty and anticipation of Federal Reserve rate cuts, financial experts are advising on the best investment strategies. The article suggests that for most investors, gaining exposure through gold-backed exchange-traded funds (ETFs) is the most efficient and low-cost method. Experts generally recommend against owning physical gold due to storage and transaction costs and advise limiting gold allocation to a small fraction, typically under 3%, of a diversified investment portfolio.

          <p>A Utah judge has struck down the state's congressional map, ruling that the Republican-controlled legislature unconstitutionally overrode a voter-approved independent redistricting commission. The 2021 map was criticized for "cracking" the Democratic-leaning Salt Lake County into four separate districts, effectively diluting its voters and ensuring GOP victories in all four of the state's House seats. The court has ordered lawmakers to draw a new, fairer map, marking a significant victory for voting rights advocates and a rare pushback against partisan gerrymandering in a deeply Republican state.</p>

          <p>The article analyzes the growing financial disparity between Spain's La Liga and England's Premier League, noting that English clubs spent over five times more in the recent transfer window. This gap is attributed to La Liga's strict economic controls, implemented in 2013 to ensure financial sustainability and eliminate club debt, which has successfully stabilized the league. While this disciplined approach has reduced glamour and spending power, Spanish clubs continue to achieve significant competitive success in European competitions, relying heavily on strong youth academies to produce top-tier talent.</p>

His canonization was fast-tracked, a move seen by some as an effort by the Vatican to connect with and inspire a younger generation of Catholics by recognizing a modern figure who enjoyed video games and wore jeans.</p>
