        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>A US federal court has blocked President Donald Trump's sweeping tariffs, ruling that the International Emergency Economic Powers Act (IEEPA) did not grant the president unilateral authority to impose tariffs on nearly every country. The court stated that the US Constitution gives Congress exclusive power to regulate commerce with other nations. The Trump administration has appealed the ruling, which was based on cases brought by small businesses and state governments. Global markets responded positively to the ruling, with stock markets in Asia rising and the US dollar gaining against safe-haven currencies. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>The UK government has announced plans to reform the pension industry, including the creation of ¬£25bn "megafunds" instructed to invest locally to stimulate economic growth. Chancellor Rachel Reeves said the reforms would improve returns for workers and increase investment in clean energy and high-growth businesses. While seventeen of the UK's largest pension firms have already approved the reforms in a voluntary agreement, the government is also including a legislative back-stop to ensure progress by the end of the decade. The reforms are expected to unlock over ¬£50bn of additional investment in UK infrastructure, new homes, and businesses. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>Toyota Motor Corp. reported a 10% increase in global sales for April, reaching a record 876,864 vehicles, as demand grew ahead of potential negative impacts from higher US tariffs on imported cars. The automaker's global production also increased by 7.8% to 814,787 vehicles. This surge comes as U.S. President Donald Trump imposed an additional 25% tariff on cars produced outside the United States on April 3. Despite the sales increase, Toyota anticipates a 34.9% drop in net profit for the full business year due to the tariffs and a stronger yen. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>Prime Minister Sir Keir Starmer has accused Reform UK leader Nigel Farage of promoting "fantasy" economics, likening him to former PM Liz Truss and warning that Reform's policies could increase mortgage costs. Starmer argues that Farage's unfunded tax cuts could spark an economic meltdown, similar to the turmoil caused by Truss's mini-budget in 2022. Reform has pledged more generous tax breaks and to scrap certain climate measures to fund its policies, but economists have questioned the feasibility of these plans. The speech highlights the growing political rivalry between Starmer and Farage.</p>
