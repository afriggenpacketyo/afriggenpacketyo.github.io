          <p>British tennis player Emma Raducanu is set to face world number one Aryna Sabalenka in a challenging third-round match at Wimbledon. Following a strong victory against a former champion, Raducanu acknowledges the significant gap between her current level and the tour's top players like Sabalenka. She believes improving her serve, hitting with more power, and adding more weapons to her game are crucial for her to compete at the highest level. Despite the tough draw, Raducanu feels more comfortable and confident playing at Wimbledon, her home Grand Slam, which she hopes will aid her performance.</p>

          <p>Los Angeles Dodgers pitcher Dustin May delivered the best start of his career, pitching into the eighth inning for the first time and leading his team to a 6-2 victory over the Chicago White Sox. May was dominant, retiring the first 16 batters he faced and holding Chicago hitless until the sixth inning. He finished with seven shutout innings before allowing a two-run homer in the eighth, striking out nine batters in a much-needed strong performance. The Dodgers' offense provided early support, with Freddie Freeman driving in three runs and Michael Conforto adding a two-run homer to secure the team's ninth win in ten games.</p>

          <p>The hearing technology company Cochlear has introduced its new smart implant system in China, making it one of the first global markets for the advanced device. Unlike traditional hearing aids that amplify sound, Cochlear's implant works by bypassing damaged inner ear cells to directly stimulate the auditory nerve with electrical signals. The company's chief technology officer stated that the device is most effective for users with severe to profound hearing loss for whom conventional aids are no longer beneficial. The launch was facilitated through Hainan province and Hong Kong, signaling a rapid entry into the significant Chinese market.</p>

          <p>The Chinese government has once again vowed to tackle the persistent issues of oversupply and excessive competition within its massive solar photovoltaic (PV) industry. At a recent meeting, Industry and Information Technology Minister Li Lecheng emphasized that "disorderly low-price competition" must be comprehensively addressed to ensure healthy and sustainable development. This directive follows President Xi Jinping's call to eliminate excess industrial capacity. The ministry urged companies to focus on improving product quality and phasing out outdated production, as the industry continues its push into global markets amidst ongoing economic challenges.

          <p>California Governor Gavin Newsom is scheduled for a two-day visit to rural South Carolina, a trip that is fueling speculation about a potential 2028 presidential campaign. His tour will focus on eight of the state's most economically and environmentally challenged counties, many of which are Republican strongholds. The South Carolina Democratic Party framed the visit as an effort to show that rural voters are not forgotten by Democrats. While Newsom's political advisors deny that the trip is about a presidential run, his increasing presence in key primary states and engagement with Southern voters continues to attract national political attention.</p>

          <p>A team of Chinese scientists has achieved a significant breakthrough in chimera research by cultivating a heart structure with human cells inside a pig embryo. The research, led by the Guangzhou Institutes of Biomedicine and Health, reported that the human-cell-derived heart structure continued to beat unaided for 21 days. To achieve this, scientists reprogrammed human stem cells with specific genes to prevent cell death and improve their integration within the pig embryo. This development follows the same team's previous success in growing human kidneys in pigs, advancing the potential for creating human organs for transplantation.</p>

The team from the Guangzhou Institutes of Biomedicine and Health announced that the structure survived and continued to beat for 21 days. This was accomplished by genetically modifying human stem cells to enhance their survival and integration into the host pig embryo at the blastocyst stage.
