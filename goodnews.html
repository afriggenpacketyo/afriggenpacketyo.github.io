          <p>The Italian government has greenlit the €13.5 billion construction of the Messina Strait Bridge, which will connect Sicily to the mainland and become the world's longest suspension bridge. The project, revived after multiple cancellations, is championed as a major driver for economic development in southern Italy, expected to be completed by 2032. Despite the approval, the project faces significant controversy over its high cost, environmental impact on migratory birds, and concerns about potential mafia interference and seismic risks in the region. The bridge is also being classified as defense-related infrastructure.</p>

          <p>Disney reported stronger-than-expected fiscal third-quarter earnings, largely due to significant growth in its streaming division and increased consumer spending at its theme parks. The direct-to-consumer streaming business, including Disney+, has become a key revenue driver, helping to offset the continued decline in traditional linear television. While overall revenue slightly missed projections, the robust performance of the experiences and streaming segments signals a successful strategic shift for the company. The company also raised its full-year earnings guidance, indicating confidence in its current trajectory. (not investment advice)</p>

In a significant move to boost investor confidence, Uber also authorized a new $20 billion stock buyback program.

          <p>China is on the verge of finalizing a merger between its two largest state-owned shipbuilders, which will create the world's largest publicly listed shipbuilding company. The new entity, CSSC Holdings, will have assets exceeding 400 billion yuan and is seen as a strategic move to enhance China's global competitiveness and military capabilities. Analysts believe the merger will optimize resources by phasing out less efficient operations and concentrating on high-end and military vessel construction. The move is a key part of Beijing's broader industrial ambitions amid growing rivalry with the United States.</p>

          <p>ESPN has signed a significant five-year deal with WWE, acquiring the U.S. rights to broadcast its premium live events, including WrestleMania and Royal Rumble, starting in 2026. The deal is valued at an average of $325 million per year, a substantial increase over the previous agreement with NBCUniversal's Peacock. All events will stream on ESPN's new direct-to-consumer platform, with some simulcast on linear networks, in a move designed to expand ESPN's audience to a younger, more diverse demographic. The partnership is seen as a strategic move for both companies.</p>

          <p>In an effort to boost its tourism sector and strengthen diplomatic ties, South Korea is introducing a temporary visa waiver for Chinese tour groups. The program will run from late September 2025 until June 2026, allowing organized groups of Chinese tourists to enter the country without a visa. This move follows China's unilateral visa-free policy for South Koreans implemented last year, which led to a significant increase in travel. Officials hope the new policy will revitalize regional economies and increase domestic consumption as the inbound tourism market recovers.</p>

          <p>McDonald's reported second-quarter earnings and revenue that surpassed analyst expectations, driven by a rebound in its U.S. market. The fast-food giant's domestic same-store sales grew 2.5%, reversing previous declines, thanks to successful promotions like a "Minecraft" movie tie-in and the launch of McCrispy Chicken Strips. International markets also showed strong demand, contributing to a global same-store sales jump of 3.8%, the company's largest in nearly two years. The results indicate that the chain's focus on value and marketing is successfully attracting diners despite economic pressures. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>In a direct response to security concerns, Nvidia published a blog post forcefully stating that its chips do not contain any "back doors, kill switches, or spyware." The chief security officer of the influential chip designer emphasized that embedding such vulnerabilities would be a gift to hackers and that the company is committed to building trustworthy systems. This public assertion aims to reassure customers and governments about the security and integrity of its widely used graphics processing units (GPUs), which are critical infrastructure for AI, finance, and scientific research.</p>

          <h2>FBI Data for 2024 Shows Violent Crime at Historic Lows, Contradicting Political Narratives</h2>

          <p>A new FBI report reveals that crime rates in the United States decreased significantly in 2024, with violent crime dropping to levels not seen since the 1960s. The data shows a 14.5% fall in murder and non-negligent manslaughter and a 4.5% decrease in overall violent crime compared to the previous year. These figures directly contradict the narrative of an out-of-control crime wave that was a central theme in the 2024 presidential election. The report indicates that the nation was safer during the final full year of the Biden administration, challenging claims of surging crime.</p>

          <p>UK Culture Secretary Lisa Nandy stated that financially distressed football clubs like Sheffield Wednesday and Morecambe can "absolutely" be saved from collapse. She emphasized that a new independent football regulator, set to launch later this year, will have the power to intervene, including forcing owners to sell in dire circumstances. The new regulator will also implement stronger ownership tests to prevent clubs from falling into peril. Nandy acknowledged the urgency of the situation, referencing past club collapses and promising fans that the government is working quickly to establish the new oversight body.</p>
