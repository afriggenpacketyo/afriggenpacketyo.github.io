          <p>Nvidia and Microsoft are among major US tech firms committing billions in investment to the UK, with Nvidia predicting the country will become an "AI superpower." Microsoft's $30 billion spending package is its largest ever outside the US, forming part of a broader "Tech Prosperity Deal" between the UK government and US tech giants. The investments will focus on building AI infrastructure, including data centers and a new supercomputer in Essex, with Google also promising £5 billion for AI research and infrastructure. While some warn of an AI bubble, tech leaders emphasize the potential for AI to drive economic growth and productivity, particularly in healthcare and public services. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>Frontier Airlines CEO Barry Biffle responded to United Airlines CEO Scott Kirby's assertion that the deep discount model in the U.S. is dead, calling it "cute." Biffle defended Frontier's lower unit costs and its focus on customers seeking affordable flights, arguing that there is an oversupply issue in the United States. Kirby had predicted that Spirit Airlines, the largest U.S. discounter, would go out of business, but Biffle maintains that Frontier caters to a different market segment. Both Frontier and United are vying for Spirit's customers as the latter struggles financially.</p>

          <p>Workday's shares experienced a 9% increase after activist investor Elliott Investment Management announced a $2 billion stake in the company. Elliott believes Workday's multi-year plan to enhance its operating model and capital allocation framework will drive substantial long-term value creation. Workday, which provides software for finance and human resources departments, recently announced the acquisition of Paradox, an AI recruiting software company. Despite the recent surge, Workday's shares are still down roughly 15% year-to-date, with a market capitalization of approximately $63 billion. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>With potential interest rate cuts on the horizon, experts are weighing in on whether homeowners should refinance their home equity loans. Refinancing could be beneficial for borrowers with steep rates or large balances, or those who want to change their loan terms. However, it may not be worthwhile for those with already low rates, short-term selling plans, or who are close to paying off their loans. It is important to consider closing costs and break-even points before making a decision, and assess whether a fixed-rate home equity loan or variable-rate HELOC is the better option.
