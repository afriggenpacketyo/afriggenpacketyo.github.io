          <p>Microsoft founder Bill Gates made a surprise appearance in the popular Hindi TV drama 'Kyunki Saas Bhi Kabhi Bahu Thi' alongside actress and former federal minister Smriti Irani. His four-minute segment focused on maternal and child health, aligning with the Gates Foundation's long-standing efforts to curb infant and maternal mortality in India, particularly in Uttar Pradesh and Bihar. This unexpected cameo aims to leverage the show's wide reach for social messaging, emphasizing the importance of care for girls and mothers in a patriarchal society. The collaboration demonstrates how popular storytelling can effectively inform and inspire awareness on critical social issues.</p>

          <p>As clocks go back and winter nights lengthen, particularly in northern UK regions like Orkney and Shetland, many people experience Seasonal Affective Disorder (SAD). This recurring depression, linked to reduced daylight, causes low mood, anxiety, and fatigue. Experts recommend embracing outdoor activities and redesigning indoor spaces with comforting light. Initiatives like 'Wintering Well' boxes in Orkney, offering therapeutic lamps and activity guides, aim to help individuals develop routines for better mental health during darker months.</p>

          <h2>Debate Emerges Over Necessity of Learning Manual Driving Amidst Automatic Car Rise</h2>
          <div class="timestamp">2025-10-24 19:07:13 EDT</div>
        </div>
        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>A quiet shift towards automatic cars is evident in the UK, with one in three vehicles now automatic and a quarter of driving tests taken in them. This trend is driven by the upcoming 2030 ban on new petrol and diesel cars, as electric vehicles lack manual gearboxes. For new drivers, the decision between manual and automatic is complex, influenced by instructor availability, cost, and the desire for quicker test passes. While manual licenses offer more flexibility, some argue that with automatics becoming the norm, manual skills may soon be obsolete.</p>

          <p>Vote counting for the Irish presidential election is set to begin, with results expected later today at Dublin Castle. Voters in the Republic of Ireland cast their ballots on Friday to elect the 10th Irish president, succeeding Michael D Higgins. The race features two primary contenders, Catherine Connolly and Heather Humphreys, alongside Jim Gavin, whose name remained on the ballot despite his withdrawal. Early indications suggest a potentially low voter turnout, possibly struggling to reach the record low seen in the 2018 election.</p>

          <p>Magnesium has become a popular supplement, with many claiming it aids sleep, digestion, and mental health, driving a booming global market. While magnesium is crucial for over 300 bodily processes, including brain function and blood sugar regulation, dietitians caution that supplements are only beneficial if one is deficient, which is difficult to accurately test. Despite widespread promotion by influencers, robust scientific evidence for broad positive effects on healthy individuals remains limited. Experts recommend prioritizing dietary sources and consulting professionals, as excessive intake can pose risks, particularly for those with kidney disease.</p>

The 28-page document outlines federal demands for policy changes at UCLA, including alterations to admissions, protest rules, and a ban on gender-affirming healthcare for minors. The administration had previously suspended $584 million in research funding, alleging violations in handling antisemitism complaints and gender identity issues.
