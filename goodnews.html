          <p>A digest of news includes Japan and the U.S. agreeing to enhance cybersecurity cooperation amid growing online threats. The Japanese government's release of cheaper stockpiled rice has led to increased consumer demand as rice prices soar. U.S. Defense Secretary Pete Hegseth urged Asian allies to increase defense spending to deter China, while an opposition leader in Japan apologized for calling government rice reserves "animal feed." A fire on a Seoul subway forced 400 passengers to evacuate, and a new Asian art museum opened on Naoshima Island, Japan.</p>

          <p>The UK government plans to invest ¬£1.5 billion in six new munitions and explosives factories to bolster the country's defense capabilities and create approximately 1,800 new jobs. This initiative is part of a broader strategic defense review aimed at addressing deficiencies in weapons and munitions production highlighted by the war in Ukraine. The new factories will support the production of over 7,000 British-built long-range weapons, including drones and missiles, increasing the UK's munitions spending to ¬£6 billion during this parliament. The government aims to establish an "always on" munitions production capacity that can be rapidly scaled up as needed.</p>

          <p>A ban on the sale of single-use disposable vapes has come into force across the UK, aiming to protect children's health and reduce environmental waste. While shops can still sell rechargeable or refillable devices, the ban targets disposable vapes, which have been cited as a key driver in the rise of youth vaping. Health experts emphasize that further regulation is needed to address youth vaping effectively, despite vaping being substantially less harmful than smoking. Retailers who violate the ban face fines and potential jail time.</p>

An open letter signed by over 500 Broadway performers called for accountability for harmful behavior, particularly LuPone's disrespectful language towards Lewis. The controversy stemmed from a New Yorker interview where LuPone criticized Lewis's claim of being a Broadway veteran and dismissed McDonald as not being a friend. LuPone expressed regret for her inappropriate responses and committed to making amends, while McDonald indicated she was unaware of any rift between them.</p>
