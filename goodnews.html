          <p>The Trump administration is reportedly preparing to accept a luxury Boeing 747-8 jumbo jet from the Qatari royal family for use as Air Force One, with ownership eventually transferring to the Trump Presidential Library Foundation. This unprecedented arrangement has raised legal questions regarding the acceptance of such a valuable gift from a foreign power. White House and DOJ lawyers have purportedly drafted an analysis concluding that the Department of Defense can legally accept the aircraft as a gift and later transfer it to the Trump library, arguing it doesn't violate bribery laws or the emoluments clause of the Constitution.</p>

          <p>Japanese Prime Minister Shigeru Ishiba has expressed caution regarding a consumption tax cut as a measure to combat inflation, citing concerns about the potential strain on state coffers. Senior officials within his administration and the ruling Liberal Democratic Party have also been dismissive of such a cut.

          <p>A proposal to replace public basketball courts with pickleball facilities in Fort Lauderdale has ignited controversy, with some residents alleging racial motives. The basketball courts have been a popular gathering spot for a diverse community since their construction shortly after the end of segregation on the city's beaches. While developers assert that pickleball was chosen for its broader appeal, critics fear the conversion will destroy a long-standing community tradition and potentially 'whiten' the beach area. The city commission is now exploring options for preserving or relocating the basketball courts amid community concerns.</p>

          <p>After decades of improvement, US life expectancy has recently declined, but scientific advances offer hope for reversing this trend. Cardiologist Dr. Eric Topol suggests five evidence-based strategies for a longer, healthier life: knowing and lowering biological age through blood tests, adopting a Mediterranean-style diet rich in whole grains and vegetables, prioritizing deep sleep, engaging in strength training, and fostering social connections. These steps can mitigate the risks of age-related diseases and improve overall well-being, offering a path toward a healthier future for Americans.</p>
