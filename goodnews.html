          <p>Antoine Massey, the ninth of ten inmates who escaped from the Orleans Justice Center six weeks ago, has been apprehended in New Orleans. The jailbreak, described by Louisiana's governor as the worst in recent state history, has brought intense scrutiny upon Orleans Parish Sheriff Susan Hutson, who attributes the escape to poor facility infrastructure. With Massey's capture, only one fugitive, Derrick Groves, remains at large, and authorities have arrested over a dozen individuals for allegedly aiding the escapees.</p>

          <p>President Trump has stated his belief that a ceasefire agreement between Israel and Hamas could be reached "within the next week," signaling that a deal is close. The administration has been actively pushing for a pause in the conflict, which began after Hamas's attack on Israel in October 2023 and led to a devastating Israeli military response in Gaza. While a previous proposal was rejected by Hamas, the president's comments suggest renewed hope for a halt to the fighting that has caused tens of thousands of casualties.</p>

          <p>The S&P 500 index closed at a new all-time high of 6,173, completing a significant recovery from a sharp downturn in April caused by tariff concerns.

          <p>A federal judge has struck down President Trump's executive order targeting the law firm Susman Godfrey, declaring it an unconstitutional violation of the First and Fifth Amendments. The order sought to punish the firm, which represented Dominion Voting Systems in its lawsuit against Fox News, by restricting its employees' access to federal buildings and security clearances. The ruling marks the fourth such victory for law firms that challenged the administration's directives, which the judge described as a "shocking abuse of power" threatening the independence of the legal profession.</p>

          <p>Prominent financial advisor Ric Edelman has updated his guidance on cryptocurrency investment, now suggesting that portfolios could allocate between 10% to 40% to the asset class. This is a substantial increase from his previous recommendation of a low single-digit percentage. Edelman attributes this shift to the maturation of crypto into a mainstream asset and the obsolescence of the traditional 60/40 stock-and-bond model due to increased human longevity, arguing that crypto offers non-correlated, high-return potential.
