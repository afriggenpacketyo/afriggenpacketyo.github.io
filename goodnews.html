          <p>The Trump administration is offering undocumented immigrants $1,000 stipends and travel assistance to return to their home countries voluntarily. Department of Homeland Security Secretary Kristi Noem stated that self-deportation is the safest, most cost-effective way for undocumented immigrants to leave the U.S., saving taxpayers 70% compared to arrest, detention, and removal. The program requires immigrants to use the U.S. Customs and Border Protection's "Home" app and confirms their arrival in their country of origin before issuing the stipend. Immigrants who sign up will also be deprioritized for detention and removal ahead of their departure, potentially keeping the door open for legal immigration in the future.</p>

          <p>Treasury Secretary Scott Bessent addressed global investors at the Milken Institute Global Conference, outlining President Trump's "America First Vision" and encouraging investment in the United States. Bessent emphasized tariffs, tax cuts, and deregulation as the core components of Trump's economic agenda, highlighting the administration's efforts to reduce government waste and promote private investment. He stated that the administration aims to make the U.S. more appealing for investors, while also noting that the U.S. is close to reaching trade deals with various countries, including potential progress with China in the coming weeks. Bessent's remarks followed Trump's claim that numerous countries are eager to make deals with the U.S.</p>

          <p>Treasury Secretary Scott Bessent urged global business leaders to disregard economic naysayers and increase investment in the United States, defending the Trump administration's economic agenda. Bessent argued that the administration's plans extend beyond trade policy, including tax cuts and deregulation, which would stimulate job creation and output. He encouraged investors to focus on these broader economic plans, despite concerns about tariffs destabilizing the global economy. Business leaders expressed worries about the impact of tariffs, with some delaying investment and preparing for economic headwinds. Bessent predicted that Congress could pass tax cuts by early July, which would incentivize investment in high-tech operations and equipment.</p>

          <p>President Donald Trump is scheduled to attend two crypto-focused dinners this month, aiming to raise millions from the crypto community. The first event is a $1.5 million-per-plate fundraiser, featuring David Sacks, who has been influential in shaping crypto and AI regulations. The second dinner will be held at Trump National, with access determined by a blockchain-based contest for holders of the $TRUMP meme token. The crypto community has welcomed Sacks' influence, attributing it to a policy shift delivering regulatory wins across federal agencies, contrasting with President Joe Biden's approach. The contest for the $TRUMP token runs through May 12, with the top 220 token holders promised dinner with Trump.</p>

        </div>
        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Homeowners considering a HELOC this May should be aware of potential hurdles in the approval process. Lenders are seeking borrowers who meet specific criteria, including sufficient home equity (at least 15% to 20%), a strong credit score (ideally 680 or higher), and a low debt-to-income ratio (typically below 43%). Stable income and employment history are also crucial factors for approval. To improve chances of approval, homeowners can check their credit report, lower their DTI ratio, shop around for different lenders, and consider adding a co-applicant. Despite the challenges, many homeowners with substantial equity may find HELOCs a cost-effective borrowing option in the current high-rate environment. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>The trend of anti-Trump sentiment influencing global politics continues as the center-left Labor Party in Australia secured a come-from-behind victory, with the right-wing challenger losing his seat. This mirrors the Canadian elections, where the Liberals held onto power amid an anti-Trump backlash. The Labor Party gained support following President Donald Trump's clash with Ukrainian leader Volodymyr Zelenskyy and his "Liberation Day" tariffs. Observers suggest that voters are mindful of Trump's policies, including tariffs and disrupted alliances, when making decisions. The Washington Post noted that Australians gifted their center-left prime minister a landslide victory amid anger and confusion over Trump's tariffs.</p>

          <p>New York City has ended its decades-long program of purchasing land in the Catskills to protect its drinking water, after acquiring over 156,000 acres. The city spent $518 million since 1997 to keep human and agricultural waste out of the watersheds. The decision to halt the program follows an independent review that concluded further land purchases would have little benefit. The city will now focus on a Collaborative Streamside Acquisition Program, requiring local approval for land transactions. Residents worry about gentrification threatening their communities as housing prices and taxes rise.</p>

GM President Mark Reuss has overseen a product renaissance for Cadillac, emphasizing all-electric vehicles, sporty sedans, and the flagship Escalade. The strategy involves isolating Cadillac's products from GM's other brands and focusing on value over volume. Challenges remain, including declining sales in China and ensuring the successful launch of the bespoke Celestiq.
