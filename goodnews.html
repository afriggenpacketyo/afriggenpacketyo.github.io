          <p>American fund managers are lobbying Congress to amend Section 899 of the "One Big Beautiful Bill Act," fearing it could prompt foreign investors to withdraw from U.S. stock markets. The Investment Company Institute (ICI) warns that the bill, intended to penalize foreign-owned firms from countries with unfair taxes, inadvertently impacts foreign investments in U.S. equities. The ICI argues that Section 899 could lead to capital outflows, depressing U.S. equity markets and harming both U.S. companies and investors. Foreign investors hold significant assets in U.S. markets, including stocks, government bonds, and credit, and the ICI supports protecting U.S. business interests but believes the bill's current draft is counterproductive.

          <p>Japan plans to release another 200,000 tons of rice from government stockpiles through direct contracts with retailers in an effort to curb elevated prices. Farm Minister Shinjiro Koizumi expects the released rice to be sold at 1,700 yen per 5 kilograms. This move will reduce the country's rice reserve to around 100,000 tons, down from approximately 910,000 tons before the government began releasing stocks. The government is distributing the rice to smaller supermarket chains and specialty shops, as well as major retailers, to ensure it reaches consumers at lower prices. The price uptrend has persisted due to suspected hoarding by wholesalers and farmers.</p>

          <p>Temu and Shein are increasingly pivoting to Europe as their business in the U.S. faces significant challenges from unfavorable trade policies. Consumer spending on Temu in the U.S. fell by approximately 36% in May compared to the previous year, while Shein experienced a 13% decrease. Both companies are facing regulatory scrutiny in Europe, including a proposed two-euro customs fee on small packages. To counteract these challenges, Temu and Shein are expanding their operations in Europe, increasing warehouse capacity and digital ad spending in key markets. These trends coincide with data showing that app usage of Temu and Shein in the U.S. is slowing significantly.</p>

          <p>Chinese exports to major industrial centers in Southeast Asia have risen significantly, driven by growing consumer markets and offshore factory investments. Shipments to Vietnam, Thailand, and Indonesia increased by double-digit percentages in the first five months of the year. Analysts suggest that manufacturers are shipping more to Southeast Asian factory sites to produce finished goods for local sale or export to Western countries, including the US, to offset losses from high US tariffs. Factories often inject enough local content into goods from China to declare re-exports as made in Vietnam, Thailand, or Indonesia.</p>
