          <p>Home Depot is set to report its quarterly earnings amidst a challenging economic backdrop marked by high interest rates and a sluggish housing market. The retailer has been focusing on attracting more business from home professionals, including the acquisition of SRS Distribution. Despite these efforts, Home Depot faces potential cost pressures from higher tariffs on imports, which could impact prices for consumers. The company projects modest sales growth for fiscal 2025, but faces headwinds in the housing sector, where higher mortgage rates are delaying home purchases and renovation projects.

          <p>Patti Davis, daughter of Ronald Reagan, discusses Joe Biden's recent diagnosis of prostate cancer, drawing parallels to her father's announcement of his Alzheimer's diagnosis in 1994. Davis suggests that Biden's situation presents an opportunity for him to demonstrate leadership on a human level, transcending political divides. She emphasizes the emotional challenges that come with a cancer diagnosis and encourages Biden to be open about his experiences, potentially restoring trust with voters who may feel he was not honest about his fitness for a second term. By sharing his personal journey, Biden could provide comfort and understanding to millions facing similar struggles.</p>

          <p>An opinion piece in Fox News draws parallels between Ronald Reagan and Donald Trump, arguing that both men share ideological similarities as outsiders challenging the political establishment. The article points to Reagan's opposition to the establishment and his focus on individual liberties, traits mirrored in Trump's policies and rhetoric. While acknowledging differences in style, the author contends that both leaders acted on conservative ideas and resonated with blue-collar voters. The piece suggests that the Republican Party has embraced a cluster of issues centered on the importance of the individual, which both Reagan and Trump pursued.</p>

          <p>Andrew Smith, a shark fisher in Florida, is being hailed as a hero after using his drone to save a teenage girl from drowning in a rip current. Smith, unable to swim due to a seizure disorder, utilized his drone to deliver a flotation device to the struggling girl, who had been caught in the current for about five minutes. Despite an initial failed attempt due to strong winds, Smith successfully deployed the flotation device on his second try, enabling the girl to stay afloat until first responders arrived. The incident underscores the importance of heeding beach warning flags and the potential for innovative uses of drone technology in emergency situations.</p>

          <p>NASA engineers successfully revived Voyager 1's primary roll thrusters after the backup system showed signs of potential failure, jeopardizing the spacecraft's ability to communicate with Earth. The thrusters ensure the antenna remains pointed at Earth, and even slight misalignment could sever contact. The team suspected that the heaters on the primary thrusters had turned themselves off because of an electronics glitch. The fix was critical because the Deep Space Station 43, used to send commands to both Voyagers, was scheduled to go offline for upgrades, limiting communication capabilities. The Voyager team remains optimistic about keeping the two spacecraft operational long enough to celebrate their 50th anniversary in 2027.</p>

Along the way Goodge ran through a dust storm, lost several toenails, and suffered from injuries, including rotting feet and bone pain, which sometimes caused him to hallucinate.

In particular, the Red Bull is strong in high-speed corners. This was not as clear at the time of the Japanese Grand Prix as it is now, and that probably explains the reaction at the time to Verstappen's pole lap and win at Suzuka.</p>
