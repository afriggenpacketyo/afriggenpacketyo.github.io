          <div class="timestamp">2025-06-07 23:00:15 EDT</div>
        </div>
        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>A new study suggests that subsidizing men's participation in household chores and childcare could help reverse declining birth rates, particularly in countries like China. The research, co-authored by researchers from Fudan University and the University of Hong Kong, argues that subsidies for fathers produce significantly higher long-term fertility gains than solely subsidizing mothers. China is facing a rapidly aging population, shrinking workforce, and strained social welfare system, making the decline in fertility rates especially urgent. The study also found that traditional expectations placing the burden on women to perform most childcare duties persist in China and other East Asian countries.</p>

          <p>Sona, an ancient writing system from Zambia created by women, is being revived through a social media campaign to highlight women's roles in pre-colonial communities. The writing system, used by the Chokwe, Luchazi, and Luvale people, features geometric patterns carrying mathematical principles and messages about nature. The original custodians and teachers of Sona were women, and the Women's History Museum of Zambia is working to document and archive this indigenous knowledge. The project aims to challenge the notion that African societies lacked their own knowledge systems and to reclaim cultural heritages almost erased by colonialism.</p>
