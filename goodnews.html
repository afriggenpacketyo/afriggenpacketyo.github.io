          <p>An opinion article posits that the global multilateral system is in decline, marked by unilateral actions, trade wars, and the marginalization of the Global South, necessitating urgent new governance approaches. The author presents the China-led Shanghai Cooperation Organisation (SCO) as a "critical salve" for these international challenges, highlighting its role as a platform for cooperation among countries with diverse cultures, ideologies, and political systems. The article suggests that while some states undermine global institutions, the SCO embodies five principles that foster stability and provide a model for reform in a fragmenting world order, promoting dialogue over tariffs and sanctions.</p>

          <p>For many families, mealtimes often become a source of stress due to children's fussy eating habits, a common developmental stage affecting over half of all children. Child and baby nutritionist Charlotte Stirling-Reed provides five expert tips aimed at alleviating this pressure, stressing that parents should not feel at fault. Her advice includes granting children autonomy in their food choices, refraining from categorizing foods as "good" or "bad," prioritizing a joyful dining experience, acknowledging natural appetite variations, and actively involving children in food preparation. These strategies are designed to cultivate a positive relationship with food and encourage broader dietary acceptance.</p>

          <p>Ed Sheeran's eighth album, 'Play,' represents a strategic effort to regain commercial momentum after his previous introspective works saw reduced sales. Described as a direct response to a "darkest period," the album aims to infuse joy and explore global cultures, subtly integrating Asian and Middle Eastern musical elements such as the sitar and tabla. While certain tracks like "Sapphire" have achieved significant success, topping India's streaming charts, critics suggest the album often reverts to more conventional pop structures, potentially underutilizing its rich cultural inspirations. The article contemplates whether Sheeran's drive for widespread streaming appeal may dilute his unique artistic potential.</p>

Research from the Harvard Business Review substantiates a direct correlation between empathy and commercial success, demonstrating that empathetic companies significantly outperform their competitors. The program's founder, Ann Kowal Smith, champions these initiatives as crucial investments in people, asserting that fostering open dialogue and practiced communication skills are vital drivers of future business prosperity.</p>

          <p>Gemini Space Station, the cryptocurrency exchange founded by Cameron and Tyler Winklevoss, has reportedly priced its initial public offering at $28 per share, surpassing its expected range and valuing the company at $3.3 billion. This robust pricing, along with the sale of 15.2 million shares, signals strong market demand for the crypto company. Despite reporting widening losses, especially in 2025, Gemini recently received a significant vote of institutional confidence through a $50 million strategic investment from Nasdaq. This partnership aims to integrate Gemini's custodial services and trade management system, with its stock set to trade on Nasdaq under the ticker "GEMI." (not investment advice)</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Denmark's remarkable success in dramatically improving its cancer survival rates, once lagging behind other rich countries, presents valuable lessons for the UK's National Health Service. Twenty-five years ago, Denmark implemented a bold plan involving substantial investment in advanced diagnostic equipment, particularly CT scanners, and established stringent national targets for cancer diagnosis and treatment within two weeks of referral. Beyond clinical care, the strategy also prioritized patient experience, introducing home chemotherapy and supportive counseling centers. UK Health Secretary Wes Streeting is now integrating elements of the Danish model into England's forthcoming long-term cancer plan, underscoring the necessity of sustained political consensus and increased investment for similar transformative outcomes.</p>

          <p>The legendary parody rock band Spinal Tap is making a highly anticipated return with a sequel, 'Spinal Tap II: The End Continues,' more than four decades after their original mockumentary. The film centers on the band's quest for a new drummer, a notoriously perilous position given their history of drummers meeting bizarre fates. The sequel humorously features real-life drum legends such as Questlove and Lars Ulrich declining the role, ultimately introducing newcomer Didi Crockett. Directed by Rob Reiner, the movie delves into the band's lives 15 years post-split, with their reunion prompted by a viral country cover, and includes cameos from music icons like Elton John and Paul McCartney.</p>

          <p>South Africa's Constitutional Court has issued a landmark ruling, affirming that husbands can now legally adopt their wives' family names, thereby overturning an apartheid-era law that previously prohibited this. Justice Loena Theron stated the existing legislation discriminated "on the grounds of gender" and was a "colonial import," infringing on the equality enshrined in the post-apartheid constitution. The court suspended the current law, granting the government two years to amend the Births and Deaths Registration Act. The decision, stemming from cases brought by two couples, has sparked mixed reactions on social media, with many welcoming it as a progressive step for gender equality.</p>

          <p>China's stock market is experiencing significant gains, presenting a test for regulators as Beijing endeavors to establish its US$12 trillion equity market as a consistent source of household income. This initiative aims to bolster consumer spending and economic growth by reallocating household wealth from the property sector, which currently holds 60% of Chinese family assets. While recent moderation in market gains has somewhat mitigated concerns about volatility-inducing pump-and-dump schemes by retail investors, regulators are focused on cultivating a sustainable bull market. Analysts anticipate a transition towards a slower, yet enduring, uptrend, notwithstanding potential increases in market volatility. (not investment advice)</p>
