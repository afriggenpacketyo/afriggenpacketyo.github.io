          <h2>DNA Analysis of Skeletons in Ancient Turkish Settlement Suggests Matrilineal Society</h2>
          <div class="timestamp">2025-07-29 10:24:00 EDT</div>
        </div>
        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>A new study of a 9,000-year-old Neolithic settlement in Turkey, Catalhoyuk, provides strong evidence of a society centered around women. Researchers analyzed DNA from skeletons buried under homes and discovered that related individuals were often connected through their mother's side, indicating a matrilineal and matrilocal system where men moved in with their female partner's family. This genetic evidence supports earlier theories based on female figurines found at the site. The findings, published in the journal Science, also revealed more grave goods with female bodies, further suggesting an elevated societal status for women.</p>

          <h2>India's Tiger Population Is Increasing, But Habitat Fragmentation Poses Significant Risks</h2>
          <div class="timestamp">2025-07-29 10:21:00 EDT</div>
        </div>
        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>India is home to approximately 75% of the world's wild tigers, with the population showing a promising increase to over 3,600. However, conservationists warn that significant threats remain, primarily from habitat fragmentation due to deforestation, agriculture, and infrastructure projects. This division of habitats isolates tiger populations, affecting their movement and breeding, and increases human-wildlife conflict. Experts emphasize that protecting the quality and connectivity of these habitats is crucial for the long-term survival of the species, as simply focusing on population numbers overlooks the broader ecological deterioration.</p>

          <h2>Psychologist Identifies Common Misleading Phrases Parents Tell Children That Can Hinder Success</h2>
          <div class="timestamp">2025-07-29 10:07:01 EDT</div>
        </div>
        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>A psychologist with over 20 years of experience highlights six common but potentially harmful lies that well-meaning parents tell their children. Phrases like "if you put your mind to it, you can accomplish anything" and "big kids don't cry" can inadvertently set unrealistic expectations or discourage healthy emotional expression. The article argues that such statements can negatively impact a child's long-term resilience, self-worth, and ability to form healthy relationships. Instead, it advises parents to foster realistic goals, validate all emotions, and teach the balance between independence and asking for help.</p>

The aerospace giant delivered 150 airplanes in the second quarter, its highest number since 2018, indicating improved production stability under its new leadership. CEO Kelly Ortberg expressed optimism, stating that 2025 could be the company's "turnaround year" if it maintains its focus on safety and quality. While challenges remain, including delays in certifying new 737 Max models, the improved financial performance suggests the company is making progress after years of crises.

In a detailed article, Xu argued that Dalio was mistaken to call for deleveraging in China, asserting that the country's recent liquidity issues stem from overly harsh policies rather than excessive borrowing. The debate comes as Chinese policymakers consider further stimulus measures to support the economy amid a property downturn and deflationary pressures, highlighting differing perspectives on the nation's fiscal path.

          <p>Research from hundreds of companies that have successfully transitioned to a four-day, 32-hour workweek reveals three common strategies for maintaining productivity. According to lead researcher Juliet Schor, these companies focused on cutting down on inefficient meetings, re-engineering work processes to be more efficient, and eliminating low-impact tasks. By implementing these changes, businesses reported higher employee engagement and less burnout, along with increased profits and lower turnover. The findings suggest that a shorter workweek is achievable when companies intentionally redesign how work gets done.</p>
