          <p>The European Commission has proposed a new seven-year budget of €2 trillion, featuring a fivefold increase in defense and space funding to €131 billion. This "European Competitiveness Fund" aims to bolster regional investment and strategic autonomy. The budget, which also allocates 35% to climate projects, would be financed through new revenue streams rather than increased member state contributions, though some nations like the Netherlands have already criticized the proposal as too high.</p>

          <p>President Trump's recent comments suggest that First Lady Melania Trump has played a role in shaping his approach to the war in Ukraine. He revealed that she frequently points out the hypocrisy of Vladimir Putin's actions, such as launching missiles into Kyiv shortly after seemingly positive phone calls. This revelation has led to a flurry of positive reactions on Ukrainian social media, where she has been dubbed "Agent Melania Trumpenko" for her perceived advocacy for their cause.</p>

          <p>In a significant reversal, US Senate Republicans have agreed to exempt the President's Emergency Plan for Aids Relief (PEPFAR) from a proposed $9 billion spending cut package. The initial plan to cut $400 million from the globally recognized HIV/Aids program faced bipartisan opposition due to its credited role in saving millions of lives. The White House has reportedly agreed to the amendment, which is seen as a victory for public health advocates and a sign of the program's enduring support.</p>

          <p>A Wisconsin man initially suspected of murdering his girlfriend was ultimately cleared after data from his Fitbit provided a crucial alibi. The device's activity log, showing only a few footsteps during the night of the crime, corroborated his story that he was asleep at home. This case is a prime example of how data from wearable technology is increasingly playing a pivotal role in criminal investigations, not only to incriminate suspects but also to exonerate the innocent.</p>

          <p>The Ukrainian parliament has voted to accept the resignation of Prime Minister Denys Shmyhal, who was the longest-serving individual in that role in the country's history. The move is part of a broader government reshuffle aimed at recalibrating Ukraine's economic and defense strategies during its ongoing war with Russia. Deputy Prime Minister Yulia Svyrydenko is expected to become the new prime minister, while Shmyhal is reportedly being considered for the position of defense minister.</p>

          <p>A U.S. House committee has blocked a Trump administration proposal that would have ended longstanding protections for wild horses and allowed for their potential slaughter. The proposal sought to cut the Bureau of Land Management's Wild Horse and Burro program budget and permit the transfer of horses to countries where slaughter facilities operate. The committee's action reaffirms the congressional ban on slaughter and appropriates $144 million to the program, a move praised by animal welfare advocates.</p>

          <p>The U.S. decision to review license applications for certain advanced AI chips from Nvidia and AMD for export to China is being interpreted as a positive step in bilateral trade negotiations. This move to potentially ease restrictions is seen as a concession that could reset the tone of high-level talks, moving closer to the "mutual respect" framework Beijing has sought. Experts suggest this development could be an early sign that tense relations over technology and trade are being steered toward a more cooperative direction. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>This article examines the key differences between 401(k) plans and annuities as tools for retirement planning. A 401(k) offers investment flexibility and growth potential, making it suitable for those comfortable with market risk, while an annuity provides a guaranteed income stream, appealing to risk-averse individuals seeking stability. The article suggests that instead of an either-or choice, a hybrid approach can be effective, using a 401(k) for growth and converting a portion to an annuity later to create a secure income floor in retirement.
