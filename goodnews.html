          <p>Google has agreed to pay nearly $1.4 billion to the state of Texas to settle allegations of violating residents' data privacy rights. Texas Attorney General Ken Paxton sued Google in 2022, accusing the company of unlawfully tracking and collecting user data. The settlement covers allegations in two separate lawsuits related to Chrome's incognito mode, location history on Google Maps, and biometric claims related to Google Photos. While Google did not admit wrongdoing, it stated that the settlement resolves old claims concerning product policies that have already been changed.</p>

          <p>Rumeysa Ozturk, a Turkish doctoral candidate at Tufts University, was released from immigration custody after a judge ruled her detention violated her First Amendment and due process rights. Ozturk was detained following the revocation of her student visa, allegedly due to an opinion piece she co-authored criticizing Israel's war with Hamas. The judge stated there was no evidence she engaged in violence or advocated violence, and her continued detention would chill free speech. Ozturk's attorneys argued her detainment was retaliatory and violated her rights, while Tufts University expressed support for her return to campus.</p>

          <p>Kosmos-482, a robotic Soviet spacecraft launched in 1972 with the intention of landing on Venus, is expected to re-enter Earth‚Äôs atmosphere by the end of this weekend. Due to a rocket malfunction, it never reached its intended destination and has been drifting in space ever since. Experts are unsure where it will come down, but its orbit places it between 52 degrees north and 52 degrees south latitude, covering a large portion of the Earth's surface. The spacecraft is expected to largely burn up upon re-entry, but some pieces may survive impact.</p>

          <p>A review of "Life of Pi" at the Ahmanson Theatre praises the stage adaptation of Yann Martel's novel for its inventive puppetry and magical simplicity. The story revolves around Pi Patel, a 17-year-old boy who survives at sea with animals after a shipwreck. The production transitions between the hospital where Pi is recovering and his memories of growing up in India. The staging and design elements create a dreamlike atmosphere, exploring themes of belief, survival, and the relationship between truth and wisdom.</p>
