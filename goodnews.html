This long-awaited IPO follows previous postponements due to market volatility and signals a potential rebound in the public offering market. The company will trade on the New York Stock Exchange under the ticker symbol "STUB." (not investment advice)</p>

In a lighthearted statement, the Great Run Company admitted the error, joking that it made the items a unique keepsake. Founder Sir Brendan Foster acknowledged the mistake but encouraged runners to wear their medals with pride, celebrating a successful event despite the geographical mix-up.</p>

          <p>Tennis icon Serena Williams has invested in Unrivaled, a 3-on-3 professional women's basketball league, through her venture capital firm, Serena Ventures. The investment was part of a funding round that also included soccer star Alex Morgan and was led by Bessemer Venture Partners, valuing the league at $340 million. Unrivaled was created to provide WNBA players with a high-paying domestic option during their offseason, claiming to offer the highest average salary in women's professional sports. Williams' involvement highlights her continued focus on supporting and elevating women's sports through strategic business investments since her retirement from professional tennis.</p>

          <p>Radio host Howard Stern clarified that he is still in contract negotiations with SiriusXM, following an on-air stunt that led some listeners to believe he was leaving the platform. On Monday's show, fellow host Andy Cohen briefly took over the broadcast in a pre-planned hoax, announcing a rebranded channel before Stern returned to reveal the prank. Stern, whose current contract expires at the end of the year, stated that discussions with the company about his future have been ongoing and positive. This follows two previous contract extensions, with his last deal in 2020 valued at $500 million over five years.</p>

          <p>Former Labour deputy leader Baroness Harriet Harman has stated that the party's next deputy leader, replacing Angela Rayner, must be a woman from outside of London. Her comments come as the party's National Executive Committee announced an expedited timeline for the leadership contest, with a winner to be named on October 25. Harman argued that selecting a candidate with these characteristics would complement the party leader and broaden the leadership's reach across the country. The race is seen as a pivotal moment that could influence the party's future direction, particularly regarding its economic and social policies.</p>

          <p>Musician Roger Blevins Jr., frontman for the band Mingo Fishtrap, has made a triumphant return to the stage after a 2022 tongue cancer diagnosis nearly ended his career. Following surgery that removed most of his tongue and reconstructed it with tissue from his thigh, Blevins had to relearn how to speak and sing. Now with a year of clear cancer screenings, he has performed his first ticketed show since the operation. Inspired by his experience, Blevins and his wife have also launched The Tough Crowd Project, a nonprofit dedicated to providing financial and emotional support to other families affected by cancer.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Amid rising credit card debt and high interest rates, many Americans are exploring debt relief strategies to manage their financial burdens. Debt relief encompasses various methods, including debt consolidation, which combines multiple debts into a single loan, and credit counseling, which offers structured debt management plans. More aggressive options like debt settlement involve negotiating with creditors to pay less than the full amount owed, while bankruptcy offers a legal path to eliminating or restructuring debts. This article explains that while these tools can provide significant financial relief, they often come with consequences for one's credit score and long-term financial health.

          <p>Shares of the online brokerage Robinhood jumped more than 14% after S&P Global announced its inclusion in the prestigious S&P 500 index, effective September 22. The move, which had been a subject of Wall Street speculation for months, is a significant milestone for the company that went public in 2021. Inclusion in the benchmark index typically triggers substantial buying from passive index funds, which must hold shares of its component companies. Robinhood's stock has seen a dramatic rise of over 210% year-to-date, reflecting strong performance and investor confidence in its growth prospects. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>SpaceX has agreed to purchase $17 billion worth of wireless spectrum from satellite TV provider EchoStar in a major move to enhance its Starlink satellite network's cellular capabilities. The cash-and-stock deal will give Elon Musk's company valuable spectrum licenses needed to provide direct-to-cell service globally without requiring special phones. This acquisition follows a partnership with T-Mobile and positions SpaceX to become a direct mobile service provider. The transaction also provides significant financial and regulatory relief for EchoStar, which owns the struggling Dish Network and has been under pressure to utilize its spectrum assets.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>With recent data indicating a weakening U.S. job market, individuals facing unemployment may have several options for managing their federal student loan debt. Financial experts recommend applying for income-driven repayment (IDR) plans, which can lower monthly payments, sometimes to zero, based on current income, including unemployment benefits. Another option is to apply for an Unemployment Deferment or Economic Hardship Deferment, which can temporarily pause payments, although interest may still accrue on some loans. Borrowers with private student loans have fewer standard options but are encouraged to contact their lenders directly to discuss potential hardship assistance. (not investment advice)</p>

Rangers located the group and assisted them back to the trailhead, where they were evaluated by emergency medical services. This incident serves as a cautionary tale about the dangers of consuming intoxicating substances while engaging in outdoor activities in remote or challenging terrain.</p>
