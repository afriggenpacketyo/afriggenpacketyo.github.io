        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Chevron reported a 44% decline in its second-quarter net income, falling to $2.49 billion, largely due to lower crude oil prices and a $215 million loss related to its acquisition of Hess Corporation. Despite the drop, the company's adjusted earnings per share of $1.77 beat Wall Street expectations. The acquisition of Hess, completed in July, is expected to boost future earnings and add significant assets in Guyana and the U.S. Chevron achieved record worldwide production of 3.4 million barrels per day, with U.S. output, particularly from the Permian Basin, showing strong growth.

Financial planners emphasize the importance of having an emergency fund in a safe, interest-earning account to handle unexpected expenses without resorting to high-interest debt. To secure the best rates, the article suggests choosing high-yield accounts, exploring online banks which often have lower overhead costs, and comparing different account options to find the most favorable terms and minimal fees for maximizing savings growth over time.

          <p>As of July 31, 2025, the price of gold is reported at $3,313.08 per ounce, though this figure is subject to constant change. Gold is widely regarded as a safe-haven asset and an inflation hedge, historically holding its value during times of economic or market uncertainty. The article explains that its price is influenced by numerous factors, including supply and demand, global economic conditions, inflation rates, and geopolitical instability. Other key drivers include interest rates, currency movements (particularly the U.S. dollar), market sentiment, and the policies of central banks regarding their gold reserves.

          <p>Joby Aviation is partnering with defense contractor L3Harris to develop a next-generation military aircraft capable of being operated with a pilot or flying autonomously. The collaboration will integrate Joby's vertical take-off and landing (VTOL) technology with L3Harris's expertise in military systems. The project will initially focus on applications such as airborne surveillance, reconnaissance, and logistics in contested environments, with testing set to begin this fall. This partnership reflects a shift in military strategy toward smaller, more adaptable, and potentially autonomous aircraft, moving away from more expensive traditional platforms like helicopters.</p>

          <p>Chinese swimmer Yu Zidi, aged 12, has won a bronze medal at the world swimming championships as part of the 4x200-meter freestyle relay team. Her participation and success at such a young age have prompted World Aquatics to consider reviewing its age-limit rules, which currently stand at 14 but allow younger athletes who meet a tough time standard. The executive director of the governing body acknowledged Yu's talent but expressed the need to evaluate if current regulations are appropriate for young athletes. Meanwhile, the championships are setting up a major showdown in the 800m freestyle between American veteran Katie Ledecky and 18-year-old Canadian star Summer McIntosh.</p>

          <h2>Columnist Argues 'Happy Gilmore' Films Champion Conservative Family Values</h2>

          <p>An opinion piece in the Los Angeles Times posits that the "Happy Gilmore" movies, including the new sequel, are more than just golf comedies, arguing they convey a traditional conservative message about the importance of family. The author notes that in both films, the protagonist, Happy, is motivated not by personal glory but by altruism and obligation to his family—first his grandmother, and now his daughter. The columnist suggests that this focus on selfless dedication to family, even casting Adam Sandler's own wife and daughters in the sequel, presents a message that a meaningful life is one lived for others.</p>

          <h2>Newcastle United Rejects Liverpool's Initial Bid for Striker Alexander Isak</h2>
          <div class="timestamp">2025-08-01 08:22:38 EDT</div>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Newcastle United has turned down an opening transfer offer from Liverpool for their 25-year-old striker, Alexander Isak. The bid, reportedly around £110 million plus add-ons, falls short of Newcastle's valuation of approximately £150 million for the Sweden international. Isak, who wants to explore a move away from the club, was not included in Newcastle's pre-season tour and is currently training alone. It is unclear if Liverpool, under new manager Arne Slot, will return with an improved offer as they look to strengthen their squad after a summer of heavy spending.</p>

          <p>The Labubu doll, a fluffy, monster-like figurine from Chinese toy retailer Pop Mart, has become a global phenomenon, particularly after being seen with celebrities like Rihanna. Collectors describe the dolls as a form of "social currency," with their popularity fueled by social media unboxings and limited-edition releases that sell out in minutes. The craze has led to rising prices and a difficult purchasing process, as Pop Mart has moved sales to its app to combat bots and resellers. Despite frustrations over price hikes and accessibility, the trend shows no signs of slowing down, with fans and resellers still eager to acquire the coveted collectibles.</p>

          <p>Pewabic Pottery, a Detroit institution founded in 1903, has survived over a century of the city's economic turmoil by staying true to the Arts and Crafts movement's focus on handcrafted quality.
