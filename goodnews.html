          <p>With interest rates on traditional savings accounts remaining low, savers with significant funds like $25,000 are exploring better options such as Certificates of Deposit (CDs) and high-yield savings accounts. A comparison reveals that while high-yield savings accounts currently offer slightly higher returns in most short-term scenarios, the difference is minimal. Given that CD rates are fixed and high-yield savings rates are variable and expected to fall, CDs may offer more security for those looking to lock in a guaranteed return. This analysis highlights the trade-off between potentially higher but variable returns and lower but guaranteed earnings. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>Stephen Miran, President Trump's nominee for a Federal Reserve Governor position, has committed to maintaining the central bank's independence and its dual mandate of price stability and maximum employment. In his opening remarks to the Senate Banking Committee, Miran stated that independence is critical for preventing economic depressions and hyperinflation. His nomination comes amid concerns that Trump might seek to influence the Fed's decisions on borrowing costs. While pledging independence, Miran also raised questions about Fed oversight concerning activities outside its primary mandate, such as its balance sheet.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Twenty years after Hurricane Katrina, research on survivors reveals a significant psychological silver lining known as post-traumatic growth, where individuals report positive personal changes following a traumatic event. Many survivors experienced increased personal strength, a greater appreciation for life, and improved relationships after the disaster. Studies found that while many also suffered from long-term PTSD and depression, post-traumatic stress and growth often coexisted. Factors like social support and self-efficacy were key predictors of this positive transformation, offering important lessons for future disaster recovery efforts.</p>

          <p>The U.S. House of Representatives has passed a resolution formally authorizing the Oversight Committee's investigation into Jeffrey Epstein and permitting the release of related unclassified records. The move followed Committee Chair James Comer's surprise release of 33,000 pages of documents received from the Department of Justice. This action is part of a broader push for transparency regarding the Epstein case. It also appears to be an effort by House leadership to manage a separate bipartisan initiative by Reps. Massie and Khanna, who are using a discharge petition to force a vote on releasing all DOJ records.</p>

          <p>Spanish Prime Minister Pedro Sanchez met with his British counterpart Keir Starmer in London for the first bilateral meeting between the two nations' leaders since 2017. The discussion was expected to cover strengthening trade relations and key geopolitical issues, including the wars in Ukraine and Gaza. The meeting signals a reset in UK-EU relations and follows a recent agreement to ease border checks at Gibraltar. Ahead of the meeting, Sanchez criticized Western policy on Gaza as a "failure" of "double standards" compared to Ukraine, highlighting a point of potential divergence between the two leaders.</p>

          <h2>Mortgage Rates May Decline Ahead of Anticipated Federal Reserve Rate Cut</h2>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>While the Federal Reserve is widely expected to announce an interest rate cut on September 17, mortgage rates could begin to fall before the official decision. Mortgage rates are influenced by, but not directly tied to, the Fed's policy, and lenders often adjust their rates in anticipation of such moves. Historical precedent shows that rates can drop in the lead-up to a formal announcement as market sentiment shifts. With mortgage rates already on a gradual decline throughout 2025, any further reduction is likely to be moderate rather than dramatic once the cut is formalized. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>U.S. Treasury yields fell on Wednesday after the Labor Department's Job Openings and Labor Turnover Survey (JOLTS) showed fewer available positions in July than economists had predicted. The yield on the 10-year Treasury note dropped more than 7 basis points, reflecting investor reaction to signs of a cooling labor market. Earlier, the 30-year bond yield had briefly surpassed 5%, driven by uncertainty over tariffs and concerns about the Federal Reserve's independence. This data is a key indicator for investors ahead of the full August jobs report, which will further influence market expectations for future economic policy. (not investment advice)</p>

McIlroy, who recently watched Djokovic play at the US Open, noted the tennis player's skill in managing pro-American audiences, a topic Djokovic himself discussed with the team before their 2023 victory in Rome. McIlroy emphasized the importance of controlling their own reactions and emotions rather than playing into the crowd's energy. The advice comes as Europe prepares to defend its title with a team that includes eleven of the twelve players from their previous win.</p>

When an 85-year-old patient said she was "wearing out," the King replied that he is discovering that "bits don't work so well" after 70. The visit had been previously postponed due to his cancer treatment, and when asked about his recovery, he responded, "I'm not too bad, thank you."

Two men were arrested outside Cairo, and authorities seized devices, cash, and cryptocurrency, uncovering a shell company allegedly used for laundering millions in advertising revenue.

The decision allows Google to continue paying Apple billions of dollars annually to be the default search engine on its devices, a highly profitable revenue stream for Apple. While the ruling prevents exclusive contracts, it opens the door for Apple to forge similar paid agreements with AI companies to integrate their services into Siri. This could create another major revenue source for Apple's Services division, turning a potential legal threat into a new business opportunity. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>The average monthly Social Security benefit for a retired worker in 2025 is $1,976, but individual payments can vary significantly based on work history and claiming age. While this income is a crucial foundation for many retirees, it is often insufficient to cover all living expenses, highlighting the need for supplemental income. Strategies to boost retirement funds include delaying Social Security claims to increase monthly payments, using annuities to create a predictable income stream, or tapping into home equity via a reverse mortgage. Early and comprehensive planning is essential for a financially secure retirement. (not investment advice)</p>

The bill aims to address public concerns about potential corruption and insider trading, requiring members to divest their holdings within 180 days or face a significant fine. This new effort is the result of months of negotiations to consolidate various reform proposals into a single bill with broad ideological support from progressives and conservatives.
