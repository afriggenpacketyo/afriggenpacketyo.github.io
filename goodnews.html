          <p>A 7.4 magnitude earthquake struck in the Drake Passage, prompting tsunami warnings and evacuations in Chile and Argentina. Chilean authorities called for coastal evacuations in the Magallanes region, and Argentina took precautionary measures in Tierra del Fuego. Thousands were moved to higher ground, with no immediate reports of damage or injuries. Chilean President Gabriel Boric urged residents to follow authorities' instructions, as Chile is frequently impacted by earthquakes due to its location at the convergence of three tectonic plates.</p>

          <p>The remedies trial in the U.S. government's antitrust case against Google's advertising technology is scheduled to begin on September 22. A judge previously ruled that Google held illegal monopolies in online advertising markets, tying its publisher ad server and ad exchange together. This follows a prior ruling that Google monopolized internet search. Google is navigating antitrust challenges while also competing in the generative AI market. Google maintains that its proposed ad tech remedy addresses the court's liability decision, while the DOJ seeks further divestiture of Google's ad tech tools.</p>

          <p>Wall Street has rebounded from April's sharp sell-off, driven by optimism surrounding potential trade talks, but economic uncertainties stemming from President Trump's policies continue to weigh on investors. The S&P 500 is on track to erase losses incurred after the imposition of tariffs in early April, bolstered by a positive jobs report. While China has expressed openness to discussions, it insists on the removal of tariffs first. Despite the recent recovery, the S&P 500 remains below its February high, with ongoing concerns about the potential economic impact of tariffs.</p>

          <p>This article provides guidance on how to handle a lawsuit over unpaid debts, emphasizing that settling for less than the full amount owed is often possible, even after legal proceedings have started. It suggests negotiating directly with the creditor or debt collector, working with a debt settlement company, checking for legal defenses or procedural errors, and hiring a debt defense attorney. The article stresses the importance of acting quickly, getting any settlement agreement in writing, and ensuring the lawsuit is formally dismissed to protect one's financial and legal interests.</p>

          <p>Scientists have identified antibodies in the blood of Tim Friede, who has been injecting himself with snake venom for nearly two decades, that can neutralize the poison from cobras, mambas, and other deadly species. This discovery may pave the way for a universal antivenom, addressing a global health problem that affects millions. The researchers found that two antibodies from Mr. Freide's blood, when combined with a drug that blocks neurotoxins, protected mice from the venom of 19 deadly snake species. This marks a significant step forward in antivenom research, which has lagged behind demand despite the high number of snakebites worldwide.</p>
