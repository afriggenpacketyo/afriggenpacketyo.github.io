          <p>China has emerged as the leading foreign investor in Thailand's Eastern Economic Corridor (EEC), committing US$8.4 billion between 2019 and 2024, representing 16% of all investment in the three-province cluster. This significant backing includes plans for a light-rail line, an "aerotropolis," and potential property development, with only Thailand itself investing more. A Chinese consortium, including China Railway Construction Corporation, has also joined a Thai group to complete a 220km high-speed railway line through the corridor, a project expected to finish in five years after a pandemic-induced suspension. This substantial commitment underscores China's strategic economic engagement in Southeast Asia.</p>

Trump received a largely positive ovation from the crowd at Yankee Stadium and met with the team, where he praised star player Aaron Judge, who subsequently hit two home runs. Boone highlighted the deep emotional significance of the night for New York City and the team, underscoring the unique atmosphere created by the presidential presence during the solemn 9/11 commemoration.

          <p>Shares of SK Hynix surged over 7% to a 25-year high after the company announced the completion of its HBM4 high-bandwidth memory chip development, crucial for artificial intelligence applications. This news, alongside reports of Alibaba and Baidu deploying their own AI training chips to partly replace Nvidia's, fueled a broader rally in Asian markets. Hong Kong's Hang Seng index and mainland China's CSI 300 saw gains, with Alibaba and Baidu shares jumping significantly. Japanese and South Korean benchmarks also rose, tracking Wall Street's overnight gains driven by easing inflation pressures and expectations of U.S. interest rate cuts, bolstering investor sentiment across the region.

          <p>Amap, Alibaba Group Holding’s mapping application and direct competitor to Google Maps in mainland China, has launched an artificial intelligence-powered ranking service for destinations like restaurants and hotels. Over 40 million users tested "Amap Street Stars" on its launch day, positioning the app as a crucial entry point for offline local services within Alibaba's "super-app" strategy. This initiative directly challenges Meituan's Dianping review service, intensifying competition in the instant commerce segment. Users praised the combination of ranking and navigation features, which is a common offering from Google Maps in other markets, signifying Alibaba's latest move to expand its lifestyle service ecosystem.

          <p>This opinion article argues that the multilateral system is faltering 80 years after World War II, with the United Nations sidelined and global fragmentation increasing due to unilateral actions and trade wars. The author posits that new governance approaches are urgently needed to prevent further decline. The China-led Shanghai Cooperation Organisation (SCO) is presented as a "critical salve" for these global ailments, embodying five principles that facilitate cooperation among diverse cultures, ideologies, and political systems. The article suggests the SCO provides a platform for states to address global challenges where others, including those raising tariffs, have failed to deliver effective reforms.</p>

          <p>Child and baby nutritionist Charlotte Stirling-Reed offers five expert tips to help parents manage fussy eating, a common developmental phase affecting over half of children. She advises allowing children autonomy in choosing what they eat and when to leave the table, as this can encourage them to try new foods and reduce mealtime battles. Stirling-Reed also stresses avoiding labeling foods as "good" or "bad," instead modeling balance and variety, and prioritizing enjoyment at the dinner table. Engaging children in food preparation and exposing them to a wide range of quick, nutrient-dense foods are also recommended, along with consulting a GP for persistent concerns.</p>

          <p>Ed Sheeran's eighth album, "Play," marks a departure from his recent introspective works, aiming to create joy and explore diverse cultures after a challenging personal period. The album subtly incorporates Asian and Middle Eastern musical elements, featuring instruments like the sitar and tabla, and a duet with Indian superstar Arjit Singh on the track "Sapphire." While Sheeran made efforts to authentically engage with these cultures, some critics note that the influences are often assimilated into his mainstream pop sound, rather than deeply integrated. Despite this, the article suggests "Play" is an enjoyable record that plays to his strengths, with "Sapphire" already topping India's streaming chart.</p>

          <p>Gemini Space Station, the cryptocurrency exchange founded by Cameron and Tyler Winklevoss, reportedly priced its initial public offering (IPO) at $28 per share, exceeding its expected range and valuing the company at $3.3 billion. The strong demand led to the sale of 15.2 million shares, despite initial plans for more, and follows a recent increase in the proposed price range. Nasdaq's strategic $50 million investment in Gemini further bolstered institutional confidence, with plans to offer clients access to Gemini's custodial services. Despite widening losses reported in 2024 and 2025, the successful pricing indicates continued investor interest in crypto IPOs, even amid consolidation in major cryptocurrency prices.

          <p>Denmark's dramatic improvement in cancer survival rates over the past 25 years, now surpassing the UK, offers valuable lessons for the NHS. Once lagging, Denmark implemented a bold plan involving significant investment in diagnostic equipment like CT scanners, new national standards for rapid diagnosis and treatment, and innovative approaches such as at-home chemotherapy. The country also prioritized patient experience, with initiatives like colorful hospital environments and counselling centers. UK Health Secretary Wes Streeting acknowledges these insights are informing government plans. Experts suggest that sustained political consensus, long-term planning, and increased investment, similar to Denmark's approach, are crucial for the NHS to achieve comparable success.</p>

          <p>The legendary parody British rock band Spinal Tap is making a comeback with a sequel, "Spinal Tap II: The End Continues," more than 40 years after their original mockumentary. The film sees the band searching for a new drummer to fulfill a contractual obligation for a final gig in New Orleans, with famous musicians like Questlove and Lars Ulrich making cameo appearances. Directed by Rob Reiner, who reprises his role as filmmaker Marty DiBergi, the sequel explores the band members' lives since their tumultuous split. Early reviews are mixed, but the film continues the band's tradition of self-deprecating humor and satirical take on rock 'n' roll excesses, promising more "up to eleven" moments.</p>

          <p>South Africa's Constitutional Court has ruled that husbands are now legally permitted to take their wives' family names, overturning a discriminatory apartheid-era law. Justice Loena Theron stated the previous legislation, which only allowed women to change their surnames upon marriage, discriminated "on the grounds of gender" and was a "colonial import." The court suspended the existing Births and Deaths Registration Act, granting the government two years to amend it. This landmark decision, which upholds a lower court ruling, was prompted by two couples challenging the law, and has sparked mixed reactions on social media, with many welcoming it as a progressive step for gender equality.</p>

          <p>Stunning gains in Chinese stocks are challenging regulators to manage a measured, sustainable bull market, as Beijing seeks to position its US$12 trillion equity market as a steady source of household income. This initiative aims to support consumer spending and economic growth, while also shifting household wealth away from the property market. Regulators are reportedly pleased that recent gains have moderated, reducing the risk of volatile pump-and-dump schemes by retail investors. Analysts suggest the market is transitioning from rapid growth to a slower, more stable bull trend, indicating an ongoing uptrend despite potential increased volatility. (not investment advice)</p>
