          <p>The U.S. defense chief stated that the recent strikes on Iran were not intended to instigate regime change. This announcement follows escalating tensions in the Middle East, particularly between Israel and Iran, with the U.S. now directly involved. The statement aims to clarify the objectives of the military action, emphasizing a limited scope rather than a broader political goal. The U.S. seeks to reassure international partners and domestic audiences about its intentions in the region. Optimism that this is an isolated incident is moderate.</p>

          <p>Senator John Fetterman, D-Pa, voiced his support for President Trump's decision to attack three Iranian nuclear sites. Fetterman stated that Iran is the world‚Äôs leading sponsor of terrorism and cannot have nuclear capabilities, calling the move "correct." Trump announced the operation, targeting key nuclear sites at Fordow, Natanz, and Isfahan, and declared it a "very successful attack." The overnight strike involved bunker buster bombs and Tomahawk missiles, marking a major escalation in the Middle East. Fetterman's backing of Trump's action highlights a bipartisan consensus on addressing Iran's nuclear ambitions.</p>

          <p>The author reflects on the experience of never owning a smartphone and the changing perceptions surrounding this choice. Initially met with disbelief or disdain, the author now finds that being phoneless has become an object of fascination and envy as the costs of constant connectivity become more apparent. While acknowledging the downsides, such as missed opportunities and logistical challenges, the author argues that remaining offline has allowed for a better attention span and a greater awareness of the social changes brought about by ubiquitous smartphone use. The author observes a decline in real-world engagement and a rise in solipsism among those constantly absorbed in their devices.</p>

          <p>Exit polls suggest a tight race between Prime Minister Shigeru Ishiba's Liberal Democratic Party (LDP) and Tomin First no Kai, the regional party led by Tokyo Governor Yuriko Koike, in the Tokyo metropolitan assembly election. The election is seen as a bellwether for the upcoming House of Councillors race and a crucial test for Ishiba's minority government. Major parties actively engaged with voters through social media and street speeches, focusing on issues such as inflation, political funding scandals, and child-rearing policies.

Observers note that the decision to strike Iran expands U.S. military engagement in the Middle East, but the overall strategic objective remains centered on China's influence in the Indo-Pacific.
