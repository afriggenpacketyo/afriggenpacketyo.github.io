          <div class="timestamp">2025-05-26 08:33:00 EDT</div>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>This article explores the complex factors that contribute to the development of sexual orientation, highlighting that it is not a choice but rather a result of biological and psychosocial influences during puberty. Experts emphasize that no single factor determines a person's sexual orientation, but rather a combination of genetic makeup, hormones, and social factors play a role. The article underscores that sexual orientation is stable throughout life, and attempts to change it through conversion therapies have been unsuccessful. The piece also stresses the importance of societal acceptance and unbiased discussions about sexual diversity to support individuals' self-esteem and mental health. The article concludes that no sexual orientation is a disease or unnatural, as social norms dictate tolerance and acceptance.</p>

          <p>Team USA flag football player Darrell Doucette III is advocating for current national team members to have the opportunity to compete for Olympic roster spots alongside NFL players when flag football debuts at the 2028 Los Angeles Games. Doucette emphasizes the dedication and hard work of existing flag football players who have elevated the sport, and he welcomes competition while asserting the team's current ability to win gold. He believes the team is already the best at the sport and doesn't necessarily need NFL players, but he is open to competition. Doucette previously stated that he believes he is better than Patrick Mahomes at flag football due to his high IQ of the game.</p>

          <p>Southwest Airlines is ending its long-standing policy of allowing two free checked bags, marking a significant change for the company. Starting Wednesday, customers will be charged to check bags for the first time in over half a century, aligning with industry standards where baggage fees are a substantial revenue source. This decision coincides with other major changes, including the introduction of basic-economy tickets and the elimination of open seating. The airline has not yet announced the specific fees for checked bags, but rivals typically charge around $35 to $40 for the first checked bag on domestic flights.</p>
