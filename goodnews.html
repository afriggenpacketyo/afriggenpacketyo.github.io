          <p>Following a dip caused by a weaker-than-expected labor report, the stock market experienced a significant rebound, which CNBC's Jim Cramer attributes to the impressive earnings from major technology companies. He points to the "Magnificent Seven" stocks, including Microsoft, Meta, and Alphabet, as the foundation of the market's resilience, citing their flawless reports, massive user engagement, and strong growth across various divisions. Cramer suggests that the financial strength and diverse revenue streams of these tech giants make them a formidable force, capable of propping up the market even amidst wider economic concerns.

          <p>Following a tragic family murder-suicide involving a legally held firearm, a bereaved woman's campaign has led to tighter gun control laws in the UK. The new regulations, which have now come into force, increase the number of character references required for a shotgun certificate application and mandate more thorough police checks for domestic abuse and dishonesty. The campaigner, Emma Ambler, whose twin sister and two nieces were killed, expressed hope that these changes will prevent similar tragedies. The government has indicated it plans to strengthen the guidance even further in the future.</p>

          <p>A Maryland psychiatrist, Dr. Lisa Carchedi, donated a kidney to her older sister, Gina Warsaw, who was suffering from debilitating kidney failure. The successful transplant surgery was performed using a minimally invasive, single-port robotic technique at the University of Maryland Medical Center, which speeds up recovery time for the donor. The sisters, who share a close bond, performed the procedure on the anniversary of their father's death, honoring his belief in family. The life-saving gift has given Warsaw a new chance at life and allowed her to return to spending time with her grandchildren.</p>

Key victories include blocking a freeze on federal funding and protecting funds for transportation, education, and healthcare, demonstrating the financial impact of the state's legal resistance strategy.</p>

          <p>The southern Chinese province of Hainan is positioning itself to attract a surge in medical tourism, setting a goal of 1.5 million annual visitors by 2027. This strategic push coincides with South Korea's decision to eliminate value-added tax refunds for foreign tourists seeking cosmetic surgery, potentially diminishing its appeal as a top destination. Hainan plans to leverage this opportunity by fast-tracking approvals for innovative international drugs and medical devices, aiming to capture a larger share of the lucrative medical travel market and reverse the outflow of overseas medical spending.</p>

          <p>New guidance from the UK's National Institute for Health and Care Excellence (NICE) advises that patients stopping obesity medications like Wegovy and Mounjaro should receive at least a year of follow-up support. This recommendation addresses concerns that patients often regain a significant portion of their lost weight after treatment ends. The advice emphasizes that weight management is a long-term process, not a short-term fix, requiring structured plans that include healthy eating, physical activity, and behavioral support to maintain weight loss successfully.</p>

          <p>President Trump is set to sign an executive order creating a White House task force dedicated to ensuring security for the 2028 Olympic and Paralympic Games in Los Angeles.

          <p>Following the recent large downward revision of U.S. jobs numbers, which prompted President Trump to fire the Bureau of Labor Statistics (BLS) commissioner, experts are clarifying that such revisions are a normal part of the process. The BLS releases preliminary data for timeliness and then updates the figures as more survey responses from businesses and households are collected. While the recent 258,000-job downward revision for May and June was large, former officials stress it is not evidence of miscalculation or bias, but a refinement of initial estimates with more complete information.

          <p>A new pilot agreement between the United Kingdom and France, designed to curb small boat crossings in the Channel, has officially come into force. The "one-in, one-out" scheme will allow the UK to detain and return some migrants arriving illegally by boat to France. In return, the UK will accept an equivalent number of asylum seekers directly from France, provided they meet specific eligibility and security criteria. Prime Minister Keir Starmer described the plan as a result of "grown-up diplomacy," though critics argue it will not be as effective as previous proposals.</p>
