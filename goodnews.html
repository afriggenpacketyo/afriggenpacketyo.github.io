          <p>Nigeria's GDP grew by 3.4% in 2024, marking its highest growth rate in ten years, driven by recovery in the oil and gas sector and strong performance in tech and finance. The World Bank's report highlights the positive impact of President Bola Tinubu's reforms, including the removal of petrol subsidies and currency devaluation. However, the agriculture sector faces challenges due to insecurity and high input costs, contributing to ongoing food price inflation. Despite the economic growth, poverty remains high, with nearly half the population living in poverty, and inflation is expected to remain above 20% this year. The article also mentions the International Monetary Fund (IMF)'s praise for the reforms and warning about high poverty levels.</p>

          <p>Experts and doctors are debating who should be prescribed GLP-1 weight-loss drugs, considering factors beyond just weight. While the drugs are effective, they are expensive, often not covered by insurance, and can cause side effects. The focus should be on improving overall health, particularly reducing visceral fat, which is linked to various chronic diseases. Doctors need better ways to identify individuals with excess visceral fat, as BMI is not a reliable measure. The article emphasizes the importance of determining the long-term effects and safety of these drugs, especially since most people take them for less than a year.</p>

          <p>Scientists are in a global race to discover why the Universe exists, with teams in the US and Japan building detectors to study neutrinos. The current theories of astronomy can't explain why matter and antimatter didn't cancel each other out after the Big Bang.
