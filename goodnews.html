        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>A study reveals that nearly half of Japanese workers in their 20s are "quiet quitting," prioritizing personal time and work-life balance over career advancement and higher pay, a stark contrast to previous generations. Many young Japanese workers have witnessed their parents sacrifice their lives for their companies, working excessive overtime and neglecting their personal lives, which has motivated them to seek a different path. This shift is also influenced by the pandemic, which prompted some to re-evaluate their priorities and question the concept of lifetime commitment to a single company. Experts view this change positively, suggesting it could lead to a healthier economy and address the country's shrinking population.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>The Los Angeles Dodgers persevered against the New York Mets in a 13-inning marathon, winning 7-5, but the game highlighted ongoing concerns about the team's pitching depth. A rain delay shortened Clayton Kershaw's start, and the bullpen was stretched thin, with nearly every reliever used. Despite holding a lead, closer Tanner Scott blew a save in the ninth, forcing extra innings. Teoscar Hern√°ndez's RBI double in the 13th ultimately secured the win for the Dodgers, but the team faces potential consequences from overusing its pitching staff during a demanding stretch of the season.</p>

          <p>Japan's new farm minister, Shinjiro Koizumi, plans to sell government stockpiled rice directly to retailers, aiming to lower prices to 2,000 yen per 5 kilograms amid soaring costs for consumers. The reserve rice is expected to be available in stores as early as June, addressing criticism that the government has failed to curb rising rice prices. Koizumi aims to bypass auctions that have prevented government control over prices, potentially exploring online sales to ensure broad distribution. The move comes as average rice prices in Japanese supermarkets reached a record high, doubling last year's level.</p>

          <p>Hong Kong's financial system is crucial for China to advance the internationalization of the yuan, also known as the renminbi (RMB), amid geopolitical tensions and discussions on de-dollarisation. Businesses in Qatar are keen to take advantage of the yuan by using a "toolbox" available in Hong Kong, such as settlement, payment, hedging and swaps. This trend showcases that the US‚Äô trade war has spilled over to the financial market, prompting more countries and businesses to consider alternatives to the dominant US dollar in international trades, payments and investments. This urgency to ‚Äúde-dollarise‚Äù dovetails with China‚Äôs effort to internationalise its currency, a strategy that dates back to the 2008 financial crisis.</p>

These clinics will be open to walk-in patients as well as those referred by GPs and police, with specialist staff present to treat people in acute mental distress. However, Andy Bell, the CEO of the Centre for Mental Health, is sceptical of the scheme because it is untested and calls for better funding of NHS mental health services. A recent study found that the number of people waiting 12 hours or more in A&E after a decision to admit to a ward was the highest since modern records began.</p>

Ha emphasizes that technology and AI are crucial for bolstering information technology infrastructure and cybersecurity, and that the US has become more US-centric, there is a potential for AI to become "a bargaining chip for other countries," if its services and models are so powerful.</p>

          <p>With the UK set to ban disposable vapes starting June 1st, many vapers are stockpiling the products before they become illegal to sell. The ban is intended to reduce environmental impact and curb youth vaping. However, some former smokers say disposable vapes helped them quit cigarettes, and they worry about the transition to rechargeable devices. Some retailers have seen sales of popular vape flavors double in recent weeks, while others fear the ban will drive customers back to smoking cigarettes. The government hopes reusable vapes will continue to offer a healthier alternative to cigarettes, but others argue environmental concerns are trumping public health concerns.</p>

          <p>Karan Kandhari's "Sister Midnight" is a gritty comedy about Uma, a restless housewife in Mumbai, who embarks on a series of nocturnal adventures. The film explores Uma's urban malaise and her hidden strength. Though the movie ultimately can‚Äôt square its episodic unpredictability with the bubbling feminist-outlaw energy at its core, that‚Äôs less a bug than a feature. Kandhari captures a pulpy mood of big-city dislocation, building a trippy, jarring and blackly funny experience out of a city‚Äôs stray colors, sounds and personalities.</p>

          <p>China has approved a mega-project to construct a 767-kilometer-long canal linking the inland province of Jiangxi to the coastal province of Zhejiang. The Jiangxi-Zhejiang Canal is expected to become the most expensive artificial canal ever built in China, with an estimated investment of 320 billion yuan. The project is part of a broader effort to lower logistical costs and integrate less-developed inland regions with wealthier coastal hubs. Once operational, it could handle around 25 million tonnes of cargo annually.</p>

          <p>The European Union's trade chief has called for a trade deal with the U.S. based on "respect" rather than "threats" following President Trump's threat to impose a 50% tariff on all goods sent to the United States from the EU. EU Trade Commissioner Maros Sefcovic stated that the EU is committed to securing a deal that works for both sides and is ready to defend its interests. European governments have warned that higher tariffs would be damaging to both sides, with Ireland's Taoiseach calling negotiations the best way forward.</p>
