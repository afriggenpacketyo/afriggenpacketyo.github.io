        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>The UK government has announced new plans for food businesses in England to voluntarily make healthy food options more accessible and appealing to customers. Under this partnership, supermarkets and manufacturers will decide on their own methods, such as promotions or loyalty point incentives for healthier products, to help tackle rising obesity rates. While the industry and health groups have welcomed the focus on corporate responsibility, some experts caution that its voluntary nature and exclusion of many takeaways and convenience shops may limit its overall impact.</p>

        </div>
        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>As a heatwave impacts the UK, this article explains the "urban heat island effect," the phenomenon causing cities to be significantly warmer than surrounding rural areas. The primary cause is the prevalence of dark, hard surfaces like asphalt and concrete, which absorb and retain the sun's heat, releasing it slowly and elevating temperatures, especially overnight. In contrast, rural landscapes with more vegetation and water benefit from natural cooling through evaporation. With global temperatures rising, this effect makes growing urban populations increasingly vulnerable to the dangers of extreme heat.</p>

          <p>A new pilot program in Kent, England, is teaching primary school children as young as five about sun safety to help reduce future cases of skin cancer. The initiative, planned for a nationwide rollout, educates students on UV levels, proper sunscreen application, and the risks of sun exposure, as sunburn in childhood significantly increases the risk of melanoma later in life. Health experts and cancer charities are backing the project, emphasizing that prevention and early education are critical as melanoma diagnoses are projected to rise in the coming years.</p>

The rocket, developed by Mitsubishi Heavy Industries and JAXA, lifted off from Tanegashima Island, placing a government climate-monitoring satellite into orbit. The H2A series, which had a 98% success rate, is now being succeeded by the more cost-effective H3 rocket, positioning Japan to compete in the increasingly crowded commercial satellite-launch market dominated by companies like SpaceX.</p>

          <p>An estimated crowd of over 100,000 people participated in the Budapest Pride march, turning the event into a massive demonstration for human rights and a clear message to Prime Minister Viktor Orban's government. The government had attempted to ban the march, citing a controversial law that equates homosexuality with pedophilia, but the city's mayor, Gergely Karacsony, enabled it to proceed as a council-organized event. The large turnout, significantly higher than last year, was seen by many as a powerful and peaceful act of defiance against the government's restrictive policies.</p>
