          <p>JPMorgan Chase announced second-quarter financial results that exceeded Wall Street's forecasts, largely due to better-than-expected revenue from its fixed income trading and investment banking operations. The bank reported earnings of $5.24 per share on revenue of $45.68 billion, outperforming estimates. While net income fell compared to the prior year, which was inflated by a one-time gain, the core performance was strong. CEO Jamie Dimon commented on the U.S. economy's resilience but cautioned about significant ongoing risks, including trade tariffs and geopolitical instability, providing a cautiously optimistic outlook.

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>The UK government has launched a new scheme offering drivers discounts of up to £3,750 on the purchase of new electric cars to accelerate the shift from petrol and diesel vehicles. The grants, part of a £650 million program, will apply to eligible models costing up to £37,000. While the government and some industry figures welcome the move to make EVs more affordable, critics and some consumers point to the significant lack of public charging infrastructure as a major barrier to adoption. The policy aims to support the UK's goal of banning new petrol and diesel car sales by 2030, but faces debate over its effectiveness and timing.</p>

          <p>Los Angeles Dodgers manager Dave Roberts, who is managing the National League team for the fourth time, shared his relaxed approach to the MLB All-Star Game festivities. He views the event as an opportunity for the sport's best players to enjoy themselves without the pressure of a regular-season game. Roberts commented on his own players, including Shohei Ohtani and Freddie Freeman, noting the break is beneficial for them despite the media attention. He emphasized that the game is a celebration of accomplishment for the players, allowing them to connect and appreciate the moment before the competitive second half of the season begins.</p>

          <p>Chinese President Xi Jinping and Australian Prime Minister Anthony Albanese have hailed a significant improvement in relations between their two countries during Albanese's visit to Beijing. President Xi stated that the relationship has "turned around" after overcoming previous "setbacks," emphasizing the importance of mutual respect and cooperation. Albanese echoed these sentiments, welcoming the opportunity to seek common ground while acknowledging differences. This diplomatic warming follows years of strained ties and is seen as a crucial step in stabilizing economic and political engagement, particularly as both nations navigate a complex global landscape and China seeks to strengthen ties with U.S. allies.</p>

          <p>The BBC's annual report has revealed that former "Match of the Day" host Gary Lineker was the corporation's top-earning presenter for the eighth year in a row, with a salary between £1,350,000 and £1,354,999. Radio 2 host Zoe Ball was the second-highest earner. The report was released amid confirmations of staff dismissals following a review into the BBC's workplace culture and recent findings against presenter Gregg Wallace. The data also showed a slight decline in the number of households paying the licence fee, though the BBC's impartiality and accuracy ratings saw a small increase among UK adults.</p>

          <p>An ocean exploration team has discovered the wreck of the Teruzuki, a Japanese destroyer sunk during a pivotal World War II battle off the Solomon Islands in 1942. The vessel was found over 2,600 feet below the surface by the Ocean Exploration Trust's E/V Nautilus, remarkably with unused depth charges still intact. The Teruzuki was a formidable ship that had played a key role in sinking and damaging several U.S. warships before it was torpedoed by American PT boats. The discovery in the historic Iron Bottom Sound provides a new glimpse into naval warfare history, as no historical images of the ship exist.</p>

          <p>China's economy expanded by 5.2% year-on-year in the second quarter of 2025, according to official data, a pace that keeps it on track to meet the government's annual growth target of around 5%. The growth was partly supported by government stimulus measures and a temporary pause in trade war escalations with the U.S., which allowed for a surge in exports. However, analysts warn this growth may not be sustainable, citing persistent challenges such as weak consumer confidence, falling prices, and a deepening crisis in the property sector that continues to drag on the economy.

          <p>Tesla has officially entered the Indian market, launching its Model Y electric SUV with a starting price of approximately $70,000, significantly higher than in other major markets. The high price is largely attributed to India's steep import tariffs and luxury taxes, positioning the vehicle in the premium segment against brands like BMW rather than mass-market EVs. Experts suggest this initial launch, coinciding with the opening of Tesla's first showroom in Mumbai, is a strategic move to "test the waters" rather than a push for high sales volume. The company's future pricing and manufacturing decisions in India will likely depend on potential policy changes.</p>
