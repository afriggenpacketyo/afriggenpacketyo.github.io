          <p>Audra McDonald's performance as Rose in the Broadway revival of "Gypsy" is generating significant acclaim, particularly for her rendition of "Rose's Turn." The article describes McDonald's portrayal as a transformative experience that reinterprets the character's motivations and vulnerabilities. Director George C. Wolfe notes that McDonald strips away layers of the character, revealing a deeper sense of rage, sorrow, and abandonment. The performance incorporates elements from Tony Kushner's "Angels in America" and explores Rose's complex relationship with her own mother.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Despite signs of economic improvement, such as easing inflation and a steady job market, credit card debt forgiveness remains a viable option for many Americans struggling with high-interest balances. The article highlights that the cost of carrying credit card debt remains high, and debt forgiveness can offer targeted relief. It advises that debt forgiveness may be suitable for those whose debt feels unmanageable, are falling behind on payments, have access to a lump sum, or have exhausted other options like balance transfers. The article concludes that debt forgiveness can be a useful tool, but it comes with trade-offs like a hit to credit and potential tax liability. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>The Los Angeles Dodgers are trying to find a solution to Roki Sasaki's declining fastball velocity, a key component of his game. After initial success in Japan where he hit 100 mph, Sasaki's fastball velocity has since dropped, averaging 96 mph and sometimes dipping to 92-93 mph. The lack of velocity impacts the effectiveness of his fastball, as it lacks spin and vertical break. Coaches are working with Sasaki to identify the root cause and improve his command and pitch conviction.</p>
