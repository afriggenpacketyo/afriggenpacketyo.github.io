          <p>The Philadelphia Phillies baseball team joined in on a viral meme, appearing to reference the recent controversy involving the CEO of the tech company Astronomer. During the stadium's "kiss cam" segment, the jumbotron played a Coldplay song, alluding to a video where the CEO was allegedly seen embracing the company's HR chief at a recent concert. The moment, which sparked an internal investigation at Astronomer, has become a widespread cultural reference, with multiple sports teams and brands making jokes about the incident.

          <p>President Trump announced that ten more hostages held in Gaza are expected to be released "very shortly" as his administration continues to push for a 60-day ceasefire between Israel and Hamas. The proposed deal reportedly includes the return of these ten living hostages and the remains of eighteen others in exchange for Israel releasing an unspecified number of Palestinian prisoners. This development follows a recent visit by Israel's Mossad director to Washington to discuss the conflict and a White House meeting where Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu nominated Trump for a Nobel Peace Prize for his efforts.</p>

          <p>Retired Marine Cpl. Scott Harrison, who endured the Vietnam War, has brought to life a vision that helped him survive: a carousel in a mountain meadow. During the war, a music box from his sister inspired daydreams of this peaceful scene, providing a mental escape from the brutality. After struggling with PTSD for years, Harrison began building the Carousel of Happiness in Nederland, Colorado, in 1986, hand-carving its animals over 26 years. Now a nonprofit, the carousel has delighted over a million visitors and provided Harrison with a profound sense of healing and purpose.</p>

          <p>President Trump has signed the GENIUS Act into law, establishing the first major regulatory framework for cryptocurrency in the United States, specifically targeting the $250 billion stablecoin market. The legislation provides consumer protections and clear definitions for stablecoins, which are pegged to assets like the U.S. dollar to reduce volatility. Supporters, including major crypto firms, believe the act will facilitate faster, lower-cost transactions and allow banks and credit unions to issue their own stablecoins. The bill's passage is seen as a significant step toward integrating digital currencies into the mainstream financial system. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>President Trump has been diagnosed with chronic venous insufficiency (CVI) after experiencing mild swelling in his lower legs, according to his White House physician. The condition, described as benign and common in older adults, occurs when leg veins struggle to send blood back to the heart, causing it to pool. Dr. Sean P. Barbabella stated that medical evaluations, including ultrasounds, confirmed the CVI diagnosis but found no signs of more serious issues like blood clots, declaring the president to be in "excellent health." Treatment for mild cases typically involves lifestyle changes like exercise and wearing compression stockings.</p>

          <p>Following an order from President Trump, the Department of Justice has formally requested that a court unseal grand jury transcripts related to the federal investigations of Jeffrey Epstein. The move comes amid intense public and political pressure for greater transparency after the administration initially stated no further files would be released. The court filing cites significant public interest and the administration's commitment to transparency as the reason for the request. The DOJ will work to redact personal and victim-related information before any potential release, which ultimately requires a judge's approval.</p>

          <p>The "California Forever" project, a controversial plan by Silicon Valley billionaires to build a new city in Solano County, has announced its intention to create a 2,100-acre manufacturing hub. Dubbed the "Solano Foundry," the site would aim to attract companies in defense, aerospace, robotics, and other advanced industries, with the goal of creating over 35,000 jobs. The project's CEO, Jan Sramek, pitched the plan as a way to bring high-tech manufacturing back to the state. However, the project continues to face skepticism from local residents and community groups concerned about its impact on farmland and existing communities.</p>

The previous system involved U.S.-based "digital escorts" supervising the overseas work, a practice critics warned could create cybersecurity vulnerabilities. The move affects Microsoft's Azure division, a significant source of the company's revenue from government contracts.</p>

          <p>Experts report that the United Kingdom is experiencing a significant increase in its wasp population this summer, likely due to a very warm and dry spring creating ideal breeding conditions. While many of the UK's 9,000 wasp species are solitary, the more noticeable social wasps are thriving, leading to more human interactions. Entomologists emphasize the ecological importance of wasps as apex predators and natural pest controllers, urging the public to coexist with them. They note that while wasps can be a nuisance, they play a vital role in the ecosystem.</p>

          <p>A new stage show in Liverpool, "The Legend of Rooney's Ring," has transformed the life of football star Wayne Rooney and his wife Coleen into a fantasy spoof inspired by "The Lord of the Rings." Written by a co-creator of the sitcom "Motherland," the play draws on a tabloid story from 2004 about Coleen's allegedly discarded engagement ring. The writer emphasizes that the show is an affectionate homage rather than a critique, celebrating the couple as heroic figures. The production is characteristic of Liverpool's Royal Court theatre, which focuses on original, locally relevant comedies.</p>

RSV is a highly infectious virus that is a leading cause of hospitalization in young children.

          <p>A remarkable story from two decades ago is being revisited, recounting how a 12-year-old girl in Ethiopia was rescued from kidnappers by a pride of lions. In June 2005, the girl had been abducted by men intending to force her into marriage and was missing for a week. A pride of three lions reportedly chased the men away and then stood guard over the terrified girl until she was found by authorities. Wildlife experts at the time speculated that the girl's whimpering may have mimicked the sound of a lion cub, preventing the lions from attacking her.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Scientists have discovered a specific interaction between a gut bacteria byproduct and a genetic variant that can trigger the inflammatory response seen in ulcerative colitis. The study found that in people with a faulty version of the OTUD3 gene, a molecule produced by certain bacteria overactivates an immune protein called STING, leading to chronic inflammation in the colon. This finding helps explain the unpredictable nature of the disease and why treatments vary in effectiveness among patients. The research could pave the way for more precise, personalized therapies targeting this specific inflammatory pathway.</p>
