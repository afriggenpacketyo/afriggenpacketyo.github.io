          <p>Elon Musk announced his impending departure from his role as a "special government employee" overseeing the Department of Government Efficiency (DOGE) within the Trump administration. Musk stated his mission to reduce wasteful spending has been successful, claiming to have cut around $160 billion, although some reports dispute this figure. His departure comes after criticisms of a budget bill backed by Trump, which Musk believes undermines DOGE's work. Musk's focus will now shift back to his companies, particularly Tesla, after some investors expressed concerns about his divided attention. The White House intends to make some of DOGE's cuts permanent through congressional action. </p>

The fracture grew over time, eventually causing the pin to break during landing. All 112 passengers and crew members deplaned safely without injury, despite substantial damage to the aircraft. </p>

          <p>England midfielder Ella Toone revealed that she didn't properly grieve after her father's death until a calf injury forced her to step away from football. Her father, Nick Toone, passed away in September 2024, shortly after the Lionesses' Euro 2022 win. Toone said she played on after his death but wasn't enjoying the game as much as she should have been. The injury allowed her to focus on herself, speak to a counselor, and spend time with her partner, ultimately helping her to grieve and regain her love for the game. </p>
