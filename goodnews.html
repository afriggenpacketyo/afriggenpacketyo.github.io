          <p>Hundreds of thousands gathered in Tel Aviv, expressing gratitude to Donald Trump for his perceived role in the Gaza ceasefire and hostage release deal. US special envoy Steve Witkoff confirmed hostages are returning, while Palestinian officials reported 500,000 people had moved back to northern Gaza. An upcoming summit in Egypt, attended by multiple leaders including Trump, aims to finalize the war's end. The ceasefire agreement mandates Hamas release 48 remaining hostages by Monday morning, a process confirmed by a top Hamas official.</p>

          <p>Kenya has converted its US$5 billion Chinese railway loans to Chinese yuan, a move expected to save US$215 million annually in debt-servicing costs. Analysts suggest this decision could pave the way for other debt-stressed African nations to align more closely with China. The original loans from China Exim Bank in 2014-2015 funded the Standard Gauge Railway. While new terms were not fully disclosed, the deal is anticipated to halve interest rates from the previous 6.37% under the dollar-denominated agreement. (not investment advice)</p>

The Trojans' defense also showed significant improvement, stifling Michigan's offense and holding their star quarterback to limited yardage.

          <p>Shohei Ohtani's poor performance in the NL Division Series, where he went one for 18 with nine strikeouts, raises concerns for the Dodgers heading into the NLCS. Manager Dave Roberts acknowledged that Ohtani's "at-bat quality needs to get better," particularly against left-handed pitching. While Ohtani attributed some struggles to tough opposition, Roberts emphasized the need for self-reflection and adjustment to his approach. The Dodgers' World Series aspirations depend significantly on their $700-million superstar regaining his form at the plate.</p>

Concerns include the lack of monitoring for humane killing and data on euthanized joeys. The ban will also cover kangaroo skins used in products like sports shoes, extending beyond food sales.</p>

          <p>The clocks in the UK will revert to Greenwich Mean Time (GMT) on Sunday, October 26, marking the end of British Summer Time (BST). This annual shift, which gives most people an extra hour, has been a tradition for over a century since Germany first adopted Daylight Saving Time in 1916. While some argue for permanent BST to boost productivity and reduce accidents, critics point to gloomier winter mornings, particularly in Scotland, as a major drawback, reigniting a perennial debate.</p>

          <p>Britain is experiencing a surge in common colds, flu, and Covid-19, leading to widespread illness. Experts attribute this to increased indoor mixing as children return to school and adults to work, creating ideal conditions for respiratory viruses. While Rhinovirus (common cold) is currently most prevalent, Covid-19 variants and an early uptick in flu cases are also circulating. Public health officials advise vaccination for eligible individuals and basic hygiene, noting that current illness levels are not unusually high but emphasize protecting vulnerable populations.</p>
