          <p>China's Communist Party membership reached 100.27 million by the end of 2024, marking a 1.1% increase from the previous year, though this growth rate has slowed. The data, released before the party's founding anniversary, confirms its status as the world's second-largest political party by membership, after India's BJP. Unlike looser affiliations in Western parties, members in China are subject to strict regulations, including mandatory fees of up to 2% of their monthly income and regular attendance at party meetings. This structure ensures a high level of commitment and organizational control.</p>

          <p>A same-sex partnership system, first introduced in Tokyo's Shibuya Ward in 2015, has expanded significantly and is now available to 92.5% of Japan's population. A recent survey shows that 530 local governments have implemented the system, with nearly 10,000 couples registered. Despite this progress, Japan remains the only G7 nation that has not legalized same-sex marriage, meaning these partnership certificates are not legally binding. Consequently, couples lack crucial rights such as inheritance, co-parenting, and medical decision-making abilities enjoyed by married heterosexual couples.</p>

          <p>A new trade agreement between the United Kingdom and the United States has officially commenced, providing preferential tariffs for British industries. The deal allows the first 100,000 UK-made cars to be sold in the US with a 10% tariff, a significant reduction, and eliminates tariffs on the UK aerospace sector entirely. However, a major point of contention remains, as UK steel and aluminum exports are still subject to a 25% tariff, which could double if a separate agreement is not reached by a July 9 deadline. The uncertainty is causing a "massive headache" for UK steel producers who ship to the US.</p>

Data from the Major Cities Chiefs Association shows cities like Philadelphia, Minneapolis, and New York City saw significant decreases in homicides in early 2025 after increasing their police budgets in 2024. A spokesperson for the National Police Association stated that the trend demonstrates that Americans are rejecting policies that reduce police resources.

          <p>In a recent interview, U.S. President Donald Trump stated he has assembled a group of "very wealthy people" who are ready to buy the social media platform TikTok. Trump said he could reveal their identities in about two weeks and suggested that Chinese President Xi Jinping would likely approve such a deal. The fate of TikTok in the U.S. has been uncertain since a 2024 law mandated its Chinese owner, ByteDance, divest from the platform or face a ban. Trump has repeatedly extended the divestiture deadline, maintaining he wants the app to continue operating under new ownership.</p>

          <h2>Cumbrian Family Wins Six-Month Battle for Refund on Snowless Lapland Holiday</h2>

          <p>A family from Cumbria has successfully received a ¬£3,500 refund from tour operator Tui for a "dream" trip to Lapland that had no snow. The family had booked the trip last December, but a lack of snow meant all the key winter activities, such as husky and reindeer rides, were cancelled. Tui initially refused a full refund, but an independent adjudicator ruled in the family's favor. The adjudicator found that the essential purpose of the holiday was defeated and that Tui had not complied with its own "no snow" policy, which the family had inquired about before departure.</p>

          <h2>China Partially Lifts Ban on Japanese Seafood, Raising Hopes for Diplomatic Reset</h2>

          <p>China has announced it will "conditionally" resume imports of seafood from some regions of Japan, partially lifting a blanket ban imposed in 2023. The ban was a response to Japan's release of treated wastewater from the damaged Fukushima nuclear power plant. The new measure allows imports of aquatic products from most of Japan but maintains the prohibition on shipments from 10 prefectures, including Fukushima and Tokyo. This move is seen as a potential step toward easing diplomatic tensions between the two Asian powers, which have been strained over the issue.</p>
