          <p>Nvidia will sell over 18,000 of its advanced artificial intelligence chips to Saudi Arabian company Humain, according to CEO Jensen Huang. The announcement was made at the Saudi-U.S. Investment Forum in Riyadh, as part of a White House-led trip to the region. The Blackwell chips will be used in a 500 megawatt data center in Saudi Arabia, with the first deployment using GB300 Blackwell chips. This deal highlights the importance of Nvidia's chips in the global race for AI technology.</p>

          <p>The White House announced that the de minimis tariff rate on low-value parcels from China will be reduced to 54% from 120%, following an agreement with Beijing. This reverses a previous move to eliminate the low-value parcel exemption, which had allowed Chinese e-commerce firms to ship goods to the U.S. duty-free. The U.S. will also lower its maximum tariff rate on Chinese imports from 145% to 30% for a 90-day period. This change impacts companies like Shein and Temu, with Temu already transitioning to a local fulfillment model to avoid tariffs.</p>

          <p>Pandora, the world's largest jewelry company, faces potential financial strain due to President Trump's proposed tariffs on goods from Thailand and Vietnam, where the company manufactures its products. CEO Alexander Lacik is considering raising prices globally or solely in the U.S. to offset potential costs, which could reach $135 million annually. The company is also streamlining its supply chain by rerouting shipments to Canada and Latin America. Despite the challenges, Pandora is not panicking and is prepared to adapt to the uncertain trade landscape, having previously mitigated risks by ceasing sourcing from China after earlier tariff increases.</p>
