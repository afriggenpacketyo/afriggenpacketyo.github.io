          <p>Ronan, a 15-year-old California sea lion, has reaffirmed her exceptional rhythmic abilities in a new study, demonstrating her ability to move to a beat better than humans. Researchers at New College of Florida tested Ronan's ability to synchronize with percussion beats at varying tempos, confirming her unique talent for recognizing and responding to rhythms. This research reinforces the idea that the ability to recognize a beat is not exclusive to humans and vocal-learning animals. Ronan's performance highlights the complex cognitive abilities of sea lions and challenges previous assumptions about animal musicality.</p>

          <p>Reform UK has emerged as a significant force in British politics, achieving sweeping election wins and challenging the dominance of the Conservative and Labour parties. The party performed strongly in areas that heavily supported Brexit and has gained control of several councils.

While the Liberal Democrats and Greens also made gains, Reform's performance signals a potential shift in the British political landscape, raising questions about the future of traditional party dominance.</p>

          <p>Disney Imagineers are defending their upcoming Disneyland attraction, "Walt Disney ‚Äî A Magical Life," which features a lifelike animatronic of Walt Disney. The project aims to capture Disney's essence and story using advanced technology. Concerns have been raised about the ethics of representing the deceased, especially after criticism from Disney's granddaughter. Imagineers emphasize the importance of Disney's story and their commitment to a faithful and theatrical presentation. The animatronic is designed to be highly accurate, reflecting Disney's appearance and mannerisms in 1963, and will feature dialogue taken directly from his speeches.</p>

          <p>Harvard University has enlisted a team of prominent conservative lawyers, some with ties to Supreme Court justices and former President Trump, to represent the university in a lawsuit against the government. This strategic move is a departure from Harvard's previous legal approach and is aimed at navigating the current legal landscape. The university faces a significant threat to its federal funding after refusing to comply with administration demands, including eliminating professors deemed too activist and banning international students opposing "American values". Legal experts suggest this approach could enhance Harvard's chances in a Supreme Court with a conservative majority.</p>
