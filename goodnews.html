          <p>Astronomers have discovered faint, ancient radio signals originating from a distant galaxy cluster known as SpARCS1049, which took 10 billion years to reach Earth. The signals emanate from a "mini-halo," a vast cloud of high-energy particles and magnetic fields, which has never been detected so deep in space before. This finding suggests that the processes creating these energetic particles, such as supermassive black holes or cosmic particle collisions, have been shaping galaxy clusters for nearly the entire history of the universe. The discovery opens a new window into understanding how the early universe grew and evolved.</p>

          <p>Shohei Ohtani showcased his best pitching performance of the season, throwing two sharp innings for the Los Angeles Dodgers in their 9-5 loss to the Kansas City Royals. The two-way star reached a career-high velocity of 101.7 mph and effectively mixed his pitches, allowing only one hit and one walk over 27 pitches. Despite Ohtani's impressive outing, the Dodgers' bullpen struggled, with bulk reliever Ben Casparius giving up six runs. The loss snapped the Dodgers' five-game winning streak, but Ohtani's continued progress on the mound remains a significant positive development as he returns from Tommy John surgery.</p>

          <p>According to computer scientist Harry Shum, former head of AI at Microsoft, China is rapidly catching up to the United States in the field of AI algorithms, even as it lags significantly in advanced chip technology. Speaking at a summit, Shum noted that while the US maintains a clear lead in AI chips, a gap that could take years to close, China is making significant strides in algorithm engineering. He highlighted Chinese start-up DeepSeek, which has achieved results comparable to top US competitors like OpenAI using a fraction of the computing power, as a prime example of this progress.</p>

          <p>A 20-year-old woman sustained minor injuries after being bitten by what officials believe was a juvenile shark at Jones Beach State Park on Long Island, New York. The woman was in waist-deep water when the incident occurred, resulting in non-life-threatening cuts to her leg and foot. While the woman did not see what bit her, experts who analyzed photos of the wounds concluded they were most likely from a juvenile sand tiger shark. Following the incident, swimming was temporarily suspended, but resumed the next day after drone and lifeguard surveillance found no further threats.</p>

          <p>The S&P 500 and Nasdaq achieved record highs this week, demonstrating resilience despite initial fears over the US-Iran conflict. The market's positive performance was largely driven by a rapid decrease in oil prices after a brief surge, which eased concerns about inflation and consumer spending. Investors are also increasingly anticipating three Federal Reserve rate cuts by the end of the year, further boosting market sentiment. Friday's Personal Consumption Expenditures (PCE) report showed core inflation slightly higher than expected, which could influence future Fed decisions. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>A new genetic study of skeletons from the 9,000-year-old city of √áatalh√∂y√ºk in Turkey suggests it may have been a matriarchal society. Researchers analyzed DNA from over 130 individuals buried under the city's houses and found that genetic connections within households were primarily traced through the female line. This indicates that upon marriage, men likely moved into their wives' households, and female offspring remained in their birth homes. The findings, which also show preferential treatment for females in grave goods, challenge traditional assumptions about patrilineal structures in ancient societies.</p>

This aggressive recruiting campaign is part of Meta's push to establish dominance in the AI space, competing with other tech giants for the world's best minds.

A concerned driver had called in the sighting along the remote stretch of road.
