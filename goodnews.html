However, initial gains were tempered by uncertainty surrounding President Trump's tariff authority, which faces a Supreme Court challenge. Goldman Sachs' President John Waldron indicated a slowdown in investment banking activity for the second quarter due to market volatility, but highlighted robust equity trading and a pickup in capital markets activity. Wells Fargo also announced the termination of a 2015 consent order, marking progress in resolving regulatory issues, while Bristol Myers Squibb defended its schizophrenia drug Cobenfy despite trial setbacks, awaiting further data.

          <p>The Supreme Court issued a ruling in Seven County Infrastructure Coalition v. Eagle County that aims to reduce the burden of environmental regulation on land development, potentially expediting infrastructure projects. The court placed new limits on the National Environmental Policy Act (NEPA), instructing courts to be deferential to an agency‚Äôs decision to approve a project after producing an environmental impact statement. The ruling is a victory for land developers, libertarians, and advocates of an ‚Äúabundance‚Äù agenda, who argue that excessive regulation hinders economic growth and innovation. The court emphasized that NEPA should not be used to stymie projects based on indirect or geographically separate impacts.</p>
