          <div class="timestamp">2025-06-25 05:00:50 EDT</div>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Researchers at the San Carlos Clinical Hospital in Madrid have found that injecting stem cells from human fat into mice skin may improve hair regrowth, particularly in male mice when combined with an energy-boosting molecule. The study, published in Stem Cell Research & Therapy, achieved significant hair regrowth in both male and female mice with appropriate doses. While the study's lead author cautions that human clinical trials are needed to confirm these benefits, the findings suggest a potential new therapeutic approach for androgenetic alopecia. The researchers are actively working on confirming safety for men and women in human clinical trials, with the treatment potentially available in approximately five years.</p>

        </div>
        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Despite expectations, the recent conflict between Israel and Iran has not caused an oil crisis, with prices remaining lower than pre-attack levels. This resilience is attributed to several factors, including Iran's decision not to disrupt oil supplies through the Strait of Hormuz and traders becoming more skeptical of price spikes. Additionally, the approaching autumn season typically sees lower oil demand, and the market is currently oversupplied, with the U.S. being the world's dominant oil producer. These factors have collectively mitigated the potential for a crisis, leading to a more stable oil market than anticipated.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>The slang term "bruh," popular among Gen Alpha, has roots dating back to the 16th century with the abbreviated use of "brother" evolving over time. Internet culture, particularly TikTok, has transformed the meaning of "bruh," with the word now used to express a range of emotions and serve as a form of punctuation. Experts explain that the word's meaning is defined by the context of the moment, advising parents not to fear slang and to read the context clues. The term evolved from the earlier use of "bro" and gained traction through internet memes and viral videos, eventually becoming the ubiquitous expression it is today.</p>

The winner of the Democratic primary is likely to have an advantage in the general election, although incumbent Mayor Eric Adams is running as an independent.</p>

          <h2>NATO Chief Says Trump 'Totally Committed' to Article 5</h2>

          <p>NATO Secretary General Mark Rutte has stated that President Donald Trump is "totally committed" to Article 5, NATO's mutual defense guarantee, despite the president's earlier ambiguous remarks. Rutte also emphasized the importance of NATO members increasing their defense spending. The NATO summit is expected to endorse a higher defense spending goal of 5% of GDP. Tensions between Israel and Iran, as well as reports of limited impact from recent U.S. strikes on Iranian nuclear facilities, are also key discussion points.</p>

          <h2>Wimbledon 2025: No Line Judges, but Will They Be Missed?</h2>
          <div class="timestamp">2025-06-25 01:47:50 EDT</div>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Wimbledon 2025 will mark the first time in its 148-year history without line judges, as electronic line calling is introduced. While technology fans celebrate progress, traditionalists will miss the people and uniforms that added to Wimbledon's unique character. The move reflects a broader trend toward automation in sports, but some argue that it removes a bit of the personality and charm that made Wimbledon special. The absence of line judges may be particularly noticeable on the iconic grass courts of SW19.</p>
