          <p>The Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) has formally dropped its lawsuit against Binance and its founder, Changpeng Zhao, concluding one of the last major crypto enforcement actions. The case, initiated in June 2023, accused Binance of illegally serving U.S. users, inflating trading volumes, and commingling customer funds. This dismissal comes as the Trump administration signals a pro-crypto stance, with the Justice Department curtailing its crypto enforcement team. Binance has also forged ties with World Liberty Financial, a project aiming to be a crypto bank, and Zhao has become an advisor to Pakistan's Crypto Council. (not investment advice)</p>

Sable plans to appeal, insisting it is operating under original permits from the 1980s.
