          <div class="timestamp">2025-09-12 15:13:07 EDT</div>
        </div>
        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>With mortgage rates falling to their lowest point in nearly a year and a Federal Reserve rate cut anticipated, prospective homebuyers are facing a timely opportunity. However, experts advise remembering several key factors to capitalize on the current climate. It is crucial to monitor the market closely, as lenders often adjust rates in advance of formal Fed action. Buyers should also prioritize improving their credit scores to qualify for the best possible rates and secure pre-approval to demonstrate seriousness to sellers. Finally, the wisdom of "date the rate, marry the home" applies, suggesting that waiting for even lower rates could mean losing out on a desired property. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>Veteran character actor Clifton Powell has publicly identified Jeff Witjas of the APA agency as the agent who allegedly fired him for accepting a role in the 2005 film "The Gospel." Powell claims the agent contemptuously referred to the project as "another one of those little Black movies," prompting the actor to defend his need to support his family before the professional relationship ended. Powell, known for roles in films like "Ray" and "Rush Hour," emphasized that he has always prioritized working on projects that resonate with his community. He stated this philosophy has sustained his prolific career, which now includes nearly 300 credits.</p>

Industrial company Eaton highlighted a significant growth opportunity, noting that the data center industry's project backlog has surged from $150 billion to $470 billion in one year, driven by AI investments from major tech companies. This massive expansion in data centers, along with increased investment needs for utilities and aerospace, points to strong secular tailwinds for the industrial sector. The market's performance reflects optimism even as investors await the Fed's decision on monetary policy. (not investment advice)</p>

Kamin becomes the third person to hold the top role in the mayor's office in less than three years, a notably rapid turnover compared to previous administrations. In her announcement, Bass described Kamin as a "status quo disrupter" and a seasoned leader. Kamin previously represented the city in a successful lawsuit against the Trump administration's Department of Justice over immigration enforcement policies and will begin his new role on September 22.</p>

          <h2>Terence Crawford and Canelo Alvarez Weigh In for Super-Middleweight Title Fight</h2>

          <p>Challenger Terence Crawford, moving up two weight classes, weighed in at the same level as champion Saul 'Canelo' Alvarez ahead of their highly anticipated super-middleweight fight in Las Vegas. The undefeated Crawford, who aims to become the first male boxer to be an undisputed champion in three different divisions, appeared shredded and in peak physical condition despite the added weight. Alvarez will defend his four major world titles in the bout. While Alvarez's experience and natural power at the 12-stone limit could be decisive, many analysts are tipping the adaptable and intelligent Crawford to make history on Saturday night.</p>

          <p>NATO has launched a new operation named "Eastern Sentry" to bolster the security of its eastern flank following the violation of Polish airspace by Russian drones. NATO chief Mark Rutte described the incursion as dangerous and unacceptable, regardless of whether it was intentional. The new mission will integrate air and ground assets from various allies, including the UK, France, and Germany, to strengthen defenses from Finland in the north to Romania in the south. NATO's top commander, Alexus Grynkewich, affirmed the alliance's commitment to defending every inch of its territory and reassuring citizens of its rapid response capabilities.</p>

          <p>A neurosurgeon at a St. Louis hospital intervened to stop an organ harvesting procedure on his 22-year-old patient, Larry Black Jr., who was not brain-dead. The patient, recovering from a gunshot wound to the head, was being prepped for surgery after his family consented to donation based on what they felt was a grim prognosis. The doctor, Zohny Zohny, rushed into the operating room after learning of the plan, insisting the patient had not been properly evaluated and could recover. Black woke up two days later and is now a father of three, highlighting systemic issues and confusion within the organ donation process.</p>

          <p>The U.S. Department of Agriculture is organizing a trip for American agricultural growers and exporters to visit China this autumn to engage with officials and participate in a major import expo. This annual mission takes on greater significance this year as both nations attempt to stabilize relations while Beijing has been reducing its purchases of U.S. farm goods. China remains the largest overseas market for American farmers, and the visit is seen as a crucial effort to maintain trade connections. Approximately 20 state representatives, associations, and exporters are expected to participate in the American pavilion at the Shanghai expo.</p>

          <div class="timestamp">2025-09-12 14:01:33 EDT</div>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>For savers with a $10,000 Certificate of Deposit (CD) maturing this September, renewing the account may still be a wise financial decision despite recent interest rate cuts by the Federal Reserve. While rates are no longer at their peak, they remain competitive, with many online banks still offering rates around 4.50%, which can yield significant interest earnings. Furthermore, renewing a CD locks in a fixed rate, protecting funds from the volatility of variable-rate savings accounts as further Fed cuts are anticipated. Acting now could represent a final opportunity to secure a relatively high, stable return for an extended period. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>The Federal Aviation Administration is launching a new pilot program to speed up the integration of electric vertical takeoff and landing (eVTOL) aircraft, often called air taxis. Key industry players Archer Aviation and Joby Aviation announced their participation in the program, which will establish public-private partnerships to promote the safe deployment of this new technology. The initiative follows a presidential executive order aimed at fostering innovation and cementing U.S. leadership in advanced aviation. Supervised trials could begin as early as next year, representing a critical step toward making widespread air taxi services a reality.</p>
