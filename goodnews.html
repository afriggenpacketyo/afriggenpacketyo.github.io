          <h2>FIFA Agrees to Implement Mandatory Rest Periods for Professional Footballers</h2>
          <div class="timestamp">2025-07-13 11:32:10 EDT</div>
        </div>
        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Following negotiations with the global players' union, Fifpro, FIFA has agreed to introduce mandatory rest periods to protect players from injury and burnout. The new rules will include a minimum 72-hour gap between matches and a three-week break at the end of each season. This consensus comes after Fifpro filed a lawsuit against FIFA over the expanded Club World Cup, raising concerns about the increasingly congested fixture calendar. The move is seen as a significant first step in addressing player welfare amid the sport's global expansion.</p>

        </div>
        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>At the Big 12 Media Days, Colorado Buffaloes head coach Deion Sanders called for the NCAA to enforce stricter uniform rules in college football, similar to the NFL's fine system. He expressed frustration with players wearing gear like biker shorts and lacking proper knee pads, arguing it shows a lack of respect for the game. Sanders, who recently signed a five-year extension with Colorado, also addressed questions about his health, stating he feels well and is focused on his team. The coach has previously dealt with significant health issues, including blood clots.</p>

          <p>A new article highlights numerous abandoned locations around the world that have been repurposed into unique and fascinating tourist attractions. From the Maunsell Sea Forts in England, which were WWII defense towers, to a sunken prison in Estonia now used as a beach, these sites offer a glimpse into the past. Other examples include the ghost town of Kolmanskop in Namibia, now overrun by sand dunes, and a replica of Paris in China, Tianducheng. These destinations demonstrate how derelict spaces, once left to decay, can find new life and attract thousands of visitors annually.</p>

          <p>A feature article details how investigative genetic genealogy is being used to solve decades-old cold cases, including the identification of the Golden State Killer. The technique, pioneered by amateur sleuths like Barbara Rae-Venter, involves using public DNA databases to build family trees of unknown suspects, leading law enforcement to their identity. The article highlights its success in cracking numerous cases, such as identifying a man who committed a sexual assault in 1997. While the method has proven highly effective, it also raises significant questions about genetic privacy and the ethics of using personal data for criminal investigations.</p>

          <p>One year after the assassination attempt on President Trump in Butler, Pennsylvania, the U.S. Secret Service is enhancing its security protocols with new technology. The agency has deployed a fleet of military-grade drones and mobile command posts to improve aerial surveillance and inter-agency communication. These upgrades directly address failures from the Butler incident, where a shooter operated a drone undetected and law enforcement agencies could not communicate directly. The new command posts, costing up to $1.5 million each, will ensure seamless radio contact with local police at future events.</p>

          <p>English amateur Lottie Woad came remarkably close to winning a major title at the Evian Championship, finishing just one shot behind the leaders before a playoff decided the winner. Australia's Grace Kim ultimately secured her first major victory by defeating Thailand's Atthaya Thitikul with an eagle on the second playoff hole. The 21-year-old Woad shot a sensational final-round 64 to set the clubhouse lead at 13 under par. Her performance earns her crucial points toward an LPGA Tour card, leaving her with a significant decision about when to turn professional.</p>

          <p>UK Transport Secretary Heidi Alexander has announced that the government will take steps to make electric vehicles (EVs) more affordable for consumers. While she did not confirm reports of a new subsidy program, she guaranteed that measures would be introduced to lower the high upfront cost of EVs. The government also announced a funding package to improve charging infrastructure, including £25 million for councils to install gullies for easier on-street charging. The move aims to accelerate the transition away from petrol and diesel cars ahead of the 2030 ban. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>Professor Zheng Yongnian, a prominent Beijing policy adviser, has argued that Chinese think tanks need to develop an "indigenous knowledge system" to effectively explain China to the world. Speaking to a newspaper, Zheng stated that these organizations should become more "self-centred," focusing on China's unique practical experiences rather than relying on Western academic frameworks. He believes this approach is crucial for accurately analyzing Chinese public policy and predicting the country's future direction. This shift, he suggests, is necessary for China to successfully project its soft power and global influence.</p>

          <p>According to a psychologist who studies relationships, couples in the happiest partnerships practice five key habits during the work week that many others neglect. These include establishing a brief morning routine together, sending thoughtful check-in messages during the day, and taking individual time to decompress after work. They also prioritize a daily, distraction-free moment of "us time" and end each day with a quiet emotional check-in. The article suggests these small, intentional rituals are more important for maintaining intimacy and connection than grand weekend gestures, especially during busy periods.</p>

          <p>Two Chinese satellites, Shijian-21 and Shijian-25, appear to have docked in geostationary orbit, potentially for a landmark autonomous refueling mission. According to space-tracking firm COMSPOC, the satellites were observed in prolonged close-proximity operations and "appeared visually merged" for several days in early July. If confirmed, this would mark a significant achievement in autonomous satellite servicing, a capability the United States has not yet demonstrated in the same way. The event, which was reportedly monitored by U.S. surveillance satellites, underscores China's rapidly advancing space technology and capabilities.</p>

The article draws parallels between Anderson and Marilyn Monroe, highlighting a shared vulnerability and a sacrificial role in the public eye, particularly regarding the violation of her privacy with a stolen tape. It argues that despite the intense scrutiny and exploitation she faced, Anderson has triumphed through her own strength and constitution, remaining a beloved and relevant cultural figure at age 58.</p>
