          <h2>Trump Administration Requests Dismissal of Abortion Pill Lawsuit, Echoing Biden's Position</h2>

          <p>The Trump administration has asked a federal judge to dismiss a lawsuit seeking to restrict access to mifepristone, an abortion pill, aligning with the previous Biden administration's stance. The Justice Department argues the case, brought by conservative attorneys general from Missouri, Idaho, and Kansas, lacks the legal standing to be heard in the Texas federal district court where it was filed. The lawsuit aims to reverse regulatory changes made by the FDA since 2016 that expanded access to mifepristone, including telemedicine prescriptions and mail delivery. Abortion pills are now used in nearly two-thirds of abortions in the United States, particularly in states with abortion bans, so the outcome of this case is of extreme importance.</p>

          <p>The Trump administration has dismantled some of the migrant tents hastily erected at Guant√°namo Bay, Cuba, just three months after announcing plans to house up to 30,000 migrants at the base. The operation never expanded beyond housing 32 migrants in existing buildings, despite the initial vision. The decision to dismantle the tents suggests that the Defense and Homeland Security Departments do not plan to house large numbers of migrants at the base. The costs of the operation have been criticized, with Democrats calling it a waste of taxpayer funds.</p>

The non-profit will retain a significant stake in OpenAI's business arm, allowing it to pursue its goals.

          <p>A new study indicates that receiving a shingles vaccine may reduce the risk of cardiovascular events, such as stroke and heart failure, by 23% for up to eight years. The research, which examined data from over one million individuals aged 50 and older, showed a particularly strong protective effect in men, younger individuals, and those with unhealthy lifestyles. Researchers suggest that preventing shingles through vaccination may lower the risks of blood vessel damage and inflammation that can lead to heart disease. The CDC recommends the shingles vaccine for everyone starting at age 50.</p>

The automotive industry is grappling with 25% tariffs on imported vehicles and non-USMCA compliant auto parts.
