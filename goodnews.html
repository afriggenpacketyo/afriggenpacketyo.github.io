          <p>Exit polls indicate an extremely tight race in the Polish presidential election between Warsaw's Mayor Rafal Trzaskowski and conservative historian Karol Nawrocki. Early polls showed conflicting results, with each candidate claiming a marginal lead, making the official result, expected on Monday morning, highly anticipated. Trzaskowski, supported by the pro-EU coalition, aims to remove political influence from the judiciary and liberalize abortion laws, while Nawrocki, backed by the Law and Justice party, advocates for a strong, sovereign Poland. The outcome will significantly impact Poland's relationship with the EU and the direction of its domestic policies.</p>
