          <p>Two of China's largest drug manufacturers, Jiangsu Hengrui Pharmaceuticals and Hansoh Pharmaceutical Group, are projected to report substantial profit increases for the first half of the year. This growth is attributed to the successful rollout of new innovative drugs and income generated from technology licensing agreements. Analysts forecast that Hengrui's net profit could rise by as much as 40 percent, reflecting a strategic shift away from generic drugs toward more profitable novel treatments. This trend is expected to continue, further strengthening the companies' financial positions in the global market. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>The Green Party in the United Kingdom is at a pivotal moment as it decides its future leadership and strategic direction. The contest features a clash between deputy leader Zack Polanski's "eco-populist" approach, which aims to channel public anger against elites, and the more moderate strategy of current co-leader Adrian Ramsay and MP Ellie Chowns. While Polanski advocates for a bolder, more confrontational style to attract disaffected left-wing voters, his opponents argue for continuing the proven method of intensive local campaigning that led to record electoral success. The outcome will determine how the party attempts to build on its recent gains.</p>

          <p>Minnesota Vikings head coach Kevin O'Connell inadvertently used an expletive during a live television interview on the team's local broadcast. The incident occurred in the third quarter of a preseason game against the New England Patriots. While providing commentary on an offensive play, O'Connell reacted with frustration to an illegal motion penalty against his team, dropping an F-bomb on the air. The play, which would have resulted in a first down, was nullified by the penalty. The unscripted moment highlighted the raw emotion of coaching, even during exhibition games.</p>

          <p>World number one Scottie Scheffler won the BMW Championship, overcoming a four-shot deficit on the final day to finish two strokes ahead of Scotland's Robert MacIntyre. MacIntyre, who led overnight, had a difficult start with consecutive bogeys, allowing Scheffler to take the lead by the seventh hole. Despite some late-round tension and a few uncharacteristic errors from both players, Scheffler sealed his victory with a remarkable chip-in for birdie on the 17th hole. The win marks Scheffler's 18th career PGA Tour success, showcasing his resilience under pressure at Caves Valley Golf Club in Maryland.</p>

          <p>Following the Alaska summit between President Trump and Vladimir Putin, U.S. special envoy Steve Witkoff claimed Russia has agreed to allow the U.S. and Europe to offer Ukraine "robust" security guarantees. Witkoff stated this could include "Article 5-like language," referencing NATO's collective defense principle, as part of a potential peace deal. Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy described the offer as "historic" ahead of his meeting in Washington with Trump and European leaders. The development suggests a possible pathway to ending the war, though details of the guarantees and territorial concessions remain under negotiation.</p>

          <p>Cleveland Browns rookie quarterback Dillon Gabriel has denied that a recent comment he made about "entertainers and competitors" was a jab at his teammate, Shedeur Sanders. During a preseason game, Gabriel stated his job was to compete, which some on social media interpreted as a reference to the high media attention surrounding Sanders. Gabriel later clarified that his comment was directed at the media, not his fellow quarterback. Both players were drafted by the Browns this year and are competing for a position on the team's depth chart behind the expected starter, Joe Flacco.</p>
