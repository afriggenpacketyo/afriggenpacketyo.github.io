          <p>A cold case from Wisconsin involving a missing mother, Audrey Backeberg, has been resolved after more than 60 years, with the Sauk County Sheriff's Office reporting that she is alive and well. Backeberg disappeared in 1962 at the age of 20, and the investigation revealed that she left by her own choice, with no evidence of criminal activity or foul play. Initial reports suggested she may have abandoned her children, but the sheriff's office has now confirmed her disappearance was voluntary. The case was reopened earlier this year, leading to the discovery of Backeberg's whereabouts.</p>

          <p>The White House has clarified that President Trump's announcement to rename Veterans Day as "Victory Day for World War I" was intended as an additional proclamation, not a full replacement. This clarification came after initial reports suggested a complete renaming of the November 11 holiday. The White House Press Secretary stated that the day would still be observed as Veterans Day, with an additional proclamation issued on the same date. Establishing a federal holiday or observance requires congressional approval.</p>

          <p>A new book reveals that Joe Biden's top staff debated the possibility of him taking a cognitive test as he geared up for re-election, but ultimately decided against it. The discussion took place in February 2024 amid concerns about Biden's mental acuity and age. Aides were confident he would pass, but worried that taking the test would raise more questions about his abilities. Biden later stepped down from his re-election campaign in favor of Kamala Harris, who lost the presidential election to Donald Trump.</p>

          <p>Chinese power grid engineering expert Li Licheng, aged 84, has signed a contract with a Chinese private commercial space flight company to book a seat on a space tourism voyage. Li, an academician of the Chinese Academy of Engineering, will be on the inaugural flight scheduled for 2028. He plans to travel into space three times, once a year, stating he will only be 89 years old after the trips.

          <p>In several U.S. cities, the income needed to afford a median-priced home is now more than twice the income required to afford a median-priced apartment. A Redfin analysis reveals that U.S. homebuyers must earn $116,633 to afford a median-priced home, which is 82% more than the income needed to cover the cost of a median-priced rental. The estimates are based on the standard assumption that housing costs shouldn't exceed 30% of gross income, reflecting national and metro-level data.</p>

          <p>This article discusses Sarah Snook's one-actor take on The Picture of Dorian Gray, now on Broadway, drawing parallels between the story's themes of vanity and image obsession with modern social media culture. Snook plays 26 roles, using elaborate camerawork and a smartphone to broadcast herself to a giant screen. This highlights the gap between false perfection and reality, and the pleasure derived from deception. The production uses social media tropes to critique the ways performing a persona can rot away an interior life.</p>
