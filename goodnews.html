        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Saudi Aramco's net profit for the first quarter of 2025 decreased by 5% compared to the same period last year, primarily due to lower oil prices and production volumes. The company's net income for the quarter reached $26 billion, slightly exceeding analyst expectations. Free cash flow also declined from $22.8 billion to $19.2 billion. These figures indicate ongoing financial pressures for the Saudi state oil giant as it navigates fluctuating crude prices and slowing global demand.</p>
