          <h2>Novak Djokovic Cancels Practice Session Ahead of Wimbledon Semifinal</h2>
          <div class="timestamp">2025-07-11 02:16:42 EDT</div>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Novak Djokovic has raised concerns about his fitness ahead of his Wimbledon semifinal match against world number one Jannik Sinner by canceling a scheduled practice session. The 38-year-old champion had an awkward fall during his quarter-final victory and has acknowledged the increasing physical demands of competing at the highest level. His opponent, Jannik Sinner, has also been dealing with an elbow injury, adding another layer of uncertainty to the highly anticipated matchup. While Sinner stated he would be 100% fit, Djokovic's last-minute cancellation casts some doubt on his physical condition for the upcoming clash.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Actor Ewan McGregor's application to replace the roof on his £2 million historic mansion in Scotland has been rejected by the local council. His architects argued the current lead roof was "beyond repair" and that a modern replacement was necessary to prevent water damage and deter theft. However, Perth and Kinross Council ruled that the proposed single-ply membrane material would not preserve the C-listed building's special architectural character. The actor, who purchased the ten-bedroom villa in 2023, had previously received approval for other renovations on the property.</p>

          <p>U.S. career diplomat Julie Eadeh is expected to be the next American consul general for Hong Kong and Macau, pending approval from Beijing. Eadeh is a familiar figure in the city, having previously served as the political section chief at the consulate during the 2019 anti-government protests. Her name has reportedly been submitted to the relevant Chinese authorities for their consent. The appointment comes at a time of continued complex relations between Washington and Beijing, with the role of the top US diplomat in the city being a key position in navigating these dynamics.</p>

          <p>A coalition of European nations has agreed to establish a headquarters in Paris for a future multinational force intended to deploy to Ukraine after a ceasefire. The force aims to provide logistical support, help rebuild Ukraine's military, and secure its airspace and the Black Sea to deter future Russian aggression. For the first time, a U.S. delegation, including President Trump's special envoy Keith Kellogg, attended the planning meeting in Rome, signaling American support for the initiative. While no specific troop commitments were made, the move represents a significant step in long-term security planning for Ukraine.</p>

          <p>Tesla's new car sales in Norway saw a significant 54% year-on-year increase in June, a stark contrast to slumping sales in other major European markets like Germany. The popularity is largely driven by the revamped Model Y, which meets Norwegian demand for value, space, and all-wheel drive capabilities. This success persists despite a notable backlash against CEO Elon Musk's political activities, with a recent survey showing many Norwegian EV drivers would not buy a Tesla for political reasons. The trend underscores Norway's unique, policy-driven EV market, which has made it a global leader in electric vehicle adoption.</p>

          <p>In a significant environmental effort, China has blown up approximately 300 dams and closed hydropower stations along the Red River, a key tributary of the upper Yangtze. The initiative aims to restore the natural habitat for numerous rare and endemic fish species that have been severely impacted by decades of dam construction. These structures had blocked migratory routes, restricted water flow, and destroyed spawning grounds, leading to drastic ecological decline. The demolitions are part of a broader push to reverse environmental damage and protect biodiversity in one of China's most important river systems.</p>

The lawsuit alleges that federal agents have been unconstitutionally targeting brown-skinned people without probable cause as part of a mass deportation plan.

          <p>A federal judge in New Hampshire has once again temporarily blocked President Trump's executive order aimed at ending birthright citizenship for children of some non-citizens. The ruling allows a class-action lawsuit, filed by the ACLU on behalf of immigrant parents and their infants, to proceed. This legal challenge was structured to comply with recent Supreme Court limits on nationwide injunctions by using a class-action certification. The White House criticized the decision as an unlawful attempt to circumvent the Supreme Court and vowed to fight the ruling, which challenges a key part of the administration's immigration policy.</p>
