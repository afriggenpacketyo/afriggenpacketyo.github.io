          <p>The Vatican has announced that Carlo Acutis, who died at age 15 in 2006 from leukemia, will be canonized as the first millennial saint on September 7. Acutis was known for his devotion to the Church and community, teaching Catholicism and volunteering to help the homeless. He also used his computer skills to create a website documenting over 100 eucharistic miracles recognized by the Church. His canonization follows recognition of two miracles attributed to his intercession, including the healing of his mother and a Costa Rican woman with a serious brain injury, solidifying his place in Catholic history.</p>

          <p>The presence of Mexican, Guatemalan, and Salvadorian flags at protests in Los Angeles against federal immigration raids has sparked controversy. While some view these flags as an affront, others argue they represent solidarity with immigrants and pride in heritage for Americans with roots in those countries. Satirist Lalo Alcaraz notes that the flag-wavers are often younger-generation American citizens supporting their immigrant parents. This contrasts with 2006 protests where organizers encouraged waving American flags, reflecting a shift in how communities express their identity and resistance to perceived persecution.</p>

          <p>A federal judge has ruled that the Trump administration cannot deport or detain Columbia University activist Mahmoud Khalil based on foreign policy reasons. The preliminary injunction prevents the government from deporting Khalil due to Secretary of State Marco Rubio's determination that his presence compromises U.S. foreign policy interests. The judge found that Khalil's career and reputation are being damaged, and his speech is being chilled. The administration may still attempt deportation on other grounds, but the ruling is a blow to their efforts to remove pro-Palestinian campus activists.</p>
