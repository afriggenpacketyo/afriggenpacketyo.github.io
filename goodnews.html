          <p>The U.S. Supreme Court has declined an emergency request from South Carolina officials, allowing a transgender male student to continue using the boys' restroom at his school for the time being. The decision lets a federal appeals court ruling stand, which had blocked the state's restrictive policy from being enforced against this specific student while his lawsuit proceeds. The state's rule ties school funding to compliance with a ban on transgender students using facilities that align with their gender identity. The court's order is not a final ruling on the merits of the case.</p>

          <p>The U.S. Forest Service is reversing its long-standing ban on N95 masks for federal wildland firefighters, acknowledging the health risks associated with smoke inhalation. For decades, the agency had argued that masks could lead to heat exhaustion, a stance contrary to practices in other fire-prone nations. The policy change follows reports and growing evidence linking wildfire smoke to long-term health issues for firefighters, including cancer. The agency has stockpiled 80,000 masks for deployment, a move seen by advocates as an implicit admission of the dangers posed by smoke exposure.</p>

          <p>England's cricket team lost to South Africa by 14 runs in the opening T20 match in Cardiff, which was significantly affected by rain. The game was first reduced to nine overs per side, with South Africa setting a strong pace before another weather delay. This led to a revised and challenging target for England of 69 runs in just five overs. Despite a quick 25 runs from Jos Buttler, England's chase fell short as they lost key wickets early, finishing their innings at 54-5. The series is set to continue at Old Trafford on Friday.</p>

The victory comes after Lineker's departure from the BBC's "Match of the Day" and the corporation itself, following controversies surrounding his social media use. In his acceptance speech, Lineker suggested the award demonstrates public support for using one's platform to advocate for others. Other notable winners at the viewer-voted ceremony included the finale of "Gavin and Stacey" for Best Comedy.</p>

          <p>Oracle co-founder Larry Ellison momentarily claimed the title of the world's wealthiest person, with his net worth surging to $393 billion, surpassing Elon Musk. The shift was driven by a massive rally in Oracle's stock, which jumped over 40% following a highly optimistic outlook for its cloud infrastructure and AI-related business. However, as Oracle's shares moderated later in the day, Musk reclaimed the top spot on the Bloomberg Billionaires Index. Ellison, a prominent ally of President Trump, has recently been involved in high-profile AI infrastructure projects and potential media acquisitions. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>Nearly two decades after its release, former Vogue editor Anna Wintour has finally offered her opinion on the 2006 film "The Devil Wears Prada," which was famously based on her leadership style. Wintour called the movie a "fair shot," praising its humor, wit, and Meryl Streep's "fantastic" performance as the demanding editor Miranda Priestly. She recalled attending the premiere wearing Prada but being unaware of the film's plot, and noted the fashion industry's initial concern that the character would be a caricature. Her review comes as a sequel to the hit film is reportedly in production.</p>

          <h2>Financial Experts Advise Renewing CDs Despite Anticipated Federal Reserve Rate Cuts</h2>
          <div class="timestamp">2025-09-10 16:39:21 EDT</div>
        </div>
        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>With the Federal Reserve expected to cut interest rates, savers holding maturing certificates of deposit (CDs) may be hesitant to renew them. However, financial experts argue that renewing could be a prudent strategy. Current CD rates remain competitive, and locking in a high rate now can protect savings from the declining returns that will affect variable-rate accounts once cuts are implemented. Furthermore, many banks may have already factored the anticipated rate cuts into their current offers, meaning today's rates might be the best available for the foreseeable future.

          <p>Oracle experienced a historic surge in its stock value, closing 36% higher in its best single-day performance since 1992. The rally added $244 billion to the company's market capitalization, driven by a stunning forecast for its cloud infrastructure business fueled by the artificial intelligence boom. The company reported a massive backlog of $455 billion in remaining performance obligations, far exceeding analyst expectations. This performance overshadowed a slight miss on quarterly earnings and revenue, cementing Oracle's position as a key player in the competitive AI infrastructure market. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>NASA scientists have announced that a rock sample collected by the Perseverance rover on Mars contains "potential biosignatures," representing the closest the agency has come to finding evidence of ancient life on the planet. The sample, dubbed Sapphire Canyon, was gathered from the edge of an ancient river valley in the Jezero Crater. Analysis by the rover revealed minerals and textures that, on Earth, are often byproducts of microbial life consuming organic matter. While nonbiological explanations cannot be ruled out, bringing the sample back to Earth for detailed analysis is the critical next step.</p>

          <p>Zohran Mamdani, the Democratic frontrunner for New York City mayor, has launched a petition against FIFA's use of dynamic pricing for 2026 World Cup tickets, calling it an "affront to the game." He argues that the pricing model, which allows ticket costs to fluctuate with demand, will make attending matches unaffordable for many fans and prioritize profit over atmosphere. Mamdani notes that FIFA's revenue is projected to increase by nearly 400% compared to the Qatar World Cup. His petition calls for an end to dynamic pricing and for a percentage of tickets to be reserved for local residents.</p>

          <p>Boeing has reached a tentative five-year labor agreement with the union representing over 3,000 striking defense workers in St. Louis, Missouri. The workers, who primarily assemble F-15 fighter jets, have been on strike since early August after rejecting a previous contract offer. The new deal reportedly includes improved wages and the restoration of a signing bonus, with a final vote by union members scheduled for Friday. The strike was the first in nearly 30 years for this unit, which had seen Boeing hire replacement workers to maintain production during the stoppage.</p>
