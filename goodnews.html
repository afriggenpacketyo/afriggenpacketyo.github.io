          <p>House Republicans are proposing a bill to invest $1,000 in "Trump Accounts" for every American baby born between January 1, 2025, and January 1, 2029. The funds would be invested in financial markets and could be withdrawn later for expenses like college or buying a house. The accounts would function similarly to typical investment accounts, with post-tax contributions and taxed gains upon withdrawal. This initiative is part of a broader fiscal package being debated in the House, aiming to enact some of President Trump's campaign promises.</p>

          <p>Bitcoin's price surged to a new record high, surpassing $111,000, driven by positive momentum, optimism regarding U.S. crypto regulation, and continued institutional interest. The price rise occurred despite a drop in U.S. stock markets, suggesting investors are seeking alternative stores of value. Moody's recent downgrade of U.S. sovereign debt also contributed to Bitcoin's appeal as a hedge against fiat instability. JPMorgan CEO Jamie Dimon, a previous bitcoin skeptic, announced the bank will allow clients to buy the digital currency. (not investment advice)</p>

The J League focused on developing players and establishing strong local relationships, while MLS has prioritized business interests and attracting global stars. The J League is increasing media investments and engaging with fans through a unified ticketing system. The article suggests that MLS should prioritize transparency and involve fans in major decisions, such as switching to a fall-spring format.</p>
