          <p>Chinese scientists have developed a low-cost, edible, and washable protein-based coating that can more than double the shelf life of fruits by reducing moisture loss and microbial growth. Tested on 17 varieties of whole and cut fruits, including strawberries, tomatoes, kiwis, and mangos, the coating effectively delayed rot by almost a week or more. The new method is as effective as existing preservation techniques but reduces carbon dioxide emissions and the potential for toxicity, offering a promising solution to global food waste. The research team emphasized the coating's universal applicability for post-harvest and fresh-cut fruits due to its edible properties, easy washability, and low cost, costing just 9 US cents per kilogram of fruit.</p>

"The Tetsuwan Dash" will continue broadcasting without Kokubun, who debuted with Tokio in 1994 and has had an extensive career in television and radio. After the Fukushima nuclear crisis in 2011, he helped promote farming produce from Fukushima Prefecture on the variety program.</p>

          <p>As the 50th anniversary of "Jaws" is marked, Americans are paying tribute to sharks amidst recent reports of attacks. Despite these incidents, activist Julie Andersen of Shark Angels argues that the rise in sightings is due to more people in the water, better technology, and shifting ocean conditions, rather than an increase in shark populations. She highlights the rebounding white shark populations in areas like California and Cape Cod as a sign of healthier oceans. Shark Angels provides tips for staying safe in the water, including remaining calm, maintaining eye contact, and avoiding erratic movements, emphasizing that sharks are not actively seeking human meals.</p>

After a five-year suspension due to Covid controls and cross-border issues, China will allow pilgrims to return to the Tibet autonomous region this summer via two routes. These sites are sacred to followers of Hinduism, Buddhism, Jainism, and Bon, with pilgrimages organized by the Indian government involving treks through the Lipulekh Pass in Uttarakhand or Nathu La Pass in Sikkim. Yang Yabo of the Tibet Academy of Social Sciences suggests these pilgrimages can help restore stability in China-India relations during times of crisis.</p>

          <p>China's central bank kept its benchmark lending rates unchanged, following monetary easing measures implemented last month, as a trade deal with the U.S. eases some growth concerns. The People's Bank of China held the 1-year loan prime rate at 3.0% and the 5-year LPR at 3.5%, aligning with Reuters poll estimates. Last month, Chinese authorities cut lending rates for the first time since October to cushion the impact of trade tensions with Washington (not investment advice). Trade-war fears have receded after U.S. and Chinese trade representatives agreed to honor a consensus reached in Geneva, allowing for rare earth and tech trade while suspending prohibitive tariffs.</p>

He referenced attempts to erase history from textbooks and classrooms, seemingly alluding to President Trump without naming him directly. Biden also highlighted his administration's efforts to rename military bases named after Confederate military officers. In 2021, Biden signed into law a measure that made Juneteenth a federal holiday commemorating the end of slavery in the U.S., which he emphasized as being of monumental importance to America's story.</p>

The judge granted a preliminary injunction, stating that large-scale irreparable harm would occur without it.

The court agreed, finding no plausible connection between cooperating with ICE enforcement and the congressionally approved purposes of the Department of Transportation.</p>
