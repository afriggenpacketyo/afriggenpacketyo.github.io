          <p>South Korean chipmaker SK Hynix has announced record-breaking operating profit and revenue for the second quarter, largely fueled by sustained high demand for its high bandwidth memory (HBM) technology. These specialized memory chips are critical components in the AI chipsets used by major tech companies like Nvidia. The company expressed confidence for the remainder of 2025, citing stable customer inventories and anticipating that ongoing AI investments by corporations and governments will continue to drive demand. SK Hynix expects to double its HBM sales for the full year compared to 2024. (not investment advice)</p>

        </div>
        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>A panel of judges on the U.S. Court of Appeals for the 9th Circuit has ruled that President Trump's executive order aimed at curtailing birthright citizenship is unconstitutional. The court found that the order, which seeks to deny automatic citizenship to U.S.-born children of undocumented immigrants, contradicts the plain language of the Fourteenth Amendment. The judges rejected the administration's novel interpretation of the amendment's "subject to the jurisdiction thereof" clause. This decision marks a significant legal setback for the policy, affirming that the president cannot unilaterally change the Constitution's guarantee of birthright citizenship.</p>

          <h2>South Korea's Economy Expands in Second Quarter, Avoiding Technical Recession</h2>
          <div class="timestamp">2025-07-23 21:15:55 EDT</div>
        </div>
        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>South Korea's economy grew by 0.6% in the second quarter, surpassing expectations and successfully avoiding a technical recession after contracting in the previous quarter. The growth was primarily driven by a strong performance in exports, particularly for semiconductors and petroleum products, as some firms reportedly expedited shipments ahead of potential U.S. tariff adjustments. While domestic consumption also saw a modest increase, economists remain cautious, suggesting the growth pace may not be sustainable due to the looming threat of trade conflicts and a potential slowdown in global demand.

          <p>Veteran golfer Lee Westwood has criticized the Official World Golf Ranking (OWGR), calling it a "mockery" for its failure to award points to LIV Golf tour events. His comments came after his performance at The Open Championship caused him to jump nearly 3,800 spots in the rankings, highlighting the system's volatility for LIV players who only earn points at major championships. Westwood and other LIV golfers argue that excluding their league's events undermines the ranking's credibility by not accurately reflecting the world's best players. The controversy underscores the ongoing friction between the established golf tours and the newer, Saudi-backed LIV Golf league.</p>

          <p>The United States has finalized new trade agreements with Indonesia and the Philippines, imposing a 19% tariff on imports from the two nations while securing duty-free access for American exports. Analysts interpret this move as an indirect strategy to counter China's economic influence in Southeast Asia by reshaping regional supply chains and gaining access to critical resources like rare earth minerals. While not explicitly targeting Beijing, the deals are seen as part of a broader U.S. effort to contain China's dominance. Some experts note that Chinese firms are already adapting by localizing production within the region.</p>

In exchange, the administration will reinstate $400 million in federal research grants that were frozen earlier this year. The agreement marks a significant development in the administration's broader campaign to reshape higher education, which has involved threatening to cut funding to several major universities.</p>

          <p>The U.S. housing market is showing early signs of a shift, though it remains firmly in favor of sellers. According to real estate data, the number of homes for sale has increased, with 34% more sellers than buyers in May, the highest rate since 2013. Despite this rise in inventory, median home prices also hit a record high in June, driven by a lack of incentive for current homeowners with low-interest mortgages to sell. Experts suggest that while conditions are still challenging for buyers, the increased inventory may lead to more negotiating power, particularly for homes that have been on the market longer.</p>

Her performance was hailed as the decisive factor in a game that had been dominated by Spain but stymied by a resilient German defense.</p>

          <p>NASA has successfully launched the TRACERS mission, sending two identical satellites into orbit aboard a SpaceX Falcon 9 rocket. The twin spacecraft will fly in tandem to study how the solar wind, a stream of charged particles from the sun, interacts with Earth's magnetic field. This interaction creates "space weather," which can produce spectacular auroras but also disrupt satellites, GPS signals, and power grids on the ground. By taking precise, simultaneous measurements from two points, scientists hope to better understand and eventually predict these potentially dangerous space weather events, helping to protect critical infrastructure.</p>

On the positive side, he pointed to strong corporate earnings and durable investment themes like the data center buildout. However, he also warned of negative pressures, including potentially inflationary trade deals and speculative "froth" in certain stocks that reminds him of previous market bubbles.

          <p>The Los Angeles Rams have begun their training camp widely regarded as a Super Bowl contender, boasting a roster with both veteran leadership and young stars. The offense is bolstered by the signing of receiver Davante Adams, who joins a talented group led by quarterback Matthew Stafford. However, the team faces several key concerns as they prepare for the season. These include managing Stafford's back soreness, addressing uncertainty at the left tackle position due to Alaric Jackson's health issues, and relying on an unproven group of cornerbacks.

          <p>Freddie Freeman delivered a two-out, two-run walk-off single in the bottom of the ninth inning to give the Los Angeles Dodgers a dramatic 4-3 victory over the Minnesota Twins. The win provided a much-needed spark for the team, which had won just one of its previous five games and has been hampered by an exhausted and struggling bullpen. The comeback was made possible by a brilliant seven-inning, 12-strikeout performance from starter Tyler Glasnow and a record-tying fifth consecutive game with a home run from Shohei Ohtani.
