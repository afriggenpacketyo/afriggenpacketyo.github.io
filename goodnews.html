          <p>Uber is launching a pilot program in the U.S. to offer drivers and couriers alternative ways to earn money through its app when they are not transporting people or food. The new tasks will include small online jobs such as uploading photos or recording voice prompts to help train artificial intelligence models. This initiative, announced at the company's annual conference, is similar to platforms like Amazon's Mechanical Turk and aims to provide more income streams for its gig workers. Uber also announced the official rollout of its women rider preference feature and a delayed ride guarantee for drivers.</p>

        </div>
        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>The city of Cardiff has approved a new 10-year parking plan that includes charging higher fees for residential parking permits for heavier and more polluting vehicles, such as SUVs. The measure is intended to reduce congestion, cut air pollution, and encourage the use of public transport, walking, or cycling. The plan also involves restructuring the city into three parking zones, scrapping new resident permits in the city center, and creating new permits for carers and NHS workers. The proposal has drawn mixed reactions from residents, with some supporting the environmental goals while others express concern about the financial impact on tradespeople.</p>

          <p>Apple's Senior Vice President of Services, Eddy Cue, has expressed the company's desire to secure more sports broadcasting rights with the goal of transforming the viewer experience. Cue stated that Apple is not interested in traditional sports broadcasting and wants to offer something "unique and special," similar to its global, blackout-free coverage of Major League Soccer. He identified issues like regional blackouts, the need for multiple subscriptions, and poor video quality as problems Apple aims to solve. The company's current deals with MLB and MLS are seen as tests for a larger strategy of acquiring worldwide rights for entire leagues.</p>

          <p>As support for Windows 10 ends, Microsoft is introducing new AI features to encourage users to upgrade to Windows 11. The company will test an updated Copilot assistant that can perform multi-step tasks on a user's PC, such as resizing photos or creating music playlists using locally stored files and desktop applications. This "computer-use agent" technology, known as Copilot Actions, will operate in a contained environment, allowing users to watch it work and intervene if needed. The feature will initially be available to participants in the Windows Insider Program, representing a significant step in integrating autonomous AI into personal computing.</p>

          <p>U.S. Senator Marsha Blackburn has stated that federal legislation to regulate artificial intelligence is essential, as states like California, Utah, and Texas have already begun implementing their own safeguards. Speaking at the CNBC AI Summit, the Tennessee Republican emphasized the need for a federal standard to protect consumers and children from the risks associated with AI and social media. Blackburn is a proponent of the Kids Online Safety Act and is also focused on legislation to prevent the unauthorized use of a person's name, image, or likeness by AI models. She stressed that regulation must focus on the end-use applications of AI rather than the technology itself.</p>

          <p>Electric air taxi manufacturer Beta Technologies has set its initial public offering price range, which could value the company as high as $7.2 billion. The company plans to sell 25 million shares between $27 and $33 each, potentially raising up to $825 million. This move comes as the electric vertical takeoff and landing (eVTOL) sector gains momentum, with competitors like Joby and Archer Aviation also advancing. Despite doubling its revenue in the first half of 2025, Beta has not yet achieved profitability, reporting a net loss of $183 million during that period. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>Two Federal Reserve Governors, Stephen Miran and Christopher Waller, have offered conflicting opinions on the central bank's next move, signaling a debate within the institution. Miran is advocating for an aggressive half-percentage-point interest rate cut at the upcoming meeting, citing geopolitical tensions and a weakening labor market. In contrast, Waller supports a more moderate quarter-point reduction, expressing a desire to avoid rekindling inflation while still responding to economic warnings. Despite their differing views, their statements suggest the Federal Open Market Committee is poised to continue lowering rates. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>FBI Director Kash Patel has announced that FBI agents will continue to receive their paychecks despite the ongoing government shutdown that has halted pay for most federal workers. While the source of the funds was not specified, the move follows a similar decision to ensure military service members are paid using unspent funds from the previous fiscal year. The decision ensures that essential law enforcement personnel are compensated, but it has raised questions about the administration's legal authority to allocate funds without congressional approval. The FBI Agents Association thanked the administration but noted that other crucial support staff remain unpaid.</p>

          <p>Despite potential flight delays caused by staffing shortages during the government shutdown, aviation experts assert that air travel remains safe.

Pilots, who are not federal employees, retain the final authority to determine if a flight is safe to operate and would not take off if conditions were unsafe. While travelers should anticipate inconveniences, the core safety protocols of the aviation system remain intact.</p>

The article notes that instead of a hostile confrontation, the 25-minute discussion was a mutually respectful exchange where MacCallum pressed Mamdani on controversial issues and he responded with substance. The piece argues that such engagements are crucial for democracy, allowing politicians to humanize themselves to skeptical audiences and challenge caricatures. It suggests that more politicians should risk appearing on opposing networks to engage in persuasion rather than just performance.</p>

          <p>American ski mountaineer Jim Morrison has become the first person to successfully ski down the treacherous North Face of Mount Everest, a route known as the "Supercouloir." After reaching the 8,849-meter summit, where he scattered the ashes of his late partner Hilaree Nelson, Morrison began his daring descent. The four-hour journey down the steep and avalanche-prone face required him to navigate extremely difficult terrain, including a 200-meter rappel down bare rock. The historic achievement was a tribute to Nelson, who died in a mountaineering accident three years prior, and marked the culmination of Morrison's third attempt on the formidable route.</p>
