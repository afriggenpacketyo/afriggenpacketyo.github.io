          <p>Jamaican sprinter Kishane Thompson achieved a victory over American Olympic champion Noah Lyles in the 100-meter race at the Silesia Diamond League meet. This marked their first head-to-head competition since the Paris Olympics, where Lyles won gold by a margin of just five-thousandths of a second. Thompson finished with a meet record time of 9.87 seconds, while Lyles came in second at 9.90 seconds. The event served as a measure of redemption for Thompson following the incredibly close Olympic final.</p>

          <p>In a recent interview, actor Denzel Washington strongly condemned the concept of "cancel culture," questioning the importance of public support and online followers. He stated that his guidance comes from his faith in God, not from popular opinion, asserting that one "can't be canceled if you haven't signed up." Washington dismissed the idea that followers are a form of currency, arguing that his focus is on leading a life guided by spiritual principles rather than seeking approval from others. Director Spike Lee, who was present during the interview, echoed Washington's sentiments on the matter.</p>

          <p>A 46-year-old man was successfully rescued after being trapped for two days behind a powerful waterfall in a remote area of California. The man, Ryan Wardwell, was rappelling down a series of waterfalls known as the Seven Teacups when the force of the water pushed him off his lines, leaving him stranded. A search operation was launched after he failed to return, and a rescue team located him using a drone. He was hoisted to safety by a California Highway Patrol helicopter and treated for minor injuries and dehydration before being reunited with his family.</p>

          <p>A top scientist from the Chinese Academy of Sciences has urged China to accelerate its development of space-based solar power technology to secure a leading position in the energy and space sectors. The technology involves building orbital stations that collect solar energy and transmit it to Earth via microwaves or lasers, offering a continuous power source unaffected by weather or nighttime. The call to action highlights that China's current research, primarily led by universities, lacks the capacity for such a large-scale project. The article notes the need for a top-down national strategy to close the technology gap with countries like the United States.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>A series of articles highlights the concept of "Lighthouse Parenting" as a healthier alternative to the prevalent trend of intensive parenting. This approach encourages parents to act as a steady, reliable guide for their children, providing support when needed but allowing them the space to navigate their own challenges. This contrasts with the instinct to immediately solve every problem for a child, a method that can be exhausting for parents and detrimental to a child's development of confidence and resilience. The articles argue that stepping back can be one of the most beneficial actions a parent can take for their child's long-term growth.</p>

          <p>Devon and Cornwall Police have seized £180,000 that controversial influencer Andrew Tate had paid as a deposit for a special-edition Aston Martin Valhalla supercar in 2021. A London court granted the forfeiture order after the police argued the funds were proceeds from tax evasion and money laundering. This action follows a previous seizure of £2.7 million from Tate and his brother in December 2024 for failure to pay taxes on business revenue. The seized funds will be reinvested into crime prevention and victim support initiatives within the local community.</p>

          <h2>"Dec My Dorm" Program Provides College Essentials for Students from Foster Care System</h2>

          <p>A program called Dec My Dorm is helping students transitioning from the foster care system to college by providing them with essential dorm room supplies. Many of these students arrive on campus with minimal belongings and are often unaware of what they need, from bedding and towels to toolboxes and lamps. The initiative, which began after learning of a student who arrived at UC Berkeley with only a trash bag of possessions, aims to level the playing field and give these students a sense of belonging. By allowing students to choose their own items, the program helps them establish a personal space and eases their transition into higher education.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Therapist Sadie Salazar emphasizes the importance of waking up early as the single most crucial part of her morning routine for a successful day. By getting up when her alarm goes off "no matter what," she creates a buffer of personal time before her professional and family responsibilities begin. This extra time is used for flexible, rejuvenating activities like reading, listening to a podcast, or walking her dog, rather than a rigid regimen. Salazar, who works from home, also notes the psychological benefit of getting fully dressed for work to maintain focus and motivation throughout the day.</p>

The Prime Minister emphasized that the path to peace must involve Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy, who is scheduled to meet with Trump on Monday.

          <p>Samsung is gaining ground on Apple in the U.S. smartphone market, with its market share increasing from 23% to 31% in the second quarter, while Apple's declined from 56% to 49%. This shift is partly attributed to the growing momentum of Samsung's innovative foldable phones, like the Z Fold and Z Flip series, which offer new form factors compared to the standard iPhone design. Samsung's broader range of products at various price points also contributes to its gains. In response, Apple is expected to release a slimmer iPhone model and is rumored to be developing its own foldable phone for a potential 2026 launch. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>A fugitive drug and arms trafficker, Jamie Rothwell, was located and arrested after inadvertently revealing his location to police through photos he shared on the encrypted EncroChat network. Believing the system was secure, Rothwell sent a selfie and a picture of the view from his Barcelona apartment, which allowed detectives to identify and find him. The messages, exposed after an international law enforcement operation hacked the network in 2020, detailed his command of a multi-million-pound criminal enterprise, including trafficking AK-47s and orchestrating a gangland shooting. Rothwell has since been extradited to the UK and sentenced to 43 years in prison.</p>

          <p>Columbia-trained psychologist Becky Kennedy suggests three powerful steps for developing emotional endurance, which is the ability to withstand stress without being overcome by negative feelings. The first step is to visualize the learning process as a winding path between "not knowing" and "knowing" to normalize the struggle. The second is to engage in positive self-talk, reframing difficult moments as part of the growth process. Finally, she recommends taking on small, manageable experiments that push you out of your comfort zone, which builds the body's tolerance for discomfort and fosters resilience over time.</p>

          <p>A new Gallup survey indicates that the percentage of Americans who drink alcohol has dropped to 54%, the lowest level recorded since the question was first asked in 1939. The data also shows that those who do drink are consuming less and are increasingly concerned about the health impacts of alcohol, with a majority now believing even moderate drinking is unhealthy. This trend is even more pronounced among underage individuals, where reported drinking has declined sharply since the 1990s. While this shift points to significant public health benefits, the article notes a potential downside if it is linked to a broader decline in social interaction.</p>
