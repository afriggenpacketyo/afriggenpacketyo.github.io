Founded by Carla Langford, the faith-based organization arranges mission trips to locations like Mexico and Kenya, aiming to broaden the girls' perspectives and instill a sense of purpose. The program's next trip will take 10 girls to a rescue home in Kenya, where they have already been mentoring residents virtually. The initiative seeks to create a ripple effect, empowering participants to become positive influences in their own communities back home.</p>

          <p>The Israeli non-governmental organization IsraAID is acting as a key facilitator between the Israeli military and international aid groups to coordinate the delivery of humanitarian supplies into Gaza. CEO Yotam Polizer highlighted the severe humanitarian situation, emphasizing the need for food, medicine, and nutritional supplements to combat malnutrition. The organization began assisting after global partners faced difficulties with customs and military approvals for aid shipments. Polizer stressed that supporting humanitarian efforts in Gaza does not equate to being anti-Israel, pointing to significant support from the U.S. Jewish community.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>AI startup Perplexity has made a surprise $34.5 billion bid to purchase the Chrome browser from Google, a figure that exceeds its own current valuation. The offer comes after a U.S. Department of Justice ruling suggested Google should divest Chrome to remedy its illegal monopoly in the internet search market. Perplexity, known for its AI-powered search engine and new Comet browser, stated that several investors have agreed to back the deal. This aggressive move highlights the intense competition in the generative AI space and follows Perplexity's earlier, unrealized proposal to merge with TikTok.</p>

          <p>Analysts are increasingly optimistic about Starbucks' recovery efforts led by CEO Brian Niccol, with Baird recently upgrading the stock and raising its price target. Niccol's "Back to Starbucks" plan focuses on improving store operations and customer service through a new "Green Apron" model, which has shown positive results in test locations. The company is accelerating the rollout of this model to all U.S. stores, aiming to enhance the coffeehouse atmosphere and speed of service. These operational improvements, combined with cost-cutting measures, are expected to stabilize sales and boost future profitability. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>A new report from JLL suggests that quantum computing is on the verge of becoming a significant driver for the commercial real estate market, similar to how AI fueled the data center sector. As quantum technology advances toward commercial viability, a substantial need for specialized real estate is emerging, with investments potentially reaching $50 billion around 2030. These facilities require unique infrastructure, such as electromagnetic shielding, and are currently concentrated near research hubs like Chicago and Boston. The development represents a new, accretive opportunity for real estate rather than making existing data centers obsolete. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>Illinois Governor J.B. Pritzker is set to sign the Sonya Massey Act, a new law requiring more thorough background checks for police officer candidates. The legislation was inspired by the 2024 shooting death of Sonya Massey by a sheriff's deputy, Sean Grayson, who had a documented history of misconduct at previous law enforcement jobs. The act mandates that agencies inspect all prior employment records, including performance and fitness-for-duty evaluations, before making a final hiring decision. This reform aims to prevent officers with problematic histories from being hired by different departments within the state.</p>

          <div class="timestamp">2025-08-12 13:19:15 EDT</div>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>For retirees who must take required minimum distributions (RMDs) from retirement accounts but don't need the income, financial planners suggest several strategic options. One approach is to reinvest the funds in a brokerage account, preferably using tax-efficient assets like exchange-traded funds (ETFs). Another popular option for those aged 70½ or older is a qualified charitable distribution (QCD), which allows a direct, tax-free transfer to a nonprofit that can satisfy the RMD requirement. For those focused on legacy planning, using the RMD to contribute to a 529 college savings plan can also provide state tax benefits. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>The Consumer Price Index rose 2.7% year-over-year in July, a rate consistent with the previous month and slightly below economists' forecasts. On a monthly basis, prices increased by 0.2%, with falling gasoline prices helping to offset rising costs elsewhere. However, "core" inflation, which excludes volatile food and energy prices, climbed to a five-month high of 3.1% annually, indicating persistent underlying price pressures. Despite inflation remaining above the Federal Reserve's 2% target, analysts believe the data is not hot enough to prevent a potential interest rate cut in September.</p>

The first, a self-described "brusque" person, asks whether to suppress her critical instincts at work or accept that she might be the problem; the columnist advises her not to restrain herself and that it's always a good time to quit. The second letter comes from a 66-year-old alcoholic who, after decades of therapy, is torn between giving up on the world or striving for sobriety. The columnist responds with empathetic verses, acknowledging the profound difficulty of the choice.</p>

Despite posting a net loss due to non-cash IPO-related charges, the company's strong performance reflects growing institutional interest in stablecoins.

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Amid market volatility and persistent inflation, annuities are often considered for securing a predictable retirement income, but their safety depends on several factors. An annuity's security is tied to the financial strength of the issuing insurance company, not FDIC backing, making it crucial to choose highly-rated insurers. While state guarantee associations offer a limited safety net, the primary long-term risk is inflation eroding the purchasing power of fixed payments. Different types, such as fixed versus variable annuities, carry vastly different risk profiles, requiring careful selection based on an individual's financial goals and risk tolerance.

She argues that in addition to activism, absurdity and laughter, exemplified by Monty Python, are essential tools for survival and resistance, as humor is a form of fearlessness that agitates bullies. Recounting a mishap at a nail salon where her finger was accidentally super-glued to the manicurist's, she finds a moment of shared humanity and kindness in the absurd situation. She concludes that doing hopeful things, like showing kindness and remembering to laugh, is how we can maintain our spirits.</p>
