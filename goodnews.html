          <p>Japanese Prime Minister Shigeru Ishiba's Cabinet saw its approval rating increase to 37% in a recent Kyodo News survey.  The rise is attributed to public support for a policy shift to increase domestic rice production amidst rising prices and shortages.  Despite the increased approval, a significant portion of respondents still deem the government's response to rising rice prices insufficient. The poll also reveals public opposition to the ruling party's planned cash handouts.</p>
