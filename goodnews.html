          <p>In a recent interview, actor Michael J. Fox reflected on the prevalence of "bully culture" in modern society, identifying his own battle with Parkinson's disease as his biggest personal bully. He drew parallels to the themes in his iconic film "Back to the Future," emphasizing the importance of resilience and courage in confronting such challenges. Fox, who is returning to acting in the series "Shrinking" after a five-year retirement, spoke about how his new role, which also features a character with Parkinson's, allows him to work without hiding his symptoms.</p>

          <p>In an economy marked by persistent inflation, certificates of deposit (CDs) offer a secure way for savers to earn returns that can outpace rising costs. While national average yields for one-year CDs are below 2%, top online banks are offering significantly higher rates, with some short-term CDs exceeding 4.4% APY. The article explains the phenomenon of the inverted yield curve, where short-term CDs currently provide better returns than long-term ones, and suggests strategies like laddering to maximize earnings.

          <p>For homeowners with significant equity, home equity loans and lines of credit (HELOCs) present an affordable borrowing option compared to high-rate personal loans or credit cards. As of October 2025, average rates for 10-year home equity loans are around 8.28%, while HELOCs average 7.84%, with expectations that these rates may decrease if the Federal Reserve implements further cuts. The article outlines the differences between the two loan types, their potential tax benefits, and the critical importance of responsible borrowing since the home serves as collateral.

The article advises prospective buyers and homeowners looking to refinance to strengthen their credit, compare lenders, and consider loan terms carefully to manage costs in the current economic environment.

          <p>Gold continues to be a popular safe-haven asset, with its price standing at over $4,000 per ounce as of late October 2025. The precious metal is often sought by investors as a hedge against inflation and during periods of market volatility. Several factors influence its value, including global economic conditions, supply and demand dynamics, interest rates, and geopolitical instability. The article notes that a weaker U.S. dollar can also make gold more attractive to foreign investors, further driving up its price. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>In a deeply personal essay, the author explores the profound connection between long-distance running and his complex relationship with his father, a brilliant but troubled man whose life unraveled in middle age. Running becomes a discipline to avoid his father's fate, a method for processing a cancer diagnosis, and a way to build resilience in his personal and professional life. The narrative weaves together themes of ambition, illness, and fatherhood, ultimately framing running as a vital tool for confronting mortality and finding strength through relentless, structured effort.</p>

Drawing on John Stuart Mill, it posits that true free speech requires conscientious thought, study, and an openness to criticism, rather than being beholden to prejudice, fear, or manipulation. The author contends that attacks on science, education, and the consolidation of media by billionaires are significant threats to the free thought on which genuine free speech depends.</p>
