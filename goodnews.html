          <p>China plans to release a movie this summer about the Imperial Japanese Army's Unit 731, a controversial biological warfare unit from World War II, sparking concerns in Japan about potential negative impacts on bilateral relations. The film, produced with the cooperation of an exhibition hall dedicated to the unit, is set to premiere on the 80th anniversary of the end of the Sino-Japanese conflict. While the film aims to highlight the cruelty of Unit 731 and promote peace, the Japanese government worries it could reignite historical tensions between the two countries.</p>

          <p>China's central bank and financial regulators announced sweeping policy steps, including interest rate cuts and a reduction in the reserve requirement ratio, in an effort to stimulate economic growth amid trade tensions. The measures aim to support key sectors like technology and real estate, and include a new relending tool for consumption and elderly care. While analysts note that these policies may have limited impact on boosting domestic credit demand, the broad stimulus announcements signal a greater sense of urgency from officials to bolster the economy. The article also notes that the Chinese offshore yuan has regained some ground after weakening earlier in the month.</p>

          <p>Morocco, the largest automotive manufacturing hub in Africa, is becoming an increasingly crucial conduit for Chinese companies seeking to bypass tariffs on exports to Europe, according to The New York Times. The country's free-trade agreement with the European Union has attracted significant investment from Chinese energy, electric vehicle, and battery producers. However, the article notes that Morocco faces a difficult balancing act as tensions between China and the United States sharpen, potentially jeopardizing its economic and geopolitical interests. The article also highlights Morocco's strategic partnership with the United States and its ongoing territorial dispute over Western Sahara.</p>

          <p>Five top Venezuelan opposition figures, who had been sheltering at the Argentine diplomatic residence in Caracas for over a year, have been rescued and are now in the United States, according to Secretary of State Marco Rubio. The announcement comes as Venezuela seeks to ease tensions with the Trump administration, which has threatened to reimpose oil sanctions. The New York Times article highlights the activists' efforts to organize a voter-turnout drive and collect tally sheets during last year's election, despite constraints on their liberty. The article also notes the continued detention of political prisoners in Venezuela and the flight of other opposition leaders.</p>

          <p>A new bill in England and Wales proposes that criminals who refuse to attend their sentencing hearings could face an additional two years in prison. The bill aims to ensure that offenders cannot "opt out" of justice and that victims' families receive a moment of recognition and reparation. The legislation was initiated after several high-profile cases where killers did not attend sentencing, prompting calls for change from victims' families. The Justice Minister expressed gratitude to the families who campaigned for the new law, emphasizing that justice is not optional.</p>

          <p>CNBC reports that tourism is surging in China, defying a general consumption slowdown. China reported 314 million domestic tourist trips over the May Labor Day holiday, well above pre-Covid levels. This surge in tourism is driven by an increased interest in history and culture and boosted by China's recently built transportation infrastructure. The article also notes that cities are stepping up their efforts to attract tourists, and that inbound travel to China is rising due to expanded visa-free policies.</p>

          <p>President Donald Trump plans to announce that the U.S. will now refer to the Persian Gulf as the Arabian Gulf or the Gulf of Arabia, according to officials. The move, expected to be announced during his trip to Saudi Arabia, aligns with the preferences of Arab nations but is likely to anger Iran. The article provides historical context on the naming dispute and notes that Trump can change the name for official U.S. purposes, but he cannot dictate what the rest of the world calls it.</p>
