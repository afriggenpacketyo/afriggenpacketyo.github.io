          <p>The Smithsonian Institution issued a statement affirming its independence after President Trump announced the firing of National Portrait Gallery head Kim Sajet. The statement emphasized that personnel decisions are made by the Secretary, with oversight from the Board of Regents, including ex officio members Vice President JD Vance and Chief Justice John Roberts. This comes after Trump's executive order placing Vance in charge of supervising efforts to remove "improper ideology" from the Smithsonian. The museum also addressed concerns about biased content, stating that the Board of Regents has directed the Secretary to ensure unbiased content in Smithsonian museums.</p>
