          <p>Los Angeles Dodgers' two-way star Shohei Ohtani demonstrated his continued recovery on the mound by pitching two scoreless innings against the Kansas City Royals. During the outing, he threw the fastest pitch of his major league career, a 101.7 mph fastball, and allowed only one hit and one walk while striking out one batter. Despite his strong pitching performance in his third start since returning from elbow surgery, Ohtani went hitless in four at-bats at the plate. The Dodgers ultimately lost the game 9-5, snapping their five-game winning streak in a contest where their offense struggled to keep pace.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>The UK government is launching a new initiative partnering with major supermarkets and food manufacturers to encourage healthier consumer choices and combat rising obesity rates. Under the plan, food retailers will voluntarily report on their sales of healthy food and are encouraged to use strategies like promotions, loyalty point incentives, and store layout changes to make nutritious options more appealing. The policy is part of a broader 10-year NHS plan aimed at making the current generation of children the healthiest ever. Critics note that while welcome, the voluntary nature of the scheme and its focus on major retailers may limit its overall impact on public health.</p>

          <p>Following a single-medal performance at the Paris Olympics, Japan's national swimming team is implementing a new strategy to improve results for the 2028 Los Angeles Games. Athletes are now living together in a "virtual athletes' village" during competitions to simulate Olympic conditions and build resilience to unfamiliar environments. The initiative aims to help swimmers, especially younger ones, adapt to challenges like travel delays and shared living quarters without it affecting their performance. The communal living arrangement has also been credited with boosting team morale and motivation ahead of the upcoming world championships in Singapore.</p>

          <p>Primary schools in Kent, UK, are trialing a new sun safety program to educate children as young as five on how to reduce their risk of skin cancer later in life. The initiative, which teaches pupils to check UV levels and apply sunscreen correctly, is planned for a nationwide rollout in 2026. Experts emphasize that sunburn in childhood significantly increases the risk of melanoma, the most serious form of skin cancer, with diagnoses projected to rise in the coming years. The program, developed by the Melanoma Fund charity, aims to instill lifelong healthy habits and empower children to take responsibility for their own sun protection.</p>

Developed by Mitsubishi Heavy Industries and JAXA, the H2A series has achieved a 98% success rate over its operational history.

          <p>An estimated crowd of over 100,000 people participated in the Budapest Pride march, turning the event into a large-scale protest against Prime Minister Viktor Orban's government. The march proceeded despite an official ban, which was based on a controversial 2021 law equating homosexuality with pedophilia. Budapest's mayor, Gergely Karacsony, defied the government and allowed the event to take place, framing it as a celebration of human rights and freedom. Many attendees, carrying signs mocking the prime minister, stated that the government's attempt to prohibit the march was the primary reason they chose to attend this year.</p>
