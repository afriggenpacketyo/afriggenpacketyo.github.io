        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Federal Reserve Chair Jerome Powell cautioned that longer-term interest rates are likely to be higher due to changes in the economy and policy. Speaking at the Thomas Laubach Research Conference, Powell noted that the era of near-zero rates is unlikely to return soon, even with long-term inflation expectations around the Fed's 2% target. He also highlighted the potential for more frequent and persistent supply shocks, creating a difficult balancing act for the Fed between supporting employment and controlling inflation. Powell has recently mentioned the likelihood that tariffs will slow growth and boost inflation, adding to the complexity of policy decisions.</p>

          <p>Walmart CFO John David Rainey warned that consumers could start seeing higher prices later this month due to tariffs, even with recently announced reductions on Chinese imports. Despite Walmart's commitment to everyday low prices, Rainey stated that the magnitude of the tariff increases is too large for retailers and suppliers to absorb. Walmart reported better-than-expected quarterly earnings and maintained its full-year forecast, while also achieving its first profitable quarter for e-commerce. The retailer expects net sales to increase, but declined to provide specific earnings guidance due to fluctuating tariff policies.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>House Republicans, particularly those from New York, are in conflict with party leadership over the $10,000 cap on the state and local tax (SALT) deduction. Some representatives from suburban districts are pushing for the cap to be abolished or significantly raised, while others, like Nicole Malliotakis, support a more modest increase to $30,000. The issue is causing a major stumbling block for Republicans trying to pass a $3.8 trillion tax proposal, as those from high-tax states face pressure from constituents who feel penalized by the current cap. Polling indicates strong voter support for candidates who advocate for restoring the ability to deduct state and local taxes.</p>

          <p>Walmart cautioned that President Trump's tariffs may soon force the company to raise prices, despite reporting solid sales growth in its most recent quarter. The retail giant's U.S. store sales rose more than 3 percent, and e-commerce sales jumped more than 20 percent, marking the segment's first profitable quarter. While maintaining its full-year financial forecast, Walmart executives expressed concerns about the impact of tariffs on the company's bottom line.

While the merger raises anti-competition concerns, Wall Street anticipates a favorable view from President Trump's Federal Trade Commission.

          <p>Teenagers have coined the term "dry texting" to describe subtle shifts in texting behavior that signal a change in the vibe of a conversation. This includes reverting to lowercase, sending short replies, or using conversation-ending comments. Dry texting is a common way for teens to realize someone is upset with them. The phenomenon highlights how technology can create subtle fault lines in communication, leading to uncertainty and anxiety. While not unique to teens, ambiguous signals can be more painful than direct confrontation, especially during adolescence.</p>
