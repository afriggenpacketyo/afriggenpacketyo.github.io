          <p>Markets across the Asia-Pacific region rose as investors processed new inflation data from China, which showed a larger-than-expected decline in consumer prices for August. China's consumer price index fell by 0.4% year-over-year, while the producer price index dropped 2.9%, indicating persistent deflationary pressures. Despite this, tech stocks in Apple's supply chain, like Foxconn and Samsung, saw gains following Apple's latest product launch. Markets in Japan, Hong Kong, and South Korea also advanced, reflecting a complex but generally positive investor reaction to the regional economic news. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>A federal judge has issued a preliminary injunction preventing President Trump from firing Federal Reserve Governor Lisa Cook, allowing her to remain in her post while her lawsuit proceeds. Trump had attempted to remove Cook "for cause," citing allegations of mortgage fraud related to conduct that occurred before she joined the Fed board. The judge ruled that Cook has a strong case that her removal violates the Federal Reserve Act, stating the "for cause" provision likely applies only to a governor's behavior while in office. This decision underscores the principle of Federal Reserve independence amid Trump's public criticism of the central bank's interest rate policies.</p>

          <p>The U.S. Men's National Team delivered a much-improved performance, defeating Japan 2-0 in a friendly match in Columbus, Ohio. Goals from Alejandro Zendejas and Folarin Balogun gave the U.S. a convincing win after a disappointing loss to South Korea days earlier. Head coach Mauricio Pochettino experimented with a 3-4-2-1 formation, providing opportunities for several players who are not regular starters to gain valuable experience. The team demonstrated better cohesion and attacking pressure, suggesting that Pochettino's strategy of using these international windows for evaluation ahead of the World Cup is beginning to show positive results.</p>

          <p>Iran and the International Atomic Energy Agency (IAEA) have signed an agreement that paves the way for resuming cooperation and inspections of Iran's nuclear facilities. The deal, announced after a meeting in Cairo, was described by IAEA Director General Rafael Grossi as "a step in the right direction." This development comes after Iran suspended cooperation with inspectors in July and amid a push by European nations to reimpose sanctions due to non-compliance with the 2015 nuclear agreement. While details are scarce, the framework addresses Iran's security concerns while outlining technical requirements for renewed IAEA oversight.</p>

          <p>An opinion article suggests that China's Greater Bay Area, encompassing cities like Hong Kong, Shenzhen, and Macau, should make a bid to host the 2036 Summer Olympics. The proposal argues that the region's existing world-class sports facilities and extensive transportation network would minimize the economic burden typically associated with hosting the Games. By utilizing venues across multiple cities, the area could avoid constructing costly new infrastructure that might fall into disuse. The article highlights the potential to showcase the region's collaborative strength and modern infrastructure on a global stage, while meeting logistical requirements like athlete housing and transit times.</p>

          <h2>Strong Rehab Performance Puts Pitcher Roki Sasaki Back in Contention for Dodgers' Postseason Roster</h2>

          <p>Los Angeles Dodgers pitcher Roki Sasaki has re-emerged as a candidate for the team's postseason roster after a dominant rehabilitation start with the Triple-A Oklahoma City team. In his outing, Sasaki pitched four shutout innings and threw multiple pitches exceeding 100 mph, demonstrating a significant improvement from previous rehab appearances. While a spot in the starting rotation is unlikely, his performance has opened the possibility of him contributing from the bullpen. The decision comes as the Dodgers' bullpen is becoming more crowded with other players returning from injury, creating tough choices for the organization as the regular season winds down.</p>

          <p>Democrat James Walkinshaw is projected to win the special election for a congressional district in Northern Virginia, a seat previously held by the late Rep. Gerry Connolly. Walkinshaw, a former chief of staff to Connolly, defeated Republican Stewart Whitson in the reliably Democratic district. His victory will further reduce the Republican majority in the House of Representatives to 219-213. A key issue in the race was President Trump's cuts to the federal workforce, a significant concern in a district where a large percentage of residents are employed by the federal government.</p>

          <p>Despite missing current earnings and revenue estimates, Oracle's stock surged after the company released extraordinary forward-looking projections that left financial analysts "blown away." The company forecasts its cloud infrastructure revenue will grow from $10 billion to $144 billion over the next five years, driven by massive new contracts for artificial intelligence data centers. This explosive growth trajectory is reflected in the company's remaining performance obligations, which soared to $455 billion. The forecast signals a seismic shift in the cloud computing landscape and positions Oracle as a major competitor to established leaders like Amazon and Microsoft. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>A new blood test capable of detecting biomarkers for Alzheimer's disease is being trialed across the UK, with hopes it could revolutionize how the condition is diagnosed. The test, which measures a protein called p-tau217, is expected to improve diagnostic accuracy from around 70% to over 90% when used alongside cognitive assessments. Currently, definitive diagnosis requires specialist brain scans or lumbar punctures, which are rarely used. If the trial is successful, this less invasive and cheaper blood test could become a standard part of NHS care, enabling earlier diagnosis and access to emerging treatments.</p>

That program was credited with helping reduce poverty and increase financial stability for tens of thousands of families. This new initiative, described as a "model for the nation," aims to support family stability, boost workforce participation, and improve child development outcomes across the state.</p>

          <p>The METRO RTA bus system in Akron, Ohio, has been named the national mass transit system of the year after a major overhaul led to a 24% increase in ridership. The transformation was driven by actively listening to passenger feedback, which led to redrawn routes, increased frequency, and service seven days a week. Under the leadership of CEO Dawn Distler, a former bus driver, the system was reinvented in 2023 without a budget increase by focusing on what riders actually needed. The success of Akron's model highlights the impact of prioritizing passenger experience in public transportation.</p>
