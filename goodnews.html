          <p>Uber is expanding its ride-sharing services to the skies, announcing a partnership with Joby Aviation, an electric air taxi manufacturer, to offer helicopter services through its app as early as next year. This initiative follows Joby's recent acquisition of Blade Air Mobility, a company that already provides helicopter and seaplane flights. Passengers will soon be able to book these aerial trips directly within the Uber app in the world's most populated cities, with Blade's existing services, like flights between Manhattan and JFK, priced at $195. This article signals Uber's ambitious push into integrating aerial mobility into its platform, building on a strategic business relationship with Joby that dates back to 2019.</p>

          <p>Online lender Klarna priced its initial public offering at $40 per share, surpassing its expected range and valuing the Swedish company at approximately $15 billion. Known for its popular "buy now, pay later" products, Klarna successfully raised $1.37 billion for the company and existing shareholders, with its shares now listed on the New York Stock Exchange under the symbol "KLAR." This IPO reflects an increased public market appetite for tech companies, despite Klarna reporting a widened net loss in the second quarter and previously delaying its public offering due to U.S. tariffs. The article emphasizes the company's strategic rebranding as a digital retail bank, making this IPO a significant test of Wall Street's confidence in its evolving business model.

          <p>Five years after its $1.3 billion acquisition, Amazon's Zoox has officially entered the U.S. robotaxi market, launching its first public service in Las Vegas. The company is initially offering free rides from select locations, with plans for broader expansion across the city and eventual paid service pending regulatory approval. Unlike competitors like Alphabet's Waymo and Tesla, Zoox's electric robotaxi features a unique, rectangular design without a steering wheel or pedals, built from the ground up around the rider experience. This article details Zoox's distinctive approach, its ambitious expansion plans to cities like San Francisco, Austin, and Miami, and the ongoing challenges and safety concerns within the burgeoning robotaxi industry, including past minor collisions and software recalls.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Wholesale prices, as measured by the Producer Price Index (PPI), unexpectedly declined by 0.1% in August, potentially offering the Federal Reserve more flexibility to approve an interest rate cut at its upcoming meeting. This decrease, following a downwardly revised increase in July, significantly missed Dow Jones estimates, with the core PPI also showing a 0.1% drop. The article notes that stock market futures gained and Treasury yields dipped after the report's release, strengthening market expectations for the Fed's first rate cut since December 2024. This development comes a week before the central bank's key policy meeting, where officials will also weigh employment data and the potential inflationary impact of President Trump's aggressive tariffs.

The dramatic increase followed the company's report of a staggering $455 billion in remaining performance obligations, a 359% rise from the previous year. This article attributes Oracle's success to being a major beneficiary of the artificial intelligence boom, particularly through its cloud infrastructure business and access to Nvidia's GPUs. Analysts were "blown away" by the figures, calling it a "momentous confirmation" of the AI trade and forecasting significant cloud infrastructure revenue growth for Oracle in the coming years.

          <p>The August Producer Price Index (PPI) unexpectedly declined by 0.1%, marking the third instance of outright deflation this year and surprising economists who anticipated a rise. This tame inflation reading is expected to bolster market expectations for a Federal Reserve interest rate cut next week, with President Trump quickly demanding a "BIG" reduction. While the immediate market reaction was muted, experts note the report's positive implications for underlying inflation fundamentals, particularly in the service sector which saw a 0.2% drop. This article provides critical analysis of the PPI data and its potential influence on the upcoming Consumer Price Index (CPI) report, which is due Thursday, and the Fed's crucial monetary policy decisions next week.

Colors are expected to progress from north to south, with peak vibrancy in the Mid-Atlantic, Great Lakes, and much of the West by mid-October, and later for southern regions. Forecasters anticipate earlier and more vibrant colors in the Northeast due to cooler, drier conditions, while warmer, wetter weather in the Pacific Northwest and Southeast may delay and subdue displays. This article also notes a broader warming trend, with fall temperatures rising across the contiguous U.S. since 1970.</p>
