          <p>Five Iranian men were arrested in the UK on suspicion of planning a terrorist act, with the Israeli embassy in London believed to be the target. While police have not confirmed the embassy as the target, citing operational reasons, reports suggest the men were planning to attack the Kensington premises. The suspects, ranging in age from 24 to 46, were apprehended across different locations in the UK, including Swindon, London, Stockport, Rochdale, and Manchester. Authorities are maintaining vigilance and have asked the public to remain alert as the investigation continues to unfold.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>In response to Republican-led legislatures in Utah and Idaho banning "unofficial flags" on government property, Salt Lake City and Boise have adopted inventive workarounds by changing their official flags. Salt Lake City's mayor proposed and the city council approved three new city flags featuring the traditional sego lily design superimposed over a pride flag, a trans flag, and a Juneteenth flag. Boise's mayor issued a proclamation retroactively making the pride flag an official city flag after the state restricted flag displays. These actions come amidst a broader trend of conservative legislatures rolling back LGBTQ+ rights, prompting reactions from city leaders aiming to affirm diversity, equity, and inclusion.</p>

          <p>For the second time in a little over a week, a U.S. Navy F/A-18E Super Hornet fighter jet assigned to the USS Harry S. Truman was lost in the Red Sea. In this latest incident, the jet went overboard when an arrestment failed during landing on the flight deck, but both aviators safely ejected and sustained only minor injuries. This follows an earlier incident where a Super Hornet fell overboard during towing in the hangar bay, with initial reports suggesting the carrier took evasive action against Houthi militants. The Truman Carrier Strike Group has experienced several serious incidents since deploying to the Middle East in September 2024, including an accidental shooting down of a U.S. fighter jet and a collision with a merchant vessel.</p>

          <p>Nvidia shares experienced a boost as the Trump administration prepares to rescind the "AI diffusion rule," which would have imposed restrictions on the export of advanced AI chips. The Department of Commerce confirmed the plan, stating that the Biden-era rule was overly complex and would hinder American innovation. Nvidia welcomed the decision, asserting that it would create opportunities for American leadership in the AI industry and generate high-paying jobs. AMD CEO Lisa Su emphasized the importance of balancing national security concerns with the need to foster growth in the American chip industry.</p>

          <p>A man, Jimmy Wayne Carwyle, has been charged with felony stalking and felony vandalism after allegedly crashing his car into a gate outside Jennifer Aniston's home in Bel-Air. Carwyle is accused of repeatedly harassing Aniston with unwanted social media, email, and phone messages, starting in March and culminating in the gate-crashing incident. Aniston's private security detained Carwyle until police arrived to arrest him, and prosecutors are requesting a bail of $150,000. If convicted, Carwyle could face up to three years in prison, with Aniston being home at the time of the incident.</p>

          <p>The Trump administration has released over 60,000 pages of records related to the assassination of Senator Robert F. Kennedy, marking the second tranche of documents to be made public. The release was ordered by President Trump with support from Robert F. Kennedy Jr., who has long questioned the guilt of convicted killer Sirhan Sirhan. The documents include details about the FBI's investigation, recordings of interviews with Sirhan and eyewitnesses, and other materials that have been digitized and made available on the National Archives website. It remains uncertain whether the newly released files will reveal significant new information about the assassination.</p>

          <p>Following a dog attack in New York City where a Chihuahua named Penny was severely injured by two pit bulls, state lawmakers are proposing "Penny's Law" to criminalize negligent dog handling. The current law considers dogs as property, limiting legal action to civil matters, but the proposed legislation would penalize owners who flee the scene of an attack and hold them accountable for their dog's behavior. The attack on Penny sparked national outrage, prompting calls for stricter laws to protect pets and hold owners responsible for their animals' actions.</p>
