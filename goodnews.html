          <p>A federal judge has disqualified Alina Habba, the acting U.S. Attorney for New Jersey and a former personal lawyer for President Trump, from participating in ongoing criminal cases. The judge ruled that her appointment was not legally valid after the administration used a series of novel personnel moves to keep her in the post beyond the legal time limit for interim appointments. This decision follows a challenge in two separate cases and finds that Habba has been exercising her duties without lawful authority since July 1, 2025. The ruling has been stayed to allow for an appeal, but it could potentially void actions she has taken and impact numerous federal cases in the state.</p>

          <p>The Pentagon has created the Mexican Border Defense Medal to recognize service members deployed to the southern border as part of President Trump's immigration enforcement efforts. This new award will replace the Armed Forces Service Medal for troops serving with Joint Task Force Southern Border, which currently includes about 8,500 personnel. To be eligible, service members must have been deployed since January 20, 2025, to support Customs and Border Protection within 100 nautical miles of the U.S.-Mexico border. The establishment of this medal coincides with the creation of national defense areas along the border, which grant U.S. troops expanded authority to assist federal law enforcement.</p>

          <div class="timestamp">2025-08-21 17:06:58 EDT</div>
        </div>
        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>A financial strategy known as a 351 conversion is gaining traction among wealthy investors as a way to defer capital gains taxes on highly appreciated assets. The process involves exchanging assets from a taxable account, such as a separately managed account (SMA), for shares in a new exchange-traded fund (ETF) before it launches. This allows the investor to avoid triggering a taxable event until they eventually sell the ETF shares. While the strategy offers significant tax advantages, it comes with strict diversification requirements and high investment minimums, often starting at $1 million. Financial advisors caution that investors must be comfortable holding the resulting ETF for the long term, as options to exit the position without incurring taxes are limited.

The store, which opened ahead of two sold-out shows at the Rose Bowl, offers exclusive merchandise, including special-edition vinyl records and an Adidas collaboration. Fans, some of whom traveled from other cities, expressed immense joy and nostalgia, reflecting the band's cross-generational appeal since its breakup 15 years ago. The event highlights the enduring passion for the band's music and brazen attitude, which has fueled the rapid sellout of their U.S. tour dates and created a celebratory atmosphere among their dedicated followers.</p>

          <p>Bad Bunny's sold-out concert residency in Puerto Rico has created an unexpected boom for local tattoo artists, as fans seek permanent souvenirs inspired by his latest album. Artists are seeing a surge in requests for culturally significant designs like the national flower and native coquí frogs, turning their studios into spaces for cultural exchange. This has provided an opportunity for Boricua tattooists to educate tourists and non-Puerto Rican fans about the deeper meaning behind the symbols they choose. The trend not only provides an economic lift during a typically slow season but also fosters a greater appreciation for the island's heritage, as artists guide clients toward respectful and meaningful tattoos.</p>

          <p>Actress Kirsten Dunst has stated her desire to star in a sequel to the highly successful "A Minecraft Movie" in order to make "a pile of cash." The veteran actress, who recently appeared in the critically acclaimed but moderately profitable film "Civil War," expressed an interest in projects with greater commercial returns. The first "Minecraft" film grossed over $955 million worldwide, a figure that surpasses the combined box office of Dunst's last three movies. Dunst, who has been acting since childhood, has several other projects in development but noted the appeal of being part of a major blockbuster franchise like the one based on the popular video game.</p>

          <h2>Federal Government Considers Easing Restrictions on Psilocybin</h2>
          <div class="timestamp">2025-08-21 16:26:44 EDT</div>
        </div>
        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>The U.S. Department of Health and Human Services is considering a petition to reclassify psilocybin, the psychoactive compound in psychedelic mushrooms, which could ease federal restrictions. The Drug Enforcement Administration (DEA) has asked for a scientific review to potentially move psilocybin from a highly restrictive Schedule I narcotic to a Schedule II substance, which would recognize its medical value despite potential for abuse. This development follows a lengthy legal effort by a Seattle doctor seeking to use the substance for end-of-life care. The move is supported by a growing body of research indicating psilocybin's benefits in treating depression, anxiety, and substance use disorders.</p>

        </div>
        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Amid rising national credit card debt and high interest rates, debt forgiveness programs offer a potential solution for some consumers, but not all will qualify. Typically, candidates for these programs, which negotiate with creditors to settle debts for less than the full amount, must have a substantial amount of unsecured debt, often over $7,500. They must also be experiencing significant financial hardship, such as job loss or a medical emergency, which makes full repayment unrealistic. Furthermore, borrowers who are already delinquent on their payments are more likely to be considered, as creditors become more willing to negotiate to avoid a total loss on the account.

          <div class="timestamp">2025-08-21 15:26:51 EDT</div>
        </div>
        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>A New York state appeals court has thrown out the massive monetary penalty imposed on President Donald Trump and his company in the civil business fraud case brought by Attorney General Letitia James. The court ruled that the fine, which had grown to over $500 million, was an "excessive fine" that violated the U.S. Constitution. However, the ruling upheld the original judge's finding that Trump and other defendants committed fraud by inflating asset values to obtain better financial terms. The non-monetary sanctions, including the appointment of an independent monitor, were also upheld. The Attorney General has announced plans to appeal the decision regarding the fine to the state's highest court.</p>

          <h2>Experts Advise Homeowners on How to Prepare for a Potential Mortgage Refinance</h2>
          <div class="timestamp">2025-08-21 15:15:45 EDT</div>
        </div>
        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>With mortgage rates trending downwards and the possibility of a Federal Reserve rate cut, financial experts are advising homeowners with high-interest loans to prepare for a potential refinancing opportunity. Key steps include checking credit reports for errors, protecting credit scores by avoiding new debt, and estimating home equity, as having at least 20% can lead to better loan terms. Homeowners should also begin gathering necessary documents like proof of income, insurance, and property deeds. By doing this preparatory work in advance, borrowers can move quickly to lock in a lower rate when the market is favorable, as refinancing opportunities can be short-lived.
