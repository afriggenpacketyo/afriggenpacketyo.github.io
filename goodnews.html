          <p>Chinese tech company Xiaomi saw its shares surge after launching its new electric SUV, the YU7, which is priced to directly compete with Tesla's Model Y in China. The company reported receiving over 200,000 pre-sale orders shortly after the launch, signaling strong market enthusiasm. This new vehicle boasts a longer driving range than its Tesla counterpart and includes various AI-powered features, though it reportedly falls short on driver-assist capabilities. The launch comes amid an intense price war in the electric vehicle market. (not investment advice)</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Nike announced that it anticipates a potential $1 billion increase in costs for the current fiscal year due to U.S. tariffs, a challenge complicating its ongoing business turnaround. The company plans to mitigate this impact by adjusting its supply chain, reducing its manufacturing presence in China, and implementing price increases. Despite a significant 86% drop in quarterly profits driven by inventory clear-outs and a shift back to wholesale, Nike's earnings beat Wall Street expectations, causing its stock to rise. The company is also realigning its focus back to sports performance and expanding its wholesale partnerships. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>In Chelsea, Massachusetts, a city vulnerable to the urban heat island effect, a project known as the "cool block" is serving as a template for mitigating extreme temperatures. An environmental group, GreenRoots, is transforming a single city block by planting over 100 trees, resurfacing the street with lighter colors, and painting rooftops white to reflect heat. These measures can significantly lower temperatures in densely developed areas that lack green space. The initiative is part of a broader effort to address the health risks of worsening heat waves driven by climate change.</p>

In an interview, he discussed his work on the Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders (DSM), which broadened the criteria for what constitutes an autism spectrum disorder. This expansion, while intended to help identify individuals who needed support, also contributed to what he describes as a "60-fold" increase in reported rates. His commentary provides insight into the complex interplay between diagnostic standards and public health statistics.</p>

A 19-year-old from Norfolk has become the first patient in Europe to receive the treatment, which was developed after researchers identified the faulty gene in her family. The condition, which can be fatal, disrupts the immune system's ability to fight infections. The approval of the drug, which works by targeting a specific overactive enzyme, marks a major breakthrough, moving from disease discovery to an NHS-approved treatment in just 12 years.</p>
