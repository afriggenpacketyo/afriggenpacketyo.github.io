          <p>Dell Technologies announced a significant increase to its long-term revenue and profit growth expectations, causing its stock to rise by 2%. The company now projects annual revenue expansion between 7% and 9%, up from a prior forecast of 3% to 4%, attributing the change to surging customer demand for artificial intelligence infrastructure. As a key partner for Nvidia, Dell is capitalizing on the need for AI servers and related technology, which it supplies to major clients like Elon Musk's xAI startup. This optimistic outlook reflects the company's successful strategy in the rapidly growing AI sector.</p>

          <p>Following his retirement announcement, legendary Los Angeles Dodgers pitcher Clayton Kershaw is being widely celebrated as a future Hall of Famer. Former MLB star Tom Gordon strongly advocated for Kershaw's first-ballot induction, citing his remarkable career 2.53 ERA, which is the lowest in MLB's live-ball era for a pitcher with at least 1,000 innings. Gordon praised Kershaw's consistent excellence, his three Cy Young Awards, and his pivotal role in leading the Dodgers for over a decade, comparing his caliber to that of Pedro Martinez and Roger Clemens.</p>

          <p>Retirees can utilize a specific type of reverse mortgage, known as a HECM for Purchase loan, to acquire a new primary residence without incurring monthly mortgage payments. This financial tool allows seniors to combine a substantial down payment, often sourced from the sale of a previous home, with funds from the reverse mortgage to cover the remaining cost of the new property. To qualify, borrowers must be at least 62 years old, undergo HUD-approved counseling, and demonstrate the ability to pay for ongoing costs like property taxes and homeowners insurance.

          <p>Thirty paintings by beloved television artist Bob Ross are being auctioned to raise funds for public television stations impacted by recent federal funding cuts. The proceeds, with an estimated total value between $850,000 and $1.4 million, will help smaller and rural stations cover licensing fees for popular programming. This initiative honors Ross's legacy of supporting the very medium that broadcast his iconic show, "The Joy of Painting," into millions of American homes, ensuring his work continues to foster creativity and support public media.</p>

          <p>Despite concerns over the current government shutdown, historical data suggests that such events have rarely derailed the stock market in the long term. An analysis of the S&P 500's performance during and after ten previous shutdowns shows that market gains are not unusual, with the index rising 36% in the year following the 2019 shutdown. Financial experts note that markets tend to be forward-looking and often discount recurring political conflicts that do not alter long-term economic fundamentals, rewarding patient investors who remain invested through the uncertainty.

          <p>Tamara Lich and Chris Barber, two prominent organizers of the 2022 "Freedom Convoy" protest that paralyzed downtown Ottawa, have been handed conditional sentences, allowing them to avoid further imprisonment. Both were found guilty of mischief for their roles in the weeks-long demonstration against COVID-19 mandates and the Trudeau government. They will serve 12 months of home confinement followed by six months under a curfew, in addition to community service, a sentence far lighter than the seven to eight years sought by the prosecution.</p>

Trump highlighted the competitive nature of their economic relationship, particularly in the automotive and steel industries, while also emphasizing the mutual affection between the two nations. The discussions are aimed at resolving trade disputes, including U.S. tariffs on Canadian imports, with Canada being the only G7 country yet to secure a new trade deal with the Trump administration.</p>

          <p>The price of gold reached a historic high on Tuesday, breaking the $4,000 per ounce barrier for the first time. This surge continues a two-year trend of record-breaking prices, creating a challenging entry point for new investors. To make gold investment more accessible, financial experts suggest strategies such as purchasing fractional gold bars and coins, which are available in smaller, more affordable weights. Another recommended approach is dollar-cost averaging, where investors buy a fixed dollar amount of gold at regular intervals to build their holdings over time. (not investment advice)</p>

          <h2>Cardiologists Recommend Fiber-Rich Afternoon Snacks for Lowering Cholesterol</h2>
          <div class="timestamp">2025-10-07 13:00:00 EDT</div>
        </div>
        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>According to cardiologists, adopting the habit of eating a fiber-rich snack in the afternoon is a highly effective way to help lower cholesterol. Soluble fiber, in particular, works by binding to cholesterol in the digestive system and preventing its absorption into the bloodstream. Beyond directly lowering LDL or "bad" cholesterol, fiber also supports a healthy weight by promoting feelings of fullness, fights inflammation, and helps regulate blood sugar levels. Healthy snack options include apples with nuts, hummus with vegetables, or yogurt with berries, which contribute to overall cardiovascular health.</p>
