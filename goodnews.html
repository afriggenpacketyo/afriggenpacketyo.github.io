          <p>Tens of thousands of people participated in the Budapest Pride march, defying threats of legal consequences from Prime Minister Viktor Orban's government. The event proceeded despite a new "child protection" law used to restrict LGBTQ-related gatherings, with attendees facing potential fines and organizers facing prison time. Participants, including European Union officials, marched to show solidarity for diversity and fundamental rights in Hungary. The demonstration highlighted the growing tension between LGBTQ advocates and the country's nationalist conservative leadership.</p>

          <p>Israel's ambassador to Japan has confirmed the country will attend the 80th-anniversary ceremony for the U.S. atomic bombing of Nagasaki this August. The invitation marks a return after Nagasaki's city government excluded Israel from the 2024 event due to the conflict in Gaza. The city government stated its intention for a more inclusive approach this year, inviting all diplomatic missions in Japan. This move signals a step towards diplomatic reconciliation, with Russia's ambassador also expected to attend for the first time since the 2022 Ukraine invasion.</p>

          <p>British authorities have seized 2.4 metric tons of cocaine, valued at approximately $132 million, from a ship arriving from Panama at the London Gateway port. The discovery, made under containers on the vessel, is one of the United Kingdom's largest drug busts in recent years. The operation was intelligence-led, and officials stated it demonstrates their commitment to disrupting criminal gangs. This significant seizure highlights Britain's role as a major European market for cocaine and the ongoing efforts by law enforcement to combat international drug trafficking.</p>

          <p>A real estate agent with a decade of experience suggests homebuyers use the "80-10-10 Rule" to determine if a property is the right fit. This guideline proposes that an ideal house should have 80% of the features you love and cannot change, like location or size. Another 10% should consist of elements you can improve over time, such as countertops or paint colors. The final 10% represents things you can learn to live with, like a neighbor's fence, ensuring that minor flaws don't derail the purchase of an otherwise suitable home.</p>

          <p>Dr. Amy Acton, who became a prominent figure as Ohio's health director during the COVID-19 pandemic, has announced her candidacy for the 2026 gubernatorial race. A Democrat appointed by a Republican governor, Acton gained a national profile for her compassionate but firm handling of the early pandemic response, which also drew intense criticism and protests. Her campaign pitch focuses on the fragility of democracy she witnessed, though she faces a tough path in a state that has shifted conservative. Her candidacy is seen as a test of how voters now view the pandemic-era policies and leaders five years later.</p>

        </div>
        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Analysts are forecasting that U.S. gas prices will fall this summer, potentially reaching their lowest levels since 2021. The national average could dip below $3 a gallon by September, following a temporary spike caused by the Israel-Iran conflict. Now that a ceasefire is in place, prices are expected to resume a slow decline due to factors like increased refinery production and softening consumer demand after early summer travel peaks. Despite recent volatility, experts note that adjusted for inflation, gas prices are near a 20-year low, with Americans spending a smaller portion of their income on fuel. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>British sportscar manufacturer Lotus has stated it has "no plans" to close any factory, following reports that it was considering ending production at its UK headquarters in Hethel. The speculation arose after the company acknowledged it was "actively exploring" global market options, including a potential new plant in the United States. Production at the Norfolk-based facility, which employs 1,300 people, was recently paused due to new U.S. tariffs on imported cars. Lotus reaffirmed its commitment to its British heritage and operations despite the market challenges.</p>
