          <p>A federal judge in Maryland has issued another nationwide injunction against President Trump's executive order aimed at ending birthright citizenship for children of undocumented or temporary residents. This marks the fourth court decision to block the policy since a key Supreme Court ruling in June limited the scope of such injunctions. The judge certified the case as a class action, arguing the plaintiffs were highly likely to win on the grounds that the order violates the 14th Amendment. The Trump administration contends that the citizenship clause does not apply to parents who lack full allegiance to the U.S.</p>

          <p>Actress Gina Carano has reached a settlement with Disney and Lucasfilm over her lawsuit for wrongful termination from the series 'The Mandalorian.' Carano, who played Cara Dune, was fired in 2021 after making controversial social media posts, including one comparing the political climate for Republicans to the persecution of Jews during the Holocaust. The lawsuit, which sought damages and her reinstatement, was notably funded by Elon Musk. While the terms of the settlement were not disclosed, Carano expressed hope that the resolution brings healing, and Lucasfilm released a statement describing her as a respected professional.</p>

          <p>For the first time on record, the Southern Small White butterfly, a species typically found in Southern Europe, has been sighted in the United Kingdom. A volunteer at the Landguard Bird Observatory in Suffolk photographed the female butterfly, confirming its presence. Experts have been tracking the species' rapid northward expansion across Europe over the past two decades, a movement believed to be partly driven by a warming climate. While its arrival is a significant ecological event, it is uncertain if the species will establish a permanent breeding population in the UK.</p>

          <p>In Ukraine, a volunteer defense group composed almost entirely of women, known as the "Witches of Bucha," has taken on the mission of shooting down Russian drones. These women, who work regular jobs by day, spend their nights watching the skies on the outskirts of Kyiv to protect their communities from nightly attacks. The group formed in response to the atrocities committed in Bucha at the beginning of the war, driven by a desire to actively contribute to the defense of their country. Their efforts are credited with saving homes and critical infrastructure from Russia's relentless drone assaults.</p>

          <p>The U.S. Marshals Service is auctioning the Amadea, a 348-foot superyacht valued at over $300 million, which was seized as part of sanctions against Russia. The vessel, which features a helideck, mosaic pool, and marble fireplace, is linked to sanctioned Russian oligarch Suleiman Kerimov. The U.S. seized the yacht in Fiji in 2022 to put pressure on allies of Vladimir Putin following the invasion of Ukraine. With a required bid deposit of $10 million, the sealed-bid auction offers a rare opportunity to purchase a vessel of extreme luxury.</p>

          <p>A growing number of people, particularly millennials and Gen Z, are moving away from dating apps and embracing old-fashioned, in-person singles events to find partners. Companies like Date Cincy are hosting events that attract hundreds of participants seeking genuine, face-to-face connections, free from the curated and sometimes misleading nature of online profiles. This trend is reflected in market data, with dating app Bumble's value plummeting and attendance at singles events rising significantly. Couples who have met at these events credit the in-person chemistry as something that cannot be replicated through a screen.</p>
