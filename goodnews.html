The suspect, identified as Sgt. Quornelius Radford, allegedly opened fire with a personal weapon, wounding five fellow service members. The soldiers who intervened were awarded the Meritorious Service Medal for their bravery. Three of the five wounded soldiers have been released from the hospital, and the other two are expected to make a full recovery, thanks in part to the immediate aid rendered by their colleagues.</p>

          <p>Eli Lilly announced that its experimental daily obesity pill, orforglipron, helped patients lose nearly 12% of their body weight in a late-stage trial, a result that paves the way for market entry but fell slightly below some analyst expectations. The company's stock dropped following the news. While the weight loss is less than that achieved by powerful injectables, doctors noted the pill could be a transformative option for patients who prefer an oral medication. The most common side effects were gastrointestinal issues, with about 10% of patients on the highest dose discontinuing due to them. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>The probability of Federal Reserve Governor Christopher Waller being the next Fed chair has surpassed 50% on the prediction market Kalshi. Waller's odds surged after reports that President Trump's advisors favor his forward-looking approach to monetary policy. He has now overtaken previous front-runners Kevin Warsh and Kevin Hassett. Waller, who was nominated to the Fed by Trump in 2020, recently dissented on the decision to hold rates steady, arguing the central bank's approach was "overly cautious." His potential nomination is seen by some as favorable for investors. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>President Trump is set to sign an executive order that will direct the Department of Labor to review guidance on including alternative assets in 401(k) retirement plans.

The alternative asset industry has long advocated for this change, which could unlock trillions of dollars in retirement savings.
