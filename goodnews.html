        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>The Transportation Security Administration (TSA) has issued a reminder that Costco membership cards are not acceptable forms of identification at airport security checkpoints. Travelers need a Real ID or another approved form of ID, such as a passport or U.S. Department of Defense ID, for domestic flights and federal facility access. The TSA clarified that while a Costco card might help establish a baseline identity if all other forms of ID are lost, it is insufficient for full verification. The agency issues routine reminders about unacceptable IDs to prevent delays at airport checkpoints. Travelers should consult the TSA website for a complete list of acceptable forms of identification. </p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>A New York judge has dismissed Justin Baldoni's $400 million defamation lawsuit against Blake Lively, his former co-star in the film "It Ends With Us". Lively had previously filed a suit against Baldoni, alleging sexual harassment on set and retaliation for reporting the incidents. Baldoni's suit claimed Lively aimed to ruin his career by falsely accusing him of sexual assault and starting a smear campaign. The judge ruled that Baldoni failed to prove Lively's threats constituted extortion or that she was responsible for defamatory statements beyond her own lawsuit, which is privileged. Lively's lawyers hailed the decision as a victory, while Baldoni has been given leave to amend his allegations related to interference with contracts. </p>

          <p>Employment attorney Diane Seltzer has won the election to lead the D.C. Bar Association, defeating securities lawyer Brad Bondi in a contest with record voter turnout. Seltzer garnered over 90 percent of the electronic vote, with more than 38,000 members participating. The race became a microcosm of broader pressures on the American legal system, partly due to Bondi's relation to Attorney General Pam Bondi. Seltzer focused her campaign on upholding the rule of law and ensuring lawyers feel safe to represent their clients. Bondi expressed disappointment that the election became politicized, with partisan attacks overshadowing discussions on training programs and pro bono work. </p>

Analysts anticipate a new nomenclature for the operating system, aligning the iOS version with the year of release (e.g., iOS 26 for 2026). A redesign of the operating system interface, called "Liquid Glass," is also rumored.

The order will remain in effect during the legal case, with the judge stating that the executive branch must adhere to the Constitution.
