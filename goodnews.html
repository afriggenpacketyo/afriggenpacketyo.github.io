          <p>Donald Trump Jr., the eldest son of former President Donald Trump, suggested he might consider running for president in the future. Speaking at an economic forum in Doha, Qatar, Trump Jr. acknowledged the possibility of entering the political arena, stating that it was an honor to be asked and see that some people are receptive to the idea. He emphasized his father's transformation of the Republican Party into an 'America First' movement and noted the emergence of a strong bench of America First fighters within the party.</p>

          <p>Vani Hari, formerly known as the Food Babe, has transitioned from dispensing dietary and fitness tips to becoming a prominent voice in the Trump administration's healthy-food agenda. Hari, who gained recognition for her activism against certain food ingredients, now advises the government on strategies to eliminate petroleum-based food dyes. While celebrated by her followers, her rise has sparked controversy among food companies and scientists who criticize her tactics as pseudoscience. Despite the division, Hari remains focused on her mission to promote healthier food choices and influence food policy.</p>

          <p>President Donald Trump visited Capitol Hill to urge House Republicans to support his 'One Big Beautiful Bill Act,' aimed at delivering on his domestic agenda. The bill, which narrowly passed a House committee vote, includes provisions on tax cuts, military spending, and immigration enforcement. Trump's visit coincided with testimony from Secretary of State Marco Rubio before the Senate Foreign Relations Committee and Health and Human Services Secretary Robert F. Kennedy Jr. before the Senate Appropriations Committee. The White House also announced that the president would make an announcement with Secretary of Defense Pete Hegseth in the Oval Office.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Four former British special forces soldiers have set a record by climbing Mount Everest in under five days without acclimatizing on the mountain, controversially aided by xenon gas. The team, including a UK government minister, summited the world's highest peak early on Wednesday, using xenon to pre-acclimatise to low oxygen at high altitudes. While this expedition is a record Everest ascent without acclimatizing in the Himalayas, it's not the fastest Everest time overall. The science around using the gas remains disputed and many in the mountaineering industry have criticized it.</p>

        </div>
        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Donald Trump's recent trip to the Middle East was successful due to his use of the American private sector as an instrument of national power, positioning the U.S. as a commercial and strategic partner rather than just an arms merchant. His approach to Middle East politics is unconstrained by domestic concerns, allowing him to make decisions that other presidents might avoid. Trump's promise of no more nation-building projects and no more lectures on how to live resonates with both Gulf Arabs and Middle America. However, the success of this strategy hinges on balancing business interests with other priorities and ensuring that the U.S. remains an attractive investment destination.</p>

Julius Randle scored 28 points for Minnesota, but Anthony Edwards was held to 18 points on 5-of-13 shooting. Oklahoma City's defense stifled the Timberwolves' offense, particularly in the second half, and the Thunder's balanced attack proved too much for Minnesota to handle.

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>The Supreme Court has upheld the legal right to wild camping on Dartmoor, rejecting an appeal by landowners who sought to restrict public access. The ruling, based on the interpretation of the 1985 Dartmoor Commons Act, affirms the public's right to 'open-air recreation,' which includes camping. The decision is likely to reignite the debate over public access to land in England, where Dartmoor National Park is a rare exception to the general lack of wild camping rights on private land. The Dartmoor National Park Association welcomed the ruling, emphasizing the importance of responsible access and respect for landowners.</p>

While the risk to the general public is considered very low and there have been no human cases acquired in the UK to date, health officials are emphasizing the importance of preventative measures.

Musk emphasized the importance of starting with a small number to ensure safety and success before scaling up the operation. Tesla has been promising fully self-driving capabilities for several years, but has yet to release a vehicle that is safe to use without human supervision.</p>

          <p>President Trump has urged House Republicans not to alter Medicaid significantly as they work to pass a bill that advances his legislative agenda. Trump's comments come as hard-liners push for stricter Medicaid cuts ahead of a vote on the bill. Another point of contention is a cap on state and local tax deductions. Trump also emphasized that the GOP is a unified party, but also added that people aren't going to get everything they want in the bill. The White House official said that Trump is losing patience with the Republican holdouts.</p>
