        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Amid a high-interest-rate environment, home equity loans and Home Equity Lines of Credit (HELOCs) are presented as more affordable borrowing options compared to personal loans or credit cards. With average home equity levels exceeding $300,000, homeowners can leverage this asset for significant funds. As of mid-September 2025, average rates for home equity loans hover around 8.3-8.4%, while the average HELOC rate is approximately 8.05%. The article notes these financial products use the home as collateral, posing a risk of foreclosure if payments are missed. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>A UK cabinet minister has dismissed President Trump's suggestion that the British military should be used to address illegal migration across the English Channel. During a state visit, Trump advocated for using military force, but Trade Secretary Peter Kyle stated that the UK Border Force is responsible for border policing. Kyle emphasized that the military's primary focus should remain on national defense and global security issues. The discussion comes as the UK government continues its "one in, one out" deportation deal with France to manage Channel crossings.</p>

        </div>
        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>The European Union has proposed moving up its ban on Russian gas imports to January 2027, a year earlier than previously planned, following pressure from the U.S. The new sanctions package aims to further reduce Moscow's revenues from fossil fuels, which sustain its war economy. The proposal specifically targets Russian liquefied natural gas (LNG) and may also include measures against Chinese refineries and banks involved in the trade. Despite significant reductions since 2022, Russia still supplied 19% of the EU's gas in 2024, largely through LNG shipments.</p>

The couple, who had lived in the country for decades running a charitable program, were freed following mediation by Qatar and have reunited with their daughter in Doha. The Taliban stated the couple had broken Afghan laws but never specified the charges. Their family expressed immense relief, highlighting the diplomatic efforts of the UK and Qatar in securing their release after months of concern over their deteriorating health in detention.</p>

          <p>Chinese shipping firm SeaLegend Line has launched its first Arctic express service, with the vessel Istanbul Bridge departing from Qingdao for Gdansk, Poland. This new Northern Sea Route is designed to be faster than the traditional Suez Canal path, targeting time-sensitive and high-value cargo like e-commerce parcels and power batteries. While the transit time is significantly shorter, the company notes that the cost per container is higher than the Suez route but lower than rail transport. This move signifies growing commercial interest in the Arctic passage as a viable shipping lane between Asia and Europe.</p>

          <h2>Apple CEO States Recent iPhone Price Hikes Are Unrelated to Tariffs</h2>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Apple CEO Tim Cook has clarified that the recent price increase for the iPhone 17 Pro model is not a result of U.S. tariffs on Chinese goods. Speaking at the new iPhone's launch, Cook stated there was "no increase for tariffs in the prices." The company has been actively shifting its supply chain to countries like India and Vietnam to mitigate the impact of the levies. Despite these efforts, Apple reported an $800 million hit from tariff-related costs in the previous quarter, making Cook's statement a significant clarification of the company's pricing strategy.</p>

          <p>Reports circulating on Chinese social media falsely claimed that Poland had officially sent troops to Ukraine, a narrative that appears to stem from a misinterpretation of comments by Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy.

However, the Polish Ministry of Defense clarified that any joint training activities would take place exclusively on Polish territory. The fact check traces how these misleading claims were amplified, often paired with unrelated news about Polish military drills near Belarus to create a sensationalist narrative.</p>

          <p>President Donald Trump and Chinese leader Xi Jinping are holding a call to finalize an agreement that would prevent the social media platform TikTok from being banned in the United States. A deal "framework" was reportedly reached earlier in the week, addressing a federal law that requires TikTok's Chinese parent company, ByteDance, to divest its U.S. operations or face a shutdown. President Trump, who has expressed a desire to keep the popular app operational, has repeatedly extended the deadline for the divestiture. The call aims to resolve the long-standing issue concerning data security and foreign influence.</p>

Atkins stated that if the rule is approved, companies could choose their reporting cadence.

          <p>Minneapolis Federal Reserve President Neel Kashkari has stated his support for two more interest rate cuts this year, in addition to the one approved this week. He argues that the inflationary impact of President Trump's tariffs will likely be a temporary, "one-time effect," allowing the Fed more room to ease policy. Kashkari's more dovish stance is influenced by a weakening labor market and contained inflation expectations, despite core inflation currently running above the Fed's 2% target.

          <p>To combat high tariffs from the ongoing trade war, retailers are adopting a "business-to-business-to-consumer" (B2B2C) model to lower costs for consumers. This strategy involves routing online sales through a third-party company that acts as a "merchant of record." This middleman buys the product from the retailer at a wholesale price and pays the U.S. tariff on that lower value before the item is shipped to the customer. Companies using this method report significant savings on tariff bills, allowing them to avoid passing the full cost increase onto their American customers.</p>
