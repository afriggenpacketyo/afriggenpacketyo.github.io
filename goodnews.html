          <p>An attempted cyber attack on Edinburgh council's education department has disrupted revision for students ahead of key exams. Staff identified a suspicious 'spear-phishing' invitation, leading to a precautionary reset of student passwords, cutting off access to online learning resources. The council assures students sitting exams will receive priority support, and no data was compromised in the attack. This incident follows a ransomware cyberattack on schools in West Lothian earlier in the week, highlighting the increasing threat of cyber attacks on educational institutions.</p>

          <p>Lee Zeldin, the EPA administrator, held a ceremony to affix a mezuza to his office door, prompting praise from some Jewish leaders but criticism from Jewish environmental activists who argue his policies weaken environmental protections. These activists believe Zeldin's actions contradict the Jewish value of repairing the world. Zeldin defended his policies as based on law and science, not religious interpretation. The event highlights the ongoing tension between religious expression and environmental responsibility within the Trump administration.</p>
