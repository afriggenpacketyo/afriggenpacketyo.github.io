          <p>A writer shares her personal experience of being advised to diet for health reasons after spending years recovering from anorexia. The diagnosis of 'very high' cholesterol forced her to confront the complex relationship between mental and physical health, challenging her post-recovery identity built on unrestricted eating. She critiques societal health messaging that conflates weight with health and the design of health apps that can trigger disordered eating habits. The essay reflects on the difficulty of pursuing physical well-being without relapsing into harmful mindsets and cultural pressures.</p>

          <p>Thirty years ago, Mike Tyson's return to boxing after a prison sentence for sexual assault set a new precedent for pay-per-view spectacles, despite the fight itself being a brief, farcical mismatch against Peter McNeeley. The event, promoted as 'He's Back,' drew a massive celebrity audience and generated a record $96 million in television revenue, proving that spectacle could trump competitive substance. This article explores how the fight established a blueprint for modern boxing events, including celebrity and influencer bouts, and reflects on Tyson's enduring, complex appeal to the public.</p>

          <p>The algorithms driving engagement on platforms like TikTok and Instagram are accelerating the evolution of language, creating a new lexicon known as 'algospeak.' Author Adam Aleksic explains in his book that the constant pursuit of virality and specific engagement metrics is fundamentally rewiring how people communicate, leading to the rapid birth and spread of new words and phrases. This phenomenon reflects a significant shift in linguistic development, driven by technology rather than traditional social interaction. The article explores how these powerful digital trends are actively transforming the future of language itself.</p>

          <p>In the Swedish city of Kiruna, a massive 113-year-old wooden church is being moved in its entirety to a new location 5 kilometers away. The relocation is necessary to protect the landmark structure from ground subsidence caused by over a century of iron ore mining. The 672-tonne church is being transported on giant rolling platforms in a complex, two-day operation. This event is a key part of a larger project to move parts of the city to safer ground, with the local mining company funding the entire relocation effort.</p>

The plan involves possibly converting grants from the 2022 CHIPS Act into equity to bolster the struggling American semiconductor giant. This development comes as SoftBank also announced a $2 billion investment in Intel, highlighting a concerted effort to revitalize the company amid fierce global competition. The potential government intervention underscores a strategy to build national champions in key industries for economic and security reasons. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>OpenAI has launched a new, lower-cost subscription plan called ChatGPT Go, initially available in India for 399 rupees (about $4.57) per month. This move is aimed at expanding the company's user base in its second-largest market by making its advanced features more accessible. The new tier offers significantly more access to the latest GPT model, higher message limits, and more file uploads compared to the free version. OpenAI plans to use feedback from the Indian launch before considering a wider global rollout of this more affordable pricing model.</p>

          <p>The private members' club chain Soho House is being taken private in a $2.7 billion (£2 billion) deal led by U.S. hotel group MCR Hotels and private equity firm Apollo. As part of the acquisition, actor and investor Ashton Kutcher will join the company's board. The move comes after the company's stock value fell significantly since its 2021 public listing, amid struggles to achieve profitability and concerns that its rapid expansion diluted its exclusive brand. The deal aims to put the hospitality group on a more stable long-term financial footing.</p>

          <p>Chinese Foreign Minister Wang Yi stated that China and India should be partners, not adversaries, during a visit to New Delhi for talks with his Indian counterpart, S. Jaishankar. The meeting marks a significant step towards normalizing relations, which have been severely strained since deadly border clashes in 2020. Both sides discussed a range of issues and expressed a desire to move forward from a difficult period in their ties. This diplomatic thaw is being seen as laying the groundwork for a potential visit by Indian Prime Minister Narendra Modi to China later this year.</p>

          <p>The US Open has reimagined its mixed doubles competition, attracting top singles stars like Carlos Alcaraz and Novak Djokovic with large cash prizes and a shorter format. The move is intended to elevate the event's profile and draw more fan interest. However, it has divided opinion within the tennis world. While some see it as a fantastic innovation for the sport, critics, including doubles specialists, argue it devalues the Grand Slam title and transforms it into a 'glorified exhibition' that sidelines career doubles players from lucrative opportunities and prize money.</p>

          <p>Researchers have used Artificial Intelligence to generate facial reconstructions of Welsh convicts who were transported to Australia in the 19th century. By combining detailed prisoner records, historical sketches, and in some cases photos of modern descendants, a team of volunteers has brought the appearances of these individuals to life. The project sheds light on the stories of people deported for crimes ranging from theft to minor offenses like trampling turnips. This initiative highlights a modern approach to historical research, making the past more tangible and deeply personal.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>A travel trend dubbed 'coolcations' is gaining momentum as tourists increasingly avoid Europe's traditional summer hotspots in favor of cooler, quieter destinations. This shift is driven by concerns over record-breaking heatwaves and wildfires in Mediterranean countries. Travelers are choosing more temperate locations like Scandinavia, Switzerland, and the Scottish Highlands, or visiting southern destinations during the milder spring and autumn shoulder seasons. This behavioral change reflects a growing adaptation to climate volatility and could have significant economic consequences for tourism-dependent southern European nations.</p>

The piece, 'Sculpture With Colour (Oval Form) Pale Blue And Red,' will now go on permanent public display in her hometown. The campaign received widespread support, including major grants from the National Lottery Heritage Fund and Art Fund, as well as over 2,800 public donations. This effort prevented the important 1940s artwork from being sold to a private buyer and leaving the UK.</p>

          <p>Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy's latest meeting with U.S. President Donald Trump was markedly less confrontational than their previous encounter, with both leaders appearing determined to show a united front. While fundamental differences remain, particularly on the necessity of a ceasefire, the discussions focused on potential U.S. security guarantees for Ukraine and a future meeting with Vladimir Putin. Zelenskyy's more conciliatory approach and improved optics helped him navigate a difficult diplomatic situation. The key outcome appears to be that Ukraine has bought more time without any catastrophic breakdown in relations.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>A new S&P report indicates that China's exports to the Global South have doubled since 2015, with a significant acceleration following the U.S.-China trade war. In the last five years alone, these exports grew by 65%, far outpacing growth to the U.S. and Western Europe. This trend suggests that uncertainties from U.S. tariffs and a slowdown in China's domestic economy are motivating Chinese firms to pivot to developing nations. Analysts predict this could lead to a new global commercial order where South-South trade becomes more central. (not investment advice)</p>
