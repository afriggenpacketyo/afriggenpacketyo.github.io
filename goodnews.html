          <p>The UK government has proposed extending the ban on destructive bottom trawling to cover 30,000km2 of UK offshore areas already designated as protected, up from the current 18,000km2. This proposal aims to safeguard rare marine animals and delicate seabed ecosystems, with Environment Secretary Steve Reed warning of irreversible ocean destruction without urgent action. The announcement coincides with a UN Ocean Conference in France and follows warnings from Sir David Attenborough about the damaging effects of bottom trawling. A 12-week consultation will seek input from the marine and fishing industry.</p>
