          <p>A meteorite that crashed through a Georgia home is estimated to be 4.56 billion years old, making it approximately 20 million years older than Earth. After a fireball was seen across the region, a University of Georgia geologist analyzed fragments and concluded the rock originated from the main asteroid belt between Mars and Jupiter. The space rock likely came from a larger asteroid that broke up about 470 million years ago. Researchers have proposed naming it the McDonough Meteorite, which represents the sixth witnessed meteorite fall recovered in Georgia, highlighting how modern technology is aiding more frequent discoveries.</p>

The SpaceX Crew Dragon capsule completed its five-month mission at the International Space Station, marking the first NASA-sponsored crew landing in the Pacific. This new landing location was chosen by SpaceX to ensure any debris from the spacecraft's trunk section falls harmlessly away from populated areas. The astronauts appeared healthy and in good spirits as they began readjusting to gravity after 148 days in space.</p>

          <p>Jen Pawol has made history by becoming the first woman to umpire a regular-season Major League Baseball game, officiating a doubleheader between the Atlanta Braves and Miami Marlins. Her debut is the culmination of a long and challenging journey that began in 2016, involving over 1,200 minor league games and extensive training. A former all-conference collegiate catcher and world champion softball player, Pawol's promotion is seen as a merit-based achievement rather than a symbolic gesture. Her milestone makes MLB the third of the four major American men's sports leagues to feature a female official.</p>

The meeting occurred ahead of a planned summit between US President Donald Trump and Russian President Vladimir Putin. Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy has firmly stated he will not make any territorial concessions, a stance that contrasts with Trump's suggestions that a land-for-peace deal might be necessary to end the conflict. European allies like France have also emphasized that Ukraine's future cannot be decided without its participation.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Federal Reserve Governor Michelle Bowman has argued in favor of implementing three interest rate cuts this year, citing concerns over a weakening job market and slowing economic growth. Bowman, who voted against holding rates steady last month, stated that a proactive policy shift is needed to avoid further deterioration in labor conditions. Her comments align with other Fed officials who have recently signaled a readiness to lower rates, with investors now pricing in a high probability of a cut at the next meeting. Bowman also noted that the central bank should look past temporary inflation from tariffs. (not investment advice)</p>

Apple's stock surged over 13% after it announced an additional $100 billion investment in the United States, bringing its total commitment to $600 billion. In response, President Trump declared that Apple would be exempt from a 100% tariff on semiconductor imports. This development provided a significant boost to the tech sector, though broader uncertainties remain regarding other potential tariffs on pharmaceuticals and goods from India.

          <p>South Korea's military has observed North Korea removing some of its propaganda loudspeakers from the inter-Korean border, signaling a potential de-escalation of tensions. This action follows South Korea's own dismantling of its speakers earlier in the week, which were used for anti-Pyongyang broadcasts that included K-pop music. The tit-for-tat psychological warfare had recently intensified after North Korea sent trash-filled balloons into the South. While this move is a positive step, tensions could rise again with upcoming large-scale U.S.-South Korea military exercises, which Pyongyang views as a rehearsal for invasion.</p>

          <p>Developers have successfully converted the abandoned 19th-century campus of St. John's College in Brooklyn into a 205-unit luxury apartment building called The Hartby. The project, which cost over $104 million, involved renovating the historic structure and adding a new wing while preserving original details like exposed brick and arched windows. The developers secured a 99-year ground lease from the adjacent church, which wanted to see the deteriorating building preserved and repurposed. The building now offers a mix of market-rate and affordable housing units, along with modern amenities like a gym, lounge, and underground parking.</p>

Other beneficial foods include tomatoes for their sun-protecting lycopene, kefir for its hydrating probiotics, and salmon for its anti-inflammatory omega-3 fatty acids. Pumpkin seeds are highlighted for their zinc content, which aids in wound healing, while orange juice provides hydration and a significant dose of vitamin C to support skin resilience.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>An Australian scientist, Karl Kruszelnicki, asserts that the mystery of the Bermuda Triangle can be debunked by simple probability and natural phenomena rather than supernatural causes. He argues that the high volume of ship and plane traffic in the area means the number of disappearances is statistically no different from any other well-traveled part of the ocean. This view is supported by organizations like NOAA and Lloyd's of London, which point to factors like volatile weather from the Gulf Stream, complex navigation, and potential magnetic compass anomalies. Ultimately, the combination of nature and human error sufficiently explains the incidents.</p>

          <p>Bestselling author Mel Robbins argues that parents who are constantly on their phones are modeling behavior that can hinder their children's development and future success. She advises that parents cannot expect their kids to have a balanced relationship with technology if they themselves do not model it. Robbins suggests creating physical distance from devices after work and during family time to curb mindless use. By shifting from a controlling to a curious approach about their children's phone activities, parents can foster better connections and help their kids avoid the negative impacts of excessive screen time.</p>
