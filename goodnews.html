          <h2>Travel Experts Advise on When to Purchase Early Boarding Upgrades for Flights</h2>
          <div class="timestamp">2025-08-02 07:00:02 EDT</div>
        </div>
        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>According to travel experts, the primary reason for purchasing an early boarding upgrade on a flight is to secure overhead bin space for carry-on luggage. With airlines increasingly charging for perks, passengers without elite status or premium tickets often board last, risking having to check their bags. While some co-branded credit cards offer priority boarding, another option is to buy the upgrade as an add-on, which can cost around $24 on some carriers. Experts suggest that for travelers prioritizing overhead space, the fee can be a worthwhile expense to avoid inconvenience at the gate.</p>

          <h2>Medical Experts Explain Neobladder Reconstruction Surgery for Cancer Patients</h2>

        </div>
        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Following Pro Football Hall of Famer Deion Sanders's recent procedure for bladder cancer, surgeons are detailing the process of neobladder reconstruction. The surgery involves removing the patient's bladder and creating a new one from a section of their small intestine. Because the new organ is made from the patient's own tissue, it avoids immune system rejection and the need for immunosuppressant drugs. While the procedure allows for a relatively normal life, patients must retrain themselves to use the restroom, as the neobladder cannot signal the brain, and often face issues with incontinence.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>U.S. and Panamanian officials report a dramatic drop in migrant crossings through the Darién Gap, with numbers falling to nearly zero in June. The significant decrease, a 99.98% drop from its peak in August 2023, is being attributed to President Trump's aggressive immigration crackdown and a new enforcement push by Panama's government. The White House and DHS state that the coordinated efforts, including mass deportations, are deterring migrants from attempting the dangerous jungle journey. Officials claim the message that U.S. borders are closed to illegal entry is spreading globally, leading to the sharp decline in attempts.</p>

          <p>A growing number of major Jewish American organizations, including traditionally staunch supporters of Israel like the American Jewish Committee, are publicly expressing deep concern over the humanitarian crisis in Gaza. As a UN-backed group warns of a worsening famine, these organizations are urging Israel and all involved parties to ensure aid reaches Palestinian civilians. This shift reflects a broadening discomfort within the American Jewish community over the war's civilian toll, moving beyond left-leaning groups to include more mainstream institutions. The statements often balance support for Israel's security with an appeal to Jewish values and international humanitarian law.</p>

          <p>A Los Angeles Times opinion column pushes back against claims that the Lakers' 2020 NBA championship, won in the Orlando 'Bubble,' is somehow less legitimate. The article refutes comments from figures like 76ers executive Daryl Morey, arguing that the unique challenges of the COVID-19 pandemic made the victory more, not less, impressive. The author emphasizes the courage and mental fortitude required for players to compete in isolation during a global health crisis that affected many personally. The column concludes that dismissing the title is rooted in jealousy and a failure to appreciate the extraordinary circumstances under which it was achieved.</p>

          <p>The Netflix animated film 'K-pop Demon Hunters' has become a massive hit in South Korea, where it is praised for its authentic and detailed portrayal of Korean culture. The movie, which follows a K-pop girl group that secretly fights evil, includes subtle nods to Korean folklore, history, and even everyday mannerisms, such as how utensils are placed at a restaurant. This verisimilitude is credited to a production team that conducted extensive research in South Korea. The film's popularity highlights a trend of global cultural products that are increasingly fluid, blending diaspora talent with local sensibilities to create something universally appealing.</p>

The employees at three Oakland and one Berkeley location voted 22-to-5 to join the Blue Bottle Independent Union. The newly organized workers are seeking higher wages to cope with the high cost of living, improved benefits, and the return of perks lost after Nestlé acquired the company. This victory follows a similar successful unionization effort by Blue Bottle workers in the Boston area last year.</p>

          <p>Colombia's former President Álvaro Uribe has been sentenced to 12 years of house arrest for witness tampering and bribery, marking the first time a Colombian head of state has been convicted in a criminal trial. The court found Uribe guilty of paying jailed paramilitaries to retract testimony linking him to right-wing militia groups responsible for atrocities during the country's civil war. In addition to the house arrest, Uribe was fined and barred from holding public office for over eight years. Uribe denies the charges, claiming the verdict was political, while human rights groups have praised it as a landmark moment for accountability.</p>

          <p>Australian cricketer David Warner has cast doubt on English batter Joe Root's prospects for the upcoming Ashes series in Australia. Speaking to the BBC while in England for The Hundred tournament, Warner pointed out that Root has yet to score a century in Australia and is often troubled by bowler Josh Hazlewood. Warner cheekily advised Root to 'take the surfboard off his front leg,' a reference to a perceived technical flaw in his batting stance. The comments add a layer of psychological gamesmanship to the rivalry ahead of the highly anticipated series, which begins in late November.</p>

The crew consists of astronauts from the U.S., Russia, and Japan, bringing the total number of inhabitants on the station to eleven. While this is a fast transit time by U.S. standards, it falls short of the Russian record of just three hours.

The ruling affirms a lower court's decision, which found a 'mountain of evidence' that federal enforcement tactics were unconstitutionally targeting people based on factors like race or language. The lawsuit was filed by advocacy groups on behalf of detained immigrants and U.S. citizens who were swept up in raids. The court's decision is a significant check on the administration's aggressive immigration strategy in the region.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>A Chinese-led research team has made a groundbreaking discovery about the evolutionary history of the potato. By analyzing the genomes of various potato species, scientists found that the modern potato originated from a hybridization event that occurred about nine million years ago between an ancestor of the tomato and a tuberless, potato-like plant. This ancient cross-breeding was a key driver in the development of the tuber, the starchy part of the plant that has made it a staple food crop worldwide. The findings, published in the journal Cell, shed new light on the origins of this globally important food source.</p>
