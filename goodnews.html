          <p>Garment manufacturers in China and Vietnam experienced a small sense of relief after US President Donald Trump indicated that the United States was not looking to make sneakers and T-shirts. However, businesses are not altering their strategies based on these comments, as they have learned that Trump's policies can change rapidly. Despite a 90-day pause in US tariffs, uncertainty remains high, and both countries are seeking a deal with Washington to prevent further increases in duties. Vietnam's textile exporters are now focusing on diversifying their markets to mitigate the impact of potential trade disruptions.</p>

Hartley believes that working at the garden center helps him stay grounded and takes the pressure off his cricket performance, knowing there is something for him after cricket.

Agriculture Minister Shinjiro Koizumi stated that contracts with some companies would be finalized soon, with deliveries potentially beginning Thursday.

          <p>Japan has approved a $6.3 billion spending package to support businesses and households adversely affected by U.S. tariffs. The funds will bolster the finances of small and medium-sized businesses and subsidize household energy costs. This action comes as Japan faces an expected economic slowdown due to U.S. levies, public anger over higher consumer prices, and pressure to reduce government debt. President Trump has paused a 24 percent tariff on Japanese goods until early July, but the automotive sector is already reeling from a 25 percent U.S. tariff on finished automobiles and car parts.

          <p>Chinese scientists have challenged Darwinian evolution by proving that acquired traits can shape heredity without DNA changes. A study published in Cell showed that rice plants subjected to cold stress passed on an adaptive tolerance to low temperatures across five generations, bypassing genetic mutations. This research revives the 19th-century theory of Lamarck, suggesting that organisms can pass on learned survival traits. The team, from the Chinese Academy of Sciences, pinpointed heritable DNA methylation changes as the driver of cold adaptation in crops, positioning Lamarckism as a potent force in evolution.</p>
