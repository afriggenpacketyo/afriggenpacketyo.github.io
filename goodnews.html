          <p>A federal judge ruled that President Trump's executive order targeting the law firm Perkins Coie is unconstitutional, permanently blocking the administration from enforcing it. Judge Beryl Howell found that the order, which sought to punish the firm, violated the First, Fifth, and Sixth Amendments. The judge said that the directive sent the message that "lawyers must stick to the party line, or else." Howell wrote that the executive order was contrary to the Constitution, which requires that the government respond to dissenting or unpopular speech or ideas with 'tolerance, not coercion.'</p>

          <p>President Donald Trump is reportedly considering an executive order to regulate Name, Image, and Likeness (NIL) deals in college athletics after meeting with former Alabama head coach Nick Saban. Saban expressed concerns that the influx of money has negatively impacted college sports. Saban wants NIL payments "reformed," urging Congress to step in and make NIL "equal across the board." The NCAA recently passed rules allowing colleges to pay athletes, following a multibillion-dollar lawsuit settlement. Sen. Tommy Tuberville believes Trump can effectively regulate NIL.</p>

          <p>United Airlines will cancel 35 roundtrip flights a day from its schedule at Newark Liberty International Airport after experiencing significant disruptions. CEO Scott Kirby cited air traffic controller staffing shortages and FAA technology problems as the cause. The flight cuts represent approximately 10% of United's daily schedule at its Newark hub. Kirby said the airline is urging the FAA to more tightly control capacity at the airport, similar to restrictions at other congested airports. He praised the Trump administration for vowing to invest and fix aging air traffic control infrastructure in the U.S.</p>

          <p>Temu, the Chinese e-commerce platform, has ceased shipping products from China to the United States, opting to ship all U.S. orders from local warehouses. This change follows the Trump administration's decision to close a loophole that allowed low-cost Chinese goods to enter the U.S. without import fees. The company stated that pricing for U.S. consumers remains unchanged as it transitions to a local fulfillment model. More companies have used the loophole in recent years to ship inexpensive products directly to U.S. customers without having to pay import fees.</p>

His appointment comes at a tense time for the UC system and elite universities nationwide, which are under attack by President Trump's actions to purge higher education of what he derides as ‚Äúwoke‚Äù and ‚ÄúMarxist‚Äù ideologies. Milliken has led large public university systems for over 25 years, including the City University of New York. He will confront federal investigations and funding threats, as well as proposed budget reductions.</p>

          <p>Benjamin Qin Muji, a 15-year-old philosopher, argues that artificial intelligence can think and is therefore conscious, but cannot feel pain because it lacks a biological body. Benjamin argued that artificial intelligence , with its remarkable ability to process multiple streams of information and synthesise new ideas, could indeed think and, therefore, was conscious. The reasoning was so convincing that it vaulted Benjamin to top place among the more than 70 competitors in the trials. He believes the question of AI consciousness is important because of its significant implications.</p>

The PIN verification message visible in Hockstein's photo is different than what normally appears on the Signal app. The altered PIN message suggests Waltz is using software from a company called TeleMessage, which adds an archiving capability to cloned versions of messaging apps.</p>

The device doesn't store any biometric data, but stores that info on the user's device, according to World's website. The Orb's human-verification process is designed to be used in the World App, which is a digital wallet that gives people access to decentralized finance and cryptocurrencies.
