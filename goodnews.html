          <p>The second China-Central Asia Summit in Astana, Kazakhstan, highlighted Beijing's strengthening economic and political ties with countries in the region, including Kyrgyzstan, Uzbekistan, Turkmenistan, and Tajikistan. Agreements worth nearly $25 billion were signed between China and its regional partners, and China National Nuclear Corporation will lead a project to build another nuclear power plant in Kazakhstan. The European Union is also seeking to expand ties with Central Asia for raw materials, while Russia maintains strong security ties through the Collective Security Treaty Organisation (CSTO). These developments indicate a growing competition for influence in this strategically important region.</p>

          <p>Jane Dorotik, convicted in 2001 for the murder of her husband Bob, has had her conviction overturned after spending two decades in prison, due to the emergence of new evidence. Working with the Loyola Project for the Innocent, re-examination of blood evidence from the couple's bedroom revealed inconsistencies and previously untested samples. Despite maintaining her innocence, Dorotik was found guilty based on blood spatter evidence and a bloody syringe found in her home. The San Diego County District Attorney's Office ultimately recommended her conviction be overturned, and while initially planning to retry her, eventually dropped the charges due to insufficient evidence.</p>

          <p>Hong Kong and mainland China residents quickly adopted the new Payment Connect service on its launch day, facilitating cross-border money transfers. The service, linking Hong Kong's Faster Payment System (FPS) to mainland's Internet Banking Payment System (IBPS), allows users to transfer money for various daily activities. China's financial authorities granted Hong Kong residents a new daily remittance quota for the yuan, which HKMA chief executive Eddie Yue Wai-man said would boost the city's status as a financial center. The 17 million FPS registered users can remit up to HK$10,000 per day to 298 million users of the IBPS.</p>

          <p>Two Chinese studies suggest that the spleen could become a hub for treating diabetes through advances in cell transplantation. Researchers at Nanjing University found that "shielding" islet cells could improve their survival after being transplanted into the spleen to treat type 1 diabetes. The spleen, engineered with nanoparticles, could be a more promising long-term survival site for transplanted cells than the liver. Professor Dong Lei suggests that the spleen could become an ideal organ for islet transplantation pending systematic clinical studies, which could impact the millions affected by diabetes worldwide.</p>
