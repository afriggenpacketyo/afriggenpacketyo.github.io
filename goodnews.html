          <p>Singapore's economy grew by 2.9% year-on-year in the third quarter, surpassing economists' expectations of 1.9%, despite a slowdown from the previous quarter's 4.5% expansion. Manufacturing and construction sectors saw softened growth, though global AI investment is projected to support manufacturing, and infrastructure spending will benefit construction and financial services. The central bank, while maintaining current policy, forecasts a moderation to a near-trend pace in 2026 due to external developments. Non-oil domestic exports declined significantly in August, particularly to the U.S. and China. (not investment advice)</p>

Notably absent was Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu, whose office cited a Jewish holiday. Trump declared a "new dawn" for the region, emphasizing the start of Gaza's rebuilding phase.</p>

          <p>Missouri has enacted a new hands-free driving law, making it illegal to use handheld cellphones while operating a vehicle, with fines starting at $150 for first offenses. This legislation was championed by Adrienne Siddens, whose husband was killed by a distracted driver in 2019. Distracted driving accounts for about nine deaths daily in the U.S., and the Missouri Department of Transportation is now using telematics data to identify high-risk areas. The goal is to enhance educational programs and law enforcement visibility in these "hot spots" to reduce accidents.</p>

          <p>California Governor Gavin Newsom has signed Assembly Bill 247, immediately increasing the wages of incarcerated individuals fighting wildfires from approximately $1 per hour to the federal minimum wage of $7.25 per hour. These wages remain below the state minimum, but the legislation is a significant step in addressing social justice concerns regarding the dangerous work. The bill allocates $10 million for these raises and builds on previous legislation allowing nonviolent incarcerated firefighters to expunge their records. The state's prison fire crews are crucial to wildfire suppression efforts.</p>

          <h2>California Governor Newsom Approves Bill to Study Youth Sports Inequalities</h2>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>California Governor Gavin Newsom has signed Assembly Bill 749, establishing a commission to investigate inequalities in youth sports access across various demographics, including race, sex, sexual orientation, gender identity, and disability. The legislation aims to determine if a new state board is needed to improve participation. While its author emphasized racial disparities in sports access, Republican critics argue the bill, particularly its inclusion of "gender identity," is a veiled attempt to support transgender athletes in women's sports. Public opinion on transgender athlete issues remains complex, reflecting broader societal debates.</p>

          <p>CNBC's Jim Cramer voiced apprehension regarding Monday's market rally, attributing it to an excessive number of speculative stocks rather than established, reliable companies. While the Dow Jones, S&P 500, and Nasdaq Composite rebounded significantly after President Trump's softened stance on China tariffs, Cramer highlighted that the biggest gains were seen in volatile, often unprofitable companies, particularly in nuclear power and quantum computing sectors. He warned that this market froth, characterized by rapid price climbs in speculative names, indicates unhealthy leadership and a lack of a full recovery. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>A newly married couple sought advice on Reddit regarding the ethical implications of using wedding donations, explicitly intended for a house down payment, to instead pay off high-interest credit card and personal loan debt.

While some commenters argued it was misleading, the majority believed it was a financially sound and ethically justifiable decision, as reducing debt accelerates their ability to save for a home.

          <p>California Governor Gavin Newsom has signed Senate Bill 495, significantly easing the process for fire victims to claim personal property losses. Under the new law, survivors whose residences are totally destroyed can receive 60% of their personal property coverage, up to $350,000, without submitting an itemized list. This streamlines relief, extending the claim filing period to at least 100 days. Newsom also signed SB 429, funding the nation's first public wildfire catastrophe model, which will provide a transparent benchmark for insurance companies' proprietary models used in rate setting, addressing concerns about climate change and equitable outcomes.</p>
