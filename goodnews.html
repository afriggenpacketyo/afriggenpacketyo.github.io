          <p>Labour leader Sir Keir Starmer delivered a keynote speech at the party's conference in Liverpool, rallying his party and setting out his vision for the country. He primarily targeted Reform UK, framing the upcoming political choice as "renewal or decline" and directly criticizing Nigel Farage. Starmer also addressed migration with "hard truths," acknowledging discomfort within his party while rejecting past approaches. A key policy announcement included scrapping the 50% university target, aiming instead for two-thirds of young people to pursue higher education or "gold standard apprenticeships." The speech emphasized a new form of patriotism and hinted at tough budget decisions ahead.</p>

          <p>A potential U.S. government shutdown starting October 1 will not impact the monthly Social Security payments for 74 million Americans, as these benefits are funded through mandatory spending. However, the Social Security Administration (SSA) warns that some services, including benefit verifications, earnings record corrections, and the issuance of replacement Medicare cards, may be temporarily disrupted. While nearly 90% of SSA employees are considered essential and will continue working, about 6,200 could be furloughed. Additionally, the annual Cost-of-Living Adjustment (COLA) announcement might be delayed if the Labor Department's Consumer Price Index data release is affected by the shutdown.</p>

          <p>Pfizer has agreed to reduce the cost of some prescription drugs for Medicaid recipients, aligning with the Trump administration's "most favored nation" policy aimed at lowering U.S. drug prices. This agreement follows President Trump's executive order threatening tariffs on pharmaceutical imports unless companies build manufacturing plants in the U.S. Concurrently, the White House plans to launch "TrumpRX," a direct-to-consumer website for prescription drug purchases. While details on the exact price reductions are pending, the move is part of the administration's broader effort to cut healthcare costs, contrasting with Democratic concerns over healthcare affordability and potential government shutdown impacts.

          <p>Canadian authorities have identified human remains found in a Saskatoon well in 2006 as Alice Spence, a woman born in 1881 who moved to Canada in 1913. Known as "The Woman in the Well," her partially dismembered remains were found in a barrel, wrapped in a burlap sack, with clothing dating to the early 20th century. Despite years of investigation, a DNA profile and facial reconstructions yielded no leads until 2023, when forensic genetic genealogy helped link her to descendants. Investigators now believe Spence died under suspicious circumstances between 1916 and 1918, marking the oldest Canadian cold case solved using this innovative method.</p>

          <p>Atletico Madrid manager Diego Simeone has been issued a one-match ban by UEFA for "unsporting conduct" after clashing with Liverpool supporters at Anfield. The incident unfolded following Liverpool's 92nd-minute winning goal, when Simeone reacted visibly to what he described as continuous "insults throughout the whole game" from the home crowd. Although he later expressed regret for his part in the confrontation, he also highlighted the pressure managers face. This suspension will see him miss his side's upcoming UEFA fixture against Eintracht Frankfurt. Additionally, Liverpool was fined 4,000 euros for the throwing of objects by its fans during the match.</p>

          <p>Scientists at Oregon Health & Science University have achieved a significant breakthrough by creating early-stage human embryos using DNA from skin cells, then fertilizing them with sperm. This innovative technique, termed "mitomeiosis," involves placing a skin cell's nucleus into a donor egg stripped of its genetic material, then prompting the egg to discard half its chromosomes. While still requiring refinement and years away from clinical use, this method offers hope for infertile individuals and same-sex couples to have genetically related children. The research, published in Nature Communications, also sparks crucial ethical debates about "designer babies" and potential misuse of genetic material.</p>
