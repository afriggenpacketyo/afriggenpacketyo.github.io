          <p>Jared Kushner and Steve Witkoff discussed their unconventional approach to brokering a peace deal between Israel and Hamas, leading to a ceasefire and hostage exchange. They emphasized building trust through direct relationships and a "pragmatic realism" philosophy, navigating challenges like an Israeli missile strike in Qatar. The 20-point plan included hostage returns and phased Israeli withdrawal, despite Hamas's previous actions, which included sexual assault and murder. They addressed ethical concerns about their business ties, asserting their actions served American interests. The article highlights their confidence in the deal's success despite its fragility.</p>

          <p>Amy Sherald, renowned for her portraits of Black Americans, discusses her artistic philosophy, including her distinctive use of grayscale for skin tones to emphasize humanity over race. Her journey from struggling artist gained prominence after painting Michelle Obama's official portrait. This article highlights Sherald's decision to cancel a Smithsonian exhibition due to concerns about potential censorship of her "Trans Forming Liberty" painting by museum officials. Her work, which often features subjects staring directly at the viewer, is described as patriotic and a reimagining of American Realism to include everyone.</p>

          <p>China's upcoming Five-Year Plan for 2026-2030 continues a tradition of strategic planning that has profoundly reshaped the global economy. This article highlights three pivotal plans: "Reform and Opening Up" (1981-84) which initiated market reforms and led to the "China shock" of outsourced manufacturing; "Strategic Emerging Industries" (2011-15) which focused on green technology, giving China dominance in EVs and rare earths; and "High Quality Development" (2021-25) aiming for technological self-reliance. These plans demonstrate China's long-term vision and its significant impact on international trade, technology, and geopolitics.</p>

          <p>The UK government plans to introduce new vocational "V-level" courses for 16-year-olds, replacing existing Level 3 BTecs and other technical qualifications to simplify the post-16 education landscape. This initiative aims to increase vocational training, aligning with a target for two-thirds of young people to pursue university or technical qualifications. Additionally, an alternative qualification will be offered to reduce the number of students resitting maths and English GCSEs, a policy that has proven controversial due to low pass rates. The goal is to provide more practical, employment-focused pathways and address barriers to opportunity.</p>

          <p>Liu Qian, a prominent expert, provides an expert perspective on the US-China rivalry, arguing that its economic impact is often exaggerated. She highlights that while trade protectionism is a concern, exports to the US constitute a small fraction of China's GDP, with ASEAN and the EU being larger export destinations. The article emphasizes the deep technological interdependence between the two nations, citing global supply chains for semiconductors and AI. It suggests these factors create powerful incentives for major economies to avoid systemic breakdown despite ongoing competition, fostering a nuanced understanding of the relationship.</p>

          <p>A five-day strike by thousands of registered nurses and other healthcare workers at Kaiser Permanente facilities in California, Hawaii, and Oregon has ended. Union leaders and Kaiser Permanente confirmed the conclusion of the strike, which involved approximately 30,000 employees. Bargaining is set to resume this week, with a primary focus on "economic issues" such as competitive wages, which unions argue are crucial for retaining and recruiting staff to address staffing and patient care concerns. Kaiser stated that facilities remained staffed by physicians, managers, and nearly 6,000 contracted workers during the strike.</p>

          <p>This opinion article argues that the world has already entered a multipolar order, raising the question of whether great powers will manage this transition through "patient statecraft" or confrontation. It draws parallels to Germany's rise in the 19th century and contrasts it with the Nixon-Zhou Enlai rapprochement. The article highlights two distinguishing factors for today's competition: the irrationality of total war due to nuclear weapons and the unprecedented costs of systemic rupture due to technological interdependence. It suggests these factors create powerful incentives for major economies to avoid breakdown, advocating for managed accommodation.</p>
