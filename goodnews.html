          <p>Japanese markets reacted positively to Prime Minister Shigeru Ishiba's resignation announcement, with the Nikkei 225 rising 1.5% and the Topix reaching a record high. The political shift, coming after a national election defeat, has investors eyeing potential successors like Koizumi Shinjiro and Takaichi Sanae, with Takaichi's pro-deregulation and anti-interest rate hike views potentially driving further growth. Concurrently, the Japanese yen weakened, and bond yields increased due to persistent inflation and fiscal uncertainty. The article also notes mixed performance in other Asia-Pacific markets and a slight rise in oil prices following OPEC+'s decision to slow production increases. (not investment advice)</p>

Chief Operating Officer Yang Qian highlighted the critical role of AI in enabling robots to perform complex tasks autonomously, noting that AI for robotics still trails advancements in generative AI for chat. The startup, already generating revenue from institutional sales, plans to prepare for an initial public offering next year. (not investment advice)</p>

          <h2>Unexpected Discovery: Mars Found to Possess a Solid Inner Core, Challenging Planetary Models</h2>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>A collaborative China-US study, analyzing seismic waves from marsquakes recorded by NASA’s now-retired InSight lander, has unexpectedly revealed that Mars possesses a solid inner core. This core, approximately 600 kilometers in radius, constitutes about 18% of Mars’ radius, a proportion similar to Earth’s inner core. The discovery challenges previous scientific assumptions, as most bodies in the solar system have not cooled fast enough to form a solid inner core, suggesting Mars' internal cooling processes may be more rapid than anticipated. Geologist Ross Mitchell indicates this finding could also revive the long-debated idea that Earth was not the only planet to have once developed plate tectonics.</p>

Dr. Louise Jenkins, head of midwifery at Anglia Ruskin University, explains that "cryptic pregnancies," where the mother is unaware, affect about one in 2,500 births, highlighting the risks of missed antenatal care.

Candace Browning of BofA noted that a weakening US dollar and anticipated Federal Reserve policy easing in 2025-2026 are spurring inflows into Asia equities and debt funds.

          <p>Stargazers across Asia, significant portions of Europe, and Africa were treated to a captivating "blood moon" during a total lunar eclipse on Sunday night. This celestial event, which has fascinated humans for millennia, occurs when the sun, Earth, and moon align, causing the Earth's shadow to cast an eerie, deep red hue upon the lunar surface. Astrophysicist Ryan Milligan clarified that the moon appears red because the only sunlight reaching it is reflected and scattered through Earth’s atmosphere, with shorter blue wavelengths dispersing more easily than red ones. The article notes that while Asia, including India and China, had the best view, Europe and Africa experienced a partial eclipse at moonrise.</p>

Tributes from California's top politicians hailed him as a "towering figure" who profoundly shaped the state's political landscape. After a period away from politics to address a cocaine addiction, he returned to serve in the state assembly and Senate, later founding a nonprofit dedicated to foster youth, successfully advocating for over 50 legislative reforms.</p>
