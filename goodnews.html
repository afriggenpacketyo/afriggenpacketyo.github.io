          <p>The European Court of Justice is considering a case regarding a transgender woman in Bulgaria whose request to change her identity documents to reflect her lived gender was denied. An Advocate General has advised the court that Bulgarian law may infringe on the individual's right to freedom of movement within the EU. The opinion suggests that EU law should preclude national legislation that prevents legal recognition of gender identity, even without gender reassignment surgery, to ensure individuals can identify themselves without issues. This case highlights the ongoing struggle for transgender rights and recognition across Europe.</p>

Speaking to witnesses is crucial for understanding what happened and proving liability.
