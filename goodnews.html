          <p>Chevron has won a significant arbitration case against Exxon Mobil concerning the rights to Hess Corporation's valuable offshore oil assets in Guyana. The ruling, from the International Chamber of Commerce, dismisses Exxon's claim of first refusal and allows Chevron to proceed with its $53 billion acquisition of Hess. This decision resolves major uncertainty that had been weighing on Chevron's stock, which saw a subsequent increase in premarket trading. Exxon stated that while it disagrees with the interpretation, it respects the arbitration process. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>China's government has announced a five-year plan to stimulate its service sector by reducing restrictive measures and attracting more foreign investment. Commerce Minister Wang Wentao stated the goal is to address a shortage of high-quality services, particularly in healthcare and elderly care, and to enrich the supply available to consumers. This strategic shift emphasizes boosting domestic demand as a more reliable engine for economic growth, especially as the country navigates an uncertain global trade environment and ongoing trade disputes with the United States.

          <h2>Analysis Suggests Trump's Policies Are Increasing Public Support for Immigration</h2>
          <div class="timestamp">2025-07-18 07:30:00 EDT</div>
        </div>
        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Recent polling data suggests a significant shift in American public opinion, with attitudes becoming more favorable toward immigration since Donald Trump took office. After years of growing restrictionist sentiment, a record 79% of Americans now view immigration as a good thing for the country, according to Gallup. This reversal appears to be a reaction to the administration's aggressive enforcement policies, such as suspending asylum programs and increasing raids. While support for some measures like a border wall remains, the overall trend indicates that seeing Trump's hardline agenda in practice is making the public more pro-immigrant.</p>

          <p>Financial advisors specializing in family-run businesses and investment offices stress the importance of establishing clear, formal structures when employing relatives. Joshua Gentine, whose family founded Sargento Foods, notes that many family enterprises lack objective rules for hiring, promotion, and performance management. This ambiguity can lead to high turnover among non-family executives and put managers in difficult positions. Experts recommend creating formal development plans, setting objective goals, and using independent advisors for difficult decisions to prevent conflicts and ensure the business remains competitive and professionally managed.</p>

          <p>British boxer Daniel Dubois is set to face Ukrainian champion Oleksandr Usyk in a highly anticipated heavyweight title rematch at Wembley Stadium. Dubois, who lost their first encounter, aims to unify the division by defeating the undefeated Usyk, who holds three of the four major belts. Analysts suggest Dubois's strategy will need to be more aggressive, focusing on body shots, a tactic that appeared to trouble Usyk in their previous fight despite a controversial low-blow ruling. Having rebuilt his career with three consecutive wins, Dubois and his team believe he has gained the confidence and maturity to seize the moment.</p>

He plans to begin construction on the project's first phase later this year. Matteson also hinted at a potential expansion of the ambitious four-tower development, stating, "There's more to come."</p>

          <p>A moment from a Coldplay concert in Massachusetts has become an internet sensation after the arena's "kiss cam" focused on a man and a woman who reacted with horror instead of affection. As their image appeared on the big screen, the woman buried her face in her hands while the man ducked out of view. Online sleuths quickly identified the pair as the married CEO of a software company and his female head of human resources, fueling widespread speculation of an affair. Singer Chris Martin commented from the stage, "Either they’re having an affair or they’re very shy."</p>

          <p>This article posits that the 2028 Democratic presidential primary is unofficially underway, with potential candidates already positioning themselves within the party's main ideological camps. One camp consists of centrists, like Ruben Gallego and Rahm Emanuel, who argue the party has become too progressive and must moderate to win. The other camp is the populist left, successors to Bernie Sanders like Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez, who believe the party fails when it doesn't deliver on bold, transformative policies. The eventual nominee will face the challenge of uniting these factions while confronting a difficult electoral map.</p>
