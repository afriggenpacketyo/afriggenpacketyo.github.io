          <p>Starbucks is piloting a new banana-flavored protein cold foam at five locations in the U.S., paired with their iced latte. This move comes as protein drinks and snacks have seen a surge in popularity. The protein beverage sector is now a $6 billion industry. This test is part of a broader initiative to revamp the Starbucks menu. The company is testing an array of new products at select U.S. locations known as the Starting Five before launching them nationally. To make way for these new items, Starbucks plans to reduce its food and beverage offerings by 30% by the end of Fiscal Year 2025, aiming to create a more intentional and thoughtful experience for customers.</p>

          <p>This article explores how society often prioritizes romantic relationships over friendships, leading to a decline in the latter when people become romantically involved. Rhaina Cohen, author of "The Other Significant Others: Reimagining Life With Friendship at the Center," notes that our culture places unnecessary limits on friendship, despite historical evidence showing the importance of platonic bonds. The article suggests that individuals can prioritize both love and friendship by reimagining free time and challenging the expectation that romantic partners should fulfill all emotional needs. By investing in friendships, individuals can create a more balanced and supportive life, ultimately benefiting their mental health and overall well-being.</p>

          <p>The UK and the European Union have reached an agreement regarding Gibraltar's status post-Brexit, aiming to avoid border checks between Spain and the British Overseas Territory. The agreement ensures that passport checks at Gibraltar airport will be conducted by both Gibraltar and Spanish officials, similar to the Eurostar system at London's St Pancras. UK Foreign Secretary David Lammy stated that the deal protects British sovereignty and supports Gibraltar's economy, while Spanish Foreign Affairs Minister Jos√© Manuel Albares and EU trade chief Maros Sefcovic hailed the agreement as "historic." All parties have committed to finalizing a UK-EU treaty text on Gibraltar as quickly as possible, with the UK emphasizing that the final treaty does not impact the territory's British sovereignty.</p>

          <p>Disney and Universal have jointly filed a lawsuit against AI image company Midjourney, alleging copyright infringement for the unlicensed use of their characters and intellectual property. The lawsuit claims that Midjourney used and distributed AI-generated characters from movies like Star Wars, The Simpsons, Toy Story, and Shrek, despite requests to stop. The studios are demanding a jury trial, asserting that Midjourney's actions threaten the bedrock incentives of U.S. copyright law. The companies argue that Midjourney is a "quintessential copyright free-rider and a bottomless pit of plagiarism," highlighting the growing concerns over protecting content from illegal copyrighting in the age of AI.</p>

The article emphasizes that real payouts depend on more than just the investment amount and suggests requesting quotes from multiple insurers to compare options. Annuities can provide a reliable income stream in retirement, but understanding the factors that influence payouts is essential for making informed decisions (not investment advice).</p>

Trump also mentioned that China's tariffs on the U.S. will remain at 10%, as agreed upon last month to temporarily reduce retaliatory duties.

Financial advisor Winnie Sun emphasizes the importance of a good credit score, describing it as a "financial GPA" that affects loan rates and employment opportunities.
