          <p>This article analyzes the constitutional requirements for 'due process' in the context of President Trump's deportation policies, explaining that while all non-citizens on U.S. soil are entitled to due process, the specifics vary depending on their circumstances, such as whether they were lawfully admitted, have community ties, or are seeking asylum. The article clarifies that due process does not necessarily mean a trial for every migrant, especially under expedited removal programs for those recently in the country illegally or arriving without valid documents. The article also notes ongoing legal challenges and the Supreme Court's likely involvement in defining the specifics of due process for deportees, with the administration stating it will follow the Supreme Court's guidance. </p>

          <p>The UK and India have finalized a trade deal after three years of negotiations, which aims to reduce tariffs and boost trade between the two nations. The agreement will make it easier for UK firms to export goods like whisky and cars to India, while also cutting taxes on India's clothing and footwear exports, but it does not include changes to immigration policy. The British government projects that the deal could increase trade by an additional ¬£25.5 billion a year by 2040, with benefits for both UK businesses and consumers. Prime Ministers Sir Keir Starmer and Narendra Modi have hailed the agreement as a landmark achievement that will promote economic growth and job creation. </p>

          <p>This article reports on San Diego Padres manager Mike Shildt's ejection from a game against the New York Yankees after he vehemently protested the ejection of Fernando Tatis Jr. Shildt's passionate display seemed to energize the Padres, who then mounted a comeback victory. Shildt explained his actions after the game, noting that he was careful not to damage his glasses during his outburst. Xander Bogaerts, a Padres shortstop, remarked that Shildt appeared ready to fight, and Luis Arraez credited Shildt's support for inspiring the team's comeback. </p>

          <p>China's state broadcaster CCTV has released footage of the electromagnetic catapult system in action on the country's most advanced aircraft carrier, the Fujian. The report also indicated that due to the complexity of the launch system, the Fujian would require longer sea trials than China‚Äôs other carriers, the Liaoning and Shandong, and the crew have undertaken a complete reform in take-off and landing training to master the catapult system. The adoption of the electromagnetic catapult system means that the Fujian‚Äôs carrier-based aircraft would take off with full fuel and full ordnance. </p>

          <p>This article explores the unique genetic adaptations of the Haenyeo, women divers from Jeju Island in South Korea, whose generations-long cultural practice of deep-diving has led to evolved traits such as lower blood pressure and enhanced cold-water tolerance. Genomic analysis reveals mutations associated with cold tolerance and decreased diastolic blood pressure, potentially protecting pregnant divers. Researchers hope to expand this research to other diving cultures and compare findings with people living at high altitudes, which could lead to new medical therapies. </p>
