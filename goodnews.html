          <p>Luxury fashion firm Burberry is planning to cut 1,700 jobs as part of a cost-reduction strategy aimed at saving ¬£60 million by 2027. The British designer brand reported a ¬£66 million loss in the last financial year, prompting the organizational changes that will impact roughly 20% of its global workforce, primarily in office-based roles, stores, and its Castleford factory. CEO Joshua Schulman aims to revive the brand's fortunes through these measures, following ¬£40 million in cost-cutting announced previously. Shares of Burberry jumped 8.5% after the announcement, reflecting investor optimism about the turnaround plan.</p>

          <p>Following MLB Commissioner Rob Manfred's decision to remove Pete Rose from the permanently ineligible list, ESPN's Tony Kornheiser clarified that Rose's reinstatement does not guarantee entry into the Hall of Fame. Kornheiser emphasized that baseball writers, known as guardians of the game, hold the power to vote players into the Hall. He noted that Rose's gambling on games as a manager, as well as Joe Jackson's fixing games, are serious violations that writers consider. Kornheiser added that other players with controversial pasts, such as Barry Bonds and Roger Clemens, are also eligible but have not been voted in, although he personally would put Rose in the Hall of Fame while acknowledging his sins on the plaque.</p>

Wildberger's powers are significant: essentially, anything that involves administering the state's IT infrastructure is now under Wildberger's oversight.

          <p>Health and Human Services Secretary Robert F. Kennedy Jr. is set to testify before two congressional committees to discuss the Trump administration's proposed budget and the restructuring of HHS. Kennedy will face questions about the layoffs of approximately 10,000 workers and the consolidation of 28 institutes and centers into 15 new divisions. He may also be challenged on his views about vaccines, as he has shared contradicting statements and the CDC will study whether vaccines cause autism. Senators will likely ask Kennedy to clarify how HHS will maintain its critical duties and implement change important to Americans' health.</p>

He has pledged to cut energy costs and bureaucracy while pushing for a 40-hour workweek with flexible arrangements. Merz also described his cabinet's lack of federal experience as a "great opportunity" for real change, aiming for swift action on growth, migration, and defense.</p>

          <h2>Qatar's Charm Offensive Culminates in Trump Visit and Luxury Jet Offer</h2>

          <p>Qatar's efforts to overhaul its global reputation have culminated in President Trump's visit to Doha and the likely promise of a luxury jetliner. This marks a turnaround from Trump's previous stance, when he criticized Qatar as a ‚Äúfunder of terrorism.‚Äù Since then, Qatar has spent millions on lobbyists and hosted the FIFA World Cup in 2022. The possibility of an Air Force One with Qatari heritage has inspired a backlash, but Trump has shrugged off the criticism. Critics point out that Qatar is a go-between for the Gaza conflict because it lets many of Hamas‚Äôs top political officials live there.</p>

          <p>Credit card companies are battling for partnerships with popular restaurants, offering lucrative cash deals to incentivize switches between reservation platforms like Resy and OpenTable. This competition reflects the value of high-end restaurants as cultural currency for attracting young, wealthy customers. While some restaurateurs are conflicted about becoming pawns in a corporate game, they appreciate the financial boost amid rising operating costs. OpenTable's partnership with Visa has led to a technological overhaul and cash incentives for restaurants to join its platform, challenging Resy's dominance in the fine-dining scene.</p>
