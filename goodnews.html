          <p>The new Women's Pro Baseball League has announced it will hold open tryouts for its inaugural season from August 22-25 at Nationals Park in Washington, D.C. Over 500 women from around the world have already registered for a chance to be among the 150 players selected for a draft this fall. The league, set to debut in spring 2026 with six teams, aims to find the best players globally and inspire a new generation of female baseball players. Co-founder Justine Siegal stated they are looking for top-tier talent who can "hit the long ball."</p>

          <p>Robinhood's stock price reached a new milestone, trading at $100 per share for the first time and marking a significant rally of over 30% since it was overlooked for inclusion in the S&P 500. The surge follows the company's ambitious European expansion, where it launched a new crypto strategy aimed at tokenizing thousands of financial instruments like stocks and ETFs on its own blockchain. CEO Vlad Tenev emphasized a strategy of demonstrating crypto's potential through product delivery rather than talk, with tokenized shares of private companies like SpaceX and OpenAI now available to European users.</p>

          <p>The S&P 500 showed resilience despite a weak private payrolls report from ADP, which some analysts believe strengthens the case for a Federal Reserve interest rate cut. Capital One stock is on a notable winning streak, reaching a new record close as investors anticipate strategic growth following its acquisition of Discover Financial. Market commentary suggests that recent dips in high-performing tech stocks like Nvidia could represent buying opportunities for investors who believe in their long-term growth potential. The market is now looking ahead to the official government jobs report for a clearer economic picture. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>A new wave of virtual YouTubers, or "VTubers," are leveraging artificial intelligence to build massive online followings and generate significant income. These creators use AI-powered avatars, like the popular gaming character Bloo, who is "puppeteered" by a human but uses AI for tasks like video editing and voice dubbing. While some VTubers are partially human-controlled, advances in generative AI are making it easier to create fully automated virtual personalities. This trend is fueling a new creator economy but also contributes to the rise of low-quality "AI slop" content online.</p>

          <p>With the Federal Reserve expected to cut interest rates later in 2025, an article suggests that now is an opportune time to open a certificate of deposit (CD). By locking in a CD, savers can protect their money from future rate drops and secure a fixed return, with current rates offering significant interest on deposits. For example, a $20,000 deposit in a six-month CD could earn over $400 in interest. This strategy provides predictable growth and allows savers time to consider their next financial moves in an uncertain economic environment. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>A new expedition is being launched this fall to a remote Pacific island in an attempt to locate Amelia Earhart's lost plane. The effort will focus on a "visual anomaly" identified in imagery of a lagoon at Nikumaroro, an uninhabited atoll between Hawaii and Australia. Researchers believe this anomaly could be the wreckage of the Lockheed 10-E Electra that Earhart and navigator Fred Noonan were flying when they disappeared 88 years ago. If the object is confirmed to be the aircraft, a recovery effort will be planned to bring it home.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Zohran Mamdani, the Democratic nominee for New York City mayor, has proposed creating a network of city-owned, non-profit grocery stores to combat high food prices. The plan, which has significant public support, would be a first for a major U.S. city and is modeled after smaller experiments in rural America. However, critics point to the immense challenges, including the grocery industry's slim profit margins and complex supply chains. While the goal is to address food insecurity and affordability, there is no guarantee the stores would be cheaper or effectively change residents' health outcomes.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Researchers have sequenced the first whole ancient Egyptian genome from the Old Kingdom period, revealing details about a potter who lived between 4,500 and 4,800 years ago. The DNA, extracted from the man's well-preserved remains found in a ceramic pot, showed he had brown hair and eyes and lived a hard life, with skeletal markings indicating extensive pottery work. The genetic analysis also provided a significant breakthrough, showing that about 20% of his ancestry traced back to the Fertile Crescent, offering new evidence of population mixing between North Africa and the Middle East during that era.</p>
