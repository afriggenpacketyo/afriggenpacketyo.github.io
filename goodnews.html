          <p>Golfer Xander Schauffele defended the challenging conditions at the U.S. Open at Oakmont Country Club, stating that the course was "very fair" because everyone played the same course. Despite some players expressing displeasure with the difficulty, Schauffele believed the course was more playable due to rain, making the fairways and greens more forgiving. He acknowledged the presence of "weird breaks" but emphasized that golfers could avoid trouble by hitting fairways and avoiding bunkers. Schauffele highlighted that the U.S. Open requires golfers to play extremely well, which is fitting for a major championship.</p>

President Trump had previously stated that the companies would form a "partnership" and that U.S. Steel would remain American-owned. The New York Stock Exchange notified the SEC that U.S. Steel's shares would be removed from listing, as it has become a wholly owned subsidiary of Nippon Steel North America.
