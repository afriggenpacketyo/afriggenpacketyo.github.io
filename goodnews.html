        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>The landmark 1954 Supreme Court decision in Brown v. Board of Education unanimously declared the "separate but equal" doctrine unconstitutional in public education, overturning the precedent set by Plessy v. Ferguson. This pivotal ruling culminated decades of strategic legal battles led by the NAACP and its brilliant attorney, Thurgood Marshall, who argued that segregation aimed to maintain a state of subjugation. While the decision did not immediately eradicate all forms of racial segregation across society, particularly in housing and schools, it undeniably served as a monumental catalyst for the civil rights movement. The article emphasizes its crucial role in pushing the United States closer to its founding ideals of equality and justice for all citizens, with Marshall later becoming the first African American Supreme Court Justice.</p>

McLaren's Oscar Piastri, despite an error-strewn weekend and a first-lap crash, managed to retain a relatively comfortable championship lead. George Russell delivered an excellent race, moving from fifth to second, while Carlos Sainz secured a commendable third place, earning Williams their first podium since 2021.

          <p>The Seabed 2030 project, a joint initiative by the United Nations and the Nippon Foundation, aims to comprehensively map the entire ocean floor by the end of this decade, with only about 20% currently surveyed. This ambitious undertaking promises significant scientific discoveries, including unknown mountains and canyons, and could offer crucial insights into climate change and past human societies. However, the article highlights substantial challenges, such as geopolitical fragmentation, waning political motivation, and immense costs. Critics also voice concerns that more complete mapping could accelerate the exploitation of deep-sea resources, underscoring the critical need for robust international conservation and governance.</p>

          <p>St. Patrick's Cathedral in New York City has unveiled a remarkable new mural by artist Adam Cvijanovic, titled "What's So Funny About Peace, Love and Understanding," marking the first major addition in 75 years. The artwork powerfully celebrates the continuous pilgrimage of God's people, depicting historical and present-day immigrants arriving in New York. Cardinal Timothy Dolan enthusiastically embraced the theme, drawing parallels to the Holy Family as refugees and openly criticizing contemporary anti-immigrant rhetoric. This article highlights the mural's dual purpose: to inspire the faithful and to convey a broader message of respect and welcome to all residents of New York City, fostering a sense of community.</p>

          <p>The United Nations' latest Global Innovation Index reveals that China has entered the top 10 most innovative nations for the first time, displacing Germany and signaling the apparent failure of US efforts to contain its technological rise. Washington's policy of tech decoupling, characterized by export controls and blacklisting Chinese firms, has inadvertently spurred China to dramatically increase domestic research and development spending. This article argues that American pressure has catalyzed Chinese innovation, pushing it towards greater self-sufficiency in critical fields like artificial intelligence and quantum computing. The development highlights a profound paradox where US actions may be undermining global innovation and its own long-term strategic interests.</p>

          <p>Former England player Kat Merchant is advocating for scrum-half Lucy Packer to start for England in the Women's Rugby World Cup final against Canada, asserting that Packer's "incredible speed of ball" could be a decisive factor. Packer has participated in all five World Cup games but has only started once. Merchant suggests that while the more experienced Natasha Hunt could make a stronger impact from the bench, Packer's calm yet quick play might provide the crucial shift needed from the outset. This article delves into the strategic debate over team selection, highlighting the tactical considerations for the upcoming high-stakes final match.</p>

          <p>Berkshire Hathaway has completely sold its highly profitable stake in Chinese electric vehicle maker BYD, an investment initially made in 2008 at Charlie Munger's urging. The company began reducing its 225 million share position in 2022, which had grown significantly in value. While Warren Buffett acknowledged BYD as an "extraordinary company," he indicated a desire to find alternative investments. This article notes that Berkshire also sold most of its Taiwan Semiconductor stake, citing geopolitical risk. The move aligns with Buffett's preference for long-term decisions over short-term financial guidance, a stance he shares partially with President Trump. (not investment advice)</p>
