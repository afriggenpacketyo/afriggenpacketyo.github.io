          <p>Amid a challenging back-to-school shopping season marked by tariffs and budget-conscious consumers, some value-oriented retailers are positioned to perform well. Surveys indicate that shoppers are concerned about rising prices, leading them to seek deals and stretch their budgets further. Companies like TJX Companies, Costco, and Amazon, known for their pricing flexibility and value propositions, are expected to attract more customers. These retailers employ various strategies, such as negotiating with suppliers and leveraging private-label brands, to mitigate the impact of tariffs and protect their profit margins.

The goal is for the two leaders to meet within the next two weeks to discuss a potential peace deal and security guarantees. Trump has indicated that he would get involved to finalize an agreement after the initial bilateral talks, emphasizing that no U.S. troops would be on the ground.</p>

          <p>S&P Global has affirmed its AA+ credit rating for long-term U.S. sovereign debt, stating that expected revenue from President Trump's tariff policies will likely offset weaker revenue resulting from his recent tax-and-spending legislation. The rating agency noted that the Congressional Budget Office projects the new law will increase the federal deficit by $3.4 trillion over the next decade. However, S&P warned that the rating could be lowered in the future if deficits increase due to an inability to contain spending or if political developments weaken U.S. institutions and the dollar's status as the world's primary reserve currency.

          <p>The senior living real estate sector is experiencing a significant boom as the baby boomer generation ages, with demand for housing rapidly outpacing new construction. Occupancy rates are rising while inventory growth has fallen to its lowest point since 2006, creating a favorable market for investors and existing property owners. Real estate investment trusts like Ventas are investing heavily, citing strong returns and the opportunity to acquire assets below replacement cost. However, developers face challenges, primarily due to higher interest rates, which are constraining the construction of new facilities needed to meet the escalating demand.

          <p>The American Academy of Pediatrics (AAP) has issued new guidance recommending the Covid-19 vaccine for children as young as six months, a position that contrasts with the current federal stance. The Trump administration's health agencies recently halted recommendations for healthy children to receive the vaccine, instead advising "shared clinical decision-making." The AAP stated its recommendations are based on decades of expertise and are crucial in an environment of misinformation, emphasizing that infants and toddlers face the greatest risk of severe outcomes from the virus. This divergence could create confusion for parents and may affect insurance coverage for the vaccine.</p>

          <p>The House Oversight Committee has announced its intention to release documents related to the Jeffrey Epstein case, which it is set to receive from the Department of Justice this week. The committee had subpoenaed the records following controversy over a DOJ internal review that found no evidence of a "client list" or blackmail, a conclusion that angered many of President Trump's supporters. A committee spokesperson confirmed the files will be made public after a thorough review to redact victims' identities and any sensitive material. The release will also be coordinated with the DOJ to avoid impacting any ongoing criminal investigations.</p>

          <p>The Federal Trade Commission has filed a complaint against a group of individuals for allegedly creating a network of fake Ticketmaster accounts to purchase and resell hundreds of thousands of tickets to high-demand concerts. The complaint alleges the group spent nearly $57 million on tickets for artists like Taylor Swift and Bruce Springsteen, then resold them for a profit of several million dollars. The FTC claims the operation used software to mask IP addresses and illicitly obtained credit cards to circumvent ticket purchasing limits, violating the Better Online Ticket Sales Act. This action follows widespread public frustration over ticket availability.</p>

          <p>During a meeting with China's Foreign Minister Wang Yi, Indian Prime Minister Narendra Modi acknowledged the "steady progress" in bilateral relations between the two nations. This high-level visit signals a continued thaw in a relationship that has been tense for years, particularly after a deadly border clash in 2020. Modi is scheduled to visit China at the end of August for the Shanghai Cooperation Organization summit, his first trip there in seven years. The rebuilding of ties comes as both countries navigate increased trade friction with the United States under President Trump's aggressive tariff policies.</p>

          <p>Commerce Secretary Howard Lutnick announced that Intel will be required to give the U.S. government a non-voting equity stake in the company in exchange for receiving funds from the CHIPS Act. This marks a shift from the Biden administration's approach, which provided grants without requiring equity. The move comes as the Trump administration explores ways to become more involved with the struggling chipmaker to bolster domestic manufacturing and reduce reliance on foreign companies. Intel, which previously finalized a nearly $8 billion grant, has been slowing construction on its major Ohio factory complex due to market conditions.</p>
