          <p>The Reserve Bank of India has decided to keep its key policy rate unchanged at 5.5%, a move that was widely anticipated by economists. This decision comes as India navigates escalating trade tensions with the United States, including threats of new tariffs from President Trump. The central bank had previously made a significant 50-basis-point cut and has now shifted to a "neutral" stance, indicating it will carefully monitor economic data before making future moves. Despite low inflation, the RBI is pausing to assess the macroeconomic outlook. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>The Los Angeles Sparks secured a 100-91 victory over the Indiana Fever, halting the Fever's five-game winning streak. The Sparks, who have now won eight of their last nine games, capitalized on the absence of Fever's star rookie Caitlin Clark, who was sidelined with a groin injury. Despite Clark's vocal support from the bench, Indiana could not overcome a strong performance from the fully healthy Sparks roster. The win helps move the Sparks closer to securing a playoff berth in the league.</p>

As part of the deal, the NFL will receive a 10% equity stake in ESPN, valued at an estimated $2.2 billion to $2.5 billion. The agreement, which still requires final negotiations and regulatory approval, will integrate NFL Network into ESPN's upcoming direct-to-consumer service.

          <p>The California Department of Corrections and Rehabilitation has announced the planned closure of a medium-security state prison in Norco by fall 2026. The decision is attributed to a significant decline in the state's overall inmate population and is expected to save the state $150 million annually. The facility, which currently houses nearly 3,000 inmates and employs 1,200 staff, has a unique history, having originally opened as a luxury resort in the 1920s. The state plans to support the local community through the transition, though the future use of the historic property remains undecided.</p>

          <h2>Chinese Economists Debate Setting Official Targets for Consumer Spending</h2>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>A debate is underway among Chinese economists and policymakers regarding whether to establish official, measurable targets for household consumption in the nation's next five-year plan. Proponents argue that setting a goal for the "household consumption rate," which measures consumer spending as a share of GDP, is a crucial step to strategically expand domestic demand. However, others question if such a metric is operationally feasible as a policy goal. This discussion comes as China seeks to rebalance its economy and rely more on internal consumption for growth.

          <p>Los Angeles Dodgers rookie pitcher Roki Sasaki is making a promising recovery after a shoulder injury sidelined him early in the season. Once a major offseason acquisition, Sasaki's initial performance was underwhelming, but he has recently shown significant progress in his throwing program, with improved velocity and a new pitch. The Dodgers are hopeful that the Japanese phenom can continue to improve and potentially become a valuable contributor to their pitching staff for the postseason. His return would provide welcome depth as the team defends its World Series title.</p>

          <p>Meta, the parent company of WhatsApp, announced it has taken down 6.8 million accounts associated with scams in the first half of this year. Many of these accounts were tied to criminal organizations operating scam centers in Southeast Asia, which often use forced labor to target people worldwide with fraudulent investment schemes. In response to this growing threat, WhatsApp is rolling out new security features to alert users of potentially suspicious activity, such as being added to a group by an unknown contact. The crackdown targets the hijacking of accounts to promote these scams.</p>

          <p>A federal judge has temporarily blocked the Trump administration's plan to reallocate over $4 billion in disaster relief funds from FEMA's Building Resilient Infrastructure and Communities (BRIC) program. The injunction was granted in response to a lawsuit from 20 states, which argued that unlawfully ending the program would cause "irreparable harm" to communities relying on the funds for flood mitigation and other resilience projects. The judge stated that the court was not convinced Congress intended for the money to be repurposed, halting the transfer while the case proceeds.</p>

          <p>A state-owned Chinese corporation has announced significant progress on the Mes Aynak copper mine in Afghanistan, with extraction potentially starting this year. The project, holding one of the world's largest untouched copper deposits, was awarded to the company in 2008 but has been stalled for 17 years due to security challenges and the presence of ancient Buddhist archaeological sites. The Taliban government has reportedly agreed to a costlier underground mining process to protect the historical relics, clearing a major hurdle for the long-delayed venture.</p>

          <p>According to the FBI's annual Unified Crime Report, crime rates in the United States fell across every category in 2024, continuing a downward trend from the spike seen after the pandemic. The report showed a significant 14.9% decrease in murder and nonnegligent manslaughter, as well as an 18.6% drop in motor vehicle thefts. While violent and property crimes have decreased, experts note that the rate of aggravated assaults remains higher than pre-pandemic levels. The data was compiled from over 16,000 law enforcement agencies covering about 95% of the U.S. population.</p>

          <p>The Los Angeles County Board of Supervisors has passed a new law requiring landlords in unincorporated areas to ensure their rental units do not exceed 82 degrees Fahrenheit. This ordinance is designed to protect vulnerable tenants from the increasing danger of extreme heat waves driven by climate change. The law will take effect next month but will not be enforced until 2027, giving landlords time to comply, with an emphasis on passive cooling solutions like reflective roofing and blackout curtains over just air conditioning. The measure aims to address a growing public health emergency.</p>
