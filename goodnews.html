        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>The Walt Disney Company has announced that "Jimmy Kimmel Live!" will return to television, nearly a week after the show was indefinitely suspended. The suspension followed comments Kimmel made regarding the death of conservative activist Charlie Kirk, which drew criticism from the FCC chairman and led major affiliate owners like Nexstar and Sinclair to pull the show. Disney stated the suspension was to avoid inflaming tensions but decided to reinstate the program after "thoughtful conversations" with the host. The decision had sparked a significant debate about free speech and corporate responsibility.</p>

          <p>NASA has officially introduced its 2025 class of ten new astronaut candidates, selected from a pool of over 8,000 applicants. The group, which notably includes more women than men for the first time, consists of six pilots, a biomedical engineer, an anesthesiologist, a geologist, and a former SpaceX launch director. These candidates will now undergo two years of rigorous training for future missions to the International Space Station, the Moon, and potentially Mars. Among the new astronauts is Anna Menon, who previously flew to orbit as a private astronaut on a commercial SpaceX mission in 2024.</p>

          <p>England's National Health Service (NHS) is implementing a new initiative called "Jess's Rule," urging general practitioners to reconsider a patient's diagnosis if their condition does not improve after three consultations. The rule is named after Jessica Brady, a 27-year-old who died from advanced cancer after her symptoms were repeatedly dismissed as long Covid. The guidance encourages doctors to conduct further tests, seek second opinions, or refer patients to specialists to prevent avoidable deaths from missed diagnoses. The initiative aims to make this best practice standard across the country, particularly helping younger patients whose serious illnesses are sometimes overlooked.</p>

          <p>China is in the process of drafting its 15th five-year plan, a comprehensive blueprint that will guide the nation's economic and social development from 2026 to 2030. This long-standing tradition of strategic planning is seen by President Xi Jinping as a key political advantage, especially amid global uncertainty. The upcoming plan is crucial for achieving China's goal of reaching the per capita GDP of a "moderately developed country" by 2035. Experts suggest that given current domestic and international challenges, the new plan may need to prioritize flexible, qualitative goals over rigid quantitative targets to ensure its success.</p>

          <p>Police in Menlo-Atherton, California, successfully prevented a potential school shooting after receiving a tip through the "Say Something" anonymous reporting system. The tip alerted authorities to concerning online posts by a former student, leading to a campus lockdown and the student's detainment before any violence could occur. This marks the 19th credible planned school attack that the system, created by the Sandy Hook Promise organization, has helped thwart since its 2018 launch. Officials praised the student who submitted the tip, highlighting the critical role of community vigilance and accessible reporting tools in preventing gun violence in schools.</p>

          <p>Ahead of the Ryder Cup at Bethpage Black, European captain Luke Donald and his U.S. counterpart Keegan Bradley have highlighted their close personal friendship, setting a collegial tone for the famously intense competition. The two live near each other in Florida, are members of the same golf club, and even co-own a restaurant. Despite the expectation of a rowdy New York crowd, both captains emphasized their mutual respect and camaraderie. Bradley has chosen not to be a player-captain, focusing instead on preparing his team to reclaim the cup, while Donald aims to lead Europe to its first away victory since 2012.</p>

          <p>Brazilian President Luiz Inácio Lula da Silva met with TikTok's CEO to discuss a potential $10 billion investment by the company to build a major data center in Brazil. The meeting, held in New York, underscores the significance of digital policy in Lula's international agenda. The proposed project, one of the largest tech infrastructure investments in the country's history, would likely be located in the state of Ceará. The region is already a hub for submarine fiber-optic cables connecting South America to other continents, making it a strategic location for such a facility amid ongoing global tensions over technology and data regulation.</p>

Shedeur was ultimately selected by the Cleveland Browns in the fifth round. Deion Sanders defended his son's mindset, stating that professional players are expected to be ready to perform immediately rather than spend years in development on the bench.</p>

          <p>The future of the iconic Reel Inn seafood restaurant, a beloved landmark on the Pacific Coast Highway for nearly 40 years, remains in limbo after it was destroyed in a fire. After initially telling the owners they could not rebuild, California State Parks has reversed its position and now says it will work to allow the restaurant to be rebuilt on or near its original site. However, no clear timeline or plan has been provided, leaving owners Andy Leonard and Teddy Seraphine-Leonard in a state of uncertainty.

          <p>Ongoing negotiations between the U.S. and China over TikTok's future now include new stipulations regarding control of the app's powerful and closely guarded algorithm. Previously a major sticking point, a new agreement would reportedly move TikTok's U.S. operations under a U.S.-based joint venture that would control a copy of the algorithm and oversee security. Software maker Oracle would provide comprehensive security monitoring to ensure the technology is not used for malicious purposes or subject to undue influence. This arrangement aims to address national security concerns that the Chinese government could access U.S. user data or manipulate content.</p>

After years of struggling with injuries and inconsistency at Barcelona, the 28-year-old Frenchman had a phenomenal 2024-25 season, scoring 35 goals and leading PSG to a historic treble. The article credits his transformation to both personal maturity and a key tactical shift by manager Luis Enrique, who moved him into a central 'false nine' role after Kylian Mbappe's departure. This new position allowed Dembele to finally fulfill the immense potential predicted for him when he became one of the world's most expensive players in 2017.</p>
