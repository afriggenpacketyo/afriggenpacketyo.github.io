          <p>Representative Jerry Nadler, a long-serving Democrat from New York, has announced he will not seek reelection in 2026, citing the need for "generational change" within the party. Nadler, 78, stated his decision was influenced by observing the challenges faced by older political figures and the rise of what he termed "incipient fascism" from Donald Trump. First elected in 1992, Nadler played a key role as the former chair of the House Judiciary Committee, notably managing Trump's first impeachment. His retirement opens up his seat, with colleagues like Hakeem Jeffries praising his extensive career and dedication to justice.</p>

          <p>Most Asia-Pacific markets saw gains as investors evaluated the outcomes of the Shanghai Cooperation Organization (SCO) summit in Tianjin, though sentiment was tempered by ongoing trade uncertainties. The market movements followed a U.S. federal appeals court ruling that declared most of President Donald Trump's global tariffs illegal, adding a layer of complexity to the global trade landscape. Japan's Nikkei 225 and South Korea's Kospi both registered increases, while Australia's S&P/ASX 200 declined.

          <p>Marie Tidball, a Labour MP for Penistone and Stocksbridge who has a congenital disability, is advocating for better accessibility within the historic Houses of Parliament. In an interview, she detailed numerous physical barriers she faces daily, from heavy, hard-to-open doors to inaccessible toilets and the design of the Commons Chamber benches. Tidball, who was elected last July, argues that for Parliament to truly reflect the 22% of the voting-age population with disabilities, significant changes are needed. While acknowledging that some improvements have been made, she stresses the importance of making the institution more inclusive for future disabled MPs and constituents.</p>

This was his first time addressing the media since a Fourth of July fireworks accident resulted in a superficial eye injury. Harris described the incident as a "humbling experience" but declined to provide specific details, emphasizing his gratitude that the situation was not worse. After being cleared for contact, he has been practicing with a tinted visor and is gradually increasing his workload, though his streak of 68 consecutive NFL starts could still be at risk.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>The Old Faithful Inn, located in Yellowstone National Park, is celebrated as a landmark of national park architecture and the largest log cabin in the world. Built in 1904, the lodge was designed by architect Robert Reamer, who utilized uniquely twisted and gnarled trees, or "freaks of the forest," to construct its iconic structure. For over a century, it has hosted millions of visitors, including presidents and royalty, and has withstood natural events like earthquakes and wildfires. The article highlights that the inn's enduring rustic style set a benchmark that influenced the design of many other famous lodges in national parks across the United States.</p>

          <p>Musician Tom Odell reflects on a pivotal 2016 concert that he considered a personal failure, only to learn years later that it inspired Billie Eilish and Finneas O'Connell to pursue their own music careers. This revelation taught him a valuable lesson about the unforeseen impact one can have on others. Odell is currently experiencing a career resurgence, partly due to his song "Black Friday" gaining viral popularity on TikTok and being featured in the show "Heartstopper." Now touring with Eilish, he discusses his new, more confessional music and the creative freedom he has found since becoming an independent artist.</p>

          <p>Premier League clubs have set a new spending record, with their total outlay during the summer transfer window exceeding £3 billion for the first time. This figure is significantly higher than last summer's £1.96 billion and surpasses the combined spending of the top leagues in Germany, Spain, France, and Italy. The deadline day was highlighted by major deals such as Alexander Isak's £125 million move to Liverpool, which helped push the total to £3.087 billion. The article notes that this financial dominance is turning other major European competitions into "feeder leagues" for England's top flight. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>Dwayne "The Rock" Johnson is earning potential Oscar consideration for his dramatic turn as UFC fighter Mark Kerr in the new film "The Smashing Machine," which premiered at the Venice Film Festival. Johnson stated he had a "burning desire" to take on a more intense and raw role after feeling "pigeon-holed" as a box office star in blockbuster films for years. Early reviews praise his performance as a "revelation," noting his sincere and ego-less portrayal of Kerr's life, including his struggles with substance abuse. The film, directed by Benny Safdie, represents a significant departure from Johnson's typical action and comedy roles.</p>

          <p>China is advancing a proposal to establish a development bank for the Shanghai Cooperation Organisation (SCO), a group of 10 Eurasian nations including Russia and India. The initiative aims to insulate member countries from the risks associated with the U.S. dollar-dominated global trade system and to accelerate infrastructure projects within the region. According to analysts, creating such a financial institution is a logical next step for the SCO to deepen economic cooperation and promote the use of local currencies. The plan was formally advanced during a recent summit, with members deciding to accelerate consultations on the bank's formation. (not investment advice)</p>

          <h2>New Dating of Ancient Skull Found in Greece May Rewrite Human Evolutionary History</h2>

        </div>
        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>A new study has precisely dated the Petralona cranium, a significant human fossil discovered in a Greek cave over 60 years ago, to be at least 286,000 years old. Using advanced uranium-series dating techniques, researchers have placed the skull firmly in the Middle Pleistocene era, resolving decades of conflicting estimates. The fossil, often attributed to the species Homo heidelbergensis, possesses features distinct from both Neanderthals and modern humans. This new, reliable minimum age suggests that this archaic human population coexisted with emerging Neanderthals, adding complexity to the timeline of human evolution in Europe and reinforcing the idea of a branching, rather than linear, history.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>The Met Office has announced a "decent chance" for the aurora borealis, or Northern Lights, to be visible across much of the United Kingdom in the coming days. This rare opportunity is due to heightened solar activity from a coronal mass ejection, which could push the celestial display further south than is typical. While visibility is dependent on clear, dark skies and minimal light pollution, areas in the Midlands and northern regions are forecasted to have the best viewing conditions. The phenomenon is caused by charged particles from solar winds interacting with the Earth's magnetic field, creating a memorable light show.</p>
