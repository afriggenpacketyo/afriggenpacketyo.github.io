          <p>Honeywell and Dover executives provided positive updates at a Bank of America conference, indicating that reduced U.S.-China tariffs are improving their business outlook. Honeywell anticipates lower tariff exposure due to the temporary agreement between the two countries, with CFO Mike Stepniak estimating a $100 million reduction in tariff exposure, and he also expressed confidence in meeting fiscal guidance, citing strong orders in April and May. Dover's CFO, Chris Woenker, highlighted the company's advantage due to its North American manufacturing footprint and low China exposure, with ongoing efforts to reshore production to the U.S. Both companies emphasized their ability to manage tariffs through strategic price hikes and supply chain adjustments.

          <p>With credit card debt balances declining but interest rates remaining high, borrowers should consider strategic debt consolidation moves.

Alternatives like a home equity line of credit (HELOC) or a home equity loan should also be considered to potentially lower interest payments. (not investment advice)</p>
