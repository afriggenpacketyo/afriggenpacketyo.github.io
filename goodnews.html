          <p>Archaeologists at William & Mary University discovered a secret cellar beneath the Williamsburg Bray School, the oldest surviving schoolhouse for Black children in America. The cellar contained artifacts such as slate pencil fragments, jewelry, and handmade ceramics associated with sites of enslavement. The Williamsburg Bray School, which taught mostly enslaved students in the 1760s, was later transformed into a dormitory for some of the first women to attend college. The discovery provides new insights into the early republic, from the school's history to the generations that followed.</p>

Former Lakers legend Magic Johnson praised the transaction, citing Walter as the best choice to carry on the Lakers' legacy. NBA valuations have surged since the league's latest media rights agreement, and the Lakers finished the 2025 season as the No. 3 seed in the Western Conference.</p>

          <p>The Trump administration has brokered a peace deal between the Democratic Republic of Congo (DRC) and Rwanda to end the war over mineral wealth in eastern DRC. The deal, set to be signed in Washington, aims to end the fighting and attract American investment into the region, rich in minerals like coltan, cobalt, and gold. Critics are skeptical, as the M23 militia, believed to be backed by Rwanda, is not a signatory to the agreement. The deal includes provisions on territorial integrity, disarmament, and a joint security mechanism, potentially countering China's dominance in Africa's mineral sector.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>The presence of public pools is crucial for mental, physical, and social health, providing a space for recreation, exercise, and community building. Public pools have historically served as important social hubs, but segregation in the 1950s led to their decline as suburbanites retreated to private club pools. Revitalizing public pools by building them in unused spaces could significantly improve the well-being of city residents, especially during the hot summer months. Access to adequate bathing facilities is essential for the health, happiness, and efficiency of a large number of people.</p>

The ban, passed by the Senedd, aims to reduce plastic and microplastic pollution, with exemptions for medical-grade wipes and business-to-business supplies. Deputy First Minister Huw Irranca-Davies emphasized the need to shift towards reusable and non-plastic products, while Conservative MS Janet Finch-Saunders highlighted the contribution of wipes to sewage blockages. Research from Cardiff University found that wet wipes pose a "significant risk" to the environment in Wales.</p>

Concerns have been raised about insufficient safeguards and the potential harm to vulnerable people. Supporters argue that the bill is the most robust piece of legislation in the world and that failure to pass it could delay the issue for another decade.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>In the Age of Offense, marked by high polarization and easy broadcasting of thoughts, it is crucial to cultivate the ability to not take offense. Being too easily offended can negatively impact one's quality of life more than being rude. By understanding the psychological and neurological mechanisms behind taking offense, one can learn to control their responses, such as laughing it off, using the prefrontal cortex to inhibit emotional reactions, and tuning out offense-making media. Avoiding offense-seeking behavior and focusing on self-management can lead to a happier and more balanced life.</p>
