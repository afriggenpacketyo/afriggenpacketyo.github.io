          <p>Paris Saint-Germain (PSG), backed by Qatari Sports Investments, secured their first Champions League title with a dominant 5-0 victory over Inter Milan.

Kesha explained that aligning with her integrity was more important than proving a point, leading her to collaborate with her human creative team. This decision reflects a broader conversation about the role and impact of AI in the arts and the importance of human creativity.</p>

          <p>The sale of single-use disposable vapes is now banned across the UK, aiming to curb youth vaping and reduce environmental waste. While rechargeable and refillable devices remain available, this ban targets the colorful, easily accessible disposable vapes that have contributed to the rise in vaping among young people. Health experts believe further regulation is needed, despite the ban's potential impact. Vaping is considered less harmful than smoking, but long-term risks are still unknown, prompting concerns about its increasing popularity among non-smokers.</p>

          <p>Inter Milan's Champions League final defeat against PSG has prompted discussions about a potential rebuild, focusing on younger players and fresh energy. Coach Inzaghi acknowledged the need for new signings, but also highlighted the challenge of finding new clubs for existing players. The team's older average age was a disadvantage compared to PSG's youthful squad, contributing to their fatigue and inability to cope with PSG's pace. Despite the loss, Inzaghi remains a highly-regarded coach, although his future with the club is uncertain.</p>
