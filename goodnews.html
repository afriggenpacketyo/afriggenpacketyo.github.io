          <p>A newly declassified memo confirms that U.S. intelligence agencies rejected President Trump's claim that the Maduro regime in Venezuela controls the Tren de Aragua gang, which Trump used to justify deporting Venezuelans under the Alien Enemies Act. The memo states that while Venezuela's environment allows the gang to operate, the Maduro regime likely does not cooperate with or direct the gang's activities in the United States. This revelation further undermines the Trump administration's rationale for using the Alien Enemies Act, which had been used only three times previously, all during declared wars.</p>

          <p>A federal judge ruled that disputed ballots in the 2024 North Carolina Supreme Court race must be included in the final count, effectively securing a victory for Democratic incumbent Allison Riggs. Judge Richard Myers agreed with Riggs' argument that removing ballots would violate the U.S. Constitution, damaging due process and equal protection rights. He ordered the State Board of Elections to certify the results showing Riggs winning by 734 votes, but delayed the decision for seven days pending a potential appeal from Republican challenger Jefferson Griffin.</p>

          <p>The Trump administration has requested a federal judge dismiss a lawsuit seeking to restrict access to the abortion pill mifepristone, aligning with the Biden administration's earlier position. This stance is surprising given President Trump's opposition to abortion rights. The request focuses on the case's venue rather than the merits, allowing the administration to avoid stating its views on mifepristone. This move may reflect a desire for political caution on abortion, particularly until the 2026 midterm elections.</p>
