          <p>Donald Trump has endorsed Jack Ciattarelli, a former critic, for New Jersey governor, calling him a "terrific America First Candidate." Ciattarelli, who previously criticized Trump, now aligns with his agenda, promising to grow the economy, cut taxes, secure the border, and protect veterans. The endorsement has sparked mixed reactions, with Ciattarelli expressing honor and resolve to unite the party and make New Jersey affordable and safe again. The New Jersey Democratic Governors Association criticized the endorsement, stating that Ciattarelli would put Trump before New Jersey, while Bill Spadea, another Republican candidate, accused Ciattarelli of lying about his record.</p>

The article also covers Trump's plans to cut US drug prices, a Republican senator's concerns about the party's identity, the reported firing of the head of the US copyright office, and a poll suggesting Americans are reconsidering major life events due to economic anxiety. The trade war duties will be lowered and the release of Edan Alexander from Gaza is being hailed as a 'good faith step'.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>This New York Times article reports on the anticlimactic auction of the Riggio family's art collection, indicating potential weakness in the art market. The sale, seen as a bellwether for the auction season, fell short of expectations, with many objects presold and little enthusiastic bidding. Experts attributed the subdued atmosphere to economic uncertainty surrounding President Trump's tariffs. While some artworks sold above their estimates, a major Warhol painting was withdrawn, and a painting by Lucio Fontana sold for significantly less than it had in 2017, suggesting a cooling market for certain artworks.</p>

          <p>Most Asian stock markets extended gains following an agreement between the US and China to suspend tariffs, fueling hopes of de-escalation in the trade war. The US will reduce its tariffs on China to 30 percent for 90 days, while China will cut its retaliatory measures to 10 percent. The news prompted rallies on Wall Street, with the Nasdaq, S&P 500, and Dow Jones all experiencing significant gains.
