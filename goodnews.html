        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>A federal judge in Chicago has dismissed a lawsuit filed by the Trump administration's Department of Justice that challenged the legality of sanctuary city policies in Chicago and Illinois. The judge, a Biden appointee, ruled that the local ordinances lawfully limit cooperation with federal immigration enforcement and do not violate the Constitution's Supremacy Clause. The ruling is a setback for the administration's efforts to compel local jurisdictions to assist with federal immigration crackdowns. Chicago's mayor praised the decision, stating it affirms the city's right to focus on local public safety.</p>

          <p>Tennis star Venus Williams' recent joke about returning to competition for health insurance benefits has highlighted the complex relationship between employment and healthcare in the U.S. The article uses her situation to explain concepts like COBRA, which allows individuals to keep their employer-based plan after a job ends but at a much higher personal cost. It also discusses how the Affordable Care Act has changed options for those with pre-existing conditions or in non-traditional jobs. Williams' experience serves as a relatable, high-profile example of the challenges many Americans face when navigating health insurance outside of a conventional job.</p>

          <p>A significant security operation is in place for Donald Trump's four-day private visit to his Turnberry golf resort in Scotland. The former U.S. president's visit involves road closures, a heavy police and military presence, and aerial surveillance. During his stay, he is scheduled to meet with UK Prime Minister Keir Starmer and Scottish First Minister John Swinney to discuss various issues. The visit has also drawn protests in Aberdeen and Edinburgh, while police representatives have raised concerns about the cost and staffing impact of the large-scale security detail.</p>

          <p>A 68-year-old dog trainer, Christopher Kennedy, was incidentally diagnosed with idiopathic pulmonary fibrosis (IPF), a progressive and terminal lung disease, during a routine X-ray. After medications failed and his health declined, doctors gave him less than a year to live. Despite initial reservations, he was approved for a double-lung transplant at the Cleveland Clinic and successfully underwent the procedure at age 74. Now recovering with nearly full lung capacity, Kennedy is training a new therapy dog named 'Encore' to celebrate his second chance at life.</p>

          <p>A growing number of couples are using credit cards to pay for their weddings, a strategy that financial experts say can be beneficial if handled carefully. Using a credit card for large wedding purchases can help couples earn significant rewards points or sign-up bonuses, which can then be used for a honeymoon. However, this approach is only advisable if the couple has the savings to pay off the balance immediately to avoid high-interest debt. Experts caution against going into debt for a short-term event and recommend considering wedding insurance for broader protection against unforeseen issues.</p>

          <p>Animal welfare advocates are pushing for the passage of the Captive Primate Safety Act to combat the brutal illegal pet trade. The article highlights the story of Violeta, an endangered spider monkey rescued by the Oakland Zoo, to illustrate the suffering primates endure when poached as infants and kept as pets. Experts explain that these animals suffer from chronic stress, malnutrition, and psychological damage, and often become dangerously aggressive as adults.
