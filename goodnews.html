          <div class="timestamp">2025-05-22 20:28:19 EDT</div>
        </div>
        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Japan's core inflation rate rose to 3.5% in April, marking the highest level in over two years, primarily driven by rising rice prices. This figure exceeded economists' expectations and has kept inflation above the Bank of Japan's 2% target for more than three years. The Bank of Japan Governor Kazuo Ueda has indicated potential interest rate hikes while closely monitoring the impact of U.S. tariffs. Economists anticipate a future easing of core inflation due to lower crude oil prices and the appreciation of the yen.</p>

          <p>During road construction in Lubbock, Texas, ancient bones of megafauna, or large mammals, have been discovered, exciting archaeologists. The Texas Department of Transportation announced the find, noting that such discoveries are not unusual in the region. Among the finds is at least one giant ground sloth, identified by its distinctive tooth, with possibilities of mammoth or mastodon remains as well. If evidence of human settlement alongside the megafauna is found, it would be a first for a TxDOT project, potentially halting construction temporarily.</p>

          <p>Prince William has cited Sir David Attenborough as a major influence behind his upcoming wildlife documentary series, "Guardians," which highlights the dangerous work of rangers protecting endangered species. The Prince of Wales emphasized the importance of the series in bringing awareness to the risks these rangers face, noting that approximately 1,400 rangers have died in the past decade. He hopes the series will inspire people to recognize the value and importance of conserving the natural world, much like Attenborough's documentaries have done for decades. Each episode will feature an on-screen introduction by Prince William.</p>

          <p>The U.S. Army is set to resume horse-drawn funeral carriages at Arlington National Cemetery in June, following a suspension in May 2023 due to the deaths and injuries of several horses. After an investigation, the Army enlisted equestrian expert David O'Connor to improve the program, focusing on education, animal welfare, and equipment upgrades. Changes include lighter carriages, reduced workload for the horses, and extensive training for unit personnel. The program will now involve two squads of eleven horses performing two services a day, totaling about ten funerals per week.</p>

          <p>Dr. Maher Abdallah, director of American Reproductive Centers in Palm Springs, has vowed to rebuild his clinic after a bomb explosion nearly destroyed it. Despite the devastation, the in vitro fertilization lab remained intact, and thousands of frozen eggs, sperm, and embryos were unharmed. The bombing, labeled as domestic terrorism by the FBI, killed the suspected bomber, Guy Edward Bartkus, who held antinatalist views. Abdallah has forgiven the suspect and is focusing on the future, with the clinic temporarily relocating to a surgical center and plans to rebuild on the same site.</p>

          <p>Beef prices in the U.S. have surged to record highs, with ground beef reaching $5.80 per pound in April, nearly a 50% increase from five years ago. Ranchers are struggling with rising costs for feed, land, and financing, leading to U.S. cattle herds falling to their lowest numbers in over 70 years. Drought conditions have further exacerbated the situation, making it difficult to maintain grazing land for the cows. The USDA forecasts that beef prices will continue to rise throughout 2025 as supplies tighten.</p>

          <p>Amazon shareholders rejected a proposal to separate the CEO and board chair roles, with approximately 82% voting against it. The proposal aimed to codify the structure implemented in 2021 when Jeff Bezos transitioned to executive chairman and Andy Jassy became CEO. The Accountability Board argued that separating the roles would allow the board to focus on corporate governance while the CEO focuses on business. Amazon urged shareholders to vote against the proposal, stating the current policy enables the board to determine the right leadership for the company at any given time.</p>
