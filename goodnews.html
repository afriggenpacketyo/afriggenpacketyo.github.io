          <p>AMC Entertainment's stock rose after the company announced significantly improved second-quarter financial results, beating Wall Street expectations. The movie theater chain reported revenue of nearly $1.4 billion and a dramatically reduced net loss of $4.7 million, attributing the success to a recovering box office and increased attendance. CEO Adam Aron highlighted the company's progress in managing its debt and noted record-breaking revenue per patron, driven by growth in premium offerings. The positive results signal a potential turnaround for the company following post-pandemic struggles. (not investment advice)</p>

The company, which was reacquired by co-founder Eric Baker in 2020, has filed an updated prospectus showing revenue growth but also a widening net loss. The move comes amid a resurgent IPO market, with several tech and crypto firms recently going public.

          <p>President Trump announced that his administration is actively considering the reclassification of marijuana under federal law, a move that could happen within weeks. This statement prompted a significant rally in cannabis stocks, as reclassification would have major implications for the industry, including changes to tax regulations and increased access to institutional investment. Currently, cannabis is a Schedule I drug, alongside substances like heroin; a potential move to Schedule III would be a "game changer" for the market. Industry leaders are optimistic that the president's public engagement on the issue signals a high likelihood of impending reform. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>Prominent venture capitalist Mike Moritz has publicly defended Intel CEO Lip-Bu Tan after President Trump called for his resignation over alleged conflicts of interest. In a Financial Times piece, Moritz, who has known Tan for decades, described Trump's attack as "artless bullying" and a "vindictive political sideshow." He urged Intel's board to show "backbone" and support Tan, citing his successful turnaround of Cadence Design Systems as evidence of his capability to lead Intel's transformation. Following the pressure, Tan visited the White House to discuss Intel's collaboration with the U.S. government.</p>

          <p>President Trump has signed an executive order delaying the reimposition of high tariffs on Chinese goods for an additional 90 days, pushing the deadline to mid-November. The extension was an expected outcome of recent trade negotiations between U.S. and Chinese officials in Stockholm. Without the delay, U.S. duties on Chinese imports would have reverted to the peak levels seen in April, which were as high as 145%. This move illustrates the administration's unpredictable trade policy, which has seen tariffs frequently paused or altered with little advance notice for businesses.</p>

This new agreement gives Netflix the first right of refusal on their projects, offering more flexibility than their previous exclusive deal from 2020. The partnership has already produced several documentaries, including "Harry & Meghan." Upcoming projects include a second season of Meghan's lifestyle show and a feature film adaptation of the novel "Meet Me at the Lake," signaling a continued focus on their U.S.-based media ventures.</p>

          <h2>Fears of 'Peak Mineral' Shortages for Green Energy Transition May Be Overstated</h2>
          <div class="timestamp">2025-08-11 15:52:52 EDT</div>
        </div>
        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>A new study suggests the global transition to clean energy could face significant shortages of key minerals, but this article argues that such "peak mineral" fears may be premature. Just as technological advancements like fracking overcame "peak oil" concerns, rapid innovation in green technology is already reducing reliance on scarce materials. For example, battery manufacturers are moving away from cobalt, and solar panel makers are using less silver. While mining more minerals is necessary, the dynamic nature of technology, potential for substitutes, and government investment could mitigate the forecasted shortfalls.</p>

          <p>This article provides guidance for new investors considering adding gold to their portfolios amidst an unusual economic climate of rising inflation and a strong stock market. It advises beginners to evaluate their short-term financial goals, as gold is more of a wealth protector than an income generator. Investors should also be mindful of gold's price volatility, as it has recently hit record highs, which could make it a costly entry point. Finally, the piece emphasizes gold's role as a portfolio diversifier and suggests consulting a professional to determine an appropriate allocation. (not investment advice)</p>

Following Trump's announcement on social media, gold futures dropped significantly.

          <p>The Trump administration has struck an unusual deal with Nvidia and AMD, granting them export licenses to sell specific AI chips to China in exchange for 15% of the revenue.

The move highlights the administration's transactional approach to trade and national security, treating semiconductor technology as a unique strategic asset.

The 75,000-year-old fossils include a wide range of species, from lemmings and fish to whales and a polar bear. The find fills a major gap in understanding how ecosystems responded to past climate change. DNA analysis revealed that the ancient animal lineages did not survive the subsequent refreezing of the glaciers, offering a stark warning about the vulnerability of cold-adapted species to rapid climatic shifts.</p>
