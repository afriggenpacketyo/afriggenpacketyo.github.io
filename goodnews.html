          <h2>Japanese Universities Receive Defense Tech Subsidies Amid Budget Constraints</h2>
          <div class="timestamp">2025-06-01 08:25:00 EDT</div>

          <p>Japanese universities have received approximately 2.7 billion yen in defense-related technology subsidies from the Defense Ministry over nine years, starting in fiscal year 2015. This funding has become increasingly important for researchers due to declining operational subsidies to national universities and a decreasing student population. While the ministry's program aims to advance state-of-the-art projects like harmful gas absorption sheets and AI-driven cyberattack detection, some experts express concern about the potential for military applications and the Defense Ministry's influence on research directions. The subsidy budget has increased significantly since the program's inception, reflecting the growing emphasis on security-related technology research. </p>

          <p>Chinese scientists have traced the origins of the "ghost ancestors" of modern Tibetans to Yunnan province through ancient DNA analysis. The study, published in Science, verifies the hypothesis that an archaeological site in central Yunnan is one of the origins of populations on the Tibetan Plateau. The research fills a critical gap in the genetic data of prehistoric populations in East and Southeast Asia. It identifies one of the Tibetan Plateau‚Äôs ‚Äúghost ancestors‚Äù for the first time from a genetic perspective. </p>

          <p>The French series 'Reformed,' streaming on Max, features Rabbi L√©a Schmoll, played by Elsa Guedj, as she balances tradition and modernity in her new role in Strasbourg. The show focuses on the challenges of making ancient rituals relevant in a world that often lacks clear answers. L√©a contends with both the nihilism of the modern world and the rigidness of Orthodoxy, finding herself caught in the middle. She seeks to provide meaning and comfort to her congregation through her interpretations of Jewish traditions. </p>

          <p>The article advocates for a new social contract that lifts from the bottom of society, drawing lessons from past poor people's movements. It highlights the welfare rights movement of the 1960s and 1970s, particularly the National Welfare Rights Organization (NWRO), as an example of effective grassroots organizing. The NWRO, led by Black women, fought for welfare rights and created innovative "projects of survival." The article suggests that the Johnnie Tillmon model, which emphasizes uniting the poor and addressing their daily needs, is relevant today. </p>

Sunscreen is important for all passengers, especially those with a personal or family history of skin cancer. </p>
