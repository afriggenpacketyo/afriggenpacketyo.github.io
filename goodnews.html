          <p>Actress Arianne Zucker has reached a settlement in her lawsuit against the producers of the soap opera “Days of Our Lives,” including Corday Productions and its owner, Ken Corday. Zucker’s 2024 lawsuit alleged she faced pervasive sexual harassment and discrimination from former executive producer Albert Alarr, and that she experienced retaliation after reporting his behavior. While the terms of the settlement were not disclosed, it concludes a high-profile dispute where Zucker claimed her pay was cut and her character was ultimately written off the show. Alarr was terminated following an internal investigation into his on-set conduct.</p>

          <p>As he traveled to a peace summit in Egypt, U.S. President Donald Trump declared that the war in Gaza "is over," expressing confidence that a new ceasefire between Israel and Hamas will hold. The statement comes as Germany prepares to pledge at least €100 million for the reconstruction of the devastated region and plans to co-host an international conference on the matter. The peace agreement includes the expected release of all 20 living Israeli hostages in exchange for approximately 2,000 Palestinian prisoners, marking a significant step toward resolving the two-year conflict.</p>

          <p>Syria's new president, Ahmed al-Sharaa, who once led an al Qaeda affiliate, is now tasked with rebuilding and unifying the nation after his forces overthrew the Assad regime in just 11 days. Formerly designated a terrorist by the U.S., al-Sharaa is now engaging in international diplomacy, seeking the lifting of economic sanctions and billions in aid to reconstruct the war-torn country. He faces immense challenges, including addressing sectarian violence, protecting minority groups, and transitioning the fractured state toward democracy. His journey from militant leader to head of state presents a pivotal and complex moment for Syria and the Middle East.</p>

          <div class="timestamp">2025-10-12 19:28:53 EDT</div>
        </div>
        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>As adults navigate changing life stages like careers and family, maintaining friendships often becomes a challenge, leading many connections to fade over time. Psychologists advise being more intentional and creative, such as integrating friends into mundane activities like running errands to maintain in-person contact. Experts stress the importance of honest communication about one's availability and needs to avoid misunderstandings that can lead to "ghosting." They also recommend reframing socializing as a "muscle" that gets easier with practice and trusting that friends are more understanding than one might assume, thereby overcoming the common "liking gap" anxiety.</p>

          <h2>Scientists Use Thermal Imaging of Nose Temperature to Objectively Measure Stress</h2>
          <div class="timestamp">2025-10-12 19:28:34 EDT</div>
        </div>
        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Psychologists at the University of Sussex are pioneering a new, non-invasive method to measure stress by using thermal cameras to monitor facial blood flow. Researchers have discovered that during stressful situations, a person's nose temperature drops as the nervous system diverts blood to the eyes and ears in a "fight or flight" response. This "nasal dip" provides a robust, objective marker of a person's stress level and how quickly they recover. The technique could become a valuable tool for managing harmful stress and monitoring the well-being of individuals who cannot communicate verbally, including infants and non-human primates.</p>

          <p>Renowned mathematician Shing-Tung Yau has shared his perspective on what China needs to achieve global leadership in science and technology, emphasizing the critical importance of cultivating domestic talent. As Beijing formulates its next five-year plan, Yau's insights focus on moving beyond manufacturing success to fostering foundational scientific innovation. He suggests that while China has competed effectively in some areas due to its skilled labor force, achieving true scientific primacy requires a deeper investment in homegrown researchers and thinkers. His comments come as the U.S. and China continue their intense rivalry for technological and scientific dominance on the world stage.</p>

          <p>Paramount has initiated a bid to acquire Warner Bros. Discovery, a potential merger that would significantly reshape the Hollywood landscape, but its initial offer of around $20 per share has been rejected. Despite the rejection, talks between the two media giants are reportedly ongoing, with Paramount preparing a revised offer. The bid is backed by billionaire Larry Ellison and his son David, who recently acquired a controlling stake in Paramount. A successful merger could lead to major industry consolidation, potentially combining assets like the Warner Bros. film studio with Paramount and merging news divisions such as CNN and CBS News.</p>

          <p>A recent meeting between Chinese President Xi Jinping and Indian Prime Minister Narendra Modi signals a potential reset in the historically fraught relationship between the two Asian powers. With Modi expressing a commitment to "strategic autonomy" and preventing differences from becoming disputes, India appears to be hedging its bets as its relationship with the U.S. under President Trump becomes more strained. The leaders agreed to frame their nations as "partners" rather than "rivals," with plans to resume direct flights after a five-year halt. This diplomatic warming could represent a strategic pivot for India, seeking to build a coalition of eastern powers.</p>

          <p>Scotland's path to the 2026 World Cup finals will be decided in their last two qualification matches after a recent victory over Belarus secured them at least a second-place finish in their group. They are currently tied on points with Denmark, who hold a significant goal-difference advantage. To secure automatic qualification, Scotland likely needs a win against Greece in Athens, followed by another victory against Denmark at home in what could be a winner-takes-all showdown. A draw or loss in either game would likely send Scotland to the high-stakes play-offs in March to determine their fate.</p>

          <p>Australian cricket captain Alyssa Healy produced a masterful century to lead her team to a record-breaking victory over India in the Women's Cricket World Cup. Chasing a target of 330, Australia completed their first-ever successful ODI chase over 300, a milestone for the historically dominant team. Healy's hundred, which came after a recent run of poor form, was instrumental in securing the three-wicket win and reinforcing Australia's status as tournament favorites. For Healy, who has won seven world titles as a player, winning the World Cup as captain remains a final major goal in her illustrious career.</p>

          <p>Week 6 of the NFL season featured several notable outcomes, including a stunning upset as the Carolina Panthers defeated the Dallas Cowboys 30-27 with a last-second field goal. In a display of offensive futility, the winless New York Jets managed only minus-10 net passing yards in their 13-11 loss to the Denver Broncos. Elsewhere, the Tampa Bay Buccaneers beat the injury-plagued San Francisco 49ers, and the Indianapolis Colts staged a fourth-quarter comeback to defeat the Arizona Cardinals. The results continue to shape the divisional races as teams move further into the regular season schedule.</p>
