        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>The national average savings account interest rate is 0.42% as of June 2, 2025, but high-yield savings accounts offer significantly higher rates, ranging from 4.10% to 4.40%. Online banks often provide these higher rates due to lower overhead costs. Financial experts recommend choosing a high-yield savings account and comparing different accounts to maximize earnings. These accounts can help individuals build a financial safety net and prepare for unexpected expenses. The availability of high-yield options provides a positive outlook for those looking to grow their savings.</p>

          <p>Manchester City's manager, Pep Guardiola, has identified Wolves defender Rayan Ait-Nouri as a top target to address the team's need for a specialist left-back. The club has been operating without a dedicated player in that position since Benjamin Mendy's departure. While no agreement is currently in place, sources suggest that a transfer for the 23-year-old Algerian international is likely to occur. The potential acquisition of Ait-Nouri could provide a boost to Manchester City's defensive lineup.</p>

          <p>As of June 2, 2025, the price of gold is $3,359.72 per ounce, influenced by factors such as supply and demand, economic conditions, and geopolitical events. Gold is often seen as a safe-haven asset during times of economic uncertainty and as a hedge against inflation. Fluctuations in the U.S. dollar's strength and central bank policies also impact gold prices. Investors should monitor these factors to make informed decisions regarding gold investments. (not investment advice) The article suggests a moderately optimistic outlook, given gold's traditional role as a safe haven.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Japan's revenue from the departure tax, collected from travelers, has reached a record high in fiscal year 2024, driven by an increase in visitors. The revenue has already surpassed 48.1 billion yen ($34 billion), exceeding the previous record of 44.3 billion yen in fiscal 2019. The government imposes a 1,000 yen International Tourist Tax on each traveler leaving the country. The country has been attracting more visitors due to a weaker yen and increased flights. Prime Minister Shigeru Ishiba has expressed willingness to increase the departure tax to further promote tourism and address overcrowding at tourist sites. This increase in revenue signifies a positive trend for Japan's tourism industry.</p>

          <p>Researchers are exploring the potential of microbes found in unusual places, including household sludge, to help solve environmental problems. Microbes, nature's alchemists, can transform compounds and chemicals for survival, thriving in extreme environments. A non-profit, The Two Frontiers Project, seeks microorganisms that might pull carbon dioxide from the atmosphere, grow crops in hostile environments, and clean up hazardous waste sites. They are now surveying homes for interesting slimes and goos, partnering with a citizen science platform to collect samples. The team is examining DNA of these microbes to census the organisms, search for new species, and determine whether any of them might be useful to humans. This research could potentially lead to innovative solutions for climate change and environmental cleanup.</p>

          <p>Major steel stocks experienced a significant surge after President Donald Trump announced a doubling of tariffs on steel imports. Shares of Cleveland-Cliffs jumped approximately 25% in premarket trading, while Steel Dynamics and Nucor each increased by more than 10%. The VanEck Steel ETF (SLX) also saw a rise of 1.9%. Trump stated that the tariff increase, bringing it from 25% to 50%, would further secure the steel industry in the United States. (not investment advice) The market's reaction to the tariff increase suggests a positive short-term outlook for steel stocks, but the long-term effects remain uncertain.</p>

          <p>The mayor of Tulsa, Oklahoma, has proposed a $100 million private trust to address the effects of the 1921 Tulsa race massacre. The plan aims to provide scholarships and housing assistance to descendants of the victims. The proposal does not include direct cash payments to descendants or the last two survivors of the attack. The trust would focus on revitalizing the city‚Äôs north side, particularly the Greenwood district, which was destroyed during the massacre. The mayor characterizes the plan as a "road to repair" rather than reparations. The proposal faces a challenging political climate, but it represents a significant step towards addressing historical injustices.</p>
