        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Despite ongoing trade tensions and deflationary pressures, China's industrial profits demonstrated a faster pace of growth in April, marking the second consecutive month of increases, according to official data. Cumulative profits at major industrial firms rose by 3%, an acceleration from the 2.6% growth observed in March, with high-tech manufacturing and equipment sectors leading the gains. This growth comes even after the U.S. imposed substantial tariffs on Chinese imports, leading to retaliatory measures from Beijing, though recent agreements have eased some of these levies. While some industries, such as automobiles and apparel, faced headwinds, private and foreign-invested enterprises saw profit improvements, demonstrating resilience in the face of external shocks.

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>A recent study has revealed that certain beers brewed in the United States contain elevated levels of polyfluoroalkyl substances (PFAS), commonly known as "forever chemicals," exceeding the Environmental Protection Agency's (EPA) allowed limits. Researchers from the ACS' Environmental Science & Technology discovered that beers brewed in North Carolina, California, and Michigan had the highest concentrations of PFAS, with a strong correlation between PFAS levels in municipal drinking water and the beer. While breweries have water filtration systems, they are not designed to prevent PFAS from entering the batch, and international beers tested showed lower levels of PFAS. The research team suggests that drinking water is a primary route of PFAS contamination in beer.</p>

          <p>For the first time in 34 years, Japan has lost its position as the world's leading creditor, with Germany now holding the top spot, according to the Finance Ministry. Despite an increase in Japan's net external assets to a record high, partly due to a weaker yen, Germany's gross external assets surpassed Japan's. The yen's depreciation boosted the value of Japan's foreign-currency assets, while Germany benefited from a large current account surplus. While Japan's external liabilities also climbed, the United States holds a net external liability, indicating its foreign debts exceed its overseas assets. (not investment advice)</p>

Other Chinese automakers also saw their shares decline as investors grew cautious about the potential for a price war.

          <p>Mexican photographer Graciela Iturbide has been awarded the 2025 Princess of Asturias Award for the Arts in Spain for her decades-long portrayal of social reality, particularly within indigenous communities in Mexico.

The award jury praised Iturbide's photographs for their documentary aspect and hypnotic quality, capturing a world that seems to exist on the border between harsh reality and spontaneous magic. The Princess of Asturias Award, which includes a prize of 50,000 euros, will be presented at a ceremony in Oviedo, Spain.</p>

          <p>A Canadian man, Jeffrey Wood, has been sentenced to nearly two years in prison for stealing a famous photograph of Winston Churchill, known as "The Roaring Lion," from Ottawa's Ch√¢teau Laurier hotel. Wood pleaded guilty to stealing the original print, taken by Yousuf Karsh in 1941, and admitted to forgery after replacing the photograph with a fake. The photo, which features on the UK ¬£5 note, was recovered last year in Genoa, Italy, in the possession of a private buyer unaware of its theft. The judge emphasized the breach of trust in stealing such a piece of national pride, while Wood's lawyer deemed the sentence unnecessarily harsh for a first-time offender.</p>

          <p>A House bill proposes cutting in half a tax write-off for sports team owners, potentially worth hundreds of millions, by reducing the deductible value of intangible assets like player contracts and media rights. While the provision would only affect future owners, it could cool the current high demand for teams, impacting current owners' investment growth. The Joint Committee on Taxation estimates the change would raise nearly $1 billion over 10 years, though team owners insist the number is far higher. The White House claims the measure aims to ensure fairness for fans, not team ownership, while some speculate it is a punitive measure against the NFL. (not investment advice)</p>

These machines compact and store empty Coca-Cola bottles, and users are rewarded with points via a mobile app for each deposit, which can be used for discounts on Coca-Cola products. Each RVM can hold up to 800 bottles, which are then collected and repurposed into clothes, bags, or more packaging. This initiative aims to address plastic waste and promote consumer participation in recycling, although Coca-Cola still needs to do more to limit plastic pollution.</p>

This trend is fueled by the flexibility of gin production, which allows for experimentation with various botanicals, and the ability to convert existing whiskey and shochu equipment. The rise in domestic shipments of gin reflects growing consumer interest, with dedicated e-commerce sites and bars contributing to the industry's growth.</p>

          <p>President Trump announced a delay in the implementation of a 50% tariff on goods from the European Union, pushing the deadline from June 1 to July 9 to allow time for negotiations with the bloc. The decision followed a call with European Commission President Ursula von der Leyen, who expressed a desire to engage in serious negotiations. Trump had previously threatened the tariffs due to perceived difficulties in trade negotiations with the EU, which caused the stock market to drop. Von der Leyen affirmed the importance of the EU-U.S. trade relationship and the need for time to reach a good deal.</p>

          <h2>King Charles Prepares to Deliver Key Speech Backing Canada Amid US Tensions</h2>

          <p>King Charles III is set to deliver a significant speech in Canada's parliament, expected to offer support amid the country's dispute with US President Donald Trump. This marks the royal couple's first trip to Canada since the start of their reign, and the King, as Canada's head of state, met with Prime Minister Mark Carney shortly after arriving. Carney, elected on a wave of anti-Trump sentiment, has invited the King to deliver the "Speech from the Throne," a symbolic show of support for Canada's sovereignty. The speech, written on the advice of the Canadian government, will likely convey a message that the country is "not for sale" to the US.</p>
