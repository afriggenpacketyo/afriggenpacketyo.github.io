          <h2>September CPI Report Shows Inflation Climbed at Cooler Pace Than Expected, Influencing Fed Rate Decisions</h2>
          <div class="timestamp">2025-10-24 20:05:26 EDT</div>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>The Consumer Price Index (CPI) rose at an annual rate of 3% in September, slightly below economists' forecasts of 3.1%, as the impact of President Trump's tariffs remained somewhat muted. This data is crucial for determining Social Security's cost-of-living adjustment and could be the last inflation report for a while due to the government shutdown. Economists note that tariffs contribute to rising prices, but businesses absorb some costs. The article suggests this 'benign' CPI report supports expectations for a quarter-point rate cut by the Federal Reserve next week, despite inflation edging higher, as the Fed prioritizes a weakening job market.

          <p>As clocks go back and daylight hours diminish, particularly in Scotland's northern Isles, over a million people in the UK experience Seasonal Affective Disorder (SAD). SAD is a recurring seasonal depression linked to reduced daylight, causing symptoms like low mood, irritability, and anxiety. This article explores coping strategies, including the 'Wintering Well' project in Orkney, which offers therapeutic lamps and activity guides.

          <h2>MPs Advise Against Cutting Cash ISA Allowance in UK Budget</h2>
          <div class="timestamp">2025-10-24 19:09:17 EDT</div>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>A group of UK MPs, including the Treasury Select Committee, has strongly advised Chancellor Rachel Reeves against cutting the cash ISA tax-free allowance in the upcoming Budget. They argue that such cuts are unlikely to foster an investment culture and would face opposition from banks and consumer groups. The Chancellor is reportedly considering reducing the cash ISA limit from £20,000 to £10,000 to encourage investment and address a £22bn budget shortfall. This article emphasizes that while the ambition to promote investment is supported, a cut to the most widely used ISA type is not the right approach. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>UK motorists are experiencing a quiet shift towards automatic cars, with one in three vehicles now automatic and a quarter of driving tests taken in them last year. This trend is driven by the upcoming 2030 ban on new petrol and diesel car sales, as electric vehicles lack manual gearboxes. New drivers face the decision of learning manual for broader car options or automatic for a potentially quicker test, despite manual tests having a higher pass rate. This article explores the challenges of finding automatic instructors and the changing perceptions around automatic-only licenses.</p>

          <p>Magnesium, often hailed as the 'mineral of the moment,' is experiencing a boom in the supplement market due to its purported benefits for sleep, digestion, and mental health. While magnesium is crucial for over 300 bodily processes, including nerve function and blood sugar regulation, dietitians caution against relying solely on supplements without a confirmed deficiency. This article highlights the influence of social media in popularizing various magnesium compounds, but stresses the lack of strong evidence for their effectiveness in healthy individuals. Experts recommend prioritizing a magnesium-rich diet first, as excessive intake can lead to adverse effects and be dangerous for those with kidney disease.</p>
