          <p>Shares of Chinese electric vehicle maker Xpeng surged in Hong Kong following positive earnings reports and revenue forecasts. Analysts anticipate Xpeng will achieve profitability by the fourth quarter of 2025 due to strong sales and upcoming new models. The company's first-quarter revenue more than doubled, driven by increased vehicle deliveries, and its net loss narrowed significantly. UOB Kay Hian maintains a buy rating on Xpeng, projecting a substantial upside from its current price. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>The New York Knicks suffered a Game 1 loss in the Eastern Conference Finals against the Indiana Pacers, blowing a double-digit lead in the fourth quarter. Aaron Nesmith's six consecutive three-pointers fueled Indiana's comeback, and Tyrese Haliburton hit a game-tying shot to force overtime. Despite Jalen Brunson's 43 points, the Knicks couldn't hold on, and Obi Toppin's late slam sealed the victory for the Pacers. This series is a rematch of last year's second round and a continuation of a historic rivalry from the 1990s.</p>

          <p>Canada is in discussions with the United States about joining President Trump's proposed "Golden Dome" missile defense program, according to Prime Minister Mark Carney. The system aims to defend against various missile threats, including those from space.

          <p>This New York Times article reports on a House Republican proposal to give newborns $1,000 in "Trump accounts," formerly called "MAGA accounts." Under the bill, children born between 2025 and 2029 would receive the money, which would be invested on their behalf in financial markets. The funds could be withdrawn later to pay for expenses like college or buying a house. Tax experts are puzzled by the accounts, which function similarly to typical investment accounts rather than tax-advantaged accounts.</p>

          <p>The Japanese government has initiated a revamped gasoline subsidy to reduce prices by 10 yen per liter to alleviate cost-of-living pressures for consumers. The subsidy provides a fixed sum to wholesalers regardless of prices, aiming for a gradual reduction in gasoline prices at gas stations. The program is expected to last until March 2026 and is implemented ahead of the House of Councillors election. The subsidy is intended to ease the impact of U.S. tariffs and inflation on Japanese consumers.</p>
