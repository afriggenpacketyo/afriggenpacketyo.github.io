          <p>As part of a major ceasefire agreement, the last group of living hostages held by Hamas has been released after two years in captivity. However, the Hostage Families Forum has accused Hamas of breaching the deal by only returning a fraction of the deceased hostages' bodies as promised. In a related development, former U.S. President Donald Trump addressed the Israeli Knesset, declaring an end to the war and the dawn of a "new Middle East." His speech, which was met with widespread applause, was briefly interrupted by two lawmakers protesting the conflict.</p>

        </div>
        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Seven years after making a bet with "The Bell Curve" co-author Charles Murray, a psychologist declares victory, arguing that science is no closer to a fundamental genetic explanation for intelligence. The article asserts that while genome-wide association studies have found minor correlations between DNA variations and IQ, they have not revealed any causal mechanisms or provided significant predictive power. The author contends that intelligence, much like financial solvency, is a complex trait influenced by an interacting matrix of genes and environment. The piece concludes that the deterministic genetic view of IQ promoted by Murray remains scientifically unsubstantiated.</p>

          <div class="timestamp">2025-10-13 08:00:00 EDT</div>
        </div>
        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>This article challenges the increasingly popular public health push to eliminate ultra-processed foods, arguing that such a goal is impossible for many working parents. While acknowledging the health risks associated with diets high in these foods, the author points out that the category is overly broad, lumping nutritious items like tofu and whole-grain bread with junk food. The piece emphasizes the significant time, cost, and mental energy required to prepare meals from scratch, making convenience foods a practical necessity. It advocates for a harm-reduction approach rather than complete avoidance, focusing on making healthier choices within the reality of modern life.</p>

          <p>Shares of U.S.-based rare earth mining companies saw a significant surge following President Donald Trump's threat of retaliation against China for its export controls on the critical minerals. Companies like USA Rare Earth and Critical Metals experienced double-digit percentage gains in early trading. The market movement was further bolstered by the Defense Department's efforts to stockpile these minerals and a major investment pledge from JPMorgan Chase into companies vital to U.S. national security. Rare earths are essential for manufacturing advanced weapons, electric vehicles, and other high-tech applications. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>England's rugby league head coach Shaun Wane has named the final 24-man squad for the upcoming Ashes Test series against Australia, the first in over two decades. The selection includes three players from the Grand Final-winning Hull KR team: Mikey Lewis, Jez Litten, and Joe Burgess, who returns after a 10-year absence. Notably, Super League's Man of Steel winner, Jake Connor, was omitted from the team. The squad features a mix of Super League and NRL-based talent as England prepares to face the reigning world champion Kangaroos in a highly anticipated three-match series.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>U.S. Middle East envoy Steve Witkoff has publicly praised the "tireless efforts" of the UK's National Security Adviser, Jonathan Powell, in achieving the Gaza ceasefire. This commendation provides a political boost for Powell, who is currently facing scrutiny over a collapsed espionage case in the UK. Witkoff's statement contrasts sharply with comments from the U.S. ambassador to Israel, who dismissed the UK's contribution as "delusional." The praise highlights the close working relationship between Powell and Witkoff, which was also instrumental in diplomatic efforts concerning the war in Ukraine.</p>

          <p>The families of the seven living hostages released by Hamas have shared statements of profound relief and joy after being reunited with their loved ones after more than two years. The family of Omri Miran described his return as a "victory of an entire people" and the beginning of a long recovery journey. In contrast, the Hostage Families Forum expressed shock and dismay, accusing Hamas of blatantly breaching the ceasefire agreement. The group claims that only four of the 28 bodies of deceased hostages were returned as scheduled, and they are demanding immediate action from mediators.</p>

          <p>The phenomenon of "zombification" in nature, where parasites manipulate the behavior of their hosts for their own benefit, is the subject of new scientific inquiry. Examples include fungi that force flies to climb to high perches to spread spores and flatworms that make snails' eyestalks resemble caterpillars to attract birds. Researchers are studying these instances of mind control to better understand complex biological mechanisms. Potential applications of this research include developing new pest control strategies and creating advanced immunosuppressive drugs by learning how these parasites evade their hosts' immune systems.</p>

          <p>Tropical Storm Lorenzo, the twelfth named storm of the 2025 Atlantic hurricane season, has formed in the central Atlantic Ocean. The National Hurricane Center notes that forecast models currently show a wide range of potential intensities, from a weak storm to a Category 2 hurricane. However, the projected track, or "spaghetti models," consistently show the storm curving north and then east into the open Atlantic. Based on the current forecasts, Lorenzo is not expected to pose a threat to Florida or the United States' east coast.</p>

          <p>According to an economist at Soochow Securities, the ongoing bull market in China is fundamentally based on a weakening U.S. dollar and is unlikely to be derailed by recent U.S. tariff threats. Chen Li, the firm's chief global economist, argued that while trade tensions can trigger market corrections, investors have become largely "immune" to such threats. He stated that underlying concerns about U.S. fiscal policy, the global economic outlook, and political instability under President Trump are the more significant drivers of market sentiment. The market has shown resilience, rallying despite the latest trade jitters. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>Following the initial phase of the Gaza ceasefire which saw the release of all living hostages, attention now turns to the next stages of the U.S.-brokered peace plan. The agreement outlines a future for Gaza that includes demilitarization and governance by a transitional committee of Palestinian technocrats, eventually handing over to a reformed Palestinian Authority. Key sticking points remain, including Hamas's refusal to disarm and disagreement over the extent and timeline of Israeli troop withdrawal. The plan also proposes an economic development fund to rebuild the territory, with Hamas playing no future role in its governance.</p>

        </div>
        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>This article provides a hypothetical scenario offering financial strategies for a couple in their late 50s managing a $36,000 college tuition bill after a layoff reduced their household income. It advises against withdrawing from retirement accounts, as this would incur penalties and jeopardize their future financial security. Instead, a multi-pronged approach is suggested, combining grants from the university's financial aid office, a part-time campus job for the student, and using funds from a 529 educational savings plan. The remaining balance is covered through a combination of emergency savings, selling personal assets, and finally, federal student loans. (not investment advice)</p>
