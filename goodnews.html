          <p>During a discussion, President Trump conveyed to Apple CEO Tim Cook his preference for the company to manufacture its products within the United States rather than expanding production in India. Trump referenced Apple's commitment to invest $500 billion in the U.S. and expressed his desire for Apple to prioritize domestic production, while also acknowledging the company's previous investments in China. Apple has been increasing its production in India to reduce its reliance on China, aiming to manufacture around 25% of its global iPhones in India over the next few years, as approximately 90% of its smartphones are assembled in China.</p>

          <p>House Republicans, particularly those from New York, are in conflict with party leadership over the $10,000 cap on the State and Local Tax (SALT) deduction. This has become a major obstacle for Republicans attempting to pass a $3.8 trillion tax proposal that extends President Trump‚Äôs 2017 tax cuts. Some Republicans from high-tax states like New York, New Jersey, and California are threatening to vote against the package unless the cap is raised or eliminated. A House committee approved raising the cap to $30,000, but disagreements persist, highlighting the political challenges of balancing tax relief with federal revenue concerns, as voters express frustration over high local taxes.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>A new analysis from the National Association of Realtors reveals that a shortage of affordable homes is preventing many middle-income families from achieving homeownership. Only about 20% of listed homes in March were affordable for households earning $75,000 annually, a significant drop from pre-pandemic levels. Rising home prices and higher mortgage rates are pricing middle-class households out of the market, with the affordability gap worsening in cities with restrictive zoning regulations. The lack of affordable homes is driving up prices, as buyers compete for limited inventory, impacting careers such as nursing, teaching, and plumbing.</p>

          <p>Federal Reserve Chair Jerome Powell indicated that longer-term interest rates are likely to be higher due to changing economic conditions and policy uncertainties. Speaking at the Thomas Laubach Research Conference, Powell noted that the era of near-zero rates is unlikely to return soon, even with long-term inflation expectations near the Fed's 2% target. He cautioned that the economy may face more frequent and persistent supply shocks, posing challenges for central banks. While he did not directly mention President Trump's tariffs, Powell acknowledged that tariffs could slow growth and increase inflation, making policy decisions more complex.</p>

          <p>Walmart's CFO, John David Rainey, cautioned that consumers could start seeing higher prices later this month due to tariffs, despite a recent agreement to lower duties on imports from China. The retailer, while beating earnings expectations, noted that the magnitude of the tariff increases is too large for retailers and suppliers to absorb. Walmart expects net sales to increase 3.5% to 4.5% for the fiscal second quarter but declined to provide earnings guidance due to fluctuating tariff policies. CEO Doug McMillon highlighted that tariffs on countries like Costa Rica, Peru, and Colombia have put pressure on the prices of bananas, avocados, coffee, and roses.</p>

Despite concerns about the cost of living squeeze and pressures on small businesses, the UK is currently the fastest-growing economy among the G7 nations.

          <p>LA28, the committee planning the 2028 Summer Olympics in Los Angeles, is partnering with Archer Aviation to deploy electric air taxis as part of a broader effort to create a ‚Äúcar-free‚Äù Olympics. The air taxis will offer 10- to 20-minute flights between vertiports throughout the city, including at SoFi Stadium and LAX, catering to spectators and VIPs. Archer‚Äôs four-passenger eVTOL aircraft aim to provide a convenient alternative to navigating L.A. traffic, with prices targeted to be on par with high-end ride-sharing services. The fleet will also provide emergency services and security support during the Games.</p>

Gen Jenkins, formerly head of UK Special Forces, is the first Royal Marine to hold the position. His appointment follows a BBC Panorama investigation alleging that he oversaw the rejection of resettlement applications from Afghan commandos who served alongside the SAS. The Ministry of Defence denied allegations that it tried to prevent former Afghan troops from giving evidence to an inquiry into alleged war crimes by the SAS.</p>
