          <p>The UK government is underwriting a £1.5 billion loan to Jaguar Land Rover to support the company and its supply chain following a prolonged production shutdown caused by a cyber-attack. The manufacturer, which employs around 30,000 people directly, has not built any cars this month, putting its suppliers at risk of financial collapse. This financial support, provided through the Export Development Guarantee, aims to protect thousands of jobs in the West Midlands and Merseyside while JLR works to recover from the hack and resume operations. The move marks a significant government intervention in response to a corporate cybersecurity incident.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>The biznaga, a species of barrel cactus, is facing extinction in Mexico due to its use in a traditional candied sweet called acitrón, a key ingredient in dishes like chiles en nogada. Despite being illegal since the early 2000s, acitrón is still widely sold in markets due to high cultural demand. Biologists explain that the cactus grows extremely slowly, making it impossible to farm commercially and leading to its overexploitation in the wild. Some chefs are now promoting sustainable alternatives, such as candied squash, to preserve the endangered plant while honoring culinary traditions.</p>

          <p>In response to soaring housing costs, a growing number of Americans are teaming up with friends or relatives to buy homes, a practice known as co-buying. With home prices up 56% since 2020, pooling financial resources allows buyers to enter a market that is otherwise unaffordable, particularly for single individuals. This trend is more common among younger generations, who face a significant disadvantage compared to couples with dual incomes. While co-buying offers a path to homeownership and companionship, experts advise creating a formal legal agreement to navigate potential future complications like one party wanting to sell.</p>

          <h2>Switzerland Holds Second National Vote on Introduction of Electronic ID Cards</h2>
          <div class="timestamp">2025-09-28 03:58:47 EDT</div>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Swiss citizens are voting in a second national referendum on whether to introduce an optional electronic identity system. A similar proposal was rejected in 2021 due to concerns over data privacy and the involvement of private companies. The revised plan ensures the system will be managed entirely by the state, with personal data stored on users' smartphones rather than in a central database. Supporters argue the e-ID will streamline bureaucratic processes online, while opponents remain wary of potential privacy infringements. Recent polls suggest that voters, now more familiar with digital credentials after the pandemic, may be ready to approve the measure.</p>

          <h2>Ryder Cup's 'Envelope Rule' May Be Used After Viktor Hovland's Injury</h2>

          <p>A neck injury to European player Viktor Hovland could bring the rarely used "envelope rule" into play on the final day of the Ryder Cup. Before the Sunday singles matches, each team captain secretly selects one player's name to place in a sealed envelope. If a player from the opposing team has to withdraw due to injury or illness, the player named in the envelope also sits out, and the match is declared a half-point tie for each side. This rule ensures that an injury does not unfairly penalize one team by forcing a healthy player to sit out without a match.</p>

          <p>Citizens of Zurich, Switzerland, are voting in a referendum on a proposal to severely restrict the use of leaf blowers and vacuums to curb noise and air pollution. If passed, the measure would completely ban gas-powered models within the city. Electric devices would only be permitted for three months of the year, from October to December, with special exceptions requiring permission. Supporters of the initiative argue that the machines are loud, spread fine dust, and harm microorganisms, recommending rakes as an alternative. Opponents contend that the ban represents an unnecessary and anti-social prohibition.</p>

          <p>The UK Labour Party has committed to starting construction on three new towns in England before the next general election as part of its plan to build 1.5 million new homes by 2029. A taskforce has identified Tempsford in Bedfordshire, Leeds South Bank, and Crews Hill in north London as the most promising initial sites from a list of twelve. Housing Secretary Steve Reed stated the initiative will take lessons from the post-war housing boom, using development corporations with special planning powers to accelerate building. The plan aims to address the national housing crisis and stimulate economic growth, with a goal of making at least 40% of the new homes affordable.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>The Trump administration's proposal to significantly increase H-1B visa fees could inadvertently bolster the Middle East's ambition to become a global technology hub. Gulf nations, particularly the UAE and Saudi Arabia, are actively courting top AI and tech talent with competitive compensation packages, tax incentives, and long-term "golden visas." As the U.S. potentially makes it more difficult for companies to hire foreign experts, these countries are positioning themselves as attractive alternatives with business-friendly environments. This policy shift could intensify the global competition for skilled professionals and reshape international tech landscapes. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>Despite having one of the tallest teams in the Premier League and hiring a new set-piece specialist, Newcastle United has struggled to convert dead-ball situations into goals this season. The team has scored only once from a corner or free-kick, a stark contrast to their upcoming opponent, Arsenal, who have scored half their league goals from set-pieces. Manager Eddie Howe has acknowledged that "something is not quite clicking" and has taken responsibility for improving performance in this area. The article explores the team's strategic shifts, including an increased use of long throws, as they work to leverage their physical advantages.</p>

          <p>As the regular season concludes, the Los Angeles Dodgers are finalizing their roster for the upcoming wild-card series, with several key decisions hinging on player health and strategic matchups. Infielder Max Muncy and catcher Will Smith are still recovering from injuries, leaving their availability for Tuesday's opener uncertain. The team must also determine its pitching rotation and balance its bullpen, which currently has an abundance of left-handed relievers. Manager Dave Roberts indicated that players are competing for the final spots, with veterans like Kiké Hernández making a strong late-season case for inclusion on the postseason roster.</p>
