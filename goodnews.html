          <p>The Bank of Russia has lowered its key interest rate to 20%, marking the first cut since September 2022, signaling that inflation pressures are beginning to subside. This decision comes after seasonally-adjusted inflation in April fell to 6.2%, a significant decrease from the first quarter's average of 8.2%. While domestic demand still exceeds supply capabilities, the central bank believes the Russian economy is gradually returning to a balanced growth path. The central bank plans to maintain a tight monetary policy for an extended period to achieve its 4% inflation target, especially as the invasion of Ukraine has put immense strain on prices. </p>

          <p>The U.K.'s Financial Conduct Authority (FCA) has proposed reversing its 2019 ban on offering crypto exchange-traded notes (ETNs) to retail investors, aiming to align with the U.S. and other financial hubs. Crypto ETNs are debt instruments linked to cryptocurrencies, allowing investors to gain exposure to digital tokens through regulated exchanges. The FCA's proposal intends to support U.K. growth and competitiveness, while restrictions on crypto derivatives will remain in place. This move has been praised by crypto firms as a significant advancement for the industry in the U.K., and the FCA is separately working on implementing a regulatory regime for crypto by 2026. </p>

          <p>The Belmont Stakes is set to host a rematch in New York on Saturday of the top three finishing horses from the Kentucky Derby to close out horse racing's Triple Crown for 2025. Journalism, who won the Preakness two weeks after coming in second at the Derby, was picked as the morning-line favorite for the Belmont with 8-5 odds. Sovereignty's connections chose to skip the Preakness in Baltimore to prepare for the Belmont, meaning no horse would win the Triple Crown this year. This will be the 157th running of the Belmont Stakes. </p>
