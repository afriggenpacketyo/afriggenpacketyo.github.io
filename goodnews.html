          <p>Insiders have reported that the apparent romance between actors Pamela Anderson and Liam Neeson is genuine, pushing back against allegations that it was a publicity stunt for their new film, "The Naked Gun." Reports from outlets like TMZ had suggested the relationship was fabricated by their PR teams to generate interest in the movie. However, sources close to the pair insist their connection is real and that neither actor would participate in a staged relationship for publicity. Throughout the film's press tour, the co-stars displayed notable affection, sparking widespread media attention and speculation.</p>

          <h2>Review: 'The Toxic Avenger' Remake Offers Well-Crafted Homage to Troma's Cult Classic</h2>
          <div class="timestamp">2025-08-30 12:34:36 EDT</div>
        </div>
        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>The new remake of "The Toxic Avenger," directed by Macon Blair and starring Peter Dinklage, is a well-made and diverting tribute to the 1984 Troma cult film. The article notes a disconnect, as the original's charm was its low-budget, offensive style, whereas this version is competently produced with appealing stars like Kevin Bacon and Elijah Wood. The story centers on a janitor who, after being exposed to toxic waste, becomes a mutant hero fighting a villainous pharmaceutical CEO. While filled with gore and goofy humor, the film's polished nature makes it more of a mainstream-friendly schlock homage than a true Troma-style creation.</p>

Winger Francesca McGhie scored two tries, bringing her tournament total to five, while Rhona Lloyd also added a double. Despite a resilient effort from Fiji, which scored three tries of its own, a stunning individual score from Emma Orr helped seal the crucial victory for the Scots. The team will now face Canada in a decisive Pool B match to determine their final group standing.</p>

          <p>The baseball bat used by 12-year-old Marco Rocco in a controversial home run celebration has been sold for almost $10,000 at auction. Rocco was initially suspended from a tournament for his celebratory bat flip, a decision that was later overturned by a judge following legal action from his father. The incident gained national attention and support from major league players. All proceeds from the auction, which was handled by Goldin Auctions, will be donated back to the Haddonfield Little League program.</p>

          <p>Cellist Yo-Yo Ma and Afropop singer Angélique Kidjo performed "Sarabande Africaine" at the Hollywood Bowl, a concert exploring the African origins of Baroque musical forms. The performance highlighted how the rhythmic patterns of the sarabande dance were carried by enslaved Africans to Spain before being adapted by composers like Bach and Handel. The show featured a blend of classical pieces, traditional African music, and reinterpretations of works by Philip Glass and Ravel. The collaboration showcased Kidjo's transformative musical style alongside Ma's ability to integrate his cello into diverse soundscapes, creating a unique and moving experience.</p>

          <p>Declining water levels in Iraq's largest reservoir, the Mosul Dam, have revealed approximately 40 ancient tombs believed to be over 2,300 years old. The discovery was made by archaeologists in the Khanke region of Duhok province after a severe drought, one of the worst since 1933, exposed the site. The tombs are thought to date back to the Hellenistic or Hellenistic-Seleucid period. While the drought has had devastating effects on agriculture and electricity, it has provided a rare opportunity for excavation, and researchers are now working to transfer the artifacts to a museum before the area is submerged again.</p>
