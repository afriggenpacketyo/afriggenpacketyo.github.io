          <h2>Champions League's New Format Praised After PSG's Victory</h2>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Former Manchester City defender Nedum Onuoha and journalist Nicky Bandini have lauded the new Champions League format after PSG's victory over Inter Milan. Onuoha highlighted that teams playing each other only once in the league stage reduced pressure and allowed for unexpected results, like Aston Villa's win against Bayern Munich. Bandini noted that the format benefited PSG, enabling their development throughout the season and providing a more entertaining journey for viewers. The new format emphasizes finding form at the right time rather than early tournament performance.</p>

          <p>A new documentary, ‚ÄúToxic Nation: From Fluoride to Seed Oils ‚Äî How We Got Here, Who Profits, and What You Can Do,‚Äù examines the potential health risks associated with ultraprocessed foods, seed oils, herbicides, pesticides, and fluoride. The film is part of the ‚ÄúMake America Healthy Again‚Äù movement, led by US Health and Human Services Secretary Robert F. Kennedy Jr., aiming to overhaul federal policy to reduce chronic disease. While some experts agree on the effects of certain consumables on disease risk, controversy surrounds the potential dangers, benefits, or neutrality of these factors. The documentary follows the release of the first MAHA Commission report, which advocates for significant changes to food systems, pharmaceuticals, and environmental toxins.</p>

          <p>While Coca-Cola is outperforming PepsiCo in organic revenue growth, PepsiCo's stock valuation makes it a potentially attractive investment. Coca-Cola's stock has experienced gains, pushing its price-to-sales and price-to-earnings ratios above their five-year averages, while PepsiCo's ratios are below their averages. PepsiCo's dividend yield is also near historical highs, making it appealing to dividend investors. Despite recent business growth challenges, PepsiCo's valuation suggests it could be a better choice for investors focused on dividends and value. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>The UK government plans to invest ¬£1.5 billion in at least six new munitions and explosives factories to enhance its weapons production capabilities. This initiative aims to support the creation of up to 7,000 UK-built long-range weapons and generate approximately 1,800 new jobs. The move is part of the government's Strategic Defence Review, which seeks to establish an "always on" munitions production capacity that can be rapidly scaled up. Ministers emphasize that this investment will strengthen the armed forces and boost British jobs, increasing the UK's defense spending to 3% of GDP by 2034.</p>
