          <p>In Bristol, street sex workers are collaborating with the police and a charity initiative called Night Light to protect vulnerable children. These women, often present during the night, provide crucial information about child exploitation, aiding in the apprehension of child sexual abusers and identifying children at risk. They offer insights into the dangers underage girls face on the streets and report concerning behavior, such as men showing child abuse photos. This collaboration has proven vital, leading to arrests and safeguarding at-risk youth, fostering trust between sex workers and authorities, and empowering the women to prevent similar experiences for young people. The sex workers involved emphasize they are not bad people, but are helping to safeguard other girls. Optimism score: 60</p>

The mausoleum of Chiang's son, Chiang Ching-kuo, has also been reclassified. The sites will no longer be referred to as "mausoleums" or "spirit-worship facilities."

          <h2>Economist Argues Trump's Plan to Weaken the Dollar Is Based on Flawed Assumptions</h2>

        </div>
        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Kenneth Rogoff, a Harvard economics professor, argues that President Trump's plan to weaken the dollar, as proposed by Stephen Miran, is based on a flawed diagnosis of the American economy. While the dollar's reserve-currency status plays a role in trade deficits, it is only one of many factors. Rogoff suggests that reducing the fiscal deficit would be a more straightforward fix than launching a trade war. He also points to the strength of the American economy as a key factor, making US businesses attractive to investors, and notes that even manufacturing has grown as a share of GDP.

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>China's central bank and financial regulators have announced a series of policy measures, including interest rate cuts and a reduction in the reserve requirement ratio, to bolster economic growth amid trade concerns. The measures aim to support financing for key sectors like technology and real estate, as well as promote consumption and elderly care. However, analysts suggest that these measures may have limited impact on boosting domestic credit demand, as borrowing has been somewhat insensitive to interest rates. The government is also preparing additional measures to support small and medium enterprises and the private sector. Optimism score: 60</p>

However, rising tensions between China and the United States have created a difficult balancing act for Morocco, where economic and geopolitical concerns do not always align.

          <p>Five Venezuelan opposition figures, who had been sheltering for over a year at the Argentine diplomatic residence in Caracas, have successfully left the country and are now in the United States. The move comes as Venezuela attempts to appease the Trump administration amid threats to reimpose oil sanctions.
