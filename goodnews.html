          <p>U.S. and Chinese officials will meet in Geneva this week to discuss trade, signaling a potential thaw in the escalating trade war between the global superpowers. Treasury Secretary Scott Bessent and U.S. Trade Representative Jamieson Greer will meet Beijing's lead economic representative, He Lifeng, potentially paving the way for broader trade talks. With both sides feeling the effects of the trade war, experts predict a trade deal will be struck quickly, with the U.S. removing the steep reciprocal tariffs but keeping 20% duties on Chinese goods. The article suggests that both parties are keen to negotiate to avoid a global recession, but must also convince their constituencies that the other side is not evil.</p>
