        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Experts suggest that President Trump's new travel ban, impacting 12 countries, appears designed to avoid legal pitfalls encountered by his previous attempts. The ban targets countries mainly in the Middle East, Africa, and the Caribbean, with restrictions graded against perceived threats, including terrorism. Legal experts note that the new ban is more legally robust and wider in scope compared to the original, which faced challenges for allegedly discriminating against travelers based on religion. The new ban has a more comprehensive approach that seems likely to be upheld by the Supreme Court if challenged.</p>
