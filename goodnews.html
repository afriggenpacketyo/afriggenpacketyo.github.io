          <p>General Motors CFO Paul Jacobson announced the company anticipates its 2026 earnings will exceed its 2025 results, which have already surpassed Wall Street expectations. This positive outlook is attributed to several factors, including reduced electric vehicle losses, lower warranty costs, and improved fixed-cost management. Following the announcement and an upgraded 2025 guidance, GM's shares rose over 10%. The company also affirmed its commitment to continue its aggressive share repurchase program, signaling confidence in its long-term financial strategy and operational efficiency.

          <p>Cas Holman, a designer and author who has worked with executives from Google and Nike, argues that play is the most overlooked skill for effective leadership, especially during uncertain times. She posits that engaging in playful activities shifts focus from outcomes to curiosity, reframing failure as a part of exploration and fostering creativity and resilience. The article suggests that play unlocks stronger team collaboration and connection by lowering the stakes and encouraging experimentation. Holman provides five practical steps for leaders to reintroduce play into their professional lives, such as revisiting childhood activities and incorporating lighthearted icebreakers in meetings.</p>

          <p>Sanae Takaichi, a conservative politician and admirer of Margaret Thatcher, has been elected as Japan's first female prime minister by the ruling Liberal Democratic Party. The 64-year-old is known for her hard-line conservative views, including strengthening Japan's defense, a hawkish stance on China, and support for revising the constitution. Her election is seen by analysts as a move by the LDP to solidify its conservative base after recent political turbulence. While her rise is a milestone for female representation in Japan, Takaichi holds conservative social positions, opposing same-sex marriage and supporting the male-only imperial succession.</p>

          <p>Leading defense and aerospace companies, including GE Aerospace, Northrop Grumman, RTX, and Lockheed Martin, have raised their financial forecasts for 2025. This optimism is driven by heightened global demand for their products, which has allowed them to overcome economic uncertainties and tariff impacts. Each of the firms reported third-quarter profits that exceeded Wall Street's expectations, citing strong performance in both defense and commercial aerospace sectors. The companies pointed to their substantial backlogs and increased production capacity as key factors supporting their positive outlooks for the remainder of the year. (not investment advice)</p>

For the best viewing, experts recommend finding a dark location away from city lights after midnight and looking toward the constellation of Orion. Weather forecasts for the UK suggest clear skies for the peak, and the lack of moonlight due to a new moon will further enhance visibility, with up to 15 meteors per hour expected.</p>
