          <p>Sen. Thom Tillis, a Republican from North Carolina, has announced his opposition to President Trump's nomination of Ed Martin for U.S. Attorney for the District of Columbia, potentially jeopardizing Martin's confirmation. Tillis cited Martin's support for criminal defendants in the January 6th Capitol riot cases, which were prosecuted by the D.C. Attorney's Office before Trump's blanket pardons. With Tillis's opposition, Martin's nomination faces an uphill battle in the Senate Judiciary Committee, where a tie vote would prevent it from moving forward. Martin is currently serving as interim U.S. Attorney for D.C., but his term is set to expire on May 20.</p>

          <p>Newark Mayor Ras Baraka staged a predawn demonstration outside an immigrant detention facility slated to become a key part of the Trump administration's deportation efforts. Baraka argues that the facility's owner, GEO Group, lacks the necessary permits to operate, leading to a tense standoff. Fire officials issued three citations for code violations after city officials were barred from inspecting the property. The facility, near Newark Liberty International Airport, has a $1 billion contract with ICE to hold up to 1,000 migrants daily, despite lacking a valid certificate of occupancy. This action highlights the ongoing conflict between local authorities and the federal government over immigration enforcement.</p>

          <p>A late payment can significantly damage your credit score, affecting loan rates and even job prospects. The article outlines several strategies to mitigate the impact, including requesting a goodwill adjustment from the creditor, disputing inaccuracies with credit bureaus, and negotiating a "pay for delete" agreement. If these methods fail, the late payment will remain on your credit report for up to seven years, but its impact diminishes over time. Maintaining consistent on-time payments after a late mark is crucial for rebuilding credit and financial stability.</p>

          <p>Britain and India have reached a trade agreement designed to boost economic cooperation amidst global trade uncertainties.

Britain, in turn, will reduce tariffs on clothes, footwear, and food products from India.

          <p>Proposed budget cuts to NASA by the Trump administration are causing concern at the European Space Agency (ESA), potentially affecting international collaborations, including the Artemis moon program. The cuts may shift NASA's priorities towards Mars-focused programs, potentially benefiting SpaceX. The ESA is assessing the full repercussions of the changes, emphasizing the importance of cooperation in space activities. The proposed budget would cut NASA's current budget by 24%, threatening major science projects and the work of thousands of researchers.</p>

          <p>The Taiwanese dollar experienced a pullback after a historic surge that saw it reach multi-decade gains, fueled by speculation of pressure from Washington to strengthen the currency. Despite the pullback, the Taiwanese dollar remains significantly up against the U.S. dollar this year. Experts suggest that exporters' rush to convert U.S. dollar reserves and life insurers' hedging activities contributed to the currency's dramatic swings. The Taiwanese central bank has denied that exchange rates were part of U.S. trade negotiations.</p>
