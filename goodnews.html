          <p>Representative Jasmine Crockett, a Democrat from Texas, responded to President Trump's criticism of her intelligence by asserting that he is "terrified" of "smart, bold Black women" who hold him accountable. This exchange followed an interview where Trump voiced concerns about the Democratic Party's future, labeling Crockett as a "low IQ person." Crockett, known for her active social media presence and controversial statements, has faced criticism for remarks such as calling Texas Governor Greg Abbott "Governor Hot Wheels." Her response underscores the ongoing political tensions and the intersection of race and gender in political discourse.</p>

          <p>This article analyzes how President Trump's policies and persona are influencing elections worldwide. In Canada and Australia, center-left parties gained ground by campaigning against Trump-like conservative leaders. However, in other countries like Germany, the impact is more complex, with leaders leveraging Trump's policies to justify domestic actions. The article suggests that while there's no widespread anti-Trump wave, voters are considering Trump's influence when making decisions, and leaders are adapting their strategies accordingly. The article also discusses the exception of Britain, where the anti-immigration party is doing well.</p>

          <h2>Experts Caution Women on Over-Reliance on Egg Freezing</h2>
          <div class="timestamp">2025-05-04 19:05:00 EDT</div>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>As egg freezing becomes increasingly popular, some experts caution against viewing it as a guaranteed solution for delaying motherhood. The process is expensive, costing upwards of $12,000 per cycle, and doesn't ensure a successful pregnancy. Critics argue that companies offering egg freezing as a benefit may be prioritizing employee retention over women's reproductive autonomy. A better solution, they say, involves societal and corporate support for women to have children at younger ages. One woman's story is shared, which details a lack of success even after freezing 30 eggs.</p>

          <p>Egg freezing is gaining popularity as a means for women to preserve their fertility, but experts warn against viewing it as a guaranteed solution. The process involves hormone injections, egg retrieval, and freezing, with costs ranging from $12,000 to $15,000 per cycle, plus storage fees. The procedure provides options for women who want to delay motherhood due to career or personal reasons. Experts say more education about egg freezing and fertility is needed, and gynecologists should have these conversations with women when they're younger.</p>

          <p>Estate agency Savills estimates that over half of first-time homebuyers received financial assistance from family members in the past year, with the average contribution being ¬£55,572.

While the proportion is slightly lower than the previous year, it remains higher than most years since 2013.

          <p>Egg freezing is a medical procedure in which a woman's eggs are harvested, frozen and stored until she is ready to have children. A single cycle, including medication, costs an average of $12,000 to $15,000, plus another $500 to $1,000 each year for storage. To thaw and fertilize the eggs later on costs an additional $10,000. Doctors sometimes recommend that a woman undergo multiple cycles of egg freezing to increase the number of eggs available for fertilization and implantation later on to up her chances of success, raising the cost even further.</p>
