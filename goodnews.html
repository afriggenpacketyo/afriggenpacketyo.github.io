          <p>British authorities have successfully intercepted a massive drug shipment, seizing 2.4 metric tons of cocaine valued at over $130 million from a vessel arriving from Panama. The discovery at the London Gateway port was the result of an intelligence-led operation and ranks as one of the UK's largest cocaine seizures on record. Officials highlighted the operation as a significant blow to criminal gangs, emphasizing their commitment to using intelligence and international cooperation to disrupt drug trafficking networks. The seizure comes as cocaine-related deaths in the UK have been rising.</p>

          <p>A massive crowd, estimated by organizers at up to 200,000 people, participated in the Budapest Pride march, defying a government ban and the threat of legal repercussions. The event proceeded despite a new "child protection" law used to restrict gatherings deemed to promote homosexuality. The march drew significant international support, with numerous EU officials and MEPs in attendance to show solidarity with Hungary's LGBTQ+ community and civil society. Participants and supporters framed the event as a crucial stand for fundamental human rights against an increasingly repressive government.</p>

          <p>At a party congress in Berlin, Germany's Social Democratic Party (SPD) formally bid farewell to former Chancellor Olaf Scholz and began to chart its course in opposition. In his speech, Scholz defended his government's record and warned against underestimating Vladimir Putin's ambitions in Ukraine. The congress also saw the election of new party leadership, with B√§rbel Bas elected as co-chair, as the party seeks to rebuild after a poor showing in the recent parliamentary elections relegated them to third place.</p>

          <p>Chrysler is recalling more than 250,000 of its 2022-2025 Pacifica and Voyager vehicles due to a potential defect in the side curtain airbags.

Coach Andy Farrell praised the team's ambition but noted a high penalty count in the first half that needs to be addressed. The performance of lock Joe McCarthy was a standout positive.</p>
