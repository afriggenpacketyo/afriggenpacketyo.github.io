          <p>A 4-year-old girl from Mexico, identified as Sofia, who is receiving "lifesaving medical treatment" in the United States, has been granted humanitarian parole for one year, allowing her and her mother to remain in the country. Sofia suffers from "short bowel syndrome," which prevents her from properly absorbing nutrients and fluid from food on her own, requiring specialized IV treatments administered up to 14 hours a day. Her lawyers emphasized that this treatment is only available in the United States. The decision came after the Department of Homeland Security initially sent letters terminating their humanitarian parole, raising concerns about the systemic challenges faced by immigrants seeking critical medical care. The situation garnered international attention and pressure from elected officials, highlighting the need for immigration system reforms to protect those facing life-threatening harm.</p>

He also addressed North Korea, stating his commitment to maintaining open communication channels while remaining prepared against nuclear threats. Lee's term began immediately after his election victory, following Yoon's removal due to a Constitutional Court ruling upholding his impeachment.</p>

          <p>China has been investing heavily in the sciences, and recent US policies have inadvertently helped their efforts to attract talented scientists. Even before the U.S. threatened to bar international students and besieged universities, China‚Äôs huge spending campaign on the sciences was bearing fruit. The current environment has created new opportunities for China to recruit international researchers. The shift in the global landscape could have long-term implications for scientific advancement and technological competition.</p>

          <p>China's Tiandu-1 satellite has successfully entered a fuel-efficient 3:1 resonant orbit, synchronizing with the Earth and moon's movements. This achievement is considered a breakthrough for lunar infrastructure, but claims of being the first spacecraft to do so have been challenged. Experts point to NASA's Interstellar Boundary Explorer (IBEX) probe, which entered a similar orbit in 2011, as a precedent. The 3:1 resonant orbit is expected to support future interplanetary exploration and navigation systems.</p>

To minimize emotional attachment, staff members avoid naming or having direct contact with the seals. Despite these efforts, staff often develop affectionate bonds with the animals. The center has successfully rescued and released over 200 seals since its establishment in the 1980s, contributing to conservation efforts and raising awareness about seal protection and environmental issues.</p>
