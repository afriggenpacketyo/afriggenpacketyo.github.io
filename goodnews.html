          <p>The initial public offering (IPO) market shows signs of recovery, potentially benefiting Goldman Sachs' investment banking segment. Recent IPO filings and successful debuts have renewed optimism after a rocky period marked by trade tensions and economic uncertainty. Goldman Sachs served as a lead underwriter for recent high-profile financial technology deals. Analysts suggest that easing trade tensions and a more stable stock market are emboldening companies to pursue IPOs. However, some experts caution that fewer companies are choosing to go public compared to previous decades, as private markets offer easier access to capital. (not investment advice)</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Experts suggest appealing property taxes to potentially secure years of savings by addressing over-assessments, which are common due to inaccuracies in property details. The process involves verifying assessment accuracy, comparing property values with neighbors, and checking eligibility for tax exemptions. Appealing involves demonstrating how the assessor incorrectly applied the assessment formula to your house, and changes typically take effect for the current tax year. Key steps include gathering paperwork, knowing appeal deadlines, and seeking expert guidance to challenge assessment numbers. (not investment advice)</p>
