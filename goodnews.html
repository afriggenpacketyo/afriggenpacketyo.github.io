          <p>A federal judge has blocked the Trump administration's attempts to drastically cut research funding to the National Science Foundation (NSF), a move that universities argued threatened critical work in fields like artificial intelligence and cybersecurity. Judge Indira Talwani ruled the policy change, which capped indirect costs for universities at 15%, was arbitrary, capricious, and contrary to law. The University of California estimated the change would have cost them nearly $100 million annually. This decision follows similar rulings against the administration's caps on grants from the Energy Department and the National Institutes of Health. The article highlights the importance of research funding for maintaining advancements in various technological fields, emphasizing the potential negative impacts of such cuts.</p>
