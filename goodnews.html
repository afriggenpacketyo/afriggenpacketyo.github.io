          <p>President Trump's initiative to construct a new ballroom at the White House is being funded by private donors, who may receive permanent recognition for their contributions. Companies such as Google, Lockheed Martin, and Palantir have reportedly pledged millions, with discussions underway about etching donor names into the structure or listing them online. The fundraising effort, led by a top Trump fundraiser and the Trust for the National Mall, offers tax benefits for these donations. While the White House confirms nearly $200 million has been pledged for the project, the exact amount of the president's personal contribution remains undisclosed.</p>

          <p>A federal judge in Florida has dismissed President Trump's $15 billion defamation lawsuit against The New York Times, calling the 85-page filing "decidedly improper and impermissible." The judge criticized the complaint for containing excessive political rhetoric and self-praise rather than focusing on legal claims. However, the dismissal is without prejudice, granting Trump's legal team 28 days to refile a more concise and professional complaint, capped at 40 pages. A spokesperson for The Times welcomed the ruling, stating the original lawsuit was more of a political document than a serious legal filing.</p>

          <p>Pattern Group, a major third-party seller on Amazon's marketplace, saw its stock rise slightly in its public debut on the Nasdaq. The company, which helps brands like Nestle and Panasonic optimize online sales, raised $300 million in its IPO, valuing the e-commerce accelerator at approximately $2.5 billion. The successful offering comes amid a resurgent tech IPO market, but also at a time of global trade uncertainty due to President Trump's tariff policies. In its prospectus, Pattern acknowledged its heavy reliance on Amazon as a primary risk, as any changes to the e-commerce giant's platform could significantly impact its business.

          <p>Elon Musk's artificial intelligence startup, xAI, is reportedly in the process of raising $10 billion in a new funding round that values the company at $200 billion. This valuation marks a significant increase from previous rounds and reflects the soaring investor appetite for foundational AI model developers, similar to competitors like Anthropic and OpenAI. Much of the new capital is expected to fund the construction of massive data centers equipped with advanced GPUs needed for next-generation AI development. The fundraising continues despite controversies surrounding its Grok chatbot and its perceived performance gap compared to rivals. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>After months of delays, the Senate has confirmed Mike Waltz, President Trump's former national security adviser, as the new U.S. ambassador to the United Nations in a 47-to-43 vote. The confirmation fills an eight-month vacancy just before the U.N. General Assembly's high-level meetings. Waltz's confirmation proceeded despite earlier controversy over his involvement in a security leak regarding a military strike. During his hearing, Waltz emphasized the need for major reforms at the U.N. while stressing the importance of U.S. participation to counter China's influence and address global conflicts.</p>

          <p>Grammy-winning percussionist Evelyn Glennie and acclaimed poet Raymond Antrobus, two of today's most prominent Deaf artists, have released a new collaborative album titled "Aloud." The project was created with no prior rehearsal, with the artists improvising in single takes while responding to each other's performance in real time. In an interview, they discussed how their shared experience of deafness fosters a unique musical and linguistic understanding rooted in vibration, body language, and physical presence rather than purely auditory cues. The album explores themes of identity, communication, and the multifaceted relationship Deaf people have with sound and music.</p>

          <p>Following the Federal Reserve's recent quarter-point interest rate cut, the average 30-year fixed mortgage rate has dropped to approximately 6.13%, offering significant savings for homebuyers and refinancers. For a $750,000 mortgage, this new rate results in a monthly principal and interest payment of about $4,560, which is over $450 less per month compared to the 7.04% rates seen at the start of the year. This reduction in borrowing costs enhances affordability and provides substantial long-term savings, amounting to over $160,000 in interest over the life of the loan. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>Minneapolis Federal Reserve President Neel Kashkari has stated his support for two additional interest rate cuts this year, citing a weakening labor market and his belief that President Trump's tariffs will have only a minimal long-term impact on inflation. This more dovish stance would bring the total number of cuts in 2025 to three, one more than he previously advocated. Kashkari explained that he is increasingly confident that the inflationary effects of tariffs are a temporary, one-time event. His view provides insight into the diversity of opinions within the FOMC as it navigates economic policy. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>The governments of the United Kingdom and Ireland have unveiled a new joint deal aimed at addressing the legacy of the Northern Ireland Troubles. The framework is intended to replace the UK's controversial Legacy Act, which was widely opposed by victims' groups and political parties for including a conditional amnesty. The new plan will reform the legacy commission, restore certain inquests, and establish a cross-border body for information retrieval. Irish Deputy PM Simon Harris described the deal as a "big step forward" and an "honest attempt" to provide reconciliation and justice for victims and their families.</p>

          <p>In his first public comments since joining the Federal Reserve Board of Governors, Stephen Miran stated that he does not believe President Trump's tariffs will have a macroeconomically significant inflationary effect. This view places him in the minority on the Federal Open Market Committee, where he was the lone dissenter in the recent decision, advocating for a larger half-point rate cut instead of the quarter-point reduction that passed. Miran argued there is no clear evidence that tariffs have driven up core inflation, pointing to a lack of divergence between import-heavy goods and overall inflation rates.

          <p>Bridget Phillipson, the UK's education secretary and a candidate for Labour's deputy leadership, has indicated that the government is considering scrapping the two-child benefit cap. In her strongest comments on the issue to date, she called the policy "spiteful" and stated that its removal is "on the table" as part of a forthcoming child poverty strategy. The cap, introduced in 2017, prevents families from claiming universal credit or child tax credit for a third or subsequent child. The issue has become a key topic in the deputy leadership race, with rival Lucy Powell also advocating for its removal.</p>

          <p>The artificial intelligence boom, driven by companies like Nvidia, has intensified investor interest in the semiconductor industry, leading to more concentrated exchange-traded funds (ETFs). While traditional funds remain popular, newer options provide different strategies, such as equal-weighting or focusing on "fabless" chip designers that outsource manufacturing. This trend allows investors to make more targeted bets on the chip sector's growth, though it also comes with varying levels of single-stock concentration risk. Experts suggest the industry is still in the early stages of a "super cycle," signaling continued investor focus. (not investment advice)</p>
