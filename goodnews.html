MSRA, Microsoft's largest research facility outside the U.S., has been a pivotal center for advancements in voice and image recognition and other AI projects. The move comes amid a broader context of talent shifting between U.S. tech firms and Chinese academic institutions, reflecting the competitive and complex landscape of global AI research.

          <p>Cleveland Browns rookie quarterback Shedeur Sanders addressed recent comments from teammate Dillon Gabriel, who distinguished between "entertainers" and "competitors." Gabriel later clarified his remarks were aimed at the media, not Sanders, a sentiment Sanders acknowledged without fully confirming his belief. Sanders stated that others' words do not affect him and that his focus remains on his performance, regardless of external narratives or potential controversy within the team's crowded quarterback room. The interaction highlights the media scrutiny surrounding the two rookie players as they compete for a spot.</p>

This deal represents a significant win for Google Cloud as it competes with market leaders Amazon Web Services and Microsoft Azure. The partnership underscores Meta's massive investment in AI, including its Llama models, and its need for extensive cloud infrastructure beyond its own data centers. Despite being rivals in the online advertising space, the deal highlights the complex co-dependencies within the tech industry.</p>

          <p>Japan's core inflation rate, which excludes fresh food prices, slowed to 3.1% in July, down from 3.3% in the previous month but still exceeding economists' forecasts of 3%. The moderation was partly attributed to an easing in rice price inflation, which had previously surged. The "core-core" inflation metric, closely watched by the Bank of Japan as it strips out both food and energy costs, remained steady at 3.4%. These figures arrive as the central bank continues to monitor price trends while navigating sluggish trade numbers and modest economic growth. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>A fourth-generation Texas cotton farmer, facing mounting debt from years of poor harvests, has successfully pivoted his family's business by trading crops for sheep. He now practices solar grazing, renting out his flock of 6,000 sheep to act as natural lawn mowers for large-scale solar farms, which keeps vegetation from obstructing the panels. This innovative approach turned a potential $200,000 loss from cotton farming into a nearly $300,000 profit in one year. The venture highlights a growing trend for farmers seeking stable income amid the economic challenges facing small and mid-sized agricultural operations.</p>

          <p>Markets across the Asia-Pacific region traded mixed as investors anticipated Federal Reserve Chair Jerome Powell's upcoming speech, hoping for clues about the future direction of U.S. interest rates. South Korea's Kospi saw gains, while Japan's Nikkei 225 experienced a slight dip at the open. The session was influenced by Japan's latest inflation data, which showed a slight cooling but remained above expectations. This market caution follows a five-day losing streak for the S&P 500 in the U.S., with futures markets currently pricing in a high probability of a rate cut in September. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>The UK government has issued new guidance for baby food manufacturers, instructing them to reduce sugar and salt levels and to cease promoting snack products for infants under one year old. The guidelines also aim to restrict marketing claims that imply health benefits without sufficient scientific evidence. This move follows a BBC investigation that found many popular baby food pouches were high in sugar and lacked key nutrients. Companies have been given 18 months to comply with the voluntary guidelines, after which the government may consider alternative measures if sufficient changes are not made.</p>

Simon suggested investors may have overreacted to a slight earnings miss caused by one-time expenses rather than systemic issues. He believes the company is performing exceptionally well, successfully attracting and retaining shoppers with low prices, making the negative market reaction illogical. (not investment advice)</p>

The new model marks the debut of parent company Stellantis's first hybrid powertrain in North America, a 1.6-liter turbo-four system promising over 500 miles per tank. The vehicle, which was discontinued in 2023, returns longer, wider, and taller with significantly more cargo space and a technology-focused interior. With a starting price of $36,995, Stellantis hopes the revitalized and more efficient Cherokee will reclaim market share in the competitive midsize SUV segment.</p>

          <p>American midfielder Dante Polvara made a significant impact for Aberdeen, coming off the bench to score a crucial goal and lead a comeback in their Europa League play-off match against FCSB.

The fan-favorite player has been used sparingly by the manager this season, but his energetic and effective performance has created a strong case for him to be included in the starting lineup for the second leg of the tie in Bucharest.</p>

          <p>A New York appellate court has thrown out the massive financial penalty, which had grown to over $500 million with interest, imposed on Donald Trump in his civil fraud trial. The judges ruled that while Trump was liable for fraud, the fine was excessive and likely violated constitutional protections against severe punishment. The court upheld the non-monetary penalties, including a three-year ban on Trump serving as a company director in New York. The New York Attorney General's office, which brought the case, plans to appeal the decision on the fine to the state's highest court.</p>
