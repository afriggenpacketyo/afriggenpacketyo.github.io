          <h2>SK Hynix Reports Record Q2 Profit and Revenue, Exceeding Market Estimates</h2>
          <div class="timestamp">2025-07-23 19:42:19 EDT</div>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>South Korean chipmaker SK Hynix announced record-breaking operating profit and revenue for the second quarter, surpassing analyst predictions. This success is largely driven by sustained, high demand for its high bandwidth memory (HBM) technology, which is a critical component in chipsets used for generative artificial intelligence. The company has solidified its position as a global leader in HBM, supplying major clients like Nvidia and outperforming rivals such as Samsung Electronics in the DRAM market. Analysts anticipate SK Hynix will maintain its market dominance in this sector through the remainder of 2025 and into 2026. (not investment advice)</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>South Korea successfully avoided a technical recession as its economy grew by 0.6% in the second quarter, outperforming economists' expectations. This growth marks a positive reversal from the previous quarter's contraction, fueled by a strong 4.2% increase in exports, particularly in semiconductors and chemical products. The data also showed a rise in total consumption, driven by government spending on healthcare and private spending on vehicles and recreation. The nation is currently in critical trade negotiations with the U.S. to avoid potential tariffs that could impact its export-driven economy. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>The Euro 2025 final will feature a highly anticipated rematch between England and Spain, echoing their 2023 World Cup final showdown which Spain won. After Spain secured its place by defeating Germany in extra time, the stage is set for a clash between Europe's top two teams. England, the defending European champions, will seek redemption against a formidable Spanish side aiming for a treble of major trophies. While England has undergone significant squad changes, creating a "new era" team, experts note they will face immense pressure but possess the capability to challenge the world champions.</p>

          <p>Uber is launching a new pilot program in Los Angeles, San Francisco, and Detroit that will allow women passengers to specifically request female drivers. The feature, called "women drivers," will also enable women to opt for shared rides exclusively with other women, addressing a common request for enhanced safety and comfort. While the company notes that wait times may be longer due to a smaller pool of female drivers, customers can pre-book these rides. This initiative expands on similar successful programs Uber has implemented in 40 other countries over the past several years.</p>

          <p>Republican Congressman Mike Lawler has announced he will not run for governor of New York in 2026, opting instead to seek reelection for his Hudson Valley House seat. Lawler stated his decision was based on the importance of his district in maintaining the Republican House majority, which he believes is critical for the economy. The announcement clears the field for other potential Republican challengers to Governor Kathy Hochul, with Rep. Elise Stefanik considered a leading contender. Following his announcement, Lawler introduced a bill aimed at probing a proposal by a political rival in New York City.</p>

          <p>The Trump administration has released a comprehensive AI Action Plan designed to accelerate innovation and maintain U.S. leadership in the field, particularly against competitors like China. The plan focuses on expediting the construction of data centers, modernizing the electric grid, and establishing programs to export American AI technology to allies. It also includes measures to update federal procurement rules to ensure government contractors use AI systems free of what the White House terms "ideological bias." This initiative follows an earlier executive order that removed some AI regulations put in place by the previous administration.</p>

          <p>A new analysis of past research suggests that taking 7,000 steps per day is associated with major health benefits, offering a potentially more achievable target than the commonly cited 10,000 steps. Published in The Lancet Public Health, the study found that a 7,000-step daily count was linked to a 47% lower risk of death and significant reductions in the risk of dementia, heart disease, and type 2 diabetes compared to taking only 2,000 steps. The research indicates that even modest increases in daily steps can lead to substantial health improvements, reinforcing the overall value of walking for physical and mental well-being.</p>

          <h2>The Word 'OK' Traces Its Origins to a 19th-Century Joke and a Presidential Campaign</h2>
          <div class="timestamp">2025-07-23 17:27:00 EDT</div>
        </div>
        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>The globally recognized word "OK" has a uniquely American origin, starting as a joke in the 1830s and popularized by a presidential campaign. Scholars trace its first appearance to a Boston newspaper in 1839 as a playful, misspelled abbreviation of "all correct" ("oll korrect"). The term gained widespread use during President Martin Van Buren's 1840 reelection campaign, where his nickname "Old Kinderhook" conveniently aligned with the abbreviation, leading to the formation of "O.K. Clubs." From this political beginning, the simple and versatile word spread worldwide, becoming a universal term for agreement and understanding.</p>
