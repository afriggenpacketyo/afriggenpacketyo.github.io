          <h2>Asian Economies Consider Moving Away From US Dollar</h2>
          <div class="timestamp">2025-05-06 19:00:15 EDT</div>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Asia's largest economies are exploring a new rapid financing mechanism utilizing regional currencies like the Chinese yuan, signaling a potential shift away from the US dollar. This initiative aims to shield East and Southeast Asian nations from financial volatility caused by trade tensions and turbulence in the US Treasuries market. The move could also indicate a longer-term strategy towards a regional monetary system that relies less on the dollar, potentially giving China a more prominent role in the region's financial landscape. The new financing mechanism is part of the Chiang Mai Initiative Multilateralisation (CMIM), a currency swap arrangement among ASEAN countries, China, Japan, and South Korea.</p>

          <p>Nvidia CEO Jensen Huang argues that removing restrictions on the export of powerful AI chips, particularly to countries like China, would benefit the US economy. Huang believes that a free flow of chips would help bring back tax dollars and create jobs in the United States. This stance contrasts with the Trump administration's restrictions on Nvidia's H20 chips to China, which were implemented to protect national security and exert pressure on China amidst trade tensions. Nvidia estimates that these restrictions will result in a significant quarterly charge.</p>
