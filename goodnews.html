          <p>Cleveland Browns rookie quarterback Dillon Gabriel clarified a post-game comment that sparked speculation about his relationship with fellow rookie Shedeur Sanders. After stating, "There's entertainers and there's competitors," Gabriel explained he was referring to the media as the "entertainers," not his teammate. The comment gained traction online amid the ongoing competition between the two quarterbacks, with Gabriel making his preseason debut after Sanders had a strong performance the previous week. Gabriel is currently listed ahead of Sanders on the team's depth chart.</p>

          <p>A new generation of Chinese restaurant chains is expanding internationally, introducing global audiences to authentic, diverse regional cuisines far beyond standard Westernized fare. Using Singapore as a launchpad, brands are showcasing specific culinary traditions from regions like Hunan and Zhejiang, challenging old stereotypes about Chinese food. This culinary expansion is seen by some as a form of soft power or "ping-pong diplomacy," potentially improving China's international image through shared cultural and gastronomic experiences, even as it creates economic competition for local businesses.</p>

          <p>A new box set titled "Sunset Boulevard" documents the final burst of creativity from Elvis Presley, focusing on music he recorded in Los Angeles between 1972 and 1975. The collection includes his last Top 10 hit, "Burning Love," and showcases his evolution as an expressive ballad singer during a period of personal and professional turmoil. The release provides context on a pivotal time, including his disappointment over losing a role in "A Star Is Born," which some, like his friend Jerry Schilling, believe marked a turning point that preceded his death in 1977.</p>

          <p>Samsung is gaining ground on Apple in the U.S. smartphone market, with its market share surging from 23% to 31% in the second quarter, while Apple's declined from 56% to 49%. This shift is partly driven by the growing popularity of Samsung's innovative foldable phones, such as the Z Fold 7, and a wider range of price points compared to the iPhone. While Apple remains the market leader, Samsung's momentum in new form factors is creating renewed competition, with analysts expecting Apple to release its own foldable device by 2026 to stay competitive.

          <p>Cardiologists are encouraging adults over the age of 60 to incorporate more salmon into their diets to support cardiovascular health. Salmon is a high-quality protein rich in omega-3 fatty acids, which can help lower "bad" LDL cholesterol, reduce inflammation, and support healthy blood vessel function. Since heart disease risk increases with age, experts emphasize the importance of dietary choices. They recommend consuming two servings of omega-3-rich fish per week, prepared through healthy methods like baking or grilling rather than frying.</p>

          <p>Fashion brand Topshop is staging a major comeback, confirming plans to reopen standalone stores on the UK High Street and hosting its first catwalk show in seven years. After its parent company collapsed in 2020, the brand was sold to online retailer Asos, but it now aims to recapture its former glory and physical retail presence. Industry experts believe the brand can capitalize on millennial and Gen-Z nostalgia but will face challenges in attracting new, younger shoppers and competing in a market dominated by fast fashion and economic pressures.</p>

He was awarded Britain's highest military honor for his valor during a 1944 mission where, despite sustaining 72 injuries, he successfully piloted his flying boat to sink a German U-boat. After the war, he returned to a career in banking and was remembered by friends as a stoic, private, and humorous individual who rarely spoke of his wartime heroism, viewing his actions simply as his duty.</p>

          <p>For investors holding significant cash reserves while waiting for a market downturn, financial experts advise creating a clear deployment strategy to avoid fear-driven paralysis when stocks fall. Rather than investing a lump sum at once, a dollar-cost averaging approach, where smaller amounts are invested at set intervals, is recommended to mitigate the risks of timing the market's bottom. During such a bear market, analysts suggest focusing on quality dividend-paying stocks and large-cap technology companies that may be purchased at more attractive valuations.

          <p>The S&P 500 and Nasdaq both reached several record closes this week as investors reacted to mixed economic data and speculated on the Federal Reserve's next move on interest rates. A cooler-than-expected consumer price index report initially fueled optimism for a rate cut, pushing markets higher. However, a subsequent report showing a rise in wholesale inflation tempered some of that momentum. Despite the mixed signals, market odds for a September rate cut remain high, and several major companies, including Nvidia and Meta, hit all-time stock highs. (not investment advice)</p>
