          <h2>York MP Advocates for Reconsideration of Alcohol Ban at Football Stadiums</h2>
          <div class="timestamp">2025-05-03 06:09:41 EDT</div>
        </div>
        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Luke Charters, the MP for York Outer, is calling for a re-evaluation of the 1985 legislation that prohibits alcohol consumption in view of the pitch at English football matches. Charters argues that the ban creates an inconsistency, as fans of other sports are permitted to drink while watching games. He suggests conducting trials, similar to those in the women's game, to assess the potential impact of lifting the restrictions, particularly in lower leagues, while maintaining family-friendly zones. The Football Supporters Association supports the MP's proposal and welcomes such trials.</p>

          <div class="timestamp">2025-05-03 06:03:00 EDT</div>
        </div>
        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Researchers have found that captive-bred axolotls can successfully survive and thrive in the wild, offering hope for the critically endangered species. A study tracked 18 axolotls released into restored and artificial wetlands in Mexico City, revealing they gained weight, hunted effectively, and avoided predators. This is significant because it indicates that axolotls can adapt to man-made environments, which could help mitigate habitat degradation and climate change impacts. The success of this reintroduction effort is particularly meaningful for Mexicans, as axolotls are an important part of their culture and history.</p>

          <p>A new training program called CHAT aims to reduce "elderspeak," a form of communication with older adults that resembles baby talk. Studies show that elderspeak, which includes inappropriate endearments and simplified language, can lead to resistance to care and other negative behaviors. The CHAT program, which includes videos of interactions between staff and patients, has been shown to reduce elderspeak and resistant behaviors in nursing homes. The program is now being adapted for online use and tested in nursing homes nationwide.</p>
