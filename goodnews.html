          <p>Parts of Germany experienced severe weather over the weekend, including strong thunderstorms, heavy rain, hail, and gusty winds, particularly affecting North Rhine-Westphalia. The storms caused flooding of basements and streets, as well as uprooted trees, leading to hundreds of emergency calls, although no injuries were reported. Several outdoor events, such as an open-air concert in Ulm and the 3RIDES Gran Fondo race in Aachen, were canceled due to the inclement weather. The German Weather Service forecasts warm but occasionally unpleasant conditions for the south, central, and eastern regions of the country. Residents are advised to stay informed and take precautions.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Syrians are increasingly expressing a desire for peace with Israel, marking a notable shift in the country's political landscape, journalist Furat Alali from Damascus told Fox News Digital. This change coincides with direct talks between Syria and Israel, facilitated by the U.S., signaling a departure from decades of hostility. Factors contributing to this shift include a weakened Hezbollah and a focus on Syria's own interests rather than the Palestinian cause. While the talks are in early stages, they reflect a growing sentiment among Syrians to prioritize economic development and stability over regional conflicts, though concerns remain about the new interim leadership.</p>

          <p>China has unveiled a 2030 action plan focused on advancing metrology‚Äîthe science of measurement‚Äîto achieve breakthroughs in chip technology and quantum-scale measurement. The plan, released by the State Administration for Market Regulation, aims to address shortcomings in China's metrological capabilities, particularly in areas critical to chip manufacturing and rare earth magnets. As the US continues to tighten controls on hi-tech chip exports to China, and China leverages its dominance in rare earth metals, the expansion of metrological capabilities is seen as a strategic priority for both countries. The plan aims to comprehensively improve basic metrology capabilities by 2030, with key breakthroughs in more than 50 core technologies.</p>

          <p>The Vancouver Whitecaps have reached the final of the Concacaf Champions Cup, becoming only the third Canadian side ever to qualify, amidst uncertainty about the club's future ownership and potential relocation. Despite these challenges, the team leads Major League Soccer's Western Conference and is on an unbeaten run, led by novice coach Jesper S√∏rensen. The club's CEO, Axel Schuster, is pushing for a new, privately funded downtown venue to entice new ownership to keep the team in Vancouver.

          <p>Top U.S. universities, often divided by internal strife, are finding common ground in opposing the Trump administration's efforts to defund research, increase endowment taxes, and control admissions and faculty appointments. This campaign has united faculty, students, donors, and alumni groups, who view it as an attack on academic freedom and institutional autonomy. To counter these measures, university communities are seeking to sustain this fragile unity by accepting diverse viewpoints and prioritizing the survival of their institutions. Concerns are growing that the administration's actions could damage the reputation of American universities and hinder scientific innovation.</p>

          <p>Sam Tanenhaus's biography of William F. Buckley Jr. explores the conservative intellectual's multifaceted impact on American politics, intellectual discourse, and media. Buckley's early work, "God and Man at Yale," critiqued Ivy League institutions for promoting anti-American views, a theme echoed by today's Trump administration. As the founder of National Review and host of "Firing Line," Buckley cultivated young writers and shaped conservative thought. Despite his intellectual contributions, Buckley's failure to articulate a coherent conservative philosophy remains a notable aspect of his legacy.</p>

Asean has the opportunity to shape trade rules and prioritize regional resilience, but must navigate internal divisions and external pressures with cohesion.
