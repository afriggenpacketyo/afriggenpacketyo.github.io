          <p>Pope Leo XIV, the first American-born pope, led Mass at the Vatican, calling for peace in ongoing conflicts and wishing everyone a Happy Mother's Day. The election of Robert Prevost, a former math major and White Sox fan from Chicago, represents both continuity and change for the Catholic Church. Papal biographer Austen Ivereigh noted Prevost's ability to combine evangelization, statesmanship, and governance. Pope Leo XIV has identified artificial intelligence as a major threat and embraced his predecessor's ideals of a more inclusive church, reaching out to those on the margins.</p>

          <p>Puerto Rico is seeking to capitalize on global trade tensions by attracting international companies to relocate their manufacturing plants to the island, where they would be exempt from tariffs. Government officials are actively promoting Puerto Rico as a business destination, highlighting its U.S. jurisdiction, tax incentives, and skilled workforce. Manufacturing remains the island's largest industry, and officials aim to revive Puerto Rico's economic heyday by attracting companies in sectors such as aerospace, pharmaceuticals, and medical devices.

          <p>A new study proposes that aneural eukaryotic cells can process information up to a billion times faster than traditional biochemical processes, suggesting that the computational limit of life may be significantly higher than previously estimated. This theory builds on the idea that quantum processes in biological systems can exceed the computing power of even advanced quantum computers. The study focuses on tryptophan, an amino acid found in many proteins, and suggests it could act like quantum fiber optics in cells. While the ideas require further experimentation, the new research indicates that biology and quantum mechanics may not be as mutually exclusive as previously thought.</p>
