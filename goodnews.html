          <p>Federal wildlife officials are investigating the stabbing of a 300-pound elephant pup seal on an Oregon beach and are seeking the public's help in identifying the attacker. The incident occurred on March 16 in Neskowin, Oregon, and the seal has since recovered and been moved to a secluded beach in Washington State. The National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration (NOAA) has released a description and sketch of the suspect, who is described as a white man, about 5 feet, 10 inches tall, with black-and-white hair and a large gap between his front teeth. The Marine Mammal Protection Act prohibits harming wild elephant seals, with violations punishable by up to a year in jail and a $100,000 fine.</p>

          <p>Tens of thousands of GCSE students will receive their grades via the Education Record app on their phones as part of a government trial in Manchester and the West Midlands. The pilot program aims to streamline the process for college admissions teams and reduce bureaucracy for schools. Students will still have the option to collect their paper results in person, maintaining the traditional results day experience. The app will make results available at 11:00 on results day, while in-person collection will start at 08:00, marking a significant step towards digitizing education records.</p>

          <p>Richard Irvine, owner of the Colonsay Smokery on the remote Scottish island of Colonsay, is offering to give away his business for free to the right candidate who commits to living on the island. With a population of just 125, Colonsay is seeking to attract more young people to sustain its community. Irvine, a serial business creator, established the smokery in 2022 with the intention of providing an economic opportunity for new families. The ideal candidate would likely be part of a young couple or family, with one partner running the smokery and the other working remotely, contributing to the island's economy and community.</p>

          <div class="timestamp">2025-05-06 19:00:15 EDT</div>
        </div>
        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Asia's largest economies have approved a new rapid financing mechanism that will use regional currencies, including the Chinese yuan, signaling a potential shift away from the US dollar. This scheme is part of the Chiang Mai Initiative Multilateralisation (CMIM), a currency swap arrangement among ASEAN countries, China, Japan, and South Korea. The move aims to shield these economies from the financial volatility caused by US President Donald Trump's global tariff war, which has affected the US Treasuries market and Asian currencies. This could represent a longer-term trend towards a regional monetary system that relies less on the dollar and gives China a greater role.</p>

          <p>The Department of Health and Human Services (HHS) has formally revoked some layoff notices, reinstating staff at the CDC and FDA, including those working for the World Trade Center Health Program. This decision reverses previous cuts that affected employees providing healthcare services to 9/11 first responders and survivors. While some FDA food safety labs also had their layoffs reversed, not all workers promised reinstatement have received notices, and the status of CDC's National Center for Environmental Health employees remains uncertain. The move follows criticism from lawmakers and internal confusion over the department's restructuring and budget priorities.</p>

          <p>Sovereignty, the winner of the Kentucky Derby, will not compete in the Preakness Stakes, ending the chance for a Triple Crown champion this year. Trainer Bill Mott cited the horse's long-term interests as the reason for the decision, with plans to enter Sovereignty in the Belmont Stakes instead. This marks the fifth time since 2018 that the Preakness will proceed without a Triple Crown contender. The decision has reignited discussions about the spacing of the Triple Crown races, with some suggesting changes to better accommodate the horses' health and performance.</p>

          <p>Montana Governor Greg Gianforte vetoed House Bill 477, which aimed to phase out the use of Styrofoam containers in the state, citing it as government overreach. The bill would have largely banned Styrofoam by 2030, with earlier restrictions for the hospitality industry. Gianforte argued that the state should remain a sanctuary for freedom and free enterprise, and that the ban would impose unnecessary costs on businesses and taxpayers. Proponents of the bill claimed the material poses health and environmental risks, but Gianforte countered that targeting only restaurants and food-service establishments was inconsistent.</p>

Carney, elected on an anti-Trump platform, maintained a firm stance, asserting that Canada is not for sale.

The three finalists, Rita Bullwinkel‚Äôs ‚ÄúHeadshot,‚Äù Stacey Levine‚Äôs ‚ÄúMice 1961,‚Äù and Gayl Jones‚Äôs ‚ÄúThe Unicorn Woman,‚Äù represent bold and experimental work on the fringes of American fiction.</p>

          <p>Advanced Micro Devices (AMD) reported first fiscal-quarter earnings that exceeded expectations, but the company will take a $1.5 billion hit to revenue due to chip export controls. The company expects about $700 million in lost revenue during the current quarter and $1.5 billion in total through the end of AMD's fiscal year because the U.S. limited the export of some of the company's artificial intelligence chips during the quarter. Despite these headwinds, CEO Lisa Su stated that AMD's leadership product portfolio would offset these challenges. The company's data center segment saw strong growth due to demand for both Epyc processors and Instinct GPUs.</p>
