          <p>The fourth episode of The Celebrity Traitors showcased a challenge where contestants, including Alan Carr and Celia Imrie, were tasked with eliciting shrieks from banshees, which generated significant online amusement over the resulting subtitles. Clare Balding was ultimately banished from the castle, revealing herself to be a faithful, highlighting the participants' ongoing difficulty in identifying the traitors. Earlier in the episode, actress Ruth Codd was murdered by the traitors, a move that saddened fans who admired her cutting one-liners and unique presence. Despite the strategic blunders and confusion among the contestants, Jonathan Ross managed to avoid banishment, while Alan Carr's evolving role as a cold-hearted killer continued to captivate viewers and stir discussion.</p>

          <p>The Appleby Blue Almshouse in Southwark, London, has won the prestigious Riba Stirling Prize for Britain's best new building, lauded for its innovative design combating loneliness among over-65s. This modern almshouse provides 59 affordable flats alongside communal facilities like a roof garden, courtyard, and community kitchen, setting an ambitious standard for social housing. Judges praised its "generous" and "thoughtful" spaces, which meticulously craft an "aspirational living environment" standing in stark contrast to typical older people's housing. The project, built on an old care home site by United St Saviour's Charity, offers subsidized homes for low-income individuals, marking a significant and inspiring architectural achievement.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>China is making ambitious strides in nuclear fusion research, with both private and state-backed enterprises actively competing to construct a commercial fusion reactor by 2035 or even sooner. At the ENN Group campus, engineers are diligently installing new heating systems for the EXL-50U tokamak, aiming to elevate its plasma temperature to an astounding 100 million degrees Celsius. The overarching goal is to achieve controlled fusion by heating and confining light atoms long enough to fuse them into heavier ones, a process that could release vast amounts of clean electricity. This significant national effort positions China as a potential frontrunner in harnessing the immense energy source that powers the sun, promising a transformative future of sustainable and abundant power for the world.</p>

          <p>Susan Stamberg, an influential "founding mother" of NPR, has passed away at the age of 87, leaving behind a profound legacy as a cherished mentor, insightful storyteller, and pioneering journalist. She joined NPR at its very inception, initially working to physically cut tape, a rare and groundbreaking opportunity for women in broadcasting during that era. Stamberg went on to become a distinguished host of iconic programs like "All Things Considered" and "Weekend Edition," later serving as a special correspondent. She was widely celebrated for her unique ability to find joy and humanity in diverse subjects, from culture and science to politics.

          <h2>Trump Administration Urges Employers to Offer IVF Coverage, Announces Fertility Drug Price Cuts</h2>
          <div class="timestamp">2025-10-16 17:08:20 EDT</div>

          <p>The Trump administration has announced new initiatives aimed at expanding access to in vitro fertilization (IVF), primarily by encouraging U.S. employers to voluntarily offer new fertility benefit options to their employees. This move, presented as a recommendation without government mandates or subsidies, seeks to make expensive IVF treatments more broadly affordable. President Trump also successfully secured a deal with EMD Serono, a leading fertility drug manufacturer, to significantly lower the cost of certain essential drugs and make them available on the government's TrumpRx website. The announcement comes amidst the GOP's complex and often contentious relationship with IVF, particularly after the Alabama Supreme Court's controversial embryo ruling, with Trump framing these initiatives as "very pro-life."</p>

          <h2>Trump Administration Negotiates Significant Reductions in IVF Drug Costs</h2>
          <div class="timestamp">2025-10-16 17:03:21 EDT</div>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>President Trump announced that new price negotiations with biopharmaceutical company EMD Serono will "dramatically" decrease the cost of drugs essential for in vitro fertilization (IVF), with per-cycle drug costs estimated to fall by 73% for American consumers. EMD Serono has agreed to provide an 84% discount on list prices for its fertility drugs, including Gonal-f, directly to patients through the TrumpRx website. The administration is also actively working to make it easier for companies to offer supplemental fertility insurance coverage as an accepted benefit. While a significant step in reducing a major expense, the overall cost of an IVF cycle, which can still exceed $25,000, will not decrease by the same margin, as drugs represent only one component of the expensive procedure.

          <p>The demand for protein, especially in the form of protein powders and supplements, is experiencing a significant surge, heavily influenced by social media trends and a burgeoning wellness culture, with 61% of U.S. consumers reporting increased protein intake. While dietitians acknowledge protein's fundamental role as an essential nutrient for bodily functions and muscle development, they caution that current trends often lead to an overestimation of daily protein needs. Experts strongly emphasize that whole foods remain the ideal source of protein, providing a broader spectrum of nutrients and greater satiety compared to isolated supplements. Concerns also persist regarding product safety, as some protein powders have been found to contain unsafe levels of lead in recent investigations. Dietitians advise limiting powder intake to occasional use, particularly for non-athletes, and prioritizing diverse, nutrient-rich whole-food sources.</p>
