          <p>The government is set to unveil a 10-year industrial strategy aimed at boosting growth by lowering energy costs for thousands of businesses, potentially cutting bills by up to 25%. The plan includes a new British Industrial Competitiveness Scheme, which will exempt over 7,000 manufacturing firms from certain green energy levies, reducing costs by up to ¬£40 per megawatt-hour from 2027. Additionally, the most energy-intensive firms will receive increased discounts on network charges, and measures will be implemented to expedite the connection of new factories to the energy grid. The strategy also aims to upskill Britons, attract global talent, streamline planning processes, and boost research and development spending, focusing on key sectors like advanced manufacturing, clean energy, and digital technologies. </p>

This victory marks his fourth grass-court title, placing him second only to Novak Djokovic among active players. Winning Queen's is considered a good omen, as Alcaraz also won the title in 2023 before triumphing at Wimbledon. The Queen's Club victory solidifies Alcaraz's position as a top contender. </p>

          <p>An NHS Lothian psychiatrist is hoping to establish a ketamine clinic by the end of the year as an alternative treatment for severe depression, particularly for patients who have not responded to traditional therapies. This move follows the opening of a private clinic in Lanarkshire that offers ketamine-assisted therapy. While ketamine is not licensed for routine depression treatment, it can be used 'off-label' by doctors. There are some concerns about the recreational use of ketamine. </p>

          <p>Ketamine is increasingly known as a party drug which is linked to serious health problems, even fatalities. But there is growing interest in Scotland in its potential to treat severe depression. One NHS Lothian psychiatrist hopes to set up a clinic by the end of the year offering the Category B drug as an alternative to electroconvulsive therapy (ECT), a treatment that involves sending an electric current through the brain. Prof Andrew McIntosh thinks it could offer another alternative to patients with the most hard-to-treat depression. The private clinic in Hamilton opened under licence from Healthcare Improvement Scotland in September and charges ¬£6,000 for a programme of four intravenous ketamine infusions and a course of psychotherapy.</p>

The MSCI World index experienced only a slight decline, and safe-haven assets traded mixed, indicating a muted response to the escalation. Analysts suggest that the market views the attack on Iran as a relief, with minimal risks of the conflict spreading to the rest of the region.

          <p>The NATO summit in The Hague is set to focus on increasing Europe's defense spending, a major demand of US President Donald Trump, with most members committing to a massive increase in defense spending. The agreement has the potential to transform societies in Europe. While Spain had initially opposed the measure, it ultimately dropped its opposition after a deal was reached for it to be exempt. The summit may be disappointing for Ukraine, as its aspirations to join NATO are unlikely to take center stage, but the summit is a win for the alliance. </p>
