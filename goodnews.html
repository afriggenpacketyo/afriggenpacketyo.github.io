          <p>A $7.4 billion settlement with Purdue Pharma and the Sackler family over the opioid crisis has gained support from 55 attorneys general across the country. The settlement would end the Sacklers' control of Purdue, block the family from selling opioids in the U.S., and provide funds to help communities fight the opioid crisis. The money will be paid out over 15 years, with over half distributed in the first few years. The deal leaves Purdue in bankruptcy with oversight by a monitor and prevents the company from lobbying or marketing opioids.</p>

          <p>Sarah Lin, a Bronx high school student, is advocating for a bill that would require closed captions in movie theaters across New York state. Lin's inspiration comes from witnessing the challenges her mother faces due to progressive hearing loss. The Open Captioning Accessibility Act aims to ensure that movie theaters have some showings per week with open captions for all audience members. Lin hopes the act will pass in New York and eventually be mandated nationally, making movie theaters more inclusive for the deaf and hard-of-hearing community.</p>
