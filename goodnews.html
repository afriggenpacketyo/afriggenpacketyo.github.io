          <p>The UK government has unveiled a 10-year industrial strategy focused on lowering energy costs for businesses by exempting them from certain green energy levies. This initiative, part of a broader plan to boost economic growth, aims to cut energy bills by up to 25% for over 7,000 UK businesses. The British Industrial Competitiveness Scheme will reduce costs by up to ¬£40 per megawatt-hour from 2027, while energy-intensive firms will see network charge cuts increase to 90% from 2026. The strategy also includes measures to expedite energy grid connections for new factories and projects, alongside plans to improve workers' skills and attract global talent.</p>

          <p>President Donald Trump demanded that "everyone" keep oil prices down to avoid playing "into the hands of the enemy" as tensions in the Middle East escalate following U.S. strikes on Iran. In a post on Truth Social, Trump urged the Department of Energy to increase domestic drilling, despite oil production decisions being made by private companies in response to market dynamics. His message followed U.S. airstrikes on Iranian nuclear sites, which initially caused a brief spike in oil prices before futures trading stabilized; oil prices have since decreased.</p>

          <p>Federal Reserve Governor Michelle Bowman indicated she would favor an interest rate cut at the July policy meeting if inflation pressures remain contained. Bowman's remarks align with fellow Governor Christopher Waller's recent statements, suggesting a potential shift in the Fed's approach due to diminished policy uncertainty and concerns about labor market weakness. She believes that tariffs are likely to have a temporary and muted impact on prices, paving the way for lower rates. The Federal Open Market Committee (FOMC) is scheduled to meet July 29-30 to discuss monetary policy. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>The Vera Rubin Observatory in Chile, home to the world's largest telescope, has released its first images of distant galaxies in stunning detail. The images capture star-forming regions and distant galaxies, revealing previously faint features. The telescope is equipped with an advanced 8.4-meter telescope and the largest digital camera ever built. The Legacy Survey of Space and Time (LSST) project will begin later this year, scanning the night sky nightly and capturing even the subtlest changes with unmatched precision.</p>
