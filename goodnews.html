The recalled products, identified by specific batch codes and best-by dates of August 2026, were sold at various retailers. No injuries have been reported, but consumers are advised not to consume the affected items and can contact Ben's Original for returns.</p>

          <p>Southern California experienced an unusual early atmospheric river rainstorm in October, which has drenched the landscape and is expected to delay the peak fire season by weeks or months. This "Goldilocks atmospheric river" is seen as beneficial after over a year of intensely dry conditions and significant fires in early 2025. While one storm isn't enough to reverse the drought, it makes vegetation less prone to burning. However, experts caution that a dry fall with Santa Ana winds could still reignite wildfire concerns, emphasizing the temporary nature of this reprieve.</p>

          <p>Following the Federal Reserve's recent benchmark rate cut, experts anticipate further reductions this year, likely leading to lower home equity loan rates. With homeowners holding significant equity, many are considering tapping into it. Projections suggest two more Fed rate cuts, potentially by 0.5%, which would drive average home equity rates below 8%. Some lenders are already offering rates as low as 7.5% in certain markets. Borrowers are advised to compare offers from multiple lenders to secure competitive rates as the market evolves. (not investment advice)</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Jewish mourning rituals emphasize eternal memory among the living, with little focus on an afterlife. The deceased are buried quickly and simply, without embalming, in plain wooden caskets or shrouds, reflecting humility. A ritual bath, Taharah, precedes the burial, and public viewings are generally avoided. Close family members perform K'riah, a ritual tearing of clothing, to express grief. The seven-day period of Shiva follows, during which mourners refrain from work and grooming, receiving support from friends. The Mourner's Kaddish, a communal prayer focusing on faith, is recited for varying periods, and gravestones are typically added later.</p>

He calls for a balance between growing golf's appeal to newcomers and preserving its centuries-old traditions and values.

These "high-flyer" managers spend more time in one-on-one meetings, provide structured feedback, and foster autonomy, encouraging experimentation with new tasks.
