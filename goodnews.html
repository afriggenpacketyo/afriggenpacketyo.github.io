          <div class="timestamp">2025-05-19 21:51:57 EDT</div>
        </div>
        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>In an effort to stimulate its economy amidst trade tensions, China's central bank reduced its benchmark lending rates for the first time in seven months. The People's Bank of China lowered the one-year loan prime rate to 3.0% and the five-year LPR to 3.5%, marking the first rate cut since October. This move, part of a broader stimulus package, aims to boost corporate and household borrowing, with economists anticipating further easing of monetary policy by the end of the year. The rate cuts also follow reductions in deposit rates by state-backed commercial lenders, a measure to protect their net interest margins and support the lowering of key lending rates.

          <p>The Woods, a cannabis dispensary co-owned by Woody Harrelson and Bill Maher in West Hollywood, was burglarized early Saturday morning.

          <p>Netflix has reached an agreement to bring Sesame Street to its streaming platform, ensuring the show's continued availability after Warner Bros Discovery did not renew its deal with HBO. Starting later this year, Netflix will offer a new 56th season and a library of previous episodes to its 300 million subscribers worldwide. The deal also includes PBS, which will gain access to episodes on the same day they are released on Netflix. This move reflects Netflix's increasing focus on children's content, with children's programming accounting for 15% of viewing on the service.</p>

CATL plans to allocate 90% of the funds raised to build its upcoming factory in Hungary, which will supply batteries to European automotive clients. Despite a 9.7% drop in its 2024 annual revenue, CATL's net profit increased by 15% year over year, driven by growing demand for electric vehicles in China.</p>

          <p>The Senate has moved forward with a cryptocurrency regulation bill, known as the GENIUS Act, after overcoming initial Democratic opposition related to concerns about the Trump family's involvement in the digital asset industry. The legislation, which aims to create a regulatory framework for stablecoins, advanced in a 66-32 vote after gaining support from some Democratic holdouts. While some senators, like Mark Warner, emphasized the need for clear rules to protect consumers and support innovation, others, such as Elizabeth Warren, continue to advocate for anti-corruption reforms to the bill.</p>

The run was a fundraising effort for cancer charities in memory of his mother, who died from cancer in 2018.
