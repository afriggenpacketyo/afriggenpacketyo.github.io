          <p>In an article for a prominent Communist Party journal, Chinese President Xi Jinping reiterated his country's commitment to economic globalization and free trade. He criticized the rise of unilateralism, protectionism, and the use of sanctions, framing China as a champion of open markets in contrast to more protectionist international policies. Xi pledged that China would continue to promote trade liberalization and an inclusive global economic system, opposing the creation of trade barriers. This statement was published on the opening day of a major supply chain exposition in the country.</p>

          <h2>Chinese State Media Encourages Local Governments to Use Legislation to Boost Economic Growth</h2>

        </div>
        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>An article in the People's Daily, a key state newspaper, has urged China's local governments to utilize their legislative powers as a "propeller" for economic and social development. The piece argues that tailored local laws create a stable and predictable environment, allowing market entities to operate effectively under the rule of law. Since legislative powers were expanded to more cities in 2015, this approach has reportedly shifted governance from relying on top-down orders to using legal frameworks. The article emphasizes that successful local legislation must adapt to the evolving needs of the economy.</p>

          <h2>Scientists Crossbreed Honduran and Floridian Coral to Restore Reefs</h2>
          <div class="timestamp">2025-07-15 20:58:18 EDT</div>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Marine scientists are undertaking a novel conservation effort by crossbreeding tough Elkhorn coral from Honduras with Florida's struggling native populations to restore the state's damaged reefs. This initiative, which created a hybrid nicknamed the "Flonduran," is the first time an international cross of corals has been permitted for planting on wild reefs. Over 95% of Florida's Elkhorn coral has been lost due to warming oceans and disease, threatening coastal protection from storm surges. The hope is that the hardier hybrid corals will survive future marine heatwaves and help rebuild the vital reef ecosystem.</p>

          <p>The Los Angeles Chargers have revealed two new alternate uniforms for the upcoming season: an all-gold "Charger Power" set and a navy blue "Super Chargers" uniform. The gold uniform, a first for the team, has generated mixed reactions online, with some comparing it to mustard or the Minions characters from "Despicable Me." The navy blue set is designed as a modern throwback to the team's look from the 1990s and early 2000s, an era that included their only Super Bowl appearance. The team will also have the option to wear their popular powder blue pants.</p>

          <p>President Trump announced a new trade agreement with Indonesia, averting a threatened 32% tariff on the country's goods. Under the deal, Indonesian imports will face a 19% tariff, while Indonesia has committed to significant purchases from the U.S., including $15 billion in energy, $4.5 billion in agricultural products, and 50 Boeing jets. The pact was finalized after a call between Trump and Indonesian President Prabowo Subianto. The deal is one of several the administration has pursued as an alternative to imposing steeper, country-specific levies on trading partners.</p>

          <div class="timestamp">2025-07-15 19:31:17 EDT</div>
        </div>
        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>A growing number of central banks, particularly in Africa and Latin America, are buying gold directly from domestic mines using local currency. This strategy allows them to bolster their reserves without depleting foreign exchange assets like the U.S. dollar, and is often cheaper than buying on the international market. According to the World Gold Council, this trend helps support local mining industries and formalize a sector often linked to illegal activity. The move is driven by gold's soaring prices and its appeal as a hedge against geopolitical and financial risks. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>Alexander Torres, who spent more than two decades in prison for a murder he did not commit, will receive a $14 million settlement from Los Angeles County. Torres was convicted in 2001 despite having a strong alibi and evidence that made his involvement unlikely, such as wearing a cast on his arm. A judge declared him factually innocent in 2022 after a review by the L.A. County District Attorney's Conviction Integrity Unit. The settlement resolves a federal lawsuit claiming that sheriff's detectives failed to disclose exculpatory evidence.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>An independent review of the UK's National Health Service has recommended that Physician Associates (PAs) and Anaesthesia Associates (AAs) should have their job titles changed to "assistants." The goal is to avoid confusing patients and to clarify that their roles are distinct from doctors, with more limited training. The review, authored by Professor Gillian Leng, also suggests standardized uniforms and badges and states they should not be diagnosing patients. The recommendations follow safety concerns and high-profile cases where patients died after being seen by PAs they believed were fully qualified doctors.</p>

          <p>The iconic Palm House at London's Royal Botanic Gardens, Kew, is set for a major £50 million renovation that will require its closure for five years starting in 2027. The project will involve moving 1,300 tropical plants, replacing 16,000 panes of glass, and repairing the historic ironwork, which has been damaged by the hot, humid conditions inside. A key goal of the refurbishment is to make the 175-year-old Victorian glass house more sustainable by replacing its gas boilers with heat pumps to achieve net-zero emissions. Some of the priceless plants are already being carefully prepared for relocation.</p>

          <p>The UK's Advertising Standards Authority (ASA) has banned an advertisement for Trip drinks for making unauthorized health claims that its products can "help you feel calm" and reduce stress. The ad for the cucumber, mint, and magnesium drink also referenced "calming" ingredients like L-theanine and ashwagandha. The watchdog ruled that this language implied the drink could treat anxiety, a claim not permitted on the official register for food and supplement marketing. The ASA also found a claim about "0g added sugar" to be inaccurate and ordered the ad not to appear again.</p>
