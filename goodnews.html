          <p>A framework deal has been established between the U.S. and China that would allow TikTok to continue operating in the United States, with technology company Oracle playing a key role in a consortium of firms. The commercial terms have reportedly been agreed upon, though the final structure, including the level of Chinese ownership and control over the algorithm, remains unclear. Presidents Trump and Xi are scheduled to speak on Friday to finalize the arrangement, which comes ahead of a looming deadline for parent company ByteDance to divest its U.S. business.</p>

          <p>Google's parent company, Alphabet, has announced a £5 billion investment in UK artificial intelligence infrastructure and research over the next two years, signaling confidence in the country's tech sector. The announcement, which precedes a state visit by U.S. President Donald Trump, includes the opening of a new $1 billion data center in Hertfordshire. Google executives highlighted the "profound opportunities" in the UK for advanced science and addressed concerns about the energy use of data centers, stating the new facility will be air-cooled and its heat redeployed for community use.</p>

        </div>
        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>The Los Angeles Dodgers are considering the strategic possibility of using two-way star Shohei Ohtani as a relief pitcher during the playoffs, in addition to his role as a starter. Team executives acknowledged that while the plan is for him to be a starter, unforeseen circumstances in October could lead to him being used out of the bullpen, similar to how other starters have been deployed in crucial late-game situations in past postseasons. This option is complicated by MLB's two-way player rules, which would cause the Dodgers to lose their designated hitter if Ohtani enters as a reliever and is later removed from the mound.</p>

          <p>Quarterback Baker Mayfield orchestrated a late, game-winning drive to lead the Tampa Bay Buccaneers to a 20-19 victory over the Houston Texans on Monday night. The decisive 80-yard drive was capped by a two-yard touchdown run from Rachaad White with only six seconds remaining on the clock. A crucial play on the drive was a 15-yard scramble by Mayfield on a fourth-and-10, which kept the Buccaneers' hopes alive and secured their second consecutive win via a last-minute comeback.</p>

South Korea's Kospi also reached a new record high, while U.S. markets closed higher in anticipation of a key Federal Reserve meeting. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>California is poised to designate Diwali, the Hindu "Festival of Lights," as an official state holiday after the legislature passed Assembly Bill 268. If signed into law by Governor Gavin Newsom, the bill would authorize public schools and community colleges to close for the holiday and allow state employees to take the day off. Proponents argue that the move recognizes the religious and cultural importance of the festival for California's large South Asian population and allows the diaspora community to fully participate in one of the world's oldest religious holidays.</p>

          <p>In a series of interviews, candidates running for California governor in 2026 offered their assessments of Governor Gavin Newsom's successes and failures. Democratic candidates like Toni Atkins and Tony Thurmond praised Newsom's investments in public education and his efforts to challenge the Trump administration, while also identifying areas for improvement such as the housing and insurance crises. Republican candidates, including Sheriff Chad Bianco and Steve Hilton, were highly critical of Newsom's overall performance but found some common ground on issues like limiting smartphone use in schools.</p>

          <p>A federal appeals court has upheld a lower court's decision, temporarily preventing President Trump from firing Federal Reserve Governor Lisa Cook. The ruling came just before a key meeting where the Fed is expected to vote on interest rates, ensuring Cook can participate. The court found that firing Cook would likely violate the Federal Reserve Act, which is designed to insulate the central bank from political pressure. The Trump administration sought to remove Cook based on unproven allegations of mortgage fraud, a move her attorneys argued did not meet the legal standard of removal "for cause."</p>

          <p>As autumn begins, experts in interior design and organization suggest several strategies for effectively decluttering one's home to reduce stress and improve living spaces. The advice includes starting with small, manageable tasks like a single drawer, and planning ahead for where discarded items will go, whether to charity, recycling, or online marketplaces. Experts also recommend prioritizing quality over quantity by keeping items that are genuinely uplifting, and learning to distinguish between nostalgia for the past and true sentimental value in the present to make letting go easier.</p>

          <div class="timestamp">2025-09-15 19:47:00 EDT</div>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>The U.S. Food and Drug Administration is considering removing some "black box" warnings from menopause hormone therapy medications, which could change how millions of women view the treatment for symptoms like hot flashes. The current warnings, which list risks of stroke, blood clots, and breast cancer, are based on a flawed 2002 study that many doctors now believe overstated the dangers by focusing on older women. More recent research suggests that when started closer to the onset of menopause, the benefits of hormone therapy can outweigh the risks for many, prompting calls for updated and more nuanced safety information.</p>
