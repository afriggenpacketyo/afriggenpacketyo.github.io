          <p>Twenty-two families in southwest Fresno have become first-time homeowners by constructing their own homes through the Mutual Self-Help Housing (MSHH) program. The program, run by Self-Help Enterprises, empowers low-income families to build and maintain healthy homes and communities. The project represents a $1.46 million investment from the city of Fresno to address the housing crisis. The families learned construction skills from scratch and worked collaboratively, fostering a sense of community and shared responsibility. The project is considered a model for the future. The families are working on the final steps before moving in.</p>

          <p>A federal judge ruled that using copyrighted books to train AI models is fair use, marking a victory for Anthropic, which trained its AI assistant Claude using copyrighted books. The judge stated that this use was "exceedingly transformative," but the company may have broken the law by using pirated books. A trial will be held to determine damages for using pirated books, which can reach up to $150,000 per case of willful copyright infringement. The judge also ruled that making digital copies of print books for AI training falls under fair use. The future of copyright law is uncertain.</p>

Micron projects revenue of about $10.7 billion for its fiscal fourth quarter, up 38% from a year earlier and above the $9.9 billion average analyst estimate. Data center revenue more than doubled in the third quarter, driven by soaring demand in the high bandwidth memory (HBM) market due to the artificial intelligence boom. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>Industry insiders at the Annual Meeting of the New Champions in Tianjin suggest that Chinese companies should relocate their entire manufacturing ecosystems to solidify overseas expansions. Ben Simpfendorfer of Oliver Wyman stated that rising global trade uncertainty necessitates building factories in new markets for both export and local sale. This strategy aims to strengthen supply chain resilience amidst increasing tariffs and trade tensions. The relocation of supply chains overseas began during Trump's first term to mitigate tariff impacts. The global economy is in flux.</p>

          <p>Fortnite gamers who were charged for unwanted purchases may receive a portion of $126 million in refunds from the Federal Trade Commission this week. The FTC is reopening the claims submission process for gamers eligible under a $245 million settlement with Epic Games. The settlement addresses deceptive online practices that tricked players, including children, into making unauthorized purchases. The FTC will send nearly 970,000 checks and PayPal payments to consumers who filed valid refund claims. There is hope for the future.</p>

          <p>The Federal Housing Finance Agency has directed Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac to formally consider cryptocurrency as an asset in single-family mortgage loan risk assessments. This move signals crypto integration into traditional financial infrastructure, allowing digital assets to be included without borrowers needing to liquidate them into U.S. dollars. FHFA Director William J. Pulte stated this aligns with President Trump's vision to make the United States the crypto capital of the world. Historically, cryptocurrency has been excluded due to volatility and regulatory uncertainty. (not investment advice)</p>
