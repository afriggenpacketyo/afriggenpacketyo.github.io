          <p>A psychologist specializing in couples identifies the most frequent causes of arguments in relationships, including tone of voice, family relations, household chores, and communication styles. The psychologist emphasizes that tone of voice can signal contempt, a key predictor of divorce, and suggests naming the effect to de-escalate conflict. Arguments about family often stem from unmet needs and value clashes, while chore-related disputes are typically about the uneven distribution of labor. The article suggests that fairness in chore division won't be a 50/50 split, but a feeling that both partners have a hand in the tasks. Communication styles are tricky and require time-outs and eye-to-eye discussion. </p>

          <div class="timestamp">2025-06-08 13:35:38 EDT</div>
        </div>
        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>A new study reveals that cuddling before sleep can foster secure attachment and reduce stress levels in couples. Researchers analyzed data from heterosexual couples, finding that physical closeness at sleep onset is associated with lower attachment insecurity and stress. Sleep expert Wendy Troxel notes that cuddling triggers psychological and physiological responses, such as increased emotional security and the release of oxytocin. The study suggests that pre-sleep cuddling is a meaningful ritual for emotional health, regardless of whether couples sleep together throughout the night. The findings underscore the importance of non-sexual physical affection in maintaining and repairing relationships.</p>

          <p>England secured a series victory against the West Indies in the second T20 match at Bristol, successfully chasing down a target of 197 runs. Jos Buttler and Harry Brook contributed significantly with the bat, but it was Jacob Bethell's explosive cameo and Tom Banton's unbeaten innings that propelled England to victory. Despite a strong start by West Indies, England's bowlers managed to restrict them initially, before a late surge in scoring boosted the visitors' total. Adil Rashid's expensive spell proved costly, but England's batting depth ultimately secured the win with nine balls to spare. </p>

          <p>Passengers on an American Airlines flight from Philadelphia to Naples, Italy, experienced a significant disruption when their Boeing 787-9 Dreamliner was diverted to Rome due to 'operational limitations.' The aircraft, deemed too large for Naples Airport, forced the airline to reroute the flight and transport the 231 passengers and 11 crew members by bus for the remaining 140 miles. The incident has prompted apologies from American Airlines, which typically uses a smaller Boeing 787-8 for the Naples route. This unexpected change added approximately three hours to the passengers' journey. </p>
