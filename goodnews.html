          <p>As the Scottish National Party's annual conference approaches, First Minister John Swinney is working to stabilize the party and refocus its agenda. Following a period of turmoil, Swinney has steadied the SNP by addressing internal controversies and shifting government focus to public services. With a Holyrood election looming, his strategy involves balancing the core goal of Scottish independence with pressing public concerns like the NHS and cost of living. This conference is a critical opportunity for Swinney to define his leadership and present a renewed vision for the party, navigating internal debates on the best path toward another independence referendum.</p>

          <p>First Lady Melania Trump announced that an "open channel of communication" with Russian President Vladimir Putin has resulted in the reunification of eight Ukrainian children with their families. She stated that Putin responded to a "peace letter" she sent concerning children displaced by the war, leading to a coordinated effort between Russia and Ukraine to facilitate their return. This development is part of her BE BEST initiative, which focuses on the well-being of children globally. The announcement highlights a rare moment of cooperation amid the ongoing conflict and international condemnation of Russia's alleged unlawful deportation of thousands of Ukrainian children.</p>

          <p>Northern Ireland secured a crucial 2-0 World Cup qualifying victory over Slovakia, but the win was bittersweet due to a yellow card for star player Conor Bradley. The Liverpool defender, who was instrumental in the match, is now suspended for the upcoming key fixture against group favorites Germany. Bradley's dynamic performance earned him praise as the best player on the pitch, highlighting his importance to the team's strategy. Manager Michael O'Neill now faces the difficult task of compensating for the loss of his talismanic captain as the team prepares for one of its toughest challenges in the campaign.</p>

          <p>FIFA is actively redrafting its regulations concerning domestic league games held in foreign countries and is seeking legal advice on whether a complete ban is feasible. The move follows recent approvals for a La Liga match in Miami and a Serie A game in Perth, which have reignited the debate over football's globalization. The current rules, established in 2014, require approval from multiple associations but do not give FIFA direct power to block such matches. The governing body aims to create a more robust framework to manage the practice, with new regulations potentially ready by early next year.</p>

          <p>Doncaster boxer Josh Padley has successfully turned his sport into a full-time profession, a life change spurred by his high-profile loss to world champion Shakur Stevenson. Padley, formerly an electrician, took the fight on just four days' notice and, despite the defeat, earned a significant payday and a multi-fight contract with Matchroom. The opportunity has allowed him to quit his day job and fully dedicate himself to boxing, demonstrating how a strategic risk can transform a career. He is now preparing for his next bout in the super-featherweight division, aiming to build on the global recognition he gained.</p>

          <p>China is expanding its 'Health Silk Road' in Africa with new pharmaceutical manufacturing projects, aiming to address the continent's reliance on imported medicines. In Nigeria, Chinese firms are planning to build an insulin production plant, while in the Ivory Coast, Shanghai Fosun Pharmaceutical is constructing a facility to produce antimalarial and antibacterial drugs. These investments are designed to fill critical gaps in local drug production, driven by high demand for treatments for chronic and infectious diseases. Africa currently imports approximately 70% of its essential medicines, presenting a significant opportunity for Chinese companies to establish a manufacturing foothold.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>A recent study by Chinese researchers has found a significant mismatch between regional fertility support policies and actual birth rates across the country. The report highlights that Guangdong, the province with the highest number of newborns, paradoxically offers one of the poorest environments for childbirth and family support. This finding suggests that current financial incentives and other pro-natalist measures may not be effectively influencing families' decisions to have children. The authors call for more in-depth research to create a more scientific basis for policies aimed at boosting China's declining birth rate.</p>
