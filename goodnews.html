          <p>Utah is grappling with a shortage of affordable starter homes, prompting Governor Spencer Cox to set a goal of building 35,000 lower-cost homes in five years. Despite incentives like low-interest construction loans, developers have been slow to participate, and experts suggest zoning law changes are needed to allow for smaller lot sizes. One developer in Plain City, Jed Nilson, is taking on the challenge by building starter homes priced under $400,000, prioritizing first-time buyers and essential workers. A young couple, Miranda and Cole Potokar, were among the first to move into Nilson's homes, expressing gratitude for the opportunity to build their future. The article highlights the complexities of addressing the affordable housing crisis and the need for collaborative efforts. Optimism for affordable housing in Utah is currently uncertain.</p>

          <p>Asia-Pacific markets displayed mixed performance as investors analyzed the Shanghai Cooperation Organization meeting in Tianjin, with tariff uncertainties influencing market sentiment. A U.S. federal appeals court recently ruled some of President Trump's global tariffs illegal. India's markets are under scrutiny after Trump claimed India offered to reduce tariffs on U.S. imports to zero. Meanwhile, Australia's current account balance showed a deficit, and the Australian Securities and Investments Commission fined a local unit of Societe Generale for failing to prevent suspicious orders in the electricity and wheat futures markets. The article provides a snapshot of the diverse factors impacting Asian markets. The article's reflection of global market uncertainties leads to a moderately optimistic view.</p>
