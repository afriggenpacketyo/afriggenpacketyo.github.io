          <p>Caitlin Clark and Angel Reese downplayed a heated moment after a flagrant foul during the Indiana Fever's 93-58 victory over the Chicago Sky. The foul, committed by Clark on Reese, led to a brief but intense exchange between the two players. Both Clark and Reese characterized the incident as a typical "basketball play" and sought to minimize its significance. The play added another chapter to the rivalry between Clark and Reese, which dates back to their college days and has been marked by physical play and national attention.</p>

          <p>The UK's Eurovision entry, Remember Monday, finished 19th in Basel, Switzerland, despite strong vocals and positive attention from songwriting juries. The band's song, "What The Hell Just Happened," was criticized for being a manic mish-mash of musical styles that lacked consistency. While the staging was inventive, it lacked the scale and impact of other performances. Despite the disappointing result, the BBC and others defended the band, emphasizing their talent, energy, and positive attitude, and encouraging the UK to maintain a positive approach to future contests.</p>

          <p>President Trump has publicly criticized Walmart for considering raising prices due to tariffs, urging the retail giant to "eat the tariffs" instead. Walmart had warned that increased tariffs on imported goods could lead to higher prices for consumers. Trump insisted that Walmart, which made billions in profits, should absorb the costs to avoid burdening customers. A Walmart spokesperson responded that the company is committed to keeping prices as low as possible, but there are limits to what they can bear given small retail margins.</p>
