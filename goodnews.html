          <p>The Metropolitan Outer Area Underground Discharge Channel, located north of Tokyo, is one of the world's largest underground stormwater discharge systems, playing a crucial role in protecting Tokyo and its surrounding areas from flooding after heavy rain. This impressive feat of engineering diverts excess water from rivers into a vast underground reservoir, preventing inundation in the densely populated metropolis. The facility is open for tours, offering visitors a glimpse into the cavernous space with its towering pillars, reminiscent of an ancient Roman temple. The system is a key part of Tokyo's infrastructure, designed to mitigate the impact of extreme weather events.</p>

          <p>Cognac producers in France are facing multiple challenges, including climate change, tariffs, and the loss of the Russian market. Climate change is affecting grape quality, while tariffs imposed by the US and China are impacting exports. Despite these difficulties, many family-run businesses are maintaining traditional practices, such as barrel-making, and tapping into new markets like organic cognac and cocktails. The industry is adapting by experimenting with different grape varieties and focusing on quality to attract younger consumers, ensuring the future of cognac production.</p>

          <p>Conservationists in Wales are using edible glitter to track endangered water voles, whose population has declined by 90% in the past 30 years. The glitter, safe for consumption, is added to the voles' food, and the resulting glittery poo helps conservationists monitor their movements. This innovative approach aims to identify the voles' territories and habitats, allowing for targeted conservation efforts such as removing invasive species and protecting riverbanks. The project is currently being tested on captive-bred water voles before being implemented in the wild.</p>

          <p>A mass grave containing thousands of Pachyrhinosaurus fossils has been discovered in Alberta, Canada, offering scientists a unique opportunity to study the species. The site, nicknamed the 'River of Death,' is believed to be the result of a flash flood that wiped out a migrating herd 72 million years ago. The density of bones in the area is exceptionally high, with up to 300 bones per square meter. Researchers are using the fossils to learn about dinosaur biology, growth patterns, and the ancient ecosystem of the region.</p>
