        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Palantir's stock experienced a significant drop after analysts expressed worries about the company's international commercial revenue decline, despite overall revenue growth acceleration. William Blair analyst Louie DiPalma highlighted that Palantir's high software multiple makes it susceptible to compression as revenue growth potentially slows down. While the company exceeded revenue expectations and raised its revenue guidance for the year, investors seemed concerned about the sequential margin decline. CEO Alex Karp remained optimistic, stating that Palantir is "on fire" due to its investments and a cultural shift in the U.S. (not investment advice)</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>A late payment can significantly damage your credit score, impacting loan rates, apartment rentals, and job opportunities. While it stays on your report for seven years, its impact lessens over time. Strategies to remove it include requesting a goodwill adjustment from the creditor with a written letter, disputing inaccuracies with credit bureaus by providing supporting documentation, or negotiating a "pay for delete" agreement with the creditor. If these fail, focus on consistently making on-time payments to rebuild your credit.</p>

          <p>California Governor Gavin Newsom proposed a $7.5 billion tax credit program and offered to collaborate with President Trump to bolster U.S. film production in response to Trump's threat of tariffs on films made abroad. The proposal aims to incentivize studios to conduct more production work in the U.S., reversing the trend of productions being shot in countries with tax incentives. Jon Voight, Trump's "special ambassador" to Hollywood, also discussed a federal policy with tax incentives to encourage domestic film production. Critics, however, question the effectiveness of such credits.</p>

          <p>Britain and India have reached a trade agreement designed to strengthen economic ties amidst global trade uncertainties.

British whiskey and gin will see reduced duties, and India will lower car tariffs under a quota. The agreement is seen as a significant step for Britain in establishing trade deals outside of the European Union following Brexit.</p>

          <p>Friedrich Merz's journey to becoming Germany's next chancellor was marked by an unexpected setback when he failed to win the job on the first parliamentary vote.
