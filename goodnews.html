          <p>Two individuals were rescued from their SUV by courageous bystanders just minutes before the vehicle exploded after crashing into a Domino's Pizza in Herriman, Utah. The crash ruptured a gas line, leading to a massive explosion that destroyed the restaurant and significantly damaged adjacent businesses. Fire officials confirmed that no one was inside the building at the time of the crash and no injuries resulted from the explosion itself. Multiple people involved in the three-vehicle accident that led to the crash were hospitalized for their injuries.</p>

          <p>Crews are making significant progress in containing the Madre fire in San Luis Obispo County, California's largest blaze this year, which has burned over 80,000 acres. Favorable weather and an increase in personnel have helped raise containment to 30%, up from 10% the previous day. The fire, which started Wednesday, has threatened about 50 structures and forced over 200 people to evacuate. The main area of concern is the Carrizo Plain National Monument, home to endangered species, but officials are optimistic about continued progress before a potential midweek heatwave.</p>

          <p>The UK government plans to amend the Employment Rights Bill to grant parents who experience a miscarriage before 24 weeks of pregnancy the legal right to bereavement leave. Currently, this leave is only available for pregnancy loss after 24 weeks. Deputy Prime Minister Angela Rayner stated the change will give people necessary time to grieve without pressure to return to work. The new law will provide at least one week of leave, with the exact duration under consultation, a move widely praised by campaigners and support organizations.</p>

          <p>The UK government has announced a plan to offer early years teachers tax-free payments of £4,500 to attract them to work in nurseries in 20 designated disadvantaged areas. This incentive is part of a £1.5 billion "Best Start in Life" strategy aimed at improving educational standards and narrowing the achievement gap for preschool children. Education Secretary Bridget Phillipson emphasized tackling inequalities early, though critics argue other government policies have financially strained the nursery sector. The plan also includes more frequent inspections for childcare providers.</p>
