          <p>Costco has recalled its Kirkland Signature Prosecco Valdobbiadene, warning that unopened bottles may spontaneously shatter, posing a safety risk. The recall affects products sold between April and August in twelve U.S. states, primarily in the Midwest.

          <p>Lyft's stock surged over 10% following the announcement of a new commercial partnership with Waymo, Alphabet's self-driving technology company. The collaboration will introduce Waymo's autonomous robotaxi service to Nashville starting next year, with vehicles initially available through the Waymo One app and later integrated into the Lyft platform. Under the agreement, Lyft will manage the vehicle fleet's maintenance and depot operations in the city. This deal marks a significant expansion for Waymo and a strategic move for Lyft as it competes with Uber in the evolving ride-hailing market.</p>

          <p>Microsoft announced it has taken control of 338 websites associated with a Nigerian-based cybercrime service known as "Raccoon0365." The operation allegedly provided tools for users to conduct large-scale phishing campaigns, which resulted in the theft of at least 5,000 Microsoft user credentials. Operating through a private Telegram channel, the service allowed criminals to impersonate trusted brands and trick victims into revealing sensitive login information. The takedown was executed following a U.S. District Court order and involved collaboration with Cloudflare and the U.S. Secret Service to disrupt the illicit infrastructure.</p>

          <p>Online ticket marketplace StubHub has priced its initial public offering at $23.50 a share, resulting in a valuation of $8.6 billion and raising $800 million. The pricing fell in the middle of the company's expected range, with shares set to begin trading on the New York Stock Exchange under the ticker "STUB." This public debut follows several delays and marks a significant moment for the company, which was reacquired by co-founder Eric Baker in 2020. The move comes amid a resurgent IPO market that has seen successful debuts from several other tech and finance companies. (not investment advice)</p>

Orforglipron also led to an average weight loss of 9.2%, compared to 5.3% for Rybelsus. Eli Lilly plans to seek regulatory approval for the drug in 2026, positioning it as a strong contender in the growing market for oral GLP-1 treatments.</p>

          <p>Amid a high-interest-rate environment, home equity loans and lines of credit (HELOCs) are presented as relatively affordable borrowing options for homeowners. As of September 15, 2025, average rates for 10-year home equity loans are around 8.38%, while the average HELOC rate is 8.10%, significantly lower than typical personal loan or credit card rates. The article explains the difference between the two products, noting that home equity loans provide a lump sum at a fixed rate, while HELOCs offer a variable-rate line of credit.

          <p>A prominent Chinese government adviser has suggested that Beijing could draw lessons from Germany's 1990 reunification when considering its approach to Taiwan. Speaking at a forum, Professor Zheng Yongnian proposed that mainland China could offer significant economic incentives, such as adopting a favorable currency exchange rate for the New Taiwan dollar, similar to how West Germany handled the East German mark. He also pointed to Germany's "solidarity tax" as a potential model for funding integration and infrastructure.
