          <p>Dr. Fred Ramsdell, a US scientist, learned he had won the Nobel Prize for medicine while on an off-grid hiking trip in Montana, after his wife received numerous text messages. His phone had been on airplane mode, leading to a 20-hour delay in the Nobel Committee reaching him. Dr. Ramsdell, along with two other scientists, was recognized for his research into the immune system's attack on infections. This article highlights the humorous and often challenging process of notifying Nobel laureates.</p>

          <p>Researchers have successfully demonstrated that an enzyme-converted kidney, transplanted into a brain-dead recipient, functioned for at least two days without hyperacute rejection. This breakthrough could significantly improve access to organs and reduce lengthy waiting lists for kidney transplants. The team, led by scientists from the University of British Columbia and West China Hospital, emphasizes the need for more efficient use of the human organ pool.

          <p>Dodgers manager Dave Roberts clarified his decision to not use ace reliever Roki Sasaki earlier in Game 2 of the NLDS, opting for Blake Treinen despite a save situation. The choice was driven by a strategy to manage Sasaki's workload, as he's a converted starter new to bullpen duties and the team wants to preserve him for the postseason. Although the plan nearly backfired, Sasaki is now considered the primary option for future save opportunities, with careful consideration for rest days. This article highlights the team's strategic bullpen management.</p>
