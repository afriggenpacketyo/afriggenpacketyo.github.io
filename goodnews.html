          <h2>Teen Skin Care Craze on TikTok May Be Harmful and Costly, Study Finds</h2>
          <div class="timestamp">2025-06-09 00:01:02 EDT</div>
        </div>
        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>A recent study published in Pediatrics reveals that the teen skin care craze fueled by TikTok content may be harmful and expensive. Researchers analyzed beauty routines from 100 TikTok videos and found an average of 11 potentially irritating active ingredients in the regimens, with many lacking sunscreen. The average routine involved six steps and cost about $168 per month, raising concerns about unrealistic beauty standards and potential skin damage. Experts recommend gentle cleansers, fragrance-free moisturizers, and daily mineral sunscreen for teens, cautioning against anti-aging products and the overuse of active ingredients. The findings highlight the need for open conversations between parents and children about social media messages and the intentions behind purchasing skin care products. The study notes that many of the creators were offering tips relevant to those with lighter complexions, which may exclude the unique skin care considerations of darker complexions while perpetuating harmful ideals of ‚Äúbrighter‚Äù skin associated with whiteness.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>The UK government is proposing an extended ban on bottom trawling, a destructive fishing method, across English waters. The proposal aims to expand the prohibition from 18,000km2 to 30,000km2 of the UK's offshore protected areas. Environment Secretary Steve Reed emphasized the urgency of action to prevent irreversible destruction of the oceans. The announcement coincides with the UN Ocean Conference in France and warnings from Sir David Attenborough about the damage caused by bottom trawling. The plan is subject to a 12-week industry consultation. The extension proposed by the government would cover 41 of the UK's 178 MPAs, and would protect rare marine animals and the delicate seabed they rely upon.</p>
