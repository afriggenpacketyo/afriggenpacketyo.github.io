          <p>Memphis Grizzlies star Ja Morant refuted Stephen A. Smith's claim that NBA players are hesitant to join the Grizzlies due to safety concerns in Memphis. Smith cited concerns from players like Jimmy Butler about the city's safety during a "First Take" segment discussing a potential Grizzlies rebuild. Morant responded on X, dismissing Smith's sources and emphasizing the need to focus on player performances rather than negative narratives about the city. He affirmed his commitment to staying in Memphis, countering the speculation about his future with the team. </p>

          <p>Amazon Web Services (AWS) is set to announce an update to its Graviton4 chip, featuring 600 gigabytes per second of network bandwidth. This chip is a win for the company's custom strategy and puts it up against traditional semiconductor players like Intel and AMD. AWS is investing heavily in reducing AI training costs, aiming to provide an alternative to Nvidia's expensive graphics processing units (GPUs). Anthropic's Claude Opus 4 AI model is trained on Trainium2 GPUs, and Project Rainier is powered by over half a million of these chips, an order that would have traditionally gone to Nvidia. </p>

          <p>James Gunn, co-head of DC Studios, shared his perspective on the current state of the movie industry, attributing the prevalence of bad movies to incomplete screenplays. He emphasized that DC Studios prioritizes finished scripts before beginning production, citing the upcoming DC films "Supergirl," "Lanterns," and "Clayface" as examples of high-quality screenplays. Gunn also addressed rumors about Matt Reeves' sequel to "The Batman," confirming that the film is still in development but has been delayed. He reflected on his past experience of being fired from "Guardians of the Galaxy Vol. 3," stating that it allowed him to focus on creating for himself rather than for others' approval. </p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Members of Parliament in England and Wales have voted to decriminalize abortion for women, marking the biggest change to abortion laws in nearly 60 years. The amendment to the Crime and Policing Bill, put forward by Labour MP Tonia Antoniazzi, passed with a significant majority. While the law will still penalize those who assist a woman in obtaining an abortion outside the legal framework, women who terminate their pregnancies outside the rules will no longer face police investigation. The move was supported by abortion providers and various organizations, while some expressed concerns about the limited protections afforded by the law. </p>

          <p>Reddit shares experienced a rise after the social media company introduced new artificial intelligence-powered advertising tools. The two new features, unveiled during the Cannes Lions festival, are designed to help brands better utilize discussions on the platform. These tools are powered by an engine called Reddit Community Intelligence, which transforms posts and comments into structured intelligence. The new tools are a listening tool called Reddit Insights, which shares real-time insights with marketers to help them identify trends and launch campaigns; and Conversation Summary Add-ons, which allows brands to show "positive" user content under their ads.

          <p>A Senate tax bill proposes a $1,000 baby bonus in "Trump accounts" for children born between January 1, 2024, and December 31, 2028. The federal government would deposit this amount into the account, funded by the Department of the Treasury, as part of a "newborn pilot program." To be eligible, a child must be a U.S. citizen at birth, and both parents must have Social Security numbers. These accounts, similar to 529 college savings plans, offer tax incentives, but some experts find them overly complicated compared to simpler alternatives. (not investment advice)</p>
