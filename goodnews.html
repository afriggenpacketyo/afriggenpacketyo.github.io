          <p>Germany's Alternative f√ºr Deutschland (AfD) has been officially designated as a right-wing extremist party by the country's federal intelligence agency, citing incompatibility with the democratic order due to its ethnicity-based understanding of the German people. The decision, based on a comprehensive review, has sparked controversy, with AfD leaders denouncing it as politically motivated and a blow to German democracy. The intelligence agency highlighted the AfD's discriminatory views towards citizens with a "migration background from predominantly Muslim countries." The classification could have implications for the party's treatment in parliament, including eligibility to chair committees. Optimism score is 65.</p>
