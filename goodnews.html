          <h2>Opinion: The United States' Fixation on 'Beating China' May Be Counterproductive</h2>
          <div class="timestamp">2025-05-01 21:00:13 EDT</div>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>An opinion article argues that the United States' focus on "beating China" lacks a clear alignment of purpose, goal, and means, which is essential for success in any conflict. The article suggests that the Trump administration's approach to China has been chaotic, with even close associates struggling to articulate a coherent strategy. The author contends that fuzzy thinking regarding China is not exclusive to the Trump administration, referencing a Democratic bill from 2020 aimed at promoting trade and consumer protection between the US, Canada, and Mexico. The article suggests the US needs to focus on its own strengths rather than solely trying to undermine China.</p>

          <p>Japan and the United States held their second round of tariff talks, primarily focusing on Japan's proposals to increase imports of American agricultural products. The Japanese delegation aimed to gain further details on U.S. priorities and narrow the scope of the discussions. Japan is considering expanding tariff-free imports of U.S.-grown rice and simplifying the screening process for imported cars. The Trump administration is prioritizing tariff deals with India, Japan, and South Korea to gain an advantage over China in the Indo-Pacific region.</p>

Trump announced Rubio's newest position in a social media post. The proliferation of titles raises questions about Rubio's ability to effectively manage all these responsibilities, particularly under a president known for unconventional governance.

          <p>Former National Security Advisor John Bolton discusses his views on President Trump's second term, emphasizing its incoherence and focus on retribution. Bolton suggests Trump lacks a coherent philosophy or grand strategy, primarily motivated by a desire to be the center of attention. While acknowledging the concerning nature of some of Trump's actions, such as targeting individuals for prosecution, Bolton doesn't believe Trump poses an existential threat to American institutions. He anticipates that many of the administration's efforts will ultimately fail due to checks and balances within the system.</p>

          <p>As birth rates decline, more couples are consciously choosing a life without children, citing various reasons ranging from financial considerations and climate change concerns to career priorities and a simple lack of desire for parenthood. Amy Blackstone, a sociology professor, highlights the differing values between child-free individuals and parents, with the former prioritizing their relationship with their partner and the latter valuing the imagined relationship with a child. While most are confident in their decision, some acknowledge occasional uncertainties about the future, particularly regarding family traditions and holidays.</p>

          <p>Venmo is gaining ground in the peer-to-peer payment market while Cash App is facing challenges. PayPal, the parent company of Venmo, reported strong quarterly results, with Venmo revenue increasing by 20%.

Conversely, Block, the parent company of Cash App, experienced a decline in revenue and issued disappointing guidance. PayPal's CEO is focused on monetizing Venmo as a key component of the company's turnaround strategy.</p>

          <p>Santa Cruz, California, has implemented a "soda tax" on sugar-sweetened beverages, defying a statewide ban that prohibits local governments from imposing such taxes until 2031. The tax adds 2 cents per ounce to nonalcoholic beverages with added sweeteners and a high calorie count. The city council framed the campaign as a battle against the American Beverage Association, which resonated with voters. The American Beverage Association criticized the tax as a violation of the statewide ban and an unfair burden on working families. The tax does not apply to certain beverages, such as those intended for medical use or 100% natural fruit juice.</p>
