          <p>A 19-year-old Australian surfer who went missing has been rescued after spending a night on an uninhabited island miles from the coast. The teenager, Darcy Deefholts, had gone surfing off Wooli and was reported missing when he failed to return home. A large-scale search operation located him the next day on North Solitary Island, approximately seven miles offshore. His father described the successful rescue as a "one in a million miracle," and the surfer is now receiving medical attention after his ordeal.</p>

          <p>More than 30 construction workers were safely rescued after a partial collapse in a 7-mile-long industrial tunnel being built under Los Angeles. The workers were approximately 400 feet underground when the cave-in occurred, trapping them between the collapse and the tunnel's end. They managed to climb over the debris to a tunnel boring machine and were then transported to safety with no major injuries reported. Los Angeles Mayor Karen Bass praised the first responders and the workers' composure during the incident, which is now under investigation.</p>

          <p>The Democratic Republic of Congo is experiencing a period of hope, driven by both footballing success and a potential peace deal with neighboring Rwanda. The men's national football team is on the verge of qualifying for its first World Cup since 1974, which could bring significant investment and visibility to the nation. A recent peace agreement aims to end decades of conflict in the country's eastern region, which has claimed millions of lives and hindered development. Analysts believe that stability, combined with World Cup qualification, could unlock the nation's potential and provide positive alternatives for its youth.</p>

          <p>A journalist shares a personal experience of taking his neurodivergent son to his first professional soccer game, a Club World Cup semi-final between Chelsea and Fluminense. Initially overwhelmed by the loud noises and excessive spectacle of the event, his son had a negative reaction. However, the kindness of two stadium employees, who provided noise-canceling headphones and moved the family to a quieter area, transformed the experience. The article reflects on how this act of human empathy shone through the commercialism, offering a reminder of the personal connections that underpin even the most corporatized sporting events.</p>

          <p>Owen Farrell has been selected for the bench for the British and Irish Lions' final tour match before their Test series against Australia. This marks a potential return to Test rugby for Farrell, who has been absent for over two months due to a concussion and previously stepped away from international duty. The match against the AUNZ Invitational side will also feature Ben White starting at scrum-half and Hugo Keenan at full-back, providing them a crucial opportunity to impress. The final team selection for the Test series is expected to be similar to the one that recently defeated the Brumbies.</p>

          <p>The tourism board of the Faroe Islands has launched a unique travel initiative featuring 30 self-guided road trips where the destinations are kept secret from the travelers. The "Auto Odyssey" tours, accessible by phone, guide visitors to lesser-known villages, restaurants, and scenic spots, with each stop revealed one by one. The goal is to encourage exploration beyond popular tourist sites and provide a more unpredictable and personal experience with nature. To participate, travelers must commit to following the entire designated route, which ensures that different groups do not arrive at the same location simultaneously.</p>

          <p>The UK and French governments are reportedly close to a new agreement aimed at deterring illegal small boat crossings over the English Channel. The proposed deal would involve France taking back some migrants who cross, while the UK would accept an equivalent number of asylum seekers from France who have a legitimate claim. A pilot scheme is expected to involve returning about 50 migrants per week. While the Starmer government hopes this will act as a deterrent, critics argue the initial scale is too small to have a significant impact on the overall numbers.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Researchers at Johns Hopkins University have developed a robot that successfully performed a realistic gallbladder removal surgery with 100% accuracy. The machine, which uses a machine learning architecture similar to ChatGPT, was trained on videos of human surgeries and was able to adapt to unexpected scenarios and voice commands. This represents a significant advance from previous robotic surgeries, moving from pre-programmed tasks to a system that can understand and autonomously execute complex procedures. While the robot was slower than a human, its performance was comparable to an expert surgeon, marking a major step toward clinically viable autonomous surgery.</p>

          <p>A former official from China's central bank has argued that the yuan possesses the qualities to become a safe-haven currency, citing the country's low inflation, large foreign reserves, and commitment to stability. The analysis, published in the Hong Kong International Finance Review, suggests the yuan has already shown resilience during recent periods of global stress, such as the Ukraine war and shocks from U.S. tariffs. This perspective contributes to the ongoing debate about the internationalization of the yuan, especially as confidence in the U.S. dollar is tested by debt risks and protectionist policies.

        </div>
        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Vienna is often cited as a model for successful housing policy, largely due to its extensive and stable social-housing stock, which accounts for 43% of its homes. This system, which caters to a wide range of income levels, results in significantly lower rent prices and helps moderate costs in the private market as well. The foundation for this was laid in the 1920s and is maintained today through political commitment and a levy on employee salaries. While not without challenges, such as a complex allocation system, Vienna's approach demonstrates that long-term political will can prioritize housing as a basic need.</p>
