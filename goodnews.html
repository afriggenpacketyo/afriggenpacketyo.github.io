          <p>Circle Internet Group, a stablecoin issuer, witnessed its shares skyrocket by 168% during its NYSE debut after an IPO priced well above expectations. The company, which raised nearly $1.1 billion, opened at $69 and reached a high of $103.75, reflecting strong investor interest in the crypto sector. Circle's CEO, Jeremy Allaire, emphasized the company's commitment to regulatory compliance and its role in mainstreaming crypto. This successful IPO marks Circle's second attempt at going public and underscores the growing political favor and potential trillion-dollar market opportunity within the stablecoin sector (not investment advice).</p>

          <p>Aaron Rodgers is reportedly ending his time away from football by signing a one-year contract with the Pittsburgh Steelers. The 41-year-old quarterback had previously parted ways with the New York Jets and expressed uncertainty about continuing his career. Rodgers' decision follows speculation and irritation from Steelers figures, including Terry Bradshaw. While Rodgers brings experience and talent, the Steelers will be getting a player past his prime, with his recent performance with the Jets being less than stellar.</p>

Transferring data from the original Switch is relatively simple, and the console is largely backward compatible.

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>A California appeals court has ruled that holding a cellphone while driving is illegal, even when using it for navigation. The court stated that the state law prohibiting texting or talking on a cellphone while driving also makes it illegal to hold a phone to view a map on the screen. The decision aims to reduce distracted driving and encourage drivers to keep their eyes on the road. Mounted phones and single-swipe operations are exempted, but simply looking at a map while holding the phone constitutes a violation.</p>
