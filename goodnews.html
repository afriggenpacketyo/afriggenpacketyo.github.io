          <p>The U.S. Federal Communications Commission has approved the $8 billion merger between Skydance Media and Paramount Global, a major step toward finalizing the deal. This approval allows for the transfer of 28 CBS television station licenses to the new entity. The deal moved forward after Paramount settled a legal dispute with Donald Trump and Skydance committed to changes at CBS, including promises of unbiased journalism and ending diversity initiatives. The merger combines Skydance's modern studio with Paramount's historic media assets, including Paramount Pictures, CBS, and various cable networks.</p>

          <p>Donald Trump is undertaking a five-day trip to Scotland, where he will visit his golf resorts and meet with British Prime Minister Keir Starmer and Scottish First Minister John Swinney. A key topic for discussion is the U.S.-U.K. trade agreement, with plans to refine the "Economic Prosperity Deal" signed in June. The visit also holds personal significance for Trump, whose mother was Scottish, and he is expected to visit a memorial at his Aberdeen resort. Police in Scotland have implemented significant security measures in anticipation of protests during his stay.</p>

          <div class="timestamp">2025-07-25 06:36:24 EDT</div>
        </div>
        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Lawmakers in Maui have advanced a bill to phase out thousands of short-term vacation rentals to increase the supply of long-term housing for local residents. The measure aims to address a critical housing shortage that was severely worsened by the 2023 Lahaina wildfire. If passed, the bill would require many condo owners in apartment zones to rent their units for a minimum of 180 days. While supporters believe this will provide much-needed homes for locals, opponents argue it could harm the local economy and small businesses that service the tourism industry.</p>

          <p>Major League Soccer club Los Angeles FC has formally expressed its interest in signing Tottenham Hotspur's captain, Son Heung-min. While no official bid has been made, one is expected from the American club, which previously signed former Spurs captain Hugo Lloris. Son, who has one year remaining on his contract, faces an uncertain future at Tottenham, with the new manager not guaranteeing his stay or captaincy. The potential move would be a significant development for both the player, a club legend, and the two leagues involved in the transfer discussions.</p>

          <p>Premier League club Newcastle United is reportedly considering a transfer for RB Leipzig striker Benjamin Sesko as a potential replacement for Alexander Isak. Isak's future at the club is uncertain amid interest from Liverpool, and he did not travel with the team for their pre-season tour. Sesko, a 22-year-old Slovenian international, has also attracted interest from other top clubs like Arsenal and Chelsea. The potential move highlights Newcastle's need to secure their attacking options as they prepare for a season that includes Champions League competition, amid off-field executive changes at the club.</p>

          <div class="timestamp">2025-07-25 06:00:56 EDT</div>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Major League Soccer is experiencing a significant decline in home-field advantage, with home teams now winning at a rate comparable to top European leagues. For years, MLS home teams won around 60% of matches, an outlier attributed to grueling travel across time zones and other unique conditions. The current win rate has dropped to the mid-40s, suggesting the league is maturing. This shift is credited to improved travel logistics, better sports science, more consistent refereeing with VAR, and more sophisticated tactical approaches from visiting teams, indicating a more balanced and globally competitive league.</p>

          <h2>Study Finds People Prefer Extroverted Robots But Find Neurotic Ones More Relatable</h2>
          <div class="timestamp">2025-07-25 06:00:00 EDT</div>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>A recent study from the University of Chicago explored human reactions to robots with different personalities, finding that people generally enjoy interacting with extroverted robots the most. However, the experiment also revealed that a robot programmed with a neurotic personality was perceived as more human-like and relatable. Participants described the neurotic bot, which expressed anxiety and tentativeness, as seeming to understand deep emotions. While most robotics research has focused on positive, confident traits for service roles, this study suggests that neuroticism could be useful in specific applications, like for a robot comedian.</p>

          <h2>Amid Industry Struggles, Strategic Value of IP and Libraries Drives Movie Studio Acquisitions</h2>
          <div class="timestamp">2025-07-25 06:00:00 EDT</div>
        </div>
        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Despite a struggling box office and an uncertain streaming market, interest in acquiring movie studios remains high, as evidenced by the pending Skydance-Paramount deal and other potential mergers. The primary driver for these acquisitions is the long-term strategic value of a studio's intellectual property (IP) and film library. Owning a collection of well-known films provides opportunities for sequels, reboots, and spinoffs, as well as lucrative revenue streams from merchandise and licensing. This focus on IP as a key to a broader entertainment ecosystem makes studios an attractive, if challenging, investment.</p>

          <h2>Researchers Question Claims of "Scheming" AI, Citing Flawed Evidence and Bias</h2>
          <div class="timestamp">2025-07-25 06:00:00 EDT</div>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>A new paper from Oxford researchers challenges recent claims that AI models are capable of "scheming" or deceiving humans. The authors argue that such claims are often based on cherry-picked anecdotes and a tendency to over-attribute human-like intentions to AI behavior in contrived experimental settings. Drawing a parallel to flawed 1970s research on ape language, they call for more rigorous analysis to distinguish between an AI's *capability* to perform a malicious act and an inherent *propensity* to do so. The paper urges caution in interpreting AI behavior to avoid a biased "groupthink" on AI risks.</p>

          <p>Today's top Tour de France cyclists are achieving speeds and power outputs that surpass even those from the sport's notorious doping era, but they are doing so cleanly. This new level of human performance is attributed to a virtuous cycle of sports science and technological advancement. Riders now meticulously track data like power-to-weight ratios, use advanced aerodynamic equipment, and follow highly calibrated nutrition and fueling strategies. This "marginal gains" philosophy, which optimizes every aspect of performance, has allowed athletes to reach unprecedented levels, marking a positive evolution for the sport.</p>

          <p>Three miners have been successfully rescued after being trapped for two days following a mine collapse in northern British Columbia, Canada. The workers were caught behind a large pile of debris at the Red Chris mine but were able to shelter in an underground refuge chamber equipped with food, water, and ventilation. The mine operator, Newmont, confirmed the men were safe and in good health upon their rescue Thursday night. Production at the copper and gold mine was suspended during the rescue operation, and a full investigation into the collapse will be conducted.</p>

          <p>The United States and Mexico have signed a new memorandum of understanding to tackle the decades-long problem of sewage from the Tijuana River polluting Southern California's beaches. The agreement outlines a specific timetable for infrastructure projects through 2027, with Mexico committing to its $93 million funding allocation. The accord aims to finally resolve the crisis, which has caused persistent beach closures and health issues. U.S. EPA Administrator Lee Zeldin praised the new Mexican administration's commitment, calling the agreement a major environmental and national security win.</p>
