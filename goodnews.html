          <p>Quaker, a 15-year-old military horse, has retired after being injured during a chaotic incident in London where five horses bolted after being startled by construction. The incident, captured on video, showed the horses smashing into vehicles and causing injuries to service personnel. Quaker sustained bleeding and a small break, while his rider broke his back but has since recovered. The other four horses have returned to duty, but it was decided that Quaker's welfare would be better served in retirement at the Horse Trust sanctuary, where he can enjoy a peaceful life. The sanctuary cares for former military horses, offering respite and permanent homes. The score reflects the positive outcome of Quaker's retirement after a traumatic event. </p>

          <p>AstraZeneca has reached an agreement with the Trump administration to lower drug prices and avoid tariffs through a “most-favored-nation” drug-pricing model. The company will offer discounts on some medicines to the government's Medicaid health plan in exchange for tariff relief, similar to a deal with Pfizer. This agreement aims to lower prescription medicine prices in the US, where they are significantly higher than in other developed nations. While Trump claims this could cut prices by up to 1,000%, experts suggest the actual savings for Medicaid may be modest. This deal is a step toward lowering drug costs, but its overall impact remains uncertain. </p>

The change reflects the transition from Queen Elizabeth II's reign and aims to celebrate British heritage while maintaining passport security. </p>

          <p>Maine Democratic Governor Janet Mills appeared to prematurely announce her campaign for the Senate in a since-deleted social media post. The video targeted incumbent Senator Susan Collins, a moderate Republican, accusing her of selling out Maine to special interests. Mills is seen as the favored candidate by Senate Minority Leader Chuck Schumer, but faces a potentially competitive primary against multiple contenders, including Graham Platner, who is backed by Senator Bernie Sanders. The situation suggests a potentially divisive primary race and highlights the challenges in unseating Collins, who has a history of winning re-elections by comfortable margins. </p>
