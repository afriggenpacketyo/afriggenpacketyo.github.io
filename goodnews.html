          <p>Jamaican sprinter Kishane Thompson achieved a victory over Olympic champion Noah Lyles in their first 100-meter race since the Paris Olympics. The head-to-head contest took place at the Silesia Diamond League meeting in Poland. Thompson finished with a meet-record time of 9.87 seconds, narrowly beating Lyles, who clocked in at 9.90 seconds. The race was a notable rematch after Lyles won the Olympic gold by a mere five-thousandths of a second over Thompson a year prior, adding a layer of competitive revenge to the event.</p>

          <p>A 46-year-old man was rescued via helicopter after being trapped for two days behind a powerful waterfall in a remote area of California. The man, Ryan Wardwell, had been rappelling down the Seven Teacups waterfalls when the force of the water pushed him off his lines and trapped him. A search was initiated after he failed to return to his car, and a dive team eventually located him using a drone. He was hoisted to safety by a California Highway Patrol helicopter and treated for minor injuries and dehydration before being reunited with his family.</p>

          <p>A prominent academician at the Chinese Academy of Sciences is urging China to accelerate its development of space-based solar power technology to secure a leading role in the new energy sector. The technology involves large facilities in orbit that collect solar energy, convert it to electricity, and transmit it to Earth via microwaves. Unlike ground-based solar, space stations are unaffected by weather or nighttime, offering a continuous and more intense energy source. The call for a top-down strategy aims to close the technological gap with the United States and overcome the limitations of current university-led research efforts.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>A parenting philosophy known as the 'Lighthouse Parent' is being promoted as an alternative to the exhausting and potentially damaging trend of intensive parenting. This approach encourages parents to act as a steady, reliable guide for their children, providing safety and illumination when needed without controlling every aspect of their journey. Experts argue that while parents are biologically wired to prevent their children's suffering, allowing them to struggle and solve their own problems fosters greater confidence and resilience. The concept emphasizes being a supportive beacon rather than a constant supervisor, benefiting both the child and the parent.</p>

          <p>Devon and Cornwall Police have seized £180,000 from controversial influencer Andrew Tate, which was a deposit he placed on an Aston Martin Valhalla supercar in 2021. A London court heard that the funds were determined to be the proceeds of tax evasion and money laundering. This forfeiture is in addition to £2.7 million previously seized from Tate and his brother by the same police force for failure to pay taxes on business revenues. The seized funds will be reinvested into crime prevention and victim support initiatives within the Devon and Cornwall communities.</p>

          <p>A program called Dec My Dorm is helping students transitioning from the foster care system to college by providing them with essential dorm room supplies. Many of these students arrive on campus with minimal belongings, unaware of the need for items like bedding, towels, lamps, and even basic cleaning supplies. The initiative, which began after a former foster youth described arriving at UC Berkeley with only a trash bag, allows students to select their own items to personalize their new living space. The program aims to level the playing field, helping these students feel prepared and equal to their peers.</p>

          <p>Sadie Salazar, a therapist and COO, emphasizes the importance of a consistent morning ritual to manage anxiety and ensure a successful day. Her one non-negotiable rule is to wake up when her alarm goes off, no matter what, to create protected time for herself before work and family duties begin. Instead of a rigid routine, she uses this extra hour for flexible, rejuvenating activities like reading, listening to a podcast, or walking her dog. This approach allows her to start the day with a sense of creativity and calm, rather than feeling rushed or like she has already failed at a task.</p>

          <p>The Prince and Princess of Wales are set to move to a new residence, the eight-bedroom Forest Lodge, located in Windsor Great Park. This move places them in a larger home but still in close proximity to their children's school and their current residence, Adelaide Cottage. The relocation comes after the royal couple moved from Kensington Palace to Windsor in 2022. The new home, nestled within the 4,800-acre park, aligns with Princess Catherine's belief in the healing power of nature, which she has spoken about during her recent cancer treatment.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>A new U.S. Census Bureau paper reveals that young adults aged 25 to 34 are achieving traditional life milestones at a significantly lower rate than previous generations. These milestones include moving out of a parent's home, securing a job, getting married, and having a child. Researchers attribute this shift to increased economic barriers, such as the rising cost of living, and changing societal attitudes toward family formation. The study notes that economic stability and educational attainment are now often prioritized over marriage, which is increasingly viewed as a capstone to adulthood rather than a foundational step.</p>

Starmer emphasized that any path to peace must involve Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky and welcomed the U.S. commitment to providing robust security guarantees for Ukraine as part of any potential deal.

          <p>Samsung is gaining ground on Apple in the U.S. smartphone market, with its market share surging from 23% to 31% in the second quarter, while Apple's declined from 56% to 49%. This shift is partly attributed to Samsung's innovative foldable phones, like the Z Fold and Z Flip, which offer a new form factor compared to the traditional smartphone slate. While Apple remains the market leader, Samsung's wider range of products at various price points and its experimentation with new designs are creating renewed competition. Apple is expected to respond with a slimmer iPhone model and potentially its own foldable device by 2026.</p>

Jamie Rothwell, who used the encrypted EncroChat network to manage his criminal enterprise from a Barcelona apartment, shared a photo of himself that allowed detectives to identify him. The breakthrough came after law enforcement agencies hacked the supposedly secure network, gaining access to communications from thousands of criminals. The messages exposed Rothwell's role in trafficking AK-47s and orchestrating a gangland shooting, ultimately leading to his arrest and extradition.</p>

          <p>According to Columbia-trained psychologist Becky Kennedy, building emotional endurance—the ability to withstand stress without being overtaken by negative feelings—is a learnable skill. She recommends three powerful steps: using a visual aid to understand that struggle is part of the learning process, engaging in positive self-talk to reframe difficult situations, and undertaking small, manageable experiments that push you out of your comfort zone. These practices help train the mind and body to tolerate discomfort, which in turn builds resilience and confidence to tackle larger challenges in all areas of life.</p>

The data also shows that those who do drink are consuming less and are increasingly concerned about the health impacts of alcohol. This trend coincides with a growing scientific consensus that no level of alcohol consumption is safe, linking it to increased risks of cancer and other diseases. The decline is even more pronounced among underage individuals, with reported drinking by high school seniors dropping significantly over the past two decades.</p>
