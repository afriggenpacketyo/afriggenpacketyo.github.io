          <p>The German city of Cologne conducted a large-scale evacuation of approximately 20,500 residents from its city center to allow experts to safely defuse three unexploded World War II bombs discovered in a shipyard. The operation, described as the city's largest since the end of the war, involved sealing off a zone within a 1,000-meter radius, affecting homes, businesses, cultural institutions, and transport infrastructure. Authorities took measures to ensure residents complied with the evacuation order, providing drop-in centers for those without alternative accommodation, while Cologne Bonn Airport maintained normal flight operations despite potential travel disruptions. The successful defusal of these bombs underscores the persistent dangers posed by remnants of past conflicts. Optimism is present as the people of Cologne are safe from immediate danger.</p>
