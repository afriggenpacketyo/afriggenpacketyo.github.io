          <p>President Trump announced that Fox News host Jeanine Pirro would replace Ed Martin as interim U.S. Attorney for the District of Columbia after Martin's nomination faced Senate opposition. Pirro, a former judge and district attorney, has been a vocal supporter of Trump and defended him during various investigations. Her appointment resolves a dilemma for the president, who needed a successor before Martin's term expired on May 20. Pirro's history includes repeating false statements about voter fraud in the 2020 election, which was part of a lawsuit against Fox News, but she also has a long-standing relationship with Trump and has been a staunch defender of his political career.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>The Camogie Association is facing increasing pressure to allow players the choice between skorts and shorts, with former All-Star Jane Adams calling the enforced skort rule "sexism." County and club teams have been advocating for the change, citing discomfort and player welfare concerns, with a recent survey showing that 70% of players experience discomfort wearing skorts. The Camogie Association has scheduled a Special Congress for May 22 to vote on the issue, however Elen McIntosh, captain of Ballycastle's senior camogie team, believes there are bigger issues facing women's sports, such as access to facilities, funding and media coverage. Some players have even threatened to forfeit matches if forced to wear skorts.</p>

          <p>The Kooks and Hard-Fi, prominent bands from the 2000s indie boom, are experiencing a resurgence in popularity, driven by TikTok and a renewed interest in anthemic guitar music. Luke Pritchard of The Kooks and Richard Archer of Hard-Fi discuss the changes in the music industry, including the decline of grassroots venues and the shift from album sales to streaming. Both bands recall the grind of early tours and the challenges of promoting music in an era with fewer opportunities for exposure. Despite the difficulties, they express gratitude for their enduring fan base and the chance to create music that resonates with new audiences.</p>

          <p>Chris Mason of the BBC discusses the new trade deal between the UK and the US, noting that while it is a positive development, it is also limited in scope. The deal primarily mitigates recent tariff increases rather than representing a deep and broad free trade agreement. Sir Keir Starmer acknowledges that the trading conditions may not be better than they were six months ago but argues that the focus should be on the very recent past. The agreement avoids issues like the NHS and food standards but leaves a 10% tariff in place on most UK products.</p>
