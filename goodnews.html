          <p>The last of ten inmates who escaped from a New Orleans jail in May, Derrick Groves, has been apprehended in Atlanta following a brief standoff. Authorities located the convicted murderer after receiving tips, leading to a multi-hour operation where gas was used to force him from a crawl space he had created in a residence. The escape was described as a major breach of public safety, and Groves' capture concludes a massive, months-long manhunt involving multiple law enforcement agencies. Over a dozen individuals have also been arrested for allegedly aiding the escapees.</p>

          <div class="timestamp">2025-10-08 15:21:04 EDT</div>
        </div>
        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>For homeowners seeking to borrow money, a Home Equity Line of Credit (HELOC) is a substantially more affordable option than a credit card this month. The average credit card interest rate currently stands at 22.25%, whereas the median HELOC rate is just 7.89%, making credit cards over 180% more expensive. While both have variable rates that may decrease with future Federal Reserve cuts, the significant starting gap means HELOCs will remain the cheaper choice. Additionally, interest paid on a HELOC may be tax-deductible if used for qualifying home improvement projects. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>England's captain, Harry Kane, will miss the upcoming friendly match against Wales because of a minor injury sustained during a recent game with his club, Bayern Munich. The 32-year-old striker took a kick to his ankle and sat out of training as a precaution. Manager Thomas Tuchel expressed hope that Kane, England's all-time leading goalscorer, will recover in time for the World Cup qualifier against Latvia next week. In his absence, the captaincy will be given to one of Jordan Henderson, John Stones, or Declan Rice for the match at Wembley.</p>

          <p>Minutes from the Federal Reserve's September meeting show that officials were nearly unanimous in their decision to lower interest rates but were split on how many more cuts would be needed in 2025. The summary indicated a slight majority favored two additional quarter-point cuts by year-end, reflecting concerns about a weakening labor market. However, a range of views was expressed, with some participants advocating for a more aggressive easing path while others urged a more cautious approach. The discussion highlights a shift in the central bank's focus toward balancing downside risks to employment against inflation concerns. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>In a major policy announcement, UK Conservative Party leader Kemi Badenoch declared that a future Conservative government would abolish stamp duty on the purchase of primary residences. The surprise pledge, made at the party's conference, is aimed at improving housing affordability and boosting social mobility. The plan would keep the tax in place for additional properties and those purchased by companies or non-UK residents. The party estimates the move would cost the Treasury £9 billion annually, which it claims will be funded by previously announced savings from welfare, foreign aid, and civil service cuts.</p>

          <p>Priscilla has been downgraded from a hurricane to a tropical storm as it moves off the Pacific coast of Mexico. The storm is currently bringing high surf and gusty winds to the Baja California Sur peninsula, where a tropical storm watch remains in effect. According to the National Hurricane Center, Priscilla's maximum sustained winds have decreased to 70 mph, just below the Category 1 hurricane threshold. The storm is forecast to continue weakening over the next 48 hours as it travels parallel to the coast, though it will still generate life-threatening surf and rip currents.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>With the Federal Reserve expected to continue cutting interest rates through the end of 2025, financial experts suggest that savers should act now to secure favorable rates on certificates of deposit (CDs). While the 6-7% rates of recent years are gone, short-term CDs still offer competitive returns, with some six-month terms yielding around 4.30%. These rates are significantly higher than traditional savings accounts and provide a hedge against future rate declines. Savers are encouraged to explore online banks, which typically offer more profitable rates than traditional brick-and-mortar institutions. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>Despite gold prices surging past a record $4,000 per ounce, some top financial advisors are cautioning investors that stocks remain a superior long-term investment. They argue that while gold can perform well during periods of economic turmoil, its returns are not as reliable as equities over extended periods. Historical data shows the S&P 500 has provided a higher annualized return over the past 30 years compared to gold. Advisors emphasize that equities generate earnings and pay dividends, which compound over time to create more substantial wealth. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>Manchester United co-owner Sir Jim Ratcliffe has publicly backed manager Ruben Amorim, stating that the coach needs three years to prove himself despite a difficult start at the club. United finished 15th last season and have already suffered three league losses this term, leading to speculation about Amorim's job security. Ratcliffe dismissed this as media-driven "knee-jerk reactions," emphasizing that he controls major football decisions and will not be swayed by external pressure. He also defended cost-cutting measures at the club, arguing that profitability is essential for long-term, sustainable success on the field.</p>

        </div>
        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>A single-purpose reverse mortgage is a lesser-known financial product that allows homeowners aged 62 and older to borrow against their home equity for one specific, lender-approved expense, such as property taxes or essential home repairs. Unlike more common reverse mortgages like HECMs, these loans are often offered by state or local agencies to lower-income seniors and typically have lower costs and fees. Borrowers make no monthly payments, and the loan is repaid when the homeowner sells the property or moves out. However, their availability is limited and funds can only be used for the designated purpose.</p>
