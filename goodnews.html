          <p>The U.S. Justice Department has announced the shutdown of four major dark web sites dedicated to child sexual abuse material as part of an investigation dubbed "Operation Grayskull." The operation has led to the conviction of at least 18 individuals who led or utilized the network, which had over 120,000 members and housed millions of illicit files. Officials described the investigation as one of the most successful of its kind, dismantling a sophisticated and sadistic online community and bringing key figures, including one of the world's most significant purveyors of such material, to justice.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Authorities in Shenzhen, China's tech hub, have implemented new rules mandating leniency for innovators whose government-funded projects fail to meet their goals. The policy states that if mistakes are made without misconduct or abuse of power, and reasonable corrective actions are taken, researchers and their institutions should not be punished or hindered from future funding applications. This move is designed to encourage bold exploration in uncharted scientific and technological territories by removing the fear of failure for projects that stall due to technical difficulties or market shifts.</p>

Suzuki, the first Japanese player to be enshrined, fell just one vote short of a unanimous selection, a fact he humorously noted in his speech. He was joined by dominant pitcher CC Sabathia, who won a Cy Young Award and a World Series with the Yankees, and elite relief pitcher Billy Wagner, who was elected in his final year of eligibility.

          <p>Five Eastern Caribbean nations are experiencing a surge in demand for their "citizenship by investment" programs, which offer a passport with the purchase of real estate. For as little as $200,000, buyers can gain a passport providing visa-free access to around 150 countries, with US citizens reportedly making up the majority of recent applicants. Experts suggest that political and social volatility in the U.S. is fueling the trend, as wealthy individuals seek a "plan B" passport, though the programs face scrutiny from the EU over security concerns.</p>

          <p>The United States and the European Union have reached a significant trade agreement, establishing a baseline 15% tariff on most EU goods and preventing a threatened 30% rate. The deal, announced after a meeting between Donald Trump and Ursula von der Leyen, also includes commitments for the EU to purchase hundreds of billions in US energy and invest heavily in the American economy. While averting a wider trade conflict, the agreement maintains a 50% tariff on steel and represents a compromise for the EU, which had initially hoped for lower rates. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>Archaeological discoveries at the Keeladi site in Tamil Nadu, India, have ignited a fierce debate over the subcontinent's early history and become a symbol of state pride. Artifacts dating back to 580 BCE suggest a literate, urban society in southern India that was contemporaneous with civilizations in the north, challenging long-held narratives of a north-to-south cultural flow. The findings have become politicized, with Tamil leaders accusing the federal government of suppressing the site's importance, reflecting a deep-rooted cultural and political divide within India.</p>
