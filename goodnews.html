          <p>Google is revamping its internal learning platform, Grow, to concentrate on teaching employees how to utilize modern artificial intelligence tools in their daily routines. The platform, previously offering diverse courses, now primarily features AI-related training. This shift underscores the urgency among companies to equip their workforce with AI skills amid the generative AI boom spurred by OpenAI's ChatGPT. The overhaul reflects Google's strategic pivot towards AI and streamlining operations to maintain its competitive edge in search technology, while some employees express concern that the company is prioritizing programs directly contributing to the bottom line. </p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>This article discusses the importance of maintaining clean hummingbird feeders to prevent harm or death to the birds. While hummingbird feeders can provide a supplementary food source, especially when natural wildflowers are scarce, dirty feeders can harbor harmful microbes that cause infections in hummingbirds. These infections, such as candida, can lead to swollen tongues and difficulty feeding, potentially causing starvation. The solution involves regularly cleaning feeders every two to three days with hot water or a vinegar and water solution, and refilling them with a mixture of one part refined white sugar to four parts water, avoiding red food coloring and distilled water. </p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>The Food and Drug Administration (FDA) plans to implement artificial intelligence (AI) in its drug approval processes to "radically increase efficiency," particularly in light of a Trump-driven reduction of nearly 2,000 employees. Agency officials view AI as a means to expedite the delivery of drugs to the market, potentially streamlining regulatory reviews and decision-making. This move reflects a broader trend of government agencies adopting AI technologies to improve operations and address workforce challenges. The FDA's initiative could have significant implications for the pharmaceutical industry, potentially accelerating the development and availability of new treatments. </p>

          <p>BlackRock's $3.2 billion acquisition of Preqin, an alternative asset data provider, is viewed by CEO Larry Fink as potentially the most consequential deal for expanding the firm's presence in private markets. Preqin's data integration into BlackRock platforms like Aladdin and eFront aims to bring transparency to private markets, similar to what Zillow did for housing, by providing valuation and performance data on numerous funds and managers. This move could diversify BlackRock's revenue streams beyond the volatility of the stock market and allow the creation of private-market benchmarks. While Moody's warns of potential risks in offering private market investments to retail investors, BlackRock aims to innovate and make these markets more accessible and less risky.
