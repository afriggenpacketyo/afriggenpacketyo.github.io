          <p>Inspiring stories of altruism feature a man who became a rare double living organ donor and a teenager who invented a product to help others with her condition. After donating a kidney to a stranger, Brian Flynn also donated part of his liver to a 4-year-old boy, finding profound meaning in saving lives. Separately, teen Rachel Bee, diagnosed with Crohn's disease, created the 'Infusion Hero' sweatshirt with zippered sleeves to provide warmth and comfort to patients during IV treatments. Both individuals have turned personal challenges into impactful ways of helping their communities and finding purpose through their actions.</p>

          <h2>UK Regulator Suggests YouTube Should Prioritize Public Service Media Content</h2>
          <div class="timestamp">2025-07-21 12:11:00 EDT</div>
        </div>
        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>UK media regulator Ofcom has proposed that YouTube should give greater prominence to content from public service broadcasters like the BBC and Channel 4. The recommendation comes amid concerns that the future of public service media is at risk, as younger audiences increasingly favor platforms like YouTube over traditional television. Ofcom's report suggests broadcasters must urgently collaborate with YouTube to ensure their content, especially news and children's programming, is easily discoverable. The regulator also raised the possibility of new government legislation to enforce this prominence, aiming to preserve the role of trusted, UK-made content in the digital age.</p>

          <p>Shares of CoreWeave, a prominent renter of artificial intelligence data centers, climbed over 5% after the company announced its intention to sell $1.5 billion in bonds. The capital raised from the notes, which are due in 2031, will be allocated for general corporate purposes, including the repayment of existing debt. This move follows a successful $2 billion debt offering in May and a recent announcement of a $6 billion AI data center project in Pennsylvania. CoreWeave, which counts Nvidia and Microsoft among its major clients, has seen its stock price more than triple since its public debut. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>Jim Cramer's Charitable Trust is actively adjusting its portfolio by trimming its positions in Abbott Laboratories, Danaher, and Eaton while increasing its stakes in Cisco Systems and TJX Companies. The sales are motivated by a disappointing outlook for Abbott's diagnostics business in China and a desire to protect against similar headwinds for Danaher. The Eaton sale aims to lock in profits after a recent stock rally. Proceeds are being reinvested into Cisco to gain more exposure to AI infrastructure and into the off-price retailer TJX, which is seen as well-positioned to attract value-conscious consumers.

          <p>An international team of divers has discovered the wreckage of HMS Nottingham, a Royal Navy warship sunk by a German submarine during World War One. The ship was found 60 miles off the coast of Scotland at a depth of 82 meters, solving a 109-year-old mystery. The vessel was torpedoed on August 19, 1916, resulting in the deaths of 38 crew members, though 377 others were rescued. The diving team, ProjectXplore, positively identified the ship through its dimensions, equipment, and an embossed name stamp on the stern, bringing closure to a long-unsolved chapter of naval history.</p>

          <p>The All England Club's ambitious plans to nearly triple the size of the Wimbledon tennis grounds can move forward after a High Court judge dismissed a legal challenge. A local campaign group, Save Wimbledon Park, had argued that the development was unlawful because the land was protected for public recreation. The approved proposal includes 38 new courts, an 8,000-seat stadium, and new parkland on the site of a former golf club. The judge ruled that the planning authority had properly exercised its judgment, clearing a major hurdle for the project, which will also allow Wimbledon qualifiers to be held on-site.</p>
