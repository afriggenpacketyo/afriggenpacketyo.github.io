The company also issued an optimistic forecast for the current quarter, projecting gross transaction value to be higher than anticipated. This strong performance comes as outgoing CEO Fidji Simo prepares to step down, having guided the company through significant growth. The report notes that Instacart is increasingly leveraging artificial intelligence to enhance personalization and accelerate the launch of new features. (not investment advice)</p>

After restricting the Fire to a manageable total of 143-9, the Superchargers' chase was powered by a strong opening partnership between Crawley and Dawid Malan. Despite a couple of dropped catches by the Fire, Crawley capitalized on the opportunities to secure his highest score in the tournament on his team debut.

          <p>A federal judge has issued a temporary restraining order, pausing all further construction at the controversial immigrant detention center in Florida known as "Alligator Alcatraz." The ruling came after environmental groups and the Miccosukee Tribe argued that the facility was being built without required environmental impact studies, threatening the sensitive Everglades ecosystem and sacred tribal lands. While the facility can continue to house detainees for now, the 14-day halt on construction prevents immediate further harm to the area. Florida officials have stated their intent to fight the judge's order.</p>

          <p>A judge in South Carolina has dismissed a lawsuit filed by the City of Charleston against numerous energy companies. The city had alleged that the companies created a public nuisance and should be held liable for damages related to climate change, such as increased flooding. However, the judge ruled that state courts are not the proper venue for addressing the complex global issue of climate change, stating that such cases could lead to an endless stream of litigation. The decision, which was made with prejudice, represents a significant setback for climate-related legal campaigns against the energy industry.</p>

          <p>Apple CEO Tim Cook announced a plan to spend approximately $600 billion in the United States over four years, a move seen as appeasing President Trump's demands for domestic manufacturing. While the plan does not include the final assembly of iPhones in the U.S., it expands partnerships with American suppliers for key components, with Trump granting Apple an exemption from new chip tariffs. Analysts suggest the announcement was a savvy strategic maneuver to avoid further tariff-related conflicts, boosting Apple's stock price. The investment leans on long-standing relationships with U.S. companies like Corning and Texas Instruments. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>The California Supreme Court has ruled in favor of environmental groups, allowing their legal challenge against the state's cuts to rooftop solar incentives to proceed. The unanimous decision sends the case back to an appeals court, which had previously dismissed it by arguing that courts must defer to the Public Utilities Commission's expertise. The groups contend that the commission violated state law in 2022 when it drastically reduced the credits solar panel owners receive for sending excess power to the grid. This ruling is a significant step for advocates who argue the cuts undermine California's clean energy goals.</p>

          <p>The new film "Freakier Friday" reunites Jamie Lee Curtis and Lindsay Lohan for a sequel to their 2003 body-swap comedy, this time involving a four-way switch with their respective daughter and step-daughter. The review notes that while the chemistry between the original stars remains the film's biggest charm, the plot itself is thinly sketched and primarily serves as a vehicle for their reunion. The performances of Curtis and Lohan are praised for holding the screen with confidence, but the overall story lacks the emotional insight of the original. The film is described as a disposable but delightful experience for fans, filled with comedic cameos.</p>

While captain Bruno Fernandes is expected to play a deeper role, his natural tendencies are more offensive.
