Companies such as Google, Lockheed Martin, and Palantir are among the contributors to the project, which is being spearheaded by a top political fundraiser for the president. In exchange for their contributions, donors may receive recognition, with one option being their names etched into the ballroom itself.

          <p>U.S. Treasury yields rose, with the 10-year note reaching its highest point in two weeks, in a counterintuitive market reaction following the Federal Reserve's recent interest rate cut. Investors are weighing mixed economic signals, including strong GDP estimates and slightly higher inflation, against the Fed's move to ease monetary policy. The rise in long-term yields suggests that the market anticipates continued economic growth and potential inflation, despite the central bank's efforts to manage risks. This trend will be further tested by upcoming inflation data. (not investment advice)</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>A growing number of Western countries, including the United Kingdom, France, Canada, and Australia, are preparing to formally recognize Palestine as a state, signaling a significant shift in international policy. This movement has gained momentum since the UN General Assembly overwhelmingly backed a two-state solution, with 147 countries now officially recognizing Palestinian statehood. The move has drawn sharp criticism from Israeli officials, who argue it rewards terrorism. Despite widespread support, full UN membership for Palestine remains blocked by a U.S. veto in the Security Council.</p>

          <p>A man suspected of directing the deadly 1982 attack on the Jo Goldenberg Jewish restaurant in Paris has been arrested by Palestinian authorities in the West Bank. Mahmoud Khader Abed Adra is wanted under a 2015 international warrant for his alleged role in the gun and grenade assault that killed six people and injured over 20. The arrest, facilitated by cooperation between France and the Palestinian Authority, comes just days before France is set to formally recognize the state of Palestine. French President Emmanuel Macron has stated that efforts are underway to ensure the suspect's swift extradition.</p>

          <p>Following his recent state visit to the United Kingdom, U.S. President Donald Trump is planning to invite King Charles and Queen Camilla to the United States in the coming year. A senior White House official confirmed the plans, which would coincide with the 250th anniversary of the U.S., although the visit is being planned as a separate event. The last official state visit by a British monarch to the U.S. was in 2007 by the late Queen Elizabeth II. The planned invitation underscores the amicable relationship between the two leaders.</p>

The club, which serves as a unifying force for Russian-speaking immigrants from various post-Soviet nations, achieved promotion after just three seasons.

This fundraising effort reflects the soaring valuations in the AI sector, with competitors like Anthropic and OpenAI also securing massive investments at high valuations. The new capital will likely be used to build out the significant computing infrastructure required for developing advanced AI models, including a large cluster of AI computers in Memphis, Tennessee.

          <p>The Federal Reserve's recent quarter-point interest rate cut has lowered the average 30-year fixed mortgage rate to around 6.13%, providing significant savings for homebuyers. For a $750,000 mortgage, the new rate results in a monthly principal and interest payment of approximately $4,560, which is over $450 less per month compared to the 7.04% rates seen at the start of the year. This reduction in borrowing costs enhances affordability for new buyers and presents a compelling refinancing opportunity for existing homeowners. Over the life of the loan, the savings could exceed $160,000. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>Minneapolis Federal Reserve President Neel Kashkari has advocated for two more interest rate cuts in 2025, in addition to the one approved this week. Kashkari stated that he believes the inflationary impact of the administration's tariffs will be a temporary, "one-time effect," leaving room for further monetary easing. His more dovish stance is influenced by a weakening labor market and contained inflation expectations, despite current inflation running above the Fed's 2% target. Kashkari, who does not have a vote on the policy-setting committee this year, emphasized that the central bank is not comfortable with 3% inflation.</p>

Irish Deputy PM Simon Harris acknowledged that trust is "shattered" but hopes the new approach can provide reconciliation and justice.

He cited a lack of evidence for tariff-driven inflation in economic data, placing him in the minority on the committee. Miran also suggested that stricter immigration policies would have a disinflationary effect by reducing pressure on shelter prices.</p>
