          <p>Nippon Steel's CEO, Eiji Hashimoto, expressed confidence that the U.S. government's oversight in its $14.1 billion acquisition of U.S. Steel will not impede the U.S. unit's operations. Despite conditions including a golden share for the U.S. government and significant investment commitments, Hashimoto believes the deal is efficient and ensures profitability for both companies. He emphasized that Nippon Steel aims to expand production capacity at U.S. Steel and create jobs, aligning with U.S. government expectations. The acquisition positions Nippon Steel as the world's fourth-largest steelmaker, bolstering its global capacity and enabling expansion into overseas markets, and higher U.S. tariffs on steel products are likely to remain in place.

          <p>Archaeologists have reconstructed remarkable frescoes from a luxurious Roman villa in Central London by piecing together thousands of fragments of 2,000-year-old wall plaster. Discovered in 2021, the shattered plaster reveals beautifully painted details of musical instruments, birds, flowers, and fruit from at least 20 walls of the building. The art offers insights into the affluence of the area, described as the "Beverly Hills of Roman London," and the artists who created them. The largest fresco, measuring about 5m by 3m, features pale pink, yellow, and green panels adorned with candelabras, lyres, white cranes, and local plants like mistletoe, showcasing a blend of classical and local influences. The discovery helps reconstruct the story of the UK's rich Roman history.</p>

          <p>New Zealand has suspended NZ$18.2 million in funding to the Cook Islands due to concerns over recent deals struck with China, which cover infrastructure, tourism, technology, and deep-sea mineral exploration. Wellington, the Cook Islands' largest funder, stated it was not informed of the agreements and that funding relies on a high-trust bilateral relationship. The Cook Islands has responded by saying it will address the issue urgently, emphasizing its value of New Zealand's development assistance. The move comes as New Zealand's Prime Minister Christopher Luxon is on an official visit to China, and amid broader concerns among US allies about China's growing influence in the Pacific region.</p>

          <p>Emmet Sheehan made an impressive return to the Dodgers after Tommy John surgery, pitching four strong innings in a dramatic 4-3 win against the Padres. Sheehan, who missed all of last season, showcased his sharp stuff, including a mid-90s mph fastball and a tantalizing changeup-slider combination, striking out six batters and allowing only one run. Manager Dave Roberts praised Sheehan's performance, highlighting his toughness and ability to repeat his delivery, while Will Smith secured the win with a walk-off home run in the ninth inning. The Dodgers have now clinched a series victory against the Padres, extending their lead in the National League West, and Sheehan's return provides a much-needed boost to their pitching rotation.</p>

Legal experts suggest the high-profile case will elevate the careers of the attorneys involved, potentially leading to more celebrity and big-case representation. It is expected that Read may file lawsuits against investigators involved in her case, particularly against a former homicide detective who lost his job over texts related to the case.

Xie noted that tariffs on Chinese imports remain "unreasonably high" and that the U.S. goods deficit will persist if export controls, visa denials, and barriers to Chinese firms continue. He argued that the U.S. should ease restrictions on exports of its most competitive products, such as semiconductors, and welcome Chinese investment and tourism to reduce the deficit. This statement comes amid ongoing discussions between the two countries to ease trade tensions and implement agreements reached in May regarding tariffs on Chinese imports.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>As the U.S. imposes tariffs, businesses are increasingly using "tariff engineering" to lower duty rates by changing product materials or dimensions to fit different classification codes. This legal practice involves altering items to qualify for exemptions or lower tariffs, with companies tweaking products to meet specific requirements. Examples include adding steel or aluminum to products, switching synthetic materials for cotton, and incorporating minor design changes to shift product classifications. While tariff engineering is legal, companies must avoid fraudulent misrepresentation of product classifications, as illustrated by Ford's case involving misclassified cargo vans.
