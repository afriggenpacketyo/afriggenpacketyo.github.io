          <p>Douglas "Pete" Peterson, a former U.S. Air Force pilot who was held as a prisoner of war in Vietnam for six and a half years, discusses his journey from harboring intense hatred towards the Vietnamese to becoming the first postwar U.S. ambassador to the country. Peterson, now 89, shares how he made a conscious decision to leave his hate behind and contribute to reconciliation between the two nations. After being elected to Congress, he witnessed the poverty and friendliness of the Vietnamese people, which motivated him to seek accountability for missing Americans and improve safety for children throughout Asia, leading him to establish The Alliance for Safe Children with his wife. Peterson worries about the current state of international relations, noting the broken bonds of trust and the personalization of diplomacy by some world leaders.</p>

          <p>President Trump has directed drugmakers to lower their prices to match those charged in other high-income countries within the next month, threatening price caps on Medicare earnings if they fail to comply. He stated that the U.S. will no longer subsidize healthcare for foreign countries and expects some prescription drug prices to be reduced by 50% to 90% almost immediately. The move expands the "most favored nation" concept, aiming to pay the lowest price available globally. Drug manufacturers have opposed the plan, arguing that it would stifle innovation and give foreign governments undue influence, while pharmacy benefit managers have praised the effort to lower drug prices.</p>

          <p>A report on U.S. greenhouse gas emissions, typically released by the EPA, was instead published by the Environmental Defense Fund due to the EPA not releasing it. The report indicates that the U.S. has reduced its greenhouse gas emissions by about 17% since 2005, but further acceleration is needed to meet climate commitments. Carbon dioxide, primarily from burning fossil fuels, constitutes the largest portion of emissions, with the transportation sector being the highest-emitting sector. Concerns are raised that the Trump administration's policies may hinder progress in emission reductions, particularly in the transportation and electric power sectors.</p>

The bill aims to fulfill President Trump's campaign pledges but faces criticism from within the Republican party due to concerns over state and local tax deductions. The proposed measures, which are expected to add at least $2.5 trillion to the deficit over the next 10 years, also include tax breaks for businesses and tax hikes targeting Biden's agenda, universities, and migrants. The plan is structured with the majority of tax cuts expiring in 2029.</p>

          <p>Samsung unveiled a thin version of its flagship smartphone, the Galaxy S25 Edge, in an unusually timed launch, as it seeks to maintain momentum in its mobile division amid an uncertain consumer backdrop and U.S. tariff policy. The device, which is just 5.8 millimeters thin and weighs 163 grams, is one of the thinnest smartphones on the market. The launch comes just under four months after Samsung staged its annual flagship phone launch for the S25 series. Samsung reported a jump in revenue and profit in the first quarter of the year at its mobile division thanks to strong sales of its S25 series.</p>
