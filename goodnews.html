          <p>Tiny homes expert Levi Kelly constructed a remarkably small, livable house, measuring just 19.4 by 4 feet, in his Ohio yard for approximately $5,000. Utilizing an old utility trailer and existing materials, the month-long build resulted in a functional space, despite its compact size. The house includes an AC/heating unit, a tilting bed, a portable toilet, an outdoor shower, and a mini-kitchen, all powered by solar panels. Kelly, who has successfully tested the structure in a snowstorm, demonstrates that creative design can yield practical living solutions with minimal square footage, challenging conventional notions of home size.</p>

          <p>The Powerball jackpot is projected to reach an estimated $750 million for Monday's drawing, making it the tenth largest prize in the lottery's history. This follows no single player matching all winning numbers in Saturday's drawing, which had an estimated $700 million jackpot. While the grand prize remains unclaimed, tickets sold in Maine, Massachusetts, and South Dakota won $1 million or $2 million by matching five white balls. The cash value for Monday's drawing is estimated at $338.6 million, continuing a streak of 36 consecutive rounds without a grand prize winner since May 31.</p>

          <p>SpaceX, founded by Elon Musk in 2002, has become a dominant and critical force in the U.S. space industry, leading to significant dependency. Initially saved by a $1.6 billion NASA contract in 2008, the company's Falcon 9 rocket and Dragon capsule are now primary for NASA's ISS missions. With a valuation around $400 billion and conducting 83% of all spacecraft launches in 2024, SpaceX has fundamentally transformed the space ecosystem. It has lowered access costs and enabled a new generation of space companies, solidifying its indispensable role in national space access and innovation.</p>

Further second-half tries from Eve Higgins and Enya Breen, all converted by Dannah O'Brien, solidified their lead.

          <p>The UK government plans a significant overhaul of its asylum appeals system to reduce reliance on hotels for migrants awaiting decisions. Home Secretary Yvette Cooper announced a new body with independent adjudicators to expedite appeals, which currently average over a year with 51,000 pending cases. This initiative responds to growing pressure and protests over the policy, with ministers committed to ending hotel use. However, the Refugee Council argues that reducing appeals primarily requires accurate initial decisions, as about half of original rulings are overturned due to flaws, highlighting ongoing challenges in the system.</p>

This aligns with "High Mileage Club" members reporting significant savings over several years.

          <p>A Vanguard analysis reveals that while 86% of workplace retirement plans offered Roth 401(k) contributions in 2024, only 18% of eligible investors participated. This low adoption is partly due to plans defaulting to pre-tax contributions, requiring active choice. Roth contributions, made with after-tax dollars, allow for tax-free growth and withdrawals in retirement, and unlike pre-tax funds, the original account owner is not subject to required minimum distributions (RMDs). Understanding these tax advantages is crucial for long-term financial planning, especially for younger or higher-income investors, to maximize retirement savings potential.
