          <p>House GOP leaders have introduced a plan to fund the federal government until November 21, aiming to prevent a shutdown before the September 30 deadline. The short-term continuing resolution maintains current funding levels and includes an additional $88 million for the security of lawmakers and other government officials, a measure added following Charlie Kirk's assassination. Speaker Mike Johnson is pushing for a vote this week, but the bill faces opposition from some conservative members and requires Democratic support to pass the Senate, where a 60-vote threshold is necessary.</p>

The company's public debut comes amid a broader resurgence in the tech IPO market, as firms like Figma and Klarna have also recently seen successful launches.

        </div>
        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>A detailed analysis examining the Levelized Cost of Energy (LCOE) has determined that renewable sources are the most affordable for energy production. According to investment bank Lazard, onshore wind and utility-scale solar are more cost-competitive than coal, natural gas, or nuclear power, even before accounting for government subsidies like those in the Inflation Reduction Act. Experts note that while renewables have high upfront capital costs, their operational expenses are significantly lower. The report also considers the impact of President Trump's tariffs, which are projected to increase costs for projects reliant on imported components, particularly battery storage.

The first project, named "Golftopia" by Alchemy Attractions, is a family entertainment center featuring various forms of golf and a hot air balloon launch. The second, from Cross Regions, proposes a senior living community with fine dining and retail spaces called "the Fountains at World Golf Village." Both companies must now submit detailed designs for final approval before construction can begin, with a target completion date of 2029.</p>

          <p>In an interview with Gayle King, Grammy-winning artist Cardi B addressed her reputation for being at the center of public drama as she prepares to release her new album, titled "Am I the Drama?" The rapper explained that her outspoken nature and large personality make her an easy target for controversy, which she insists she does not enjoy. She acknowledged that this reputation has followed her since high school, where she was voted "most dramatic." The new album's title is a direct nod to this long-running public perception of her character.</p>

          <p>The proposed deal to secure TikTok's future in the United States will reportedly involve a combination of new investors and existing investors from its Chinese parent company, ByteDance. According to sources, the agreement is expected to be finalized within the next 30 to 45 days. As part of the arrangement, Oracle is set to maintain its role as the platform's cloud and data security partner. This development comes after months of negotiations and uncertainty following a U.S. law requiring ByteDance to divest its American operations over national security concerns.</p>

        </div>
        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>A key regulation for reverse mortgages, known as the 6-month rule, dictates the timeline for heirs after a borrower passes away or permanently leaves the home. Lenders must issue a "Due and Payable" letter, giving the family six months to either repay the loan balance in full or sell the property to cover the debt. This rule primarily applies to federally insured Home Equity Conversion Mortgages (HECMs). While up to two three-month extensions can be requested from HUD, the deadline underscores the need for borrowers to engage in thorough estate planning with their families.</p>

          <p>The Trump administration has lifted travel restrictions on Hungarian citizens, restoring full access to the Visa Waiver Program. The move reverses a 2021 Biden administration policy that had limited the validity of travel authorizations for Hungarian passport holders born outside the country, citing security concerns with Hungary's naturalization process. Effective September 30, the validity period for travel authorizations will be restored to two years, allowing for multiple entries. The decision signals warming diplomatic ties between Washington and the government of Hungarian Prime Minister Viktor Orban.</p>

          <p>Two years after the lengthy 2023 actors' strike, SAG-AFTRA has formally established a new fund to distribute bonus payments from successful streaming shows. Dubbed the "Robin Hood" fund, it will collect 25% of the bonuses generated when a large-budget streaming project meets a specific viewership threshold. This money will then be distributed to a wider pool of performers, including stunt and background actors who work a minimum number of days. The fund was a key negotiation point designed to create a new secondary income stream for actors in the streaming era.</p>

          <p>Treasury Secretary Scott Bessent stated that President Donald Trump's credible threat to allow TikTok to be banned in the U.S. was the crucial factor that prompted China to move forward with a deal. According to Bessent, the commercial terms of a deal had been largely in place for months, but progress stalled until the administration made it clear it prioritized national security over ensuring the app's continued operation. This hardline negotiating tactic is credited with breaking the deadlock and leading to the current framework agreement to secure TikTok's future under new ownership in the United States.</p>
