          <p>President Trump announced his support for a partnership between U.S. Steel and Nippon Steel, a deal previously blocked by the Biden administration on national security grounds. Trump claimed the partnership would create at least 70,000 jobs and add $14 billion to the U.S. economy, with most investment occurring within 14 months. While the specifics of the deal remain unclear, it appears to involve investment by Nippon rather than a complete acquisition. The United Steelworkers union expressed concern that the arrangement could jeopardize American jobs and erode domestic steel-making capacity, while U.S. Steel stated they would remain American and grow bigger and stronger through a partnership with Nippon Steel.</p>

          <p>New Jersey's upcoming gubernatorial elections are drawing national attention as a potential bellwether for the 2026 midterm elections and a gauge of President Trump's influence. The Democratic primary features a crowded field, including Representatives Mikie Sherrill and Josh Gottheimer, and Newark Mayor Ras Baraka, each vying to succeed the term-limited Governor Phil Murphy. Republicans hope to flip the governorship red, with Trump endorsing Jack Ciattarelli, who has shifted his stance on the former president over the years. Experts say the race will also test how partisan allegiances are shifting in New Jersey and the strength of Trump's endorsement of Republican candidate Jack Ciattarelli.</p>

          <p>A federal judge issued a temporary restraining order against the Trump administration's plan to strip Harvard University of its ability to enroll foreign students, following a lawsuit filed by the university. Harvard argued the administration's decision was a blatant violation of law and free speech rights, retaliating against the university for refusing to surrender academic independence. The Trump administration claimed Harvard had not done enough to combat antisemitism and change its hiring practices, allegations the university strongly denied. The order pauses the Department of Homeland Security's move to revoke Harvard's access to the Student and Exchange Visitor Program (SEVP), with a hearing scheduled for May 29.</p>

          <p>President Trump announced a "planned partnership" between U.S. Steel and Japan-based Nippon Steel, ensuring U.S. Steel will remain in America and keep its headquarters in Pittsburgh. Nippon Steel's previous bid to buy U.S. Steel was blocked by former President Joe Biden, but the new arrangement is subject to another national security review. U.S. Steel praised Trump, stating the partnership would bring massive investment, new technologies, and thousands of jobs, while Nippon Steel called the agreement a "game changer" committed to protecting American workers and national security. Trump plans to hold a rally at U.S. Steel in Pittsburgh on May 30.</p>

          <div class="timestamp">2025-05-23 18:23:04 EDT</div>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>President Trump signed four executive orders to accelerate nuclear power plant construction, including advanced small reactors. One order directs the Nuclear Regulatory Commission (NRC) to streamline its rules and approve new reactor applications within 18 months, potentially lowering radiation exposure safety limits. Another order encourages siting reactors on federal lands and military bases, potentially bypassing the NRC. The administration set a goal of quadrupling the nation's nuclear power capacity by 2050. Skeptics fear the White House pressure could compromise safety, while proponents say the NRC's regulations are outdated and hinder advanced reactor deployment.</p>

          <p>A U.S. judge overturned President Trump's executive order targeting Jenner & Block, a law firm that employed an attorney who investigated him. The order suspended security clearances for the firm's lawyers and restricted their access to government buildings and federal contracting work. Trump accused the firm of engaging in activities that "undermine justice" and criticized its hiring of Andrew Weissmann, who worked on Robert Mueller's investigation. The judge ruled that Trump's directive violated core rights under the U.S. Constitution, mirroring a previous ruling against a similar order targeting law firm Perkins Coie.</p>

The lawsuit followed the revocation of Harvard's Student and Exchange Visitor Program certification, halting its ability to enroll international students. The administration claimed Harvard had not complied with demands related to antisemitism and protest activity. The judge agreed that the administration's action would cause "immediate and irreparable injury" to the university.</p>

          <p>Billy Joel has canceled his upcoming concerts due to normal pressure hydrocephalus (NPH), a brain disorder affecting hearing, vision, and balance. NPH occurs when excess cerebrospinal fluid accumulates in the brain, causing difficulty walking, bladder control issues, and memory problems. Treatment typically involves surgery to insert a shunt that drains the fluid. Early diagnosis and treatment can improve symptoms, though physical therapy may also be beneficial. Joel's statement indicated he was undergoing physical therapy and advised to refrain from performing during this recovery period.</p>
