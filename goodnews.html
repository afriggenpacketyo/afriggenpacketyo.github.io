          <h2>Beyond Dairy: Exploring Diverse Calcium Sources for Optimal Bone Health</h2>
          <div class="timestamp">2025-08-26 10:24:01 EDT</div>
        </div>
        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Many surprising food sources can help individuals meet their daily calcium requirements, which are crucial for bone health, muscle function, and nerve signaling. Registered dietitians highlight that beyond traditional dairy products like milk, yogurt, and cheese, options include calcium-fortified non-dairy milks, tofu made with calcium, and fortified fruit juices and cereals. Canned fish with bones, such as salmon and sardines, also provide calcium, as do vegetables like kale, broccoli, and bok choy. Experts recommend consulting a doctor about supplements if concerns about calcium levels persist, emphasizing that natural food sources should be prioritized.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Sixty-five years after gaining independence, many francophone African nations reflect on their progress, with some still ranking among the world's poorest due to factors like infertile land, limited raw material wealth, high birthrates, and political instability. While French political influence wanes, with troops expelled from several nations, economic ties remain strong, notably through the CFA franc currency, which offers stability but limits monetary autonomy. Despite challenges, the region has seen a decline in extreme poverty, increased life expectancy, and reduced infant mortality, with remittances from the diaspora playing a crucial role in supporting rural populations.</p>

          <p>Pittsburgh Steelers quarterback Aaron Rodgers has downplayed the emotional significance of his upcoming Week 1 game against his former team, the New York Jets. Rodgers, who spent two years with the Jets before joining the Steelers, stated that while he has friendships there, it's just one game out of 17. He expressed regret that his tenure with the Jets, marred by an Achilles injury in 2023, didn't work out as hoped, but he remains thankful for the special moments. The Jets will start Justin Fields, who previously backed up Russell Wilson for the Steelers.</p>

          <p>Former Australia head coach Justin Langer believes England may lack the "killer instinct" required to win the Ashes series in Australia this winter. Despite thrilling 2-2 draws against India and in the last home Ashes series, Langer questions England's ability to close out a series, particularly on Australian soil where they have a poor recent record. He suggests England must adopt an aggressive "Bazball" approach to put pressure on Australia's formidable bowling attack. The series, starting November 21 in Perth, will test England's courage against world-class bowlers like Mitchell Starc, Josh Hazlewood, and Pat Cummins.</p>

          <h2>Gavin Newsom's Trump Impersonations Spark Debate on Democratic Political Strategy</h2>

          <p>Gavin Newsom's recent mockery of Donald Trump, mimicking his blustery style, has garnered millions of views and sparked discussion among Democrats about effective political communication in the social media era. While some progressives see it as a refreshing, pugnacious approach to counter Trump's attention-grabbing tactics, critics suggest it reinforces the very style that degrades political discourse. The article highlights how the decline in American attention spans, driven by social media, favors short, inflammatory language, and argues that Democrats might need to combine profane style with policy substance to achieve electoral victories, moving beyond the "nice guy" party image.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Lamborghini CEO Stephan Winkelmann stated that rising tariffs are causing even the wealthiest buyers to pause, despite the brand's strong back orders and record revenue in 2024. He emphasized that the 'made in Italy' promise is core to the brand, precluding U.S. production, and noted that affluent consumers are still price-sensitive. Amid a slowdown in global EV demand, Lamborghini is reconsidering its previously announced all-electric grand touring car for 2028, potentially opting for a hybrid model instead. The company continues to thrive with new plug-in hybrid models and a strategy of limited-production 'few-offs' for top clients, appealing to a younger, more diverse global wealth demographic.</p>

          <p>Starbucks' Pumpkin Spice Latte (PSL), launched in 2003, continues to be its most popular seasonal beverage, with over 424 million sold worldwide, despite widespread backlash and early release dates. The article explains that much of the contempt for the PSL isn't about its flavor but rather reflects sexism, class anxiety, and skepticism of savvy marketing. Its success is attributed to effective seasonal branding, its association with comfort food during economic downturns, and its prevalence on social media, particularly Instagram. While the peak of "pumpkin spice hot takes" seems to have passed, the drink remains a cultural touchstone, evolving to include cold variations and inspiring countless other pumpkin spice-flavored products.</p>

          <p>The student housing sector is experiencing a significant shift, with luxury amenities losing their appeal as consumers grow more concerned about the economy. Rent growth slowed to 0.9% in July, and average advertised asking rents decreased, as students and parents increasingly opt for more affordable, older rental homes. High-end features like golf simulators are being replaced by preferences for functional co-working spaces. This trend is accelerating investment towards large, flagship public universities, which continue to see record enrollment growth and unmet housing needs, while new development declines due to higher construction and capital costs.</p>

          <p>Tropical Storm Fernand is expected to continue weakening over the central Atlantic Ocean and poses no threat to land, according to the National Hurricane Center. The storm, the sixth named storm of the 2025 Atlantic hurricane season, began weakening on Monday night and is forecast to become a post-tropical cyclone before dissipating by Thursday. Located 635 miles east-northeast of Bermuda, Fernand has maximum sustained winds of 45 mph. This hurricane season was predicted by NOAA to be above normal, with 13 to 18 named storms, following Hurricane Erin, which reached Category 5 strength earlier in the month.</p>

          <p>EchoStar's stock surged over 75% after AT&T announced an agreement to purchase wireless spectrum licenses from the telecom company for approximately $23 billion in cash. The deal, expected to close in mid-2026, will add 50 megahertz of mid-band and low-band spectrum to AT&T's network, covering over 400 U.S. markets. EchoStar stated the transaction is part of resolving Federal Communications Commission inquiries regarding its 5G network buildout, following complaints from SpaceX about underused spectrum. The companies also expanded their network services agreement, enabling EchoStar to operate Boost Mobile as a hybrid mobile network operator, a move AT&T CEO John Stankey described as a "win all the way around."</p>

          <p>Archaeologists have discovered a well-preserved Stone Age settlement submerged 26 feet below the Bay of Aarhus, Denmark, offering a rare glimpse into coastal life 8,500 years ago. This discovery is part of a major international project to map lost Northern European landscapes, submerged by rapidly rising sea levels after the last ice age. Excavations have yielded animal bones, stone tools, arrowheads, and worked wood, all remarkably preserved in an oxygen-free environment. Researchers are using dendrochronology to precisely date submerged trees, hoping to understand how ancient societies adapted to significant coastal changes, a topic increasingly relevant in today's era of climate change-driven sea level rise.</p>

          <p>Scientists have found evidence suggesting that Earth's inner core may contain another, even more inner core, potentially rewriting textbooks on our planet's structure. Geophysicists at Australian National University analyzed seismic wave data from decades of global earthquakes, revealing variations in the inner core's anisotropy that indicate distinct layers. This finding suggests a change in the structure of iron within the core, possibly pointing to two separate cooling events in Earth's history. The presence of an innermost layer could explain inconsistencies in current models of Earth's structure and offers new insights into our planet's deep past.</p>
