          <p>Model Emily Ratajkowski made her debut on the Victoria's Secret Fashion Show runway, wearing a pink lingerie set and orchid-shaped angel wings. Although this was her first runway walk for the brand, the 34-year-old previously featured in its 2023 Icon Campaign, expressing admiration for past legends like Gisele Bündchen and Naomi Campbell. Ratajkowski's career began at age 14 and gained significant momentum after her controversial appearance in Robin Thicke's "Blurred Lines" music video.

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>The UN's nuclear watchdog, the IAEA, announced that a complex repair plan has begun to restore the main power supply to Ukraine's Zaporizhzhia nuclear plant. The facility, which is Europe's largest nuclear station and currently under Russian control, has been relying on backup diesel generators for four weeks, posing significant safety risks. Both Russian and Ukrainian forces have reportedly engaged constructively with the IAEA, establishing ceasefire zones to allow specialists to conduct the crucial repairs. Ukraine's energy minister noted this is the 42nd time power lines have needed restoration since the full-scale invasion began.</p>

          <p>In a competitive job market, applicants are increasingly using AI tools to create professional headshots, offering a fast and affordable alternative to traditional photography sessions that can cost hundreds of dollars. Services like HeadshotPro and Canva's new feature allow users to generate polished profile pictures for platforms like LinkedIn, with some users reporting a significant increase in recruiter outreach after updating their photos. However, the trend raises concerns about authenticity, as recruiters express wariness of overly stylized or fake-looking images. While the technology offers greater accessibility, it creates a new tension between maintaining a genuine personal brand and leveraging AI for a professional advantage.</p>

          <p>The Grand Sumo Tournament is being held in London, marking only the second time in the sport's 1,500-year history that it has taken place outside of Japan. London's Royal Albert Hall is hosting over 40 professional wrestlers, known as rikishi, for the five-day event, which required shipping 11 tons of special clay from Japan to construct the sacred ring, or dohyo. The event underscores the deep cultural and religious traditions of sumo, with organizers working to present an authentic experience for a largely Western audience. The last time the tournament was held abroad was also at the Royal Albert Hall, in 1991.</p>

          <p>Amid rising suicide rates among Black men, community-led mental health groups are providing vital safe spaces for them to be vulnerable and prioritize their well-being. One such group, Mental Health Is Real Wealth in Los Angeles, was founded by Desmond Carter after his best friend died by suicide. These initiatives address a critical gap, as Black men are less likely to seek professional help and often face culturally incompetent care when they do. The groups aim to help men navigate societal pressures, systemic racism, and economic disparities, fostering emotional expression and breaking generational cycles of silence.</p>

          <p>Carlynn Greene, who won 30 scholarships to graduate college debt-free, advises students to avoid common mistakes when seeking financial aid. She recommends focusing on local and state-level scholarships or those with multiple specific criteria, as these have smaller applicant pools than broad national awards. Greene also stresses the importance of persistence, noting that she applied for over 100 scholarships to win 30, and suggests applying for 100 to 200 awards in total. Finally, she emphasizes treating the application essay as a marketing tool to convince the selection committee why they should invest in your education over other candidates.</p>

Financially, his net worth has continued to grow in retirement due to the significantly lower cost of living, which saves his family an estimated $5,000 per month on expenses like taxes, healthcare, and daily costs.

If the group successfully gathers over 106,000 signatures, voters will decide whether to keep or reject the map.

          <p>Psychologist Jean Twenge advises parents to delay giving children smartphones until they can drive and to restrict social media access until age 16, linking early use to teen mental health issues. To prepare them, she recommends starting conversations about responsible technology use at least six years in advance, ideally in late elementary school. Key lessons include teaching the value of privacy, the permanence of online content, and the importance of moderation. Twenge also stresses setting firm rules, such as using parental controls and starting with a basic, non-internet-connected phone to help children build a healthier relationship with technology.</p>

The company was founded to solve a common problem for professionals in cold climates: the lack of coats that are both stylish enough for business and warm enough for harsh winters. By combining Italian wool with functional linings, the brand has found a niche market, with its products now worn by billionaires and politicians and sold in over 100 stores worldwide.

          <p>In a detailed explanation of his investment philosophy, Warren Buffett categorizes assets into three types, placing gold in the second category of items that produce nothing. He argues that unlike productive assets like farms or businesses, which generate value, gold's worth is entirely dependent on the hope that someone else will pay more for it in the future. Buffett famously illustrates this by stating that all the world's gold would fit into a cube about 68 feet on a side, an object one could admire but which would remain inert. He concludes that he prefers to invest in assets that deliver tangible output and value over time. (not investment advice)</p>
