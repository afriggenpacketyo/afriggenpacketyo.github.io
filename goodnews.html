          <p>Kate Forbes, Scotland's Deputy First Minister, has announced she will not seek re-election in the 2026 Holyrood election. The Skye, Lochaber and Badenoch MSP cited a desire to prioritize her family and not miss the early years of her daughter's life. First Minister John Swinney praised her invaluable contribution to public life over the past decade, during which she rose to become finance secretary and narrowly lost the 2023 SNP leadership contest. Forbes will continue to serve as an MSP and in her government role until the election, expressing her ongoing support for Swinney and the party's goals.</p>

          <p>A recent survey has revealed that deep emotional bonds with pets are leading to some surprising sentiments, amplified by a viral AI trend. The survey, which asked 1,000 Americans about their connection with their pets, found that 31% would consider dating an AI-generated human version of their animal companion. This sentiment was particularly strong among Millennials and Gen X. The findings highlight the significant emotional support pets provide, with 77% of respondents stating their pet offers better support than an ex-partner and 38% trusting their pet more than their closest human friends.</p>

          <p>A recent federal report from the National Survey on Drug Use and Health shows a promising decrease in depression and suicidal behaviors among teenagers between 2021 and 2024. The prevalence of serious suicidal thoughts in adolescents aged 12-17 dropped from nearly 13% to 10%, with a corresponding decline in suicide attempts. Experts suggest this improvement may be linked to increased openness among teens about their struggles and better access to specialized treatment. However, the report also highlights that access to mental health care remains a challenge, with millions of teens still experiencing suicidal thoughts.</p>

Set to be JFK's largest terminal, the facility is now weather-tight and will feature a light-filled design dedicated to international travelers. This development is part of a wider $19 billion overhaul of the airport, aimed at modernizing aging infrastructure to accommodate growing air traffic. The terminal will feature 23 gates, extensive retail space, and its own resilient microgrid for power.</p>

The two-day patrol involved three Indian naval vessels and two Philippine frigates, occurring as Filipino President Ferdinand Marcos visits New Delhi for talks. The exercises are a clear demonstration of the two nations' commitment to upholding international maritime law amid China's sweeping territorial claims in the region. A Philippine military official confirmed that Chinese vessels shadowed the patrol, but no untoward incidents occurred.</p>

          <p>China is advancing its goal of aviation self-sufficiency by making progress not just on homegrown airliners but also on the essential components that comprise them. A key project is the CJ-1000A, a domestically produced commercial jet engine, which is reportedly progressing on schedule to eventually replace the foreign-made engines currently used on China's C919 aircraft. This development is part of a broader strategy to reduce reliance on foreign technology and establish China as a major force across all levels of the global civil aviation supply chain, from nose to tail.</p>

          <p>This article from the "My Unsung Hero" series recounts a powerful story of kindness experienced by Eileen Freiberg-Dale while she was caring for her husband after a traumatic brain injury. Overwhelmed with new responsibilities and grieving, she was struggling to rake the leaves in her yard when a friend of 15 years, Jonathan Lilienfeld, appeared unexpectedly. He simply put his arm around her, told her to rest, and proceeded to rake and bag all the leaves himself. Freiberg-Dale recalls this simple, unsolicited act of help as a heroic rescue during one of the most difficult times of her life.</p>

          <p>The Ann Arbor District Library has achieved remarkable success with its "Summer Game," an interactive challenge that has engaged thousands of residents, more than half of whom are adults. The game evolved from a simple reading challenge into a comprehensive library-using game inspired by corporate loyalty programs. Players earn points by solving puzzles, exploring local history, and discovering the library's diverse offerings beyond books, such as tools and art. The program's immense popularity demonstrates how public libraries can innovate to engage their communities in new and unexpected ways.</p>

          <h2>Experts Advise Most People Don't Need Electrolyte-Enhanced Sports Drinks for Hydration</h2>
          <div class="timestamp">2025-08-04 05:00:00 EDT</div>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Despite a multi-billion dollar market for sports drinks and electrolyte powders, medical experts and sports scientists suggest they are unnecessary for most people. While sweat does contain electrolytes like sodium and potassium, a varied diet typically provides more than enough of these minerals to replenish what is lost. The body, particularly the kidneys, is highly effective at regulating electrolyte levels, excreting any excess. Experts say plain water and a balanced diet are sufficient for hydration unless a person is engaged in prolonged, intense exercise or experiencing rapid fluid loss due to illness.</p>

          <p>The XRP Ledger (XRPL) is set to gain access to a critical resource it has historically lacked: Ethereum's vast pool of active developers. This is being made possible through the launch of an EVM-compatible sidechain, which allows developers to easily port their Ethereum-based applications to the XRPL ecosystem. By tapping into Ethereum's developer base, which is more than double the size of its own, the XRPL could see a significant increase in new applications, users, and overall network activity. This development is seen as a fundamental catalyst for potential growth. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>Malaysia has committed to significant purchases from the United States as part of a trade deal that secured a lower tariff rate from Washington. The country will spend up to $150 billion over five years on U.S. equipment for its semiconductor, aerospace, and data center industries. Additionally, state energy firm Petronas will buy $3.4 billion in liquefied natural gas annually. These commitments, along with other concessions, were made to address the U.S. trade deficit with Malaysia and resulted in a new tariff of 19%, down from the 25% originally threatened by the Trump administration.</p>

          <p>Manchester United's pre-season tour has concluded, showing potential signs of progress under new manager Ruben Amorim, though it remains to be seen if this is a true recovery or another false dawn. Amorim has implemented a new coaching strategy, including a tactical shift to a three-man defense and an emphasis on player responsibility and intelligence. The team environment appears more relaxed, and the players seem to be responding to his methods. However, the manager and observers know that these positive signs will mean nothing if the team cannot deliver consistent results once the Premier League season begins.</p>
