          <p>UK newspaper headlines are dominated by the Labour government's U-turn on winter fuel payments for pensioners, with many papers noting the political pressure that led to the decision. Several papers also highlight Donald Trump's confrontational meeting with South African President Cyril Ramaphosa, during which Trump raised concerns about violence against white farmers. Other news includes potential restrictions on state pensions for recent immigrants and Justice Secretary's consideration of mandatory chemical castration for sexual assault offenders.

          <p>Canadian Prime Minister Mark Carney has confirmed ongoing "high-level" talks with the United States regarding participation in President Donald Trump's proposed "Golden Dome" missile defense program. The multilayered system, estimated at $175 billion, aims to detect and intercept incoming missiles. Carney emphasized the growing missile threats, including those potentially originating from space, and affirmed Canada's commitment to ensuring protections for its citizens. While Canada and the US are partners in NORAD, this consideration comes amid strained relations and Canada's diversification of trade and security alliances.</p>

          <p>The Marks & Spencer website is completely down, preventing users from browsing, due to ongoing disruptions following a cyber attack last month. Earlier, M&S estimated the attack would reduce this year's profits by around ¬£300m, with online services disrupted until July. Some personal customer data, including telephone numbers, addresses, and dates of birth, was stolen, but payment details and passwords were not compromised. Police are investigating the Scattered Spider hacking group, believed to be behind attacks on other retailers as well.</p>

          <p>House Republicans are proposing a bill to invest $1,000 on behalf of every American baby born over the next four years, depositing the funds into "Trump accounts." Under the bill, children born between January 1, 2025, and January 1, 2029, would receive the money, invested in financial markets. The proceeds could be withdrawn later for expenses like college or buying a house, with parents able to contribute. Tax experts note that the accounts function like typical investment accounts, with post-tax income contributions and taxable gains upon withdrawal. (not investment advice)</p>

The network, founded during the Cold War, provides non-ideological news coverage to countries where the press is restricted. EU foreign policy chief Kaja Kallas announced a $6.2 million contribution to support the network's independent journalism. The move highlights European support for RFE/RL's work, particularly its reporting on Russia and Hungary.

          <p>Chinese electric-vehicle maker Xpeng saw its shares in Hong Kong surge over 10% after releasing upbeat earnings and a stronger-than-expected revenue forecast for the second quarter. First-quarter revenue more than doubled from a year earlier, driven by robust sales, with deliveries of 94,008 vehicles. The company narrowed its net loss and lifted its gross margin. Analysts expect Xpeng will likely turn profitable in the fourth quarter, thanks to strong sales and new models. The company aims to begin mass production of vehicles equipped with Level 3 autonomous driving features by year-end.</p>

          <p>The Japanese government has initiated a revamped gasoline subsidy aimed at reducing prices by 10 yen per liter to alleviate cost-of-living pressures for consumers. The subsidy, effective Thursday, will provide a fixed sum to wholesalers regardless of current prices, targeting a 7.40 yen per liter reduction in the first week. The program aims to lower prices by at least 1 yen weekly until a 10 yen reduction is achieved by mid-June. The reintroduction of subsidies comes ahead of the House of Councillors election.</p>
