          <div class="timestamp">2025-07-03 15:17:05 EDT</div>
        </div>
        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>President Trump's newly passed legislative package introduces several new tax breaks that are temporary and scheduled to expire at the end of his term in 2028. Among these provisions is a federal income tax deduction for tips earned by service workers and another for overtime pay, both of which phase out at higher income levels. The bill also allows for a temporary deduction on interest paid for new auto loans and creates a new children's savings account, seeded with a government deposit, for those born between 2025 and 2028.

          <p>The U.S. labor market continued to show resilience in June, with employers adding 147,000 jobs, surpassing economists' expectations. The unemployment rate also fell to a new low of 4.1%. Job growth was primarily driven by gains in state and local government employment, particularly in education, while the federal workforce continued to shrink due to massive cuts. Despite the solid report, economists remain cautious, expecting growth to slow in the second half of the year due to uncertainty over trade and fiscal policies. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>Average interest rates for a 30-year fixed mortgage have fallen for the fifth straight week, now standing at 6.67%, providing a glimmer of hope for prospective homebuyers. This downward trend comes amid market expectations of a potential Federal Reserve rate cut later this year, which could further ease borrowing costs. Experts advise current buyers to prepare by checking their credit reports, researching real estate agents, and securing mortgage pre-approval to be competitive as the market potentially heats up.

          <h2>Review: 'Nobu' Documentary Focuses More on Brand Than Culinary Experience</h2>
          <div class="timestamp">2025-07-03 15:01:07 EDT</div>
        </div>
        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>A new documentary titled "Nobu" chronicles the life and career of celebrated sushi master Nobu Matsuhisa, but a review suggests it functions more as a commercial for his global brand than an intimate profile. The film highlights Matsuhisa's meticulous standards and features interviews with famous patrons like Robert De Niro and Cindy Crawford. However, the reviewer finds it lacks a deep exploration of the communal dining experience or the specific culinary genius that propelled him to fame. It contrasts with more focused food documentaries that better capture the intimate discipline of the craft.</p>

          <p>The Australian government has canceled the visa of Ye, the artist formerly known as Kanye West, effectively barring him from entering the country. The decision follows the release of his song "Heil Hitler," which has been widely condemned for its antisemitism and racial epithets. Australia‚Äôs home affairs minister stated the country would not permit entry to someone who argues that antisemitism is rational. This action is the latest in a series of consequences for Ye, whose recent behavior has drawn widespread criticism and alienated former collaborators.</p>

          <p>With average credit card interest rates exceeding 21%, many Americans face overwhelming debt that may be too large for do-it-yourself payoff plans. Financial experts identify five key warning signs that professional help is needed. These include being unable to pay more than the minimum, having a credit utilization ratio over 50%, and using credit cards for essential living expenses. Other red flags are a debt-to-income ratio above 40% and being unable to qualify for reasonable debt consolidation loans. (not investment advice)</p>
