          <p>The U.S. Army is considering plans for a large-scale military parade in Washington, D.C., potentially coinciding with President Trump's 79th birthday and the Army's 250th anniversary. The parade could involve nearly 7,000 troops, tanks, helicopter flyovers, and parachute jumps. The timing of the event and the White House's involvement have raised concerns that Trump is using the Army's birthday as an excuse to stage a grand military parade, reminiscent of his previous attempt that was scrapped due to high costs. City officials have also voiced concerns about potential damage to roads from heavy vehicles.</p>

          <p>Elon Musk's Department of Government Efficiency (DOGE) has reportedly cut at least $160 billion in waste, fraud, and abuse in the federal government, according to Fox News. Some of the most outrageous examples include funding a former Taliban member, lavish parties at Caesars Palace using COVID-relief funds, and millions spent on 'Sesame Street' in Iraq. The department has also announced cuts to diversity, equity, and inclusion (DEI) contracts, redirecting funds towards a meritocracy-based system.

Temu has been actively recruiting U.S. sellers to join the platform. The company said pricing for U.S. consumers "remains unchanged as the platform transitions to a local fulfillment model."</p>
