          <p>On the first day of the second Test match at Edgbaston, Indian captain Shubman Gill scored a patient century, guiding his team to a solid position of 310-5 by the close of play. Despite a disciplined effort from England's bowlers, Gill‚Äôs unflustered performance, supported by an elegant 87 from opener Yashasvi Jaiswal, gave India the advantage. England managed to take key wickets throughout the day but will face a significant challenge to counter India's first-innings total. The day concluded with Gill and Ravindra Jadeja at the crease, having built a strong partnership.</p>

          <p>This article outlines important factors for savers to contemplate before opening a large Certificate of Deposit, especially in a changing economic environment with shifting interest rates. Key considerations include deciding between a higher-rate short-term CD and a potentially lower-rate long-term one, while being mindful of early withdrawal penalties. Savers should also realistically assess if they can afford to have a significant sum of money locked away for the chosen term. Finally, it is crucial to compare CDs against liquid alternatives like high-yield savings accounts, which currently offer competitive rates. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>The U.S. Men's National Team's preparations for their CONCACAF Gold Cup semifinal were briefly interrupted by the appearance of an unexpected drone over their training facility. While U.S. Soccer regularly uses three of its own drones for analysis, this fourth, unidentified aircraft prompted staff to investigate its origin. The team's coach, Mauricio Pochettino, downplayed the incident, joking that he would send clips to anyone who wanted them. The drone eventually landed outside the facility's perimeter, and the training session continued without further issue as the team readies for its crucial match.</p>

          <p>Equities tied to the cryptocurrency ether have seen a recent surge, reflecting renewed market enthusiasm driven by the growing trends of stablecoins and asset tokenization. Companies that have adopted an ether-focused treasury strategy saw significant stock gains. This interest is fueled by Ethereum's capability to support the tokenization of traditional assets, such as BlackRock's tokenized money market fund, and the expansion of tokenized U.S. stock trading. The developments suggest emerging real-world use cases for the Ethereum network, revitalizing a crypto asset that has otherwise struggled this year. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>The High Court in the UK has ordered a new, independent investigation into how the security service MI5 provided false evidence to multiple courts. This decision came after judges rejected two previous internal inquiries as "seriously deficient." The case originated from a BBC investigation which revealed that MI5 had lied about its relationship with a neo-Nazi state agent who had abused women. The ruling is a significant test of MI5's credibility and accountability, with the judges commending the BBC for bringing the matter to public attention.</p>

          <p>The U.S. government is ramping up a plan to breed and release billions of sterile New World screwworm flies to combat the threat of the flesh-eating pest to livestock, wildlife, and pets. The screwworm has reappeared in southern Mexico, prompting the USDA to build a new fly factory to produce irradiated male flies. When these sterile males mate with wild females, the resulting eggs do not hatch, causing the population to collapse over time. This biological control technique has been successfully used to eradicate the pest from North America in the past.</p>

          <p>For those overwhelmed by credit card debt, this article outlines seven signs that debt settlement might be a suitable strategy. These indicators include having minimum payments consume over 20% of take-home income, making no progress on the principal balance due to high interest, and considering drastic measures like borrowing from retirement funds. Other signs are maxed-out credit lines, juggling payments with cash advances, and accumulating debt due to uncontrollable life events like job loss. Debt settlement offers a faster resolution than traditional credit counseling for those in dire financial situations.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>In light of recent air traffic control (ATC) outages at major U.S. airports, this article explains the robust training and redundant systems pilots rely on to ensure safety. Pilots are trained from their earliest days to handle lost communications by using backup radio frequencies, specific transponder codes for emergencies, and an onboard collision avoidance system (TCAS). This system communicates directly with other aircraft to coordinate maneuvers and prevent mid-air incidents. While these safety protocols are effective, ATC disruptions are still likely to cause significant flight delays for passengers as traffic is limited in affected areas.</p>
