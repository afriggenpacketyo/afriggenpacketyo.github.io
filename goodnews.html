          <p>OpenAI has announced that its nonprofit will retain control of the company as it restructures into a public benefit corporation, responding to pressure from civic leaders and former employees. This decision, backed by Microsoft and valued at $300 billion, came after discussions with the attorneys general of California and Delaware. The move aims to ensure the nonprofit's mission remains central while allowing for employee and investor equity. OpenAI is currently in a legal dispute with Elon Musk, who opposes the shift towards a for-profit model, but CEO Sam Altman asserts the company remains focused on its core mission, with the nonprofit retaining control of the majority of shares.</p>

          <p>The 2025 Met Gala theme, 'Tailored for You,' will celebrate Black style and the history of dandyism, aligning with the Metropolitan Museum of Art's spring exhibition, 'Superfine: Tailoring Black Style.' Co-chairs include Colman Domingo, Lewis Hamilton, A$AP Rocky, Pharrell Williams, and Anna Wintour, with LeBron James as an honorary chair. The exhibition, inspired by Monica L. Miller's book, explores the evolution of Black identity through fashion, from enslavement to global trendsetting. This marks the first time the Met has centered Black identity and Black designers, combating the erasure of Black history, and the event has already raised a record $31 million for the museum's Costume Institute.</p>

          <p>Fifty years after the fall of Saigon, adoptees from "Operation Babylift" share their experiences of being airlifted to America for adoption. The U.S. government transported nearly 2,600 Vietnamese children to the U.S. in 1975, but the mission was controversial, as some children had families and were not orphans. A lawsuit was filed against the U.S. government to determine eligibility for adoption, but it was denied and the records were sealed. Many adoptees have turned to DNA tests to uncover their past, while some have no desire to find biological relatives.</p>

          <p>President Trump claimed gasoline prices have fallen below $2 per gallon, urging the Federal Reserve to lower interest rates. However, the national average for gasoline is over $3 per gallon, according to AAA and GasBuddy. Trump's claim appears to be based on RBOB gasoline futures, which track wholesale gasoline prices before taxes and other costs are added. Analysts state this price is irrelevant to consumers, as it does not reflect the actual cost at the pump, and the average pump price may fall below $3 a gallon.</p>

          <p>The VE Day 80 parade in London paid its respects to the wartime generation, with veterans given pride of place alongside the Royal Family and the prime minister. The events marked one of the last big public moments of recognition for the diminishing number of veterans from World War Two. The Royal Family hosted a tea party for war veterans, and crowds gave a warm welcome to the Ukrainian contingent in the parade, serving as a reminder of present conflicts. The 80th anniversary events drew large crowds along the Mall.</p>
