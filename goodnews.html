          <p>The Los Angeles Dodgers secured a 5-2 victory against the Boston Red Sox, showcasing a resurgent offense that has struggled for much of July. Despite being without shortstop Mookie Betts, the team continued a recent trend of improved run production. Teoscar Hernández was a key contributor, drawing a bases-loaded walk and hitting a two-run home run, while Andy Pages also added to the offense with a double and a sacrifice fly. The win, backed by a solid pitching performance, marks the Dodgers' third victory in their last four games as the trade deadline approaches.</p>

          <p>China's quantitative hedge funds are successfully recruiting top-tier scientific and engineering talent, partly due to funding cuts and stricter visa policies in the United States. Firms like Shanghai-based Mingshi are offering competitive salaries to attract PhD candidates and graduates who might have previously stayed in the US. This influx of expertise is crucial for the expansion of China's quant sector, which is the world's second-largest and increasingly relies on artificial intelligence. The trend highlights a shift in global talent acquisition, driven by both opportunities in China and challenges for foreign students in America. (not investment advice)</p>

          <h2>California Regulators Clarify Tesla's Planned Car Service Must Use Human Drivers</h2>
          <div class="timestamp">2025-07-25 21:18:01 EDT</div>

          <p>California state regulators have clarified that Tesla is not authorized to operate a public robotaxi service with autonomous vehicles. While the company plans to expand a "friends and family" car service in the Bay Area, the California Public Utilities Commission stated this service must use non-autonomous vehicles with human drivers, similar to a traditional limousine service. Tesla currently holds a permit for testing autonomous vehicles with a safety driver present but cannot charge fees. The clarification comes as Tesla faces a separate DMV accusation of misleading consumers about the capabilities of its "Full Self-Driving" technology.</p>

          <p>Inter Miami owner Jorge Mas has publicly criticized Major League Soccer for its "draconian" decision to suspend star player Lionel Messi and teammate Jordi Alba for one game. The suspension was enforced because both players, who were voted into the MLS All-Star game, chose to skip the event, citing the need for rest. According to league rules, unapproved absence from the All-Star game results in a one-match ban for the player's club. MLS Commissioner Don Garber acknowledged it was a difficult decision but stated the league had to enforce its long-standing policy, though he added it would be reevaluated.</p>

          <p>The United Kingdom's warmest and sunniest spring on record has resulted in a thriving population of certain insects, including ladybirds, butterflies, and wasps. The Royal Horticultural Society noted a boom in aphids, a key food source for ladybirds, which has benefited their predators. Butterfly Conservation also reported an "extraordinary" year for early sightings of numerous butterfly species, a stark contrast to the record lows of the previous year. However, experts caution that the relative lack of rain could negatively impact insect and amphibian numbers next year due to dry conditions affecting egg-laying habitats.</p>

          <p>An Illinois judge has dismissed a lawsuit filed by the Trump administration that challenged Chicago's "sanctuary city" policies, which limit cooperation between local police and federal immigration agents. The lawsuit, filed in February, argued that Chicago's ordinance illegally thwarts federal immigration enforcement. In her ruling, Judge Lindsay Jenkins granted the city's motion to dismiss the case. Chicago's mayor and Illinois' governor both praised the decision, stating that it affirms the legality of the city's welcoming ordinance and enhances public safety by allowing local police to focus on community needs.</p>

          <p>A new exhibit at the New York Historical Society examines the Hollywood blacklist, a dark period in American history that began in the late 1940s. The exhibit focuses on the "Hollywood Ten," a group of writers and directors who were jailed and blacklisted for refusing to answer questions from the House Un-American Activities Committee about alleged Communist ties. It showcases the personal and professional impact on individuals like screenwriter Dalton Trumbo and pianist Hazel Scott. The exhibit raises enduring questions about free speech, political persecution, and democracy in the United States.</p>

          <p>Wildlife biologists in Texas are undertaking a mission to save the state's dwindling bighorn sheep population, which has been decimated by disease. After a disease outbreak wiped out about 50% of the sheep in the last five years, a team captured dozens of healthy sheep from the state's last disease-free herd. The animals, including pregnant ewes, were airlifted over 200 miles to an isolated, disease-free mountain range. A recent check on the relocated herd brought promising news, as biologists observed a group that included several newborn lambs, offering hope for the species' recovery.</p>

          <p>This article explores the validity and necessity of popular health benchmarks, such as drinking eight glasses of water, getting 10,000 steps, and sleeping eight hours a night. Experts suggest that while these targets provide useful guidance, individual needs can vary significantly. For instance, a kidney specialist argues that thirst is a reliable guide for hydration for most healthy people, while a nutritionist points to the benefits of a water target for preventing symptoms like fatigue. Most experts agree that consistency and a holistic approach are more important than rigidly adhering to specific numbers, advocating for adapting recommendations to fit one's own lifestyle.</p>

          <p>A scientific revolution is underway in women's sports, focusing on how the female body is uniquely affected by elite athletic activity. Researchers are studying topics that were once taboo, such as the impact of the menstrual cycle on performance, the biomechanics of breast movement, and the reasons for a higher risk of certain injuries like ACL tears. This new focus moves away from treating female athletes as "mini-men," leading to better support, including properly fitted sports bras and training adjustments. The goal is to improve performance, reduce injuries, and keep more women and girls engaged in sports.</p>

The "Gifts to Reduce the Public Debt" program has existed for decades, accepting payments through various means, but the addition of Venmo offers a modern, convenient option. The national debt currently stands at over $36 trillion and has grown annually since 2001 under both Democratic and Republican administrations. Since 1996, patriotic citizens have voluntarily contributed over $67 million, a small fraction of the government's daily spending.</p>

          <p>Twenty-five years after "Big Brother" first aired in the UK, a growing number of social experts are suggesting that reality television may have positive societal impacts. While often criticized as superficial, the genre has historically featured more demographic diversity than other media, potentially increasing social understanding. By showcasing ordinary people in unfiltered situations, reality TV has sparked national conversations on topics from disability to coercive control. Despite valid concerns over participant welfare, some studies suggest these shows can influence viewer behavior and provide valuable insights into social dynamics.</p>
