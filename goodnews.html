          <p>Thirteen-year-old Faizan Zaki from Allen, Texas, emerged as the winner of the 2025 Scripps National Spelling Bee, succeeding after being the runner-up in the previous year's competition. Zaki correctly spelled "eclaircissement" to secure the title, outlasting eight other spellers in the final rounds. The competition saw moments of suspense as other finalists misspelled words, creating opportunities for Zaki to clinch the victory, which he ultimately seized with confidence and precision. The Scripps National Spelling Bee is an annual event in the United States that brings together students from across the nation to test their spelling skills on a progressively challenging list of words, and it marked its 100th anniversary this year. Optimism surrounds the future for Faizan Zaki as he continues his education. </p>

          <p>The White House has acknowledged problems in a report spearheaded by U.S. Health and Human Services Secretary Robert F. Kennedy Jr. titled "Make America Healthy Again," which criticized America's food supply, pesticides, and prescription drugs. The report, which cited hundreds of studies, contained formatting issues, citation errors, and some studies that did not appear to exist, leading to concerns about its accuracy. Despite these issues, the White House maintains confidence in Kennedy and says the report will be updated, describing it as a transformative assessment of the chronic disease epidemic affecting the nation's children. The White House has requested additional funding for Kennedy's initiative. </p>

          <p>China has reached an agreement to resume imports of seafood from Japan, which were halted two years ago due to concerns over the discharge of wastewater from the Fukushima Daiichi nuclear power plant. The agreement was reached during a meeting in Beijing, and exports will begin once China completes the necessary procedures. The agreement is based on China's participation in water sampling missions as part of the International Atomic Energy Agency. China had banned Japanese seafood imports in 2023, citing potential risks to the fishing industry and coastal communities in eastern China. </p>

          <p>Japan has stated it has no intention of purchasing defense equipment from the United States in exchange for the easing of tariff measures, according to a minister on Friday. Defense Minister Gen Nakatani emphasized that tariff negotiations and security issues are separate matters, and any purchase of defense equipment would be based on Japan's needs for peace and security. Nakatani's remarks followed comments from Japan's chief tariff negotiator suggesting that purchases of U.S. defense equipment could help reduce the trade deficit and be used as a bargaining chip in trade talks. Nakatani is scheduled to discuss the issue with U.S. Defense Secretary Pete Hegseth at the Asia Security Summit in Singapore. </p>

          <p>An Alaska man, Kell Morris, survived being pinned facedown in an icy creek by a 700-pound boulder for three hours with only minor injuries, thanks to his wife's quick thinking and a stroke of luck. Morris' wife held his head above water to prevent him from drowning while waiting for rescuers to arrive after the boulder crashed onto him during a hike near Godwin Glacier. A sled dog tourism company overheard the 911 dispatch and offered its helicopter to ferry rescuers to the scene, which was inaccessible to all-terrain vehicles. Rescuers used inflatable airbags and brute force to lift the boulder off Morris, who was then airlifted to a hospital and later released unscathed. </p>
