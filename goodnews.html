          <p>A rare dust storm swept through the Chicago area, reducing visibility to near zero and prompting the National Weather Service to issue its first dust storm warning for the city. The storm, caused by high winds blowing over dry farmlands, disrupted travel and graduation ceremonies. While skies cleared within 30 to 45 minutes, the event was described as something out of the history books. The incident marks only the second time the Chicago office has issued a dust storm warning.</p>
