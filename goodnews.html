          <div class="timestamp">2025-07-11 16:06:51 EDT</div>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Bitcoin's price surged to a new record, briefly exceeding $118,000, driven by the largest single-day inflow into Bitcoin ETFs for the year. This rally was also supported by significant inflows into Ether ETFs and a wave of short liquidations totaling over $550 million. The market's momentum is attributed to institutional investment and expectations of a more dovish Federal Reserve policy, with analysts suggesting only a major macroeconomic event could suppress the current upward trend. For the week, Bitcoin is poised for a nearly 10% gain. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>During a Mets-Orioles game, broadcaster and former player Keith Hernandez had a close call when a foul ball flew directly past his head in the SNY booth, an event he was completely oblivious to until after it happened. A replay showed Hernandez looking down and only reacting to the sound of the ball hitting the wall behind him, much to the amusement of his fellow commentators. Play-by-play announcer Gary Cohen humorously noted that Hernandez, a renowned defensive player in his day, could have been seriously injured had the ball been slightly more on target.</p>

          <p>Jannik Sinner delivered a commanding performance to defeat Novak Djokovic in straight sets, ending the veteran's quest for a record 25th Grand Slam title and securing his first Wimbledon final. The 23-year-old Italian will now face defending champion Carlos Alcaraz in a highly anticipated rematch of their recent five-set French Open final. Djokovic, 38, acknowledged the physical toll of age after the match but stated his intention to return to Wimbledon at least one more time. The final guarantees a continuation of the Sinner-Alcaraz rivalry that has dominated recent Grand Slam tournaments.</p>

          <p>A U.S. District Judge has issued a temporary restraining order preventing the Los Angeles Police Department from using less-lethal munitions like rubber bullets and chemical irritants against journalists covering protests. The ruling came in response to a lawsuit filed by press rights organizations, which argued that LAPD officers deliberately targeted reporters during recent demonstrations against the Trump administration's immigration policies. The order explicitly protects journalists who are not posing an imminent threat and forbids police from obstructing their work, marking a significant, albeit temporary, victory for press freedom advocates.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>The U.S. government recorded a rare budget surplus of $27 billion in June, a significant shift from the previous month's $316 billion deficit. This unexpected surplus was largely driven by a sharp increase in government receipts, which were bolstered by a 301% year-over-year surge in customs duties from tariffs. Despite this monthly surplus, the fiscal year-to-date deficit still stands at $1.34 trillion. Persistently high interest payments on the national debt remain a major challenge, totaling $84 billion for the month, second only to Social Security spending. (not investment advice)</p>
