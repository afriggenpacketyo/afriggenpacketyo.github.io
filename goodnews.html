          <p>Top White House economic advisor Kevin Hassett expressed optimism that the ongoing government shutdown is likely to conclude this week. He indicated that moderate Democrats might soon vote to reopen the government, allowing for policy negotiations to resume through the regular process. However, Hassett also warned that if an agreement is not reached, the Trump administration is considering stronger measures to compel Democrats to cooperate and end the partisan stalemate over federal funding priorities. The conflict centers on Republican desires for a short-term resolution versus Democratic demands for additional healthcare spending.</p>

          <p>Experts confirm that the 74 million Americans receiving Social Security benefits will continue to get their monthly checks even if the U.S. government shuts down, as the program is funded through mandatory spending. However, the Social Security Administration's operational budget requires congressional approval, meaning a shutdown could disrupt other key services. With a significant portion of its workforce potentially furloughed, activities such as benefit verifications, earnings record corrections, and issuing replacement Medicare cards could be temporarily halted until a funding agreement is reached.</p>

          <p>U.S.-listed companies involved in the rare earth supply chain, such as MP Materials and USA Rare Earth, saw their stock prices climb in premarket trading. This investor optimism is driven by ongoing efforts in the United States to establish a domestic supply chain for these critical minerals, thereby reducing reliance on China, which currently dominates global production. Rare earths are essential components for modern technology, including semiconductors and electric vehicle motors, making their sourcing a matter of strategic economic and national security.

          <p>Financial experts predict that 30-year mortgage rates, which have fallen from their peak at the start of the year, are likely to remain in the mid-6% range through the end of 2025. The future direction of rates is closely tied to key economic indicators like inflation and labor market data, as well as upcoming Federal Reserve policy decisions. However, the ongoing government shutdown could delay the release of this crucial data, creating uncertainty in the market and potentially impacting forecasts for homebuyers and those looking to refinance.

          <p>Tomas Chamorro-Premuzic, a business psychology professor at Columbia University, highlights that mastering emotional intelligence is more beneficial for career success than simply being authentic. He identifies three critical social skills: actively soliciting and gracefully accepting honest, critical feedback to understand one's true performance. Another key skill is developing social awareness by focusing more on others' needs and perspectives. Finally, he emphasizes the importance of adaptability, which involves stepping outside one's comfort zone to learn new skills and grow professionally.</p>

          <p>This article provides an overview of the factors that determine the price of gold, a commodity often viewed as a safe-haven asset during economic turmoil. Its value is influenced by fundamental principles of supply and demand, global economic conditions, inflation rates, and geopolitical uncertainty. Furthermore, the strength of the U.S. dollar and central bank policies, such as large-scale purchases or sales of gold reserves, play a significant role in its market fluctuations. As of October 17, 2025, the price was reported at $4,263.85 per ounce. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>Financial commentator Jim Cramer strongly advises against investing in "meme stocks," describing the practice as a speculative and dangerous strategy for long-term wealth building. He compares it to a game of musical chairs where investors buy overpriced assets hoping to sell them to a "greater fool" before the price collapses. Cramer advocates for a more traditional investment approach focused on buying and holding shares in fundamentally sound, best-of-breed companies that can deliver consistent growth over decades, rather than chasing short-term victories based on internet hype.

However, analysts remain cautiously optimistic, as the sector still contends with red flags in subprime auto lending, the costly transition to electric vehicles, and persistent economic uncertainty that could impact future performance.</p>

          <p>Taiwan's military has implemented new rules of engagement for its troops to counter the increasing threat of drone incursions from mainland China. The recently released National Defence Report details a four-step standard operating procedure: identification and monitoring, followed by an alert and notification, a safety confirmation, and finally, defensive firing. This updated protocol is designed to improve readiness and provide clear guidelines for soldiers facing frequent drone activity near Taiwan's main island and its outlying territories like Kinmen and Matsu.</p>

        </div>
        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>This article delves into why bread from countries like France is often perceived as superior to American bread, attributing the difference to legal standards. A 1993 French law mandates that traditional bread sold in a "boulangerie" must be made fresh daily using only four ingredients: flour, water, a leavening agent, and salt. In contrast, mass-produced bread common in the U.S. often contains dozens of ingredients, including dough conditioners and preservatives, prioritizing shelf life and production speed over the development of complex flavors that come from time and simpler recipes.</p>

          <p>The new documentary "Listers" provides a humorous and insightful look into the subculture of extreme bird-watching by following two brothers attempting a "big year"—a quest to identify as many bird species as possible in 12 months. Beyond the comedic journey, the film serves as a critical examination of how social apps like eBird are transforming hobbies. It explores the corrosive side of gamification, where the joy of the activity itself can be overshadowed by the competitive drive to accumulate stats and climb digital leaderboards.</p>
