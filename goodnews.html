          <p>Two hikers were rescued via helicopter from a remote beach at Point Reyes National Seashore after becoming trapped by rising tides. The pair realized their only exit was cut off and called for emergency services. A Sonoma County Sheriff's Office helicopter crew was dispatched to perform a hoist rescue, lifting the hikers to safety using a 100-foot line. No injuries were reported in the incident. Officials used the event to remind visitors of the coastline's dangers, including unpredictable tides and lack of cell service, advising them to check tide charts and carry satellite communication devices.</p>

          <p>Australia will acquire 11 Mogami-class frigates from Japan's Mitsubishi Heavy Industries in a landmark defense deal valued at approximately $6.5 billion. The agreement represents the largest-ever defense industry contract between the two nations and is a significant step in Australia's military restructuring to counter China's regional influence. Australian Defense Minister Richard Marles described the stealthy, next-generation warships as the best capability for the country's needs. The deal marks Japan's first warship export since before World War II, signaling a shift in its post-war pacifist stance on defense equipment sales.</p>

          <p>United Parcel Service (UPS) will pay $1.7 million to settle a lawsuit from 45 California counties alleging the company improperly disposed of hazardous materials. An investigation found that UPS had discarded corrosive, ignitable, and toxic waste into regular trash bins, which were then sent to landfills not equipped to handle such materials. The lawsuit stated these actions posed a risk of dangerous chemical reactions and environmental harm. UPS cooperated with the investigation and has since implemented new waste management systems and employee training programs across its California facilities to address the issue.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>August marks the beginning of tarantula mating season in Southern California, a period when male spiders actively leave their burrows in search of mates. This behavior makes sightings more common, particularly during dusk and nighttime in desert, chaparral, and mountain areas. Experts note that while the spiders can travel up to 20 miles, they are generally harmless to humans unless provoked. Their primary defense mechanism involves flicking irritant hairs, which can cause a rash, rather than biting. Popular viewing locations include Joshua Tree National Park, Griffith Park, and Anza-Borrego Desert State Park.</p>

          <p>A five-foot-long water monitor lizard named “Goose,” who had been missing for weeks, has been safely captured in Webster, Massachusetts. The reptile was spotted by a resident in Douglas State Forest, who photographed it and alerted authorities. An animal rescue group, Rainforest Reptile Shows, set up baited traps with eggs and chicken, successfully luring the lizard inside. Goose was reported to be in good health and is now in the care of the rescue organization, pending a full veterinary examination. The successful capture marks a happy conclusion to the weeks-long search for the wayward animal.</p>

          <p>Wealthy businessman and first-time political candidate Stephen J. Cloobeck is launching a $1.4 million television advertising campaign for his California gubernatorial bid. The ad buy covers every major California market and also includes airtime in New York City and Washington, D.C., aiming to boost his name recognition in a crowded field. Cloobeck, a conservative Democrat and prolific party donor, made his fortune in the timeshare industry and is self-funding his campaign. His early spending spree comes as the race for governor remains wide open following former Vice President Kamala Harris's decision not to run.</p>

          <p>Philadelphia Eagles running back Saquon Barkley has declined an invitation to serve on President Trump's revitalized council on sports, fitness, and nutrition. Barkley, who was among a list of prominent sports figures invited, stated that he felt he would be too busy to participate effectively. The council is being re-established as part of an executive order that also brought back the Presidential Fitness Test for children. Barkley, who has golfed with both President Trump and former President Barack Obama, emphasized his respect for the office but ultimately decided against accepting the position on the council.</p>

          <p>Archaeologists have discovered the remains of an auroch, an extinct species of large wild cattle, in a cave in the Yorkshire Dales, England. The discovery was made during a survey of caverns near Ingleborough as part of a project exploring the region's prehistoric use. The team also found evidence of the cave system being used for human burials during the Neolithic period. These findings provide new insights into how early inhabitants lived and farmed in the area. The project highlights the crucial role of recreational cavers, who often make initial archaeological discoveries in hard-to-access underground locations.</p>

          <p>Shares of American Eagle Outfitters surged over 20% after President Trump praised the company's new marketing campaign featuring actress Sydney Sweeney. In a social media post, Trump endorsed the ad, which had drawn some online criticism for its wordplay on "genes" and "jeans," calling it the "HOTTEST" ad out there. The president's comments contrasted the campaign with what he termed "woke" advertising by other companies. This endorsement fueled a meme-driven rally for the retailer, which has been facing financial difficulties, including a recent withdrawal of its full-year guidance due to slow sales.</p>

          <p>An American Eagle advertising campaign featuring actress Sydney Sweeney has sparked a significant social media debate and drawn comments from President Trump.

American Eagle has defended the campaign, clarifying it was always about their denim jeans, and has seen its stock price soar amid the heightened publicity and controversy.</p>

          <p>New research from the American Cancer Society indicates that a rise in colorectal cancer screenings among people aged 45-49 is leading to more early-stage diagnoses. Following recommendations to lower the screening age from 50 to 45, screening rates in this age group increased by 62% from 2019 to 2023. This correlated with a significant jump in the detection of localized, more treatable cancers. While researchers called the findings promising, they noted that screening rates for this younger demographic remain suboptimal and inequitable, particularly based on education and insurance status.</p>

Cramer noted that the financial strength, diverse revenue streams, and controlled expenses of these tech giants make them resilient forces in the market.

Emma Ambler has campaigned for reform since her family was killed in 2020 by her sister's partner, who had lied on his shotgun application. The new rules, effective August 5, require more referees for applicants, mandatory checks with partners for signs of domestic abuse, and greater scrutiny of an applicant's honesty. Ambler believes these changes are a meaningful step toward preventing similar tragedies from occurring in the future.</p>
