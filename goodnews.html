          <p>The Transportation Security Administration (TSA) has announced that most American travelers will no longer need to remove their shoes during airport security screenings, ending a post-9/11 ritual. This policy change reflects significant progress in security technology, particularly the rollout of advanced 3D CT scanners that can reliably detect explosives. The article frames this development as a marker of a broader decline in the threat of large-scale terrorism in the West, even while acknowledging that new threats from domestic extremism and civil liberties concerns about surveillance persist.</p>

          <p>When 13-year-old Micah complained of chest pains, his mother, a heart transplant recipient herself, sought immediate medical help, leading to a shocking discovery. Micah was diagnosed with Danon disease, a rare genetic condition causing severe heart failure, and was found to be near sudden cardiac death. After receiving a pacemaker and a heart transplant, Micah and his mother, who learned she also had the disease, launched Transplant Teenz. This non-profit provides a virtual support community for teenagers nationwide who are awaiting organ transplants.</p>

          <p>One year after China's Chang'e-6 mission returned the first-ever samples from the far side of the moon, a scientific debate is raging over their age. Chinese scientists have dated the rocks from the South Pole-Aitken basin at 4.25 billion years old, a finding that could reshape our understanding of the moon's early history. However, this conclusion, based on direct evidence, was reportedly rejected twice for publication in the journal Nature by a review panel of Western scientists. The dispute highlights ongoing tensions and differing interpretations within the international planetary science community.</p>

          <p>This article argues that modern society overly restricts children's movement, hindering their physical and cognitive development. It contrasts the sedentary lives of many kids with the natural, "wild" play of young animals, suggesting that free play is essential for building healthier bones, better cognitive skills, and mental well-being. The author, citing injury-prevention experts, posits that preventing children from engaging in activities like climbing trees or running down slopes out of fear of injury can be counterproductive. Such experiences are crucial for developing a robust "movement vocabulary" that makes them more resilient and less prone to injury later in life.</p>

          <h2>Author of 'Rich Girl Nation' Explains How Beauty Costs Can Hinder Women's Financial Goals</h2>

          <p>Katie Gatti Tassin, author and founder of "Money with Katie," argues that the recurring costs of beauty maintenance create a "hot girl hamster wheel" that can be an insidious force in women's financial lives. She points out that expenses for hair, nails, and skincare are investments in a "depreciating asset," requiring continuous spending to maintain an appearance that society often rewards. Tassin advises women to conduct a "hot girl detox" by annualizing these costs to understand their true financial impact and then experimenting with opting out to reclaim money, time, and mental energy for goals like debt repayment and investing.

          <p>The recent tragic deaths of young campers in the Texas floods has prompted a reflection on the fundamental purpose of summer camp. The author, who grew up at a Girl Scout camp, argues that these environments are designed to teach children courage and resilience by allowing them to face small challenges in a safe setting. While the Camp Mystic disaster is a camp director's "worst nightmare," it shouldn't deter parents from giving their children these life-changing experiences. The article posits that camp is preparation for life's trials, and learning to be brave, even when scared, is its most important lesson.</p>

          <p>While many college students believe a finance degree offers the best career prospects, recent data on employment rates suggests otherwise. A survey by the CFA Institute found high student confidence in finance, but data from the New York Fed shows that recent graduates in fields like art history and nutritional sciences have lower unemployment rates. Furthermore, majors such as theology and philosophy have better employment outcomes than economics. This trend is partly fueled by the rise of AI, which is increasing demand for humanities graduates with creative thinking and other "soft skills" that are harder to automate.

Astrophysicists explain that black holes are not cosmic vacuum cleaners but are essential to the formation of galaxies, a relatively new understanding confirmed by the James Webb Space Telescope. The article also touches on the different types of black holes, the theory that some form from collapsed gas clouds, and the unsettling concept of "spaghettification" for anything that falls past their event horizon.</p>

When the AIDS crisis devastated her community, she provided food, shelter, and care for those abandoned by their families. Rep.

Through installations like a series of bus stops depicting past, present, and imagined futures, the exhibition aims to engage visitors emotionally and intellectually.

          <p>The new "Superman" film has become a target in the culture wars, with critics decrying it as "superwoke" because director James Gunn acknowledged the character's immigrant story. This article argues the backlash is overblown, as Superman has always been an immigrant from the planet Krypton, a fact often referenced in past media. The film itself tells a story of assimilation and heartland values, where Clark Kent's heroism comes from his Kansas upbringing, not his alien origins. The author suggests the character has never been politically radical and that the current debate ignores the story's core themes of kindness and choice.</p>
