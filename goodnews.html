          <p>Toni, a popular pygmy hippo, has successfully moved from the Berlin Zoo to her new home in Mulhouse, France, where she will join another hippo named Voobadee. The Berlin Zoo confirmed the smooth transfer, expressing hopes for the pair to produce offspring within the next two years. Toni gained viral fame after her birth video, and her name was chosen by her high-profile sponsor, footballer Antonio Rüdiger. This move is part of conservation efforts for pygmy hippos, an endangered species with fewer than 2,500 remaining in the wild.</p>

          <p>Lego reported a flourishing first half of 2025, with revenue increasing by 12% to a record $5.44 billion, primarily fueled by its popular botanical-themed bricks and strategic brand collaborations. The Danish toymaker saw consumer sales grow by 13%, attributing this success to its diverse and innovative product range appealing across various age groups. New partnerships with Formula 1 and the animated series "Bluey" significantly boosted sales, with a multiyear collaboration with Pokémon also planned for next year. Lego's expanded physical presence, with 24 new stores opened, further solidified its position as the world's largest toymaker.</p>

          <p>Taylor Swift's engagement to Travis Kelce is seen as an existentially fitting moment, given her career-long exploration of love and marriage in her lyrics since her teenage years. From early hits like "Love Story" to more recent tracks, the motif of "forever love" has been central to her identity as an artist. The article highlights the tension between her ambition and societal expectations of marriage, a theme she has addressed in songs like "Midnight Rain" and "Lavender Haze." Kelce appears to be the answer to her long-standing lyrical questions about finding a partner who embraces her fame and intellect.</p>

          <h2>New Research Fuels Debate on Effectiveness of Unrestricted Cash Transfers to the Poor</h2>
          <div class="timestamp">2025-08-27 13:30:00 EDT</div>
        </div>
        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Recent studies on basic income initiatives, which gained traction as a solution for economic justice, have found that unrestricted cash transfers to the poor did not consistently produce lasting improvements in mental health, stress, or financial well-being. This has sparked renewed debate on the policy's merit, with critics on the right questioning its efficacy and advocates on the left emphasizing its role in poverty reduction and basic security, not as a cure-all. While some optimism for cash transfers has waned, ongoing experiments and broader research still highlight their importance in providing material support, keeping families housed, and improving health outcomes.</p>

          <p>Cracker Barrel Old Country Store's shares surged over 8% after the company announced it would scrap its controversial new logo and reinstate the original design, following widespread public criticism and an intervention from President Donald Trump. The stock rebound helped recover losses incurred since the new logo was first unveiled, which many customers deemed "generic" and "soulless." Trump publicly congratulated the company on its decision, which was influenced by a YouGov poll showing 76% of Americans preferred the old logo. This move underscores the significant impact of consumer sentiment and political figures on corporate branding.</p>
