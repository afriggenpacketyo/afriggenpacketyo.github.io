During their conversation, they discussed the importance of maintaining hope in a political climate often characterized by negativity and "darkness." Mamdani, a democratic socialist, stated it was an honor to speak with the former president and that he views Obama as an example of how to navigate political criticism. The call signals a level of engagement from the Democratic establishment as Mamdani prepares for the general election in the nation's largest city.</p>

          <p>The new horror film "Weapons," from writer-director Zach Cregger, is being praised for its compelling and unsettling story about a group of third-graders who mysteriously vanish from their homes one night. The article analyzes how the movie successfully provides answers to its central mystery, revealing a supernatural villain and delivering a cathartic, action-packed climax. However, it also explores the film's deeper themes, suggesting that vanquishing evil does not erase the trauma it causes, leaving the characters and community with lasting grief. The review highlights the film's unique structure and powerful performances, calling it a rare horror masterpiece that resonates emotionally.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>The health care sector emerged as the week's top performer in the stock market, buoyed by a rebound in Eli Lilly and Berkshire Hathaway's disclosure of a new stake in UnitedHealth Group. In contrast, the technology, consumer staples, and utilities sectors all posted negative returns for the week as the market saw a rotation out of momentum-driven stocks. The weakness in consumer staples was partly driven by Amazon's expansion of its grocery delivery service, which impacted stocks like Walmart and Target. Investors are now looking ahead to the Federal Reserve's annual symposium for signals on future interest rate policy. (not investment advice)</p>

        </div>
        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>The new film "East of Wall" is a docu-fiction feature that tells the story of a struggling ranch family in South Dakota, starring a real-life mother and daughter playing versions of themselves. The article praises the film for its authentic portrayal of cowgirl hardiness and the challenges of life on the open plains, capturing both the beauty and severity of their environment. While the narrative is shaped by writer-director Kate Beecroft, the movie's strength lies in the lived-in performances of its non-professional leads, Tabatha and Porshia Zimiga. The review notes that the film effectively explores themes of independence, grief, and resilience in a modern Western context.</p>

          <p>A recent survey reveals that nearly 60% of U.S. adults are making the repayment of credit card debt a top financial priority, as average interest rates climb close to 22%. With national credit card debt exceeding $1.2 trillion, many Americans are seeking effective strategies to manage and eliminate their balances, though nearly half carry debt on more than one card. The article outlines several approaches for tackling this debt, including debt management plans through credit counseling, negotiating settlements with creditors, and consolidating multiple balances into a single loan. These methods aim to simplify payments and reduce the overall cost of borrowing for consumers.</p>

          <p>Taylor Sheridan, the creator of the hit series "Yellowstone," is partnering with Paramount to open a large-scale film and television production campus in Fort Worth, Texas. The 450,000-square-foot facility will be the largest in the state and is expected to become the home base for Sheridan's productions, such as "Landman" and "Lioness." This venture represents a significant boost to the Texas entertainment industry, which recently increased its film incentive program to $1.5 billion over the next decade. The new studio is part of a 27,000-acre development owned by billionaire Ross Perot Jr.'s real estate company, Hillwood, which is also a partner in the project.</p>

          <p>This article provides a comprehensive ranking of the many film and television adaptations based on the legal thrillers of author John Grisham. The list evaluates nine different productions, from classic 1990s films like "The Pelican Brief" and "The Firm" to more recent television series based on "The Rainmaker." Each adaptation is assessed on its quality, casting, and faithfulness to the spirit of Grisham's signature underdog stories. The ranking places Alan J. Pakula's "The Pelican Brief" at the top, praising its pacing and charismatic leads, while the 2012 TV version of "The Firm" is ranked last for failing to capture the propulsive nature of the original story.</p>

          <p>Shares of UnitedHealth Group experienced their best single-day performance since 2008, jumping over 14% after Warren Buffett's Berkshire Hathaway revealed it had acquired a significant stake in the company. The investment, valued at about $1.6 billion, is seen as a major vote of confidence in the embattled health insurer, which had seen its stock fall nearly 50% this year amid a Justice Department investigation and lowered earnings outlook. Other prominent investors, including Michael Burry and David Tepper, also disclosed new positions in the company. The news provided a major boost to the Dow Jones Industrial Average and signaled a potential turning point for the stock. (not investment advice)</p>

          <h2>Swarm of Over 130 Small Earthquakes Shakes Northern California Geothermal Field</h2>
          <div class="timestamp">2025-08-15 12:39:48 EDT</div>
        </div>
        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>A series of more than 130 small earthquakes, with the largest reaching magnitude 4.0, has been recorded in Northern California's Geysers geothermal steam field. According to the U.S. Geological Survey, such earthquake swarms are common in this area, which is one of the world's most productive geothermal power facilities. The seismic activity is believed to be induced by the operations of the power plant, which involves withdrawing steam and injecting cold water deep underground, causing the surrounding rock to contract and shift. Officials state that these small, localized quakes do not pose a significant hazard compared to the major regional fault lines like the San Andreas.</p>
