          <p>The California Department of Corrections and Rehabilitation (CDCR) is reviewing hundreds of parole hearings to determine if faulty drug tests led to wrongful denials. Nearly 6,000 drug tests in California prisons are believed to have yielded false positives between April and July of the previous year. The review will assess whether there was sufficient evidence to deny parole without the positive drug screening. UnCommon Law, a nonprofit advocacy group, said the review involves at least 459 parole hearings and dozens of administrative reviews. </p>

          <p>Chinese authorities are cracking down on scams targeting the national college entrance examination, or gaokao, particularly those claiming AI can predict questions. The Ministry of Education, the Cyberspace Administration of China, and the Ministry of Public Security jointly announced a campaign to investigate and clean up "illegal and harmful information" related to the exams. Mock papers claiming AI prediction are being sold online at inflated prices. Some social media accounts are claiming access to "top secret" information from teachers involved in setting the papers. </p>
