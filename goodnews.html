          <p>Apple has committed to investing an additional $100 billion in U.S. manufacturing over the next four years, bringing its total domestic investment pledge to $600 billion. The announcement was made at the White House alongside President Trump, who praised the move as a step toward making iPhones in America. The investment is seen as an effort by Apple to avoid the administration's threatened tariffs, as the company relies heavily on a global supply chain and has been shifting some production to countries like India to mitigate trade war impacts.

          <p>The UK government has announced plans for a major crackdown on the non-surgical cosmetics industry to protect consumers from "dodgy" practitioners. The new proposals include a licensing scheme requiring clinics to meet strict safety and training standards to offer procedures like Botox and fillers. Additionally, the most high-risk treatments, such as non-surgical Brazilian butt lifts (BBLs), will be restricted to qualified health professionals only, following growing concerns over dangerous complications and at least one death linked to the unregulated procedure.</p>

Dr. Jo Saxton stated that uncertainty around international student numbers is making UK undergraduates more valuable to universities, who see them as a source of stability for financial planning. This increased flexibility comes as universities have made more offers this year, making it a particularly favorable environment for local applicants.</p>

Despite his impressive performance, which included a season-high eight strikeouts, the team's bullpen was unable to secure the win, giving up four runs in a 5-3 loss. The article notes that while Ohtani continues to excel on the mound, his offensive numbers have seen a dip since he resumed pitching, raising questions about the demands of being a modern two-way player.</p>

          <p>Financial markets widely anticipate that the Bank of England will cut its main interest rate from 4.25% to 4%, which would be its fifth reduction since last August and bring borrowing costs to a two-year low. A rate cut would offer some relief to homeowners with variable-rate mortgages but would mean lower returns for savers. The expected move comes despite inflation remaining above the Bank's 2% target, as signs of a cooling labor market and sluggish economic growth appear to be weighing on the decision.

          <p>New archaeological research indicates that survivors of the AD 79 eruption of Mount Vesuvius returned to live among the ruins of Pompeii. This evidence suggests that a precarious settlement, described as a "favela among the ruins," existed at the site until the 5th century. It is believed that some survivors who could not afford to relocate, possibly joined by others, settled in the upper floors of buried homes, salvaging valuable materials from the devastated city. This discovery changes the long-held understanding that the site was completely abandoned after the cataclysmic event.</p>
