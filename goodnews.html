          <p>President Donald Trump announced plans for the "Golden Dome" missile defense shield, an ambitious project to expand the country's air defense system, aiming for completion by the end of his term. The system, intended to protect against "catastrophic attacks," faces logistical and financial challenges, with cost estimates ranging from $175 billion to $542 billion. Trump stated that the Golden Dome would intercept missiles from anywhere in the world, even from space, using next-generation military technology. Defense Secretary Pete Hegseth hailed the project as a "game changer" and a generational investment in American security. </p>

          <p>Shinjiro Koizumi has vowed to address concerns about high rice prices upon being appointed as the new farm minister in Japan. This follows the resignation of Taku Eto due to public outrage over his insensitive comments about receiving free rice amid rising prices. Koizumi's appointment signals the government's attempt to regain public trust and tackle the pressing issue of food affordability. The new minister's focus will likely be on stabilizing rice prices and supporting local farmers' interests in a challenging economic climate. </p>

          <p>Chengdu, an inland city in southwestern China, is experiencing a surge in population and a booming real estate market as young workers seek alternatives to the hypercompetitive coastal megacities. Once derided for its slower pace, Chengdu has become known as "China's happiest city," attracting those disillusioned with the intense work culture and high living costs of cities like Shanghai and Shenzhen. The city's economy, driven by the service sector and entertainment, has been relatively insulated from the trade war with the United States. With rising housing prices and a vibrant cultural scene, Chengdu represents a shift in priorities for young Chinese professionals. </p>

          <p>The European Union is providing ‚Ç¨5.5 million in emergency funding to Radio Free Europe/Radio Liberty (RFE/RL) after the Trump administration suspended US public funding. The EU's Foreign Policy Chief, Kaja Kallas, emphasized the significance of Radio Free Europe in resisting authoritarian regimes, noting its historical role in delivering news to people under communist rule. The funding will focus on countries in regions such as Central Asia and the Caucasus, supporting independent journalism in a time of growing unfiltered content. Radio Free Europe's lawyers have challenged the decision to cut their funding in court, but a federal appeals court blocked a temporary pause on Trump's order. </p>
