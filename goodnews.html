          <p>Costco reported fiscal fourth-quarter earnings and revenue that surpassed Wall Street expectations, driven by strong growth in membership income and e-commerce sales. The warehouse retailer has successfully attracted a younger customer base, with nearly half of its new members being under the age of 40. This growth is attributed to the company's value proposition, expanding merchandise selection, and improved online shopping options. The company's full-year revenue saw an 8.1% increase, demonstrating its resilience and appeal to value-conscious consumers across different age groups. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>President Trump signed an executive order approving a deal that allows TikTok to continue operating in the United States, averting a potential ban. The agreement establishes a new U.S.-based joint venture, valued at approximately $14 billion, with parent company ByteDance retaining less than a 20% stake. U.S. investors, including Oracle, will hold a majority stake and control the board, with Oracle also overseeing the app's security and hosting American user data. This arrangement is designed to satisfy the national security requirements of a law passed by Congress mandating that ByteDance divest its U.S. operations.</p>

          <p>An industry analysis from Cox Automotive has revised the 2025 U.S. new vehicle sales forecast upward to 16.1 million units, citing stronger-than-expected consumer demand. This surprising boost is attributed to buyers acting preemptively due to fears of future price increases from potential tariffs and the expiration of federal electric vehicle tax credits. While this has benefited automakers like General Motors and Toyota in the short term, analysts predict the sales pace will likely slow in the fourth quarter. The trend highlights how policy uncertainty is currently influencing consumer purchasing behavior in the automotive market. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>Newly released architectural renderings offer a more detailed preview of the 90,000-square-foot ballroom currently under construction in the White House's East Wing. The project, announced by the Trump administration, will have a seated capacity of 650 and is being funded by private donors and the president. Corporate donors, including Google and Lockheed Martin, have reportedly pledged nearly $200 million for the construction, which began on the South Lawn earlier this month. The new structure will be significantly larger than the main White House building itself, marking a major addition to the executive residence.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Following the Federal Reserve's recent interest rate cut, the estimated monthly payment for a new $40,000 home equity line of credit (HELOC) has become more affordable. With average rates now around 7.88%, a 10-year HELOC would cost approximately $483 per month, while a 15-year term would be about $379 per month. These costs are lower than they were earlier in the year and significantly less than last fall. Because HELOCs have variable rates, borrowers could see their payments decrease further if the Fed continues to cut rates as is widely expected. (not investment advice)</p>

It contrasts his explosive style with that of his father, Louis Ginsberg, a more formal and modest poet who was also published in the magazine. The piece highlights the mutual respect between the two, noting how Louis recognized the power in his son's poem "Howl," despite its "dirty, ugly words." It concludes by quoting Allen's moving introduction to his father's work, showcasing a deep familial and artistic connection.</p>

Solomon acknowledged arguments on both sides of the issue, noting that less frequent reporting could encourage a longer-term business focus but would also reduce transparency for investors. The idea, which could be implemented by the SEC, has drawn varied responses from business leaders. While some, like JPMorgan's Jamie Dimon, have long criticized the short-term pressures of quarterly reporting, the debate over the optimal cadence for financial disclosure remains unsettled.

          <p>For the first time, a United Nations political declaration addressing non-communicable diseases has pledged to combat dementia. This inclusion is being hailed as a "watershed moment" by advocates, as it formally recognizes dementia as a major global health challenge alongside conditions like cardiovascular disease and diabetes. The move is particularly significant for lower-income countries where awareness and support for dementia are often lacking. While the declaration is a crucial first step, advocates emphasize that the next challenge will be ensuring that governments worldwide implement tangible public health campaigns and support systems for patients and caregivers.</p>
