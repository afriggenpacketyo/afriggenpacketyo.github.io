          <p>Germany's 50+1 rule, in place since 1999, ensures club members retain control over their professional football clubs, preventing external investors from gaining complete control. The rule stipulates that the parent club must hold at least 50 percent plus one vote in its spun-off professional football company. While it protects fan culture and promotes equality, critics argue it puts German clubs at a financial disadvantage compared to clubs in other countries with greater investor involvement. Exceptions exist for clubs like Bayer Leverkusen and VfL Wolfsburg, which have received continuous support from companies for over 20 years.</p>

          <p>UK inflation remains at 3.4%, the highest in over a year, with food prices continuing to rise, particularly for chocolate, which saw a record increase of 17.7% due to bad weather and mismanagement in cocoa-producing regions. Some economists speculate that businesses are passing on increased employer National Insurance payments to customers. Rising food inflation was partially offset by cheaper travel prices, with air fares falling by 5% between April and May. Chancellor Rachel Reeves maintains the government is investing in Britain's renewal, while shadow chancellor Mel Stride expresses concern about the impact on families.</p>

          <p>The White House is emphasizing President Trump's consistent opposition to Iran acquiring nuclear weapons amid criticism from various political factions. A series of clips on X showcase Trump's statements over the years, reiterating his stance on preventing Iran from developing nuclear capabilities. Vice President JD Vance has defended Trump's position, asserting that it focuses on using the American military to achieve American goals. Trump's earlier actions, such as withdrawing from the Iran nuclear deal in 2018, further demonstrate his commitment to preventing Iran from obtaining nuclear weapons.</p>

Lee's decision marks a shift towards dialogue and cooperation with North Korea, contrasting with his predecessor's emphasis on "peace through strength."

          <p>President Trump has falsely claimed that undocumented immigrants are a key voting bloc in Democratic cities like Los Angeles, used to expand the voter base and cheat in elections. Los Angeles County election officials refute this claim, stating that safeguards are in place to ensure only eligible voters cast ballots. Registering to vote requires attesting under penalty of perjury to being a U.S. citizen and a resident of California, with verification processes in place. Claims about undocumented immigrants voting have been repeatedly debunked, with researchers finding voter fraud to be virtually nonexistent.</p>

          <p>A US federal judge has blocked the Trump administration's ban on gender-neutral passports, ruling that the policy likely violates constitutional rights by discriminating on the basis of sex. The ruling orders the State Department to continue issuing passports with "X" as a gender designation to transgender US citizens. The Trump administration had ordered passports to only show the applicant's gender at birth. The White House has responded by claiming that the ruling was an attempt to thwart President Trump's agenda and push radical gender ideology.</p>

          <p>NATO, the North Atlantic Treaty Organization, was formed in 1949 to deter Soviet expansion in Europe after World War II. The organization, which currently has 31 members, acts as a collective security alliance, providing mutual defense through military and political means if a member state is threatened by an external country. Article 5 of the charter outlines the collective defense clause, which has been invoked once: by the United States in the wake of the 9/11 attacks in 2001. Three countries are currently categorized as "aspiring members:" Bosnia-Herzegovina, Georgia and Ukraine.</p>
