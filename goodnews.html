          <p>Music superstar Mariah Carey is releasing her sixteenth studio album, "Here for It All," after a seven-year hiatus, a project deeply influenced by personal grief and healing. The album was created while she was mourning the deaths of her mother, Patricia Carey, and her estranged sister, Alison, who passed away on the same day last year. Carey describes the album's sound as both new and classic, reflecting her journey of processing these profound losses and finding creative renewal. She also collaborated with artist Anderson .Paak on several tracks, including the upcoming single "Play This Song."</p>

          <p>Kathleen Corradi, appointed by Mayor Eric Adams in 2023 as New York City's first-ever director of rodent mitigation, has resigned from her post. Known as the "rat czar," Corradi was tasked with tackling the city's persistent rodent problem, overseeing a $3.5 million budget aimed at public awareness and mitigation strategies, including rat birth control. During her tenure, there was a noticeable decrease in rat-related complaints to the city's 311 service line. Mayor Adams praised her creative approach to the complex task and affirmed that the city's efforts to combat its estimated 3 million rats will continue unabated as Corradi transitions to a different role within the city government.</p>

          <p>Shares of the Canadian-based Lithium Americas surged by over 100% following reports that the Trump administration is seeking an equity stake in the company. The proposal emerged during renegotiations of a $2.2 billion Department of Energy loan for the company's Thacker Pass mine in Nevada, a major future source of lithium. This move is part of a broader White House strategy to secure direct ownership in critical mineral supply chains vital to U.S. interests, particularly for electric vehicle battery production. The potential deal aims to reduce taxpayer risk while supporting a key domestic resource project. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>Sales of newly constructed homes in the U.S. experienced a significant and unexpected increase of 20.5% in August compared to the previous month, marking the highest level since January 2022. This surge occurred even as average 30-year fixed mortgage rates remained elevated, suggesting strong underlying demand or the impact of builder incentives. While some analysts caution that the data is volatile and subject to revision, the report indicates robust activity in the housing market. The strong sales figures have reduced the inventory of new homes to a 7.4-month supply, down from a 9-month supply in July. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>Peter Mutharika has won Malawi's presidential election, ousting the incumbent Lazarus Chakwera in a victory driven by widespread public frustration over severe economic hardship. Over the past five years, Malawi has seen poverty and inflation rates soar, issues attributed to overspending, food shortages, and mismanagement. The new president faces immense pressure to stabilize the nation's finances, restore fiscal discipline, and implement effective policies to lower the cost of living. Citizens and analysts alike are cautiously optimistic but emphasize that tangible economic relief, not just promises, will be the ultimate measure of the new administration's success.</p>

          <p>Emergency officials on Maui conducted door-to-door evacuations and activated warning sirens as a wildfire spread to over 100 acres near the north shore town of Paia. The fire prompted fears of a repeat of the devastating 2023 Lahaina blaze, causing significant alarm among residents. However, firefighters successfully worked to halt the fire's forward progress, allowing officials to lift the evacuation orders later in the day. Unlike the 2023 disaster, which was exacerbated by extreme winds, conditions were less severe this time, though the incident served as a terrifying reminder of the island's vulnerability to wildfires.</p>

          <p>Meta CEO Mark Zuckerberg announced that Instagram has achieved a major milestone, reaching 3 billion monthly active users. This places the photo-sharing app, which Meta acquired for $1 billion in 2012, in the same user-base echelon as the company's other flagship platforms, Facebook and WhatsApp. The last publicly disclosed figure for Instagram was in October 2022, when it had surpassed 2 billion monthly users. The growth underscores Instagram's continued dominance in the social media landscape and its critical role within Meta's family of apps, which collectively serve a significant portion of the global population.</p>

          <p>A personal finance column advises a 55-year-old man who is facing a layoff, holds $1 million in cryptocurrency, and has not filed taxes for two decades. The advice strongly urges him to immediately hire a CPA and address the tax situation with the IRS, noting that while the IRS typically only requires the last six years of returns to be in good standing, he may have forfeited years of potential refunds. The article also discusses retirement strategies, including using the IRS "rule of 55" for penalty-free 401(k) withdrawals. It assesses his overall financial health as strong enough to retire, despite the significant tax issue that needs urgent resolution. (not investment advice)</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Using the James Webb Space Telescope, astronomers have identified a massive and mysterious object in the early universe that could be a primordial black hole. If confirmed, this discovery would challenge the standard cosmological model, which posits that stars formed before black holes. Primordial black holes are theorized to have formed from quantum fluctuations shortly after the Big Bang, predating any stars. While further observation is needed to verify its nature, the object's existence in a region with little surrounding matter supports the hypothesis. The finding could force a significant revision of our understanding of cosmic evolution.</p>

          <p>Tom Brady has responded to criticism regarding his dual roles as a minority owner of the Las Vegas Raiders and a broadcaster for Fox, positions some believe create a conflict of interest. Critics argue his access to other teams as an analyst gives the Raiders an unfair advantage. In his newsletter, Brady dismissed these concerns as products of paranoia and distrust, stating that his passion for football creates a moral duty to improve the game, not a conflict. He asserted that the intersection of his roles is where his ethical responsibility emerges, reframing the potential dilemma as a commitment to the sport's growth.</p>

The primary satellite, NASA's Interstellar Mapping and Acceleration Probe (IMAP), will study the outer boundary of our solar system and give a 30-minute heads-up on solar events, crucial for protecting astronauts on future moon missions. The other satellites will focus on Earth's outer atmosphere and provide continuous solar wind measurements for forecasting.

          <p>NFL Commissioner Roger Goodell has indicated that the league could start renegotiating its media rights deals as early as 2026, well before the current agreement's 2029 opt-out clause. The existing 11-year, $111 billion deal with partners like Disney, Amazon, and Fox could be revisited to capitalize on the ever-increasing value of live sports content. Goodell noted the rapidly changing media landscape as a reason for seeking flexibility, suggesting that both the league and its media partners may be incentivized to secure a new long-term agreement sooner. An updated deal could significantly boost league revenue, impacting team valuations and player salary caps. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>Avani Yaltho, a high school senior from Houston, has won the grand prize in NPR's Student Podcast Challenge for her entry, "The Things We Buried." The podcast is a moving reflection on the cultural and communal losses experienced over generations due to urbanization and globalization in Kerala, India, where her grandparents grew up. Through interviews with her family, Avani contrasts the open, communal village life of the past with the more isolated, fenced-in reality of today. The narrative beautifully explores themes of memory, change, and the longing for a connection to a way of life that has largely disappeared.</p>
