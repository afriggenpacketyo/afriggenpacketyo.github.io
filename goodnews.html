          <p>A U.S.-brokered ceasefire between Israel and Hamas has culminated in the release of the final 20 living Israeli hostages in exchange for Palestinian prisoners. The event coincided with a visit from President Donald Trump, who addressed the Israeli Knesset before attending a peace summit in Egypt. As part of the diplomatic efforts, Egypt awarded Trump its highest state honor for his role in ending the two-year conflict. The remains of four deceased hostages were also returned to Israel for forensic identification.</p>

          <p>England manager Thomas Tuchel has praised the high potential of forward Marcus Rashford but also issued a warning, urging him not to end his career with regrets about what could have been. Rashford, currently on a season-long loan at Barcelona from Manchester United, has shown promising form with three goals and five assists in ten games. Tuchel emphasized that while Rashford possesses the qualities to be one of the world's best players, he must consistently perform at his peak to match his potential. The 27-year-old is looking to revitalize his career after falling out of favor at his parent club.</p>

          <p>Amazon has announced its intention to hire 250,000 seasonal workers for the upcoming holiday shopping season, marking the third consecutive year the company has added at least a quarter of a million temporary staff. The hiring plan contrasts with an expected overall decline in seasonal retail jobs, which is projected to hit its lowest level since 2009 due to higher business costs and increased automation. Amazon stated that its seasonal positions will pay an average of over $19 per hour. Other major retailers like Kohl's and Target have been more cautious, not specifying their exact hiring numbers for the season.</p>

          <p>A major milestone in the U.S.-brokered Gaza peace plan was reached as all living Israeli hostages were exchanged for nearly 2,000 Palestinian prisoners and detainees, sparking emotional celebrations on both sides. The exchange marks the first phase of a plan to end the two-year war, which has left Gaza devastated. U.S. President Donald Trump, present in the region for a peace summit, declared a "historic dawn in a new Middle East" during an address to Israel's parliament. Despite the progress, significant challenges remain for future negotiations, including the disarmament of Hamas and the long-term governance of Gaza.</p>

          <h2>Analysis: Gaza Ceasefire Provides Trump with Major Diplomatic Victory</h2>

          <p>The recently brokered ceasefire in Gaza is being framed as a significant diplomatic achievement for President Donald Trump, who took a celebratory victory lap during a peace summit in Egypt. The deal, which ended two years of intense conflict, has earned him widespread praise, but analysts caution that the most difficult phases of the peace plan are yet to come. Key challenges include the disarmament of Hamas and the reconstruction of Gaza, which depend on sustained international pressure and cooperation. The ultimate success of the peace plan may hinge on future political dynamics within Israel, particularly concerning Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu's approach to the broader Israeli-Palestinian conflict.</p>

          <p>Alma Cocina Latina, a restaurant in Baltimore, is introducing diners to the unique and aromatic flavors of Venezuelan cuisine through a concept its founder calls "culinary diplomacy." The key to its authentic taste lies in specific Venezuelan peppers, such as ají dulce, which are difficult to source in the U.S. and are now being locally grown by a Maryland farmer specifically for the restaurant. Founder Irena Stein and her chefs aim to expose customers to the rich cultural and migratory history of Venezuela through its food. The distinct peppers provide a fragrant, floral, and fruity base that is essential to the nation's dishes.</p>

          <p>U.S. stocks saw a significant rebound on Monday, recovering from a sharp plunge at the end of the previous week. The market's recovery was largely driven by President Trump's more conciliatory tone regarding trade tensions with China, after he had previously announced a steep 100% tariff on Chinese imports. On Sunday, the president suggested on social media that "all will be fine" with China, easing investor fears of an escalating trade war. Analysts noted that while the immediate crisis appears to have been averted, the market remains sensitive to potential trade flare-ups.</p>

          <p>DuPont is set to spin off its electronics business, to be named Qnity Electronics, on November 1, a move analysts believe will unlock significant shareholder value. Qnity is heavily focused on the semiconductor industry, providing critical technology solutions for chip manufacturing, and is expected to benefit from long-term growth in AI, 5G, and automotive electrification. The analysis suggests that as an independent company, Qnity could command a higher valuation multiple, similar to its pure-play industry peers. Management projects that Qnity will outpace the industry's growth rate, driven by its deep customer relationships and integral role in developing leading-edge chips. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>Ecuadorian cumbia emerged in the late 1960s as a unique musical genre that blended traditional Andean rhythms, like the San Juanito, with rural Colombian cumbia. Pioneered by musicians such as Polibio Mayorga, this new sound created a cultural identity for provincial migrants moving to the country's urban centers. The genre was later popularized nationwide by artists like Medardo Luzuriaga and his orchestra. Today, the style continues to evolve with modern forms like tecnocumbia, performed by popular all-female groups such as Tierra Canela, which mix Indigenous rhythms from Ecuador and Peru into a danceable, mass-market product.</p>
