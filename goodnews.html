          <p>Hong Kong's equity capital markets are experiencing a significant resurgence, with new listing volumes jumping eightfold to $14 billion in the first half of the year, positioning the city to potentially become the world's largest listing destination. This surge is primarily fueled by Beijing's regulatory support for mainland companies to dual-list, a slower pace of A-share listings, abundant market liquidity, and concerns over delisting from U.S. exchanges. Chinese firms are increasingly leveraging Hong Kong listings to fund their globalization strategies, benefiting from the Hong Kong dollar's greater fungibility. This renewed enthusiasm marks a notable turnaround after years of subdued IPO activity, reflecting improved market valuations and policy tailwinds. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>A missing wing flap from a Delta Air Lines Boeing 737-900 jet was unexpectedly discovered in a Raleigh, North Carolina, driveway, prompting a Federal Aviation Administration investigation. The part belonged to Delta Flight No. 3247, which landed safely at Raleigh-Durham International Airport after departing from Atlanta. Despite the unusual occurrence of a wing component detaching mid-flight, no injuries were reported among the 109 passengers and six crew members on board. The incident, which happened after the flight experienced delays due to a thunderstorm, is now under full cooperation from Delta as authorities seek to understand the cause.</p>

        </div>
        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>A new study published in The Lancet Oncology indicates that a specific type of hormone therapy, combining estrogen and progestin, increases breast cancer risk in women under 55 who still have a uterus. In contrast, estrogen-only therapy was found to reduce breast cancer risk in women who have had a hysterectomy. This research provides updated insights, notably refining findings from the problematic early 2000s Women's Health Initiative study, which had previously led to widespread misunderstandings about hormone therapy safety. Experts now stress the importance of personalized medical consultation to determine the most appropriate treatment, considering individual health and family history.</p>

          <p>A federal judge in Washington, D.C., has invalidated a Trump administration policy that aimed to deny asylum access to migrants crossing the southern border. U.S. District Judge Randolph D. Moss ruled that President Trump exceeded his legal authority, asserting that neither the Constitution nor federal immigration law grants the President unilateral power to restrict asylum rights. This proclamation, enacted on Trump's first day in office, was challenged by immigrant rights advocacy groups who argued it imperiled thousands fleeing violence. The decision underscores the established legal framework for asylum in the U.S., which has been a component of federal law since 1980.</p>

Despite having a strong contingent of candidates, the team did not surpass the five-starter record held by legendary teams like the 1976 Cincinnati Reds. The remaining spots for pitchers and reserves on the 32-man rosters will be determined by a vote among MLB players and the commissioner‚Äôs office, offering a chance for additional Dodgers to be selected for the July 15 game.</p>

In reciprocity, Vietnam will grant the United States "TOTAL ACCESS" to its markets, imposing zero tariffs on US products. The agreement also includes a steeper 40% tariff on "trans-shipping" goods, which senior trade advisor Peter Navarro alleges are Chinese products routed through Vietnam to circumvent tariffs. This deal follows a trend of companies relocating manufacturing from China to Vietnam to avoid earlier Trump tariffs, aiming to address trade imbalances and secure new market access for US goods.
