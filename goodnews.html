          <p>The B-2 bomber pilots who conducted a recent strike on Iranian nuclear facilities have been advised to maintain a low profile during their July Fourth visit to the White House. President Trump, who invited the pilots to be celebrated as heroes, has claimed the mission "obliterated" Iran's nuclear program. However, for security reasons, no public ceremony is planned and the pilots' identities will not be disclosed. The visit follows a dispute over the mission's effectiveness, with initial intelligence assessments suggesting a more limited setback for Iran than the administration has publicly stated.</p>

          <p>President Trump and the first lady are scheduled to meet with Edan Alexander, a U.S.-Israeli citizen recently freed after being held hostage by Hamas for 19 months. The meeting will take place in the Oval Office with Alexander's family. The 21-year-old from New Jersey was abducted on October 7, 2023, while serving in the Israeli military. His release last month was met with widespread celebration, and the president spoke with him directly via phone call at the time, promising to take good care of him and acknowledging his mother's persistent advocacy for his freedom.</p>

          <p>A U.S. district judge has ruled against the Trump administration's suspension of asylum processing at the U.S.-Mexico border, stating the president exceeded his authority. Judge Randolph Moss determined that declaring an "invasion" to unilaterally ban asylum claims is unlawful and supplants immigration laws enacted by Congress. The ruling, which gives the administration 14 days to appeal, could require officials to resume processing asylum seekers. The decision stems from a lawsuit filed by asylum seekers and immigrant rights groups after the administration abruptly closed the border to legal applicants upon taking office.</p>

          <p>Amazon has announced it will discontinue its free, ad-supported streaming service, Freevee, in August. The service, which launched in 2019, offered a collection of original series and movies through a standalone app. Going forward, Freevee's content will be integrated into Amazon's Prime Video platform, where it will remain available to watch for free with ads, even for users without a Prime subscription. This move is intended to consolidate Amazon's video offerings and create a simpler viewing experience for customers, following the recent introduction of ads to the main Prime Video service.</p>

If the band members comply with all conditions for a six-month probationary period, the case against them will be dropped.</p>

Through this dreamlike narrative, the film critiques how gentrification and poor governance threaten the island's unique identity, music, and people.

Industry leaders and unions praised the decision, stating it will help stimulate production that has slowed due to strikes and studio spending cuts.
