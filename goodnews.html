          <p>J Balvin delivered a vibrant performance at the Forum in Inglewood, showcasing his reggaeton hits with a DJ and a dynamic dance crew. The artist performed 40 songs, including tracks from his creative album "Colores," demonstrating his ability to blend pop sensibilities with denbow rhythms. The concert featured a mix of solo hits and collaborations with other artists like Farruko, Zion & Lennox, and Cardi B, although none of the collaborators appeared on stage. The show was a high-energy experience for the audience, who enthusiastically engaged in 'perreo' sessions despite the venue's strong air conditioning.</p>

          <p>U.S. and Chinese delegations are engaged in sensitive tariff talks in Switzerland, aimed at de-escalating trade tensions between the world's two largest economies. The talks, led by Treasury Secretary Scott Bessent and Chinese Vice Premier He Lifeng, concluded for the night and will resume Sunday. The goal is to scale back tariffs imposed by both countries, potentially relieving financial markets and companies dependent on U.S.-China trade. President Trump has suggested the U.S. could lower tariffs, while Chinese officials have called for the U.S. to drop its tariffs first.</p>

          <p>As negotiations intensify for President Trump's tax agenda, key issues are emerging that could impact millions of Americans. The House Ways and Means Committee has released a preliminary bill, but it may undergo significant changes. Republicans aim to pass the package without Democratic support through reconciliation, which requires adherence to a limited budget framework. The narrow Republican majority in the House and demands for fiscal responsibility could complicate the process and affect individual provisions.</p>
