          <h2>Future of FIFA's Club World Cup Uncertain Amid Ambitions for Expansion</h2>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Following the conclusion of the recent Club World Cup, FIFA is considering a significant expansion of the tournament to 48 teams by 2029. While FIFA President Gianni Infantino's vision has been met with some hostility from players' unions, the substantial $1 billion prize fund has ensured top clubs' participation and interest. Commercial success, particularly from clubs like Real Madrid, is fueling discussions about making the event more frequent, though FIFA currently has no plans for a biennial tournament. Concerns over player welfare, scheduling, and qualification processes remain unresolved as FIFA plots the future of the competition.</p>

          <p>This archival article from July 16, 2005, reports on the designation of Macau's historic center as a UNESCO World Heritage site. The decision was seen as a significant boost to Macau's efforts to diversify its image beyond being solely a gambling destination. The 29 recognized sites, which include a blend of Portuguese and Chinese architecture, were celebrated for their role in the early encounters between Eastern and Western cultures. At the time, Macau's Chief Executive Edmund Ho Hau-wah described the collection of landmarks as a "unique, peerless jewel" that now ranks alongside sites like the Great Wall of China.</p>

          <h2>UK Government Updates Sex Education to Include Anti-Misogyny and Consent</h2>
          <div class="timestamp">2025-07-15 02:41:23 EDT</div>
        </div>
        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>New government guidance for schools in England will update the relationships, sex, and health education (RSHE) curriculum to address contemporary issues. Pupils will be taught to recognize misogyny, understand the harms of AI-generated "deepfakes," and learn about unhealthy attitudes towards consent. The guidance also emphasizes teaching students to identify positive male role models and requires schools to proactively share curriculum materials with parents. While previous plans for strict age limits on topics have been dropped, the new framework outlines what should be taught in primary versus secondary school, with full implementation by 2026.</p>

          <p>In a highly anticipated NBA Summer League game, Bronny James delivered one of his strongest performances, though the Los Angeles Lakers ultimately fell to the Los Angeles Clippers 67-58. James scored 17 points with five rebounds and five assists, demonstrating growing confidence on the court while his father, LeBron James, watched from the sidelines. Despite his efforts, the Lakers struggled with poor shooting and turnovers. The main star of the game was Clippers forward Jordan Miller, whose 19 points and clutch shooting in the final quarter secured the victory for his team.</p>

          <p>To encourage the transition from petrol and diesel vehicles, the UK government is introducing a new grant scheme offering discounts of up to £3,750 on new electric cars. The discounts, funded by a £650 million program, will apply to eligible vehicles costing up to £37,000 and are expected to be available at dealerships within weeks. While the move is welcomed by manufacturers, critics and some drivers argue that the primary barrier to EV adoption is the lack of sufficient public charging infrastructure. The government has a target of banning the sale of new fossil fuel cars by 2030.</p>

          <p>World number one golfer Scottie Scheffler's dominant season can be traced back to his decision to hire putting coach Phil Kenyon in late 2023. At the time, Scheffler was statistically one of the worst putters on the PGA Tour despite being the best from tee to green. Kenyon helped Scheffler with his green reading and grip, but a crucial switch to a mallet-style putter proved to be the turning point. Within a year, Scheffler's putting rank surged, and he went on a remarkable run, winning seven events, including his second Masters and an Olympic gold medal.</p>

In the first half of the year alone, 166 new ETFs were launched, putting the country on pace to surpass its 2021 record of 277. This surge, part of a broader global trend, has been encouraged by streamlined approval processes and reduced fees from Chinese regulators. The majority of these new funds track domestic stock indexes, reflecting growing investor appetite for accessible and diversified market exposure. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>China's economy expanded by 5.2% in the second quarter, slightly exceeding forecasts but slowing from the previous quarter's 5.4% growth. While the figure keeps Beijing on track to meet its annual 5% target, underlying weaknesses are causing concern. Retail sales growth slowed, and the real estate slump deepened, fueling deflationary pressures and calls for more significant government stimulus. Economists note that while exports have been resilient, this is largely due to price-cutting, which erodes trade terms and points to fragile domestic demand that may require deeper structural reforms.

          <p>A U.S. appeals court has temporarily blocked the Trump administration's plan to end Temporary Protected Status (TPS) for nearly 12,000 Afghans. The protections, which were set to expire, allow them to work legally in the U.S. and shield them from deportation. The administration had argued that conditions in Afghanistan had improved enough for their return, a claim disputed by immigrant advocacy groups. The court's stay provides a brief reprieve while it considers the case, highlighting the precarious situation for many of the 180,000 Afghans who fled to the U.S. after the Taliban's return to power.</p>

          <p>Norway has become a global leader in the transition to electric vehicles, with EVs now accounting for over 93% of new car sales in 2025. This remarkable shift is the result of long-term, consistent government policies that heavily favor electric cars. Key incentives include exemptions from high purchase taxes and VAT, reduced fees for roads and parking, and access to bus lanes. The country has also heavily invested in a robust public charging network, making EV ownership practical and financially advantageous, effectively taxing gasoline and diesel cars out of the market.</p>

This sustainable approach aims to significantly reduce the construction sector's carbon footprint, as mass timber buildings produce far lower emissions than those made from steel or concrete.

          <p>New research from Tel Aviv University provides the first evidence that animals respond to sounds produced by plants. Scientists found that female moths avoided laying eggs on tomato plants that were making ultrasonic noises associated with distress, such as dehydration. Two years ago, the same team first showed that plants emit these high-frequency sounds, which are inaudible to humans but perceptible to insects and some mammals. This discovery opens up a vast, unexplored field of potential acoustic communication within ecosystems, suggesting animals may use plant sounds to make decisions about pollination, feeding, or shelter.</p>
