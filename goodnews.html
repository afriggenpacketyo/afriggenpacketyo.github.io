          <p>Many millennials and Gen Zers are finding financial security elusive despite increases in their net worth, as they navigate a landscape of rising costs and increased responsibility for retirement funding. Experts argue that the financial struggles of young Americans are largely structural rather than behavioral, with traditional markers of success becoming increasingly difficult to achieve. As a result, young adults are adapting by living with their parents longer, sharing child care, and seeking new ways to build community. The article highlights the growing disparity between generations and the challenges faced by young people in achieving financial stability.</p>

Trump criticized the current pricing system as exploitative, stating that the U.S. subsidizes healthcare for other countries. The policy, dubbed ‚Äúmost favored nation,‚Äù seeks to level the global pharmaceutical playing field, but it is expected to face strong opposition from the pharmaceuticals industry, which argues it could limit access to vital care for Medicare patients. The Rand Corporation found that the U.S. paid significantly more for drugs than other wealthy democracies in 2022.</p>

          <p>The US and China have agreed to a truce, lowering import taxes on goods traded between the two countries, marking a major de-escalation of their trade war, according to the BBC article. The agreement involves canceling some tariffs and suspending others for 90 days, reducing US tariffs on Chinese imports from 145% to 30% and Chinese tariffs on some US imports from 125% to 10%. China has also halted non-tariff countermeasures, such as the export of critical minerals to the US. Talks are set to continue, with both countries expressing a desire to avoid decoupling, though uncertainty remains about the long-term outcome.</p>

          <p>The United States and China have agreed to temporarily reduce tariffs to defuse their ongoing trade war, acknowledging the economic strain on companies and consumers, according to the New York Times article. The agreement involves suspending tariffs for 90 days and continuing negotiations, with the U.S. reducing tariffs on Chinese imports to 30 percent and China lowering import duties on American goods to 10 percent. The move aims to restore trade and prevent a potential recession, but some analysts remain skeptical about the long-term commitment and potential for lasting agreement.</p>
