          <div class="timestamp">2025-06-28 19:19:11 EDT</div>
        </div>
        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Scientists studying a distant galaxy cluster have discovered ancient radio signals that traveled for 10 billion years to reach Earth. The signals originate from a "mini-halo," a vast cloud of high-energy particles and magnetic fields, which has never been observed at such a great distance before. This discovery, made using the LOFAR radio telescope, challenges previous timelines for cosmic events, suggesting that processes like supermassive black hole activity or cosmic particle collisions were energizing galaxies much earlier in the universe's history than previously thought. The finding opens a new window into understanding the evolution and formation of early galaxy clusters.</p>

          <p>Amazon founder Jeff Bezos and journalist Lauren S√°nchez were married in a lavish ceremony in Venice, Italy, attended by a host of high-profile guests. The event drew celebrities such as Leonardo DiCaprio, Oprah Winfrey, and Tom Brady, who gathered for festivities that began on Thursday. The wedding has not been without controversy, as the large influx of wealthy guests prompted a "No Space for Bezos" protest campaign from local residents concerned about over-tourism and rising costs. This is the second marriage for both Bezos and S√°nchez, who finalized their previous divorces in 2019.</p>

          <p>Despite the Los Angeles Dodgers losing 9-5 to the Kansas City Royals, Shohei Ohtani delivered his most impressive pitching performance of the season. In a limited two-inning start as he recovers from Tommy John surgery, Ohtani showcased dominant velocity, including a career-hardest 101.7-mph fastball that induced an inning-ending double play. He threw 20 strikes out of 27 pitches and retired the side in the second inning, demonstrating the potent combination of speed and breaking pitches that defines his two-way talent. While the Dodgers' bullpen struggled after his departure, Ohtani's outing was an encouraging sign for his continued recovery and contribution on the mound.</p>

          <p>According to computer scientist Harry Shum, former head of AI at Microsoft, China is rapidly catching up to the United States in the field of AI algorithms, even as it lags in chip technology. Speaking at a summit, Shum noted that the U.S. maintains a clear and significant lead in semiconductor production, a gap that will take years to close. However, he highlighted that China is making significant strides in algorithm engineering, citing the Chinese startup DeepSeek, which has achieved results comparable to top U.S. models using far less computing power. This suggests China is effectively innovating to overcome hardware constraints in the global AI race.</p>

State park officials reported that the woman suffered non-life-threatening cuts to her leg and foot. Although she did not see what bit her, experts who examined photos of the wounds concluded the bites were most likely from a juvenile sand tiger shark. Following the incident, swimming was temporarily suspended at the beach, but it resumed the next morning after drone and lifeguard surveillance of the water found no further signs of dangerous marine life.</p>

The lawsuit was filed by the five men‚ÄîYusef Salaam, Raymond Santana, Kevin Richardson, Antron McCray, and Korey Wise‚Äîwho were wrongfully convicted in a 1989 assault case.

Markets initially reacted to news of U.S. strikes on Iranian nuclear sites, but fears subsided as investors bet the conflict would not systemically impact the U.S. economy. A key indicator was the sharp drop in oil prices after an initial surge, which eased concerns about inflation and consumer spending. This, combined with growing investor expectation of multiple Federal Reserve rate cuts by year-end, allowed major indices to post significant weekly gains. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>A new genetic analysis of skeletons from the 9,000-year-old city of √áatalh√∂y√ºk in Turkey suggests it may have been a matriarchal society where female lineage was paramount. Researchers studied DNA from over 130 individuals buried under the city's houses and found that while early burials were of family members, later burials showed genetic connections primarily through the female line. This indicates a matrilocal system, where husbands moved into their wives' households. The findings are supported by the discovery of more grave goods with female skeletons, challenging Western-biased assumptions about ancient social structures being universally patrilineal.</p>

The march was a powerful display of solidarity from Hungary's LGBTQ community and its allies, including the EU equalities commissioner and dozens of MEPs who attended.
