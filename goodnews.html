        </div>
        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>A New York judge has dismissed Justin Baldoni's $400 million defamation lawsuit against Blake Lively. The suit stemmed from Lively's claims of sexual harassment on the set of "It Ends With Us" and accusations that Baldoni initiated a smear campaign against her. The judge ruled that Baldoni failed to adequately prove Lively's threats constituted wrongful extortion and that he did not demonstrate defamation, as Lively's statements were privileged under the lawsuit. The judge also found no evidence that The New York Times acted with malice in publishing the story, but Baldoni can amend and refile allegations related to contract interference by June 23. The author's tone is neutral and informative, focusing on the legal aspects of the case.</p>
