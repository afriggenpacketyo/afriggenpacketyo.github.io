          <p>Five mainland Chinese companies, including Muyuan Foods, BASiC Semiconductor, FS.com, Shanghai Seer, and Worldwide Logistics, have submitted preliminary listing applications to the Hong Kong stock exchange. Muyuan Foods, a major pork producer, aims to raise up to US$1 billion through a secondary listing to fund its global expansion. These filings contribute to a significant surge in Hong Kong's IPO fundraising, which has already surpassed nearly 90% of last year's full-year proceeds in the first five months of 2025.

          <p>CNBC's UK Exchange newsletter reflects on Vodafone's recent performance, drawing parallels between the company's long-term disappointments and the overall state of corporate Britain. The newsletter highlights repeated claims by Vodafone's leadership of reaching an "inflexion point," which have consistently failed to materialize. Once the world's largest mobile operator, Vodafone's decline mirrors the UK's reduced global significance. The company's current strategy involves focusing on key markets and pursuing consolidation, such as its merger with Three UK, in an effort to improve investment returns.</p>

          <p>A new COVID-19 variant, NB.1.8.1, is spreading across the United States after causing a surge in cases in Asia, though it is not yet tracked on federal variant dashboards. While LP.8.1 remains the dominant strain in the U.S., NB.1.8.1 has been detected in several states and is designated as a variant under monitoring by the World Health Organization (WHO). Although current data suggests it does not cause more severe illness than other variants, it appears to be more transmissible. Current COVID vaccines are expected to remain effective against this variant, but access to vaccines is being limited by recent policy changes.</p>

          <p>A record number of puffins have been recorded on Skomer Island, a small island off the Pembrokeshire coast, despite global populations declining rapidly. Conservationists counted 43,626 puffins on the island this year, a new record, which they attribute to the abundance of food and lack of predators on the island. Skomer Island's isolation protects it from predators and human impact, contributing to the thriving seabird population. While puffins are thriving in Pembrokeshire, they are listed as vulnerable to extinction on the global IUCN Red List due to pollution, food shortages, and climate change.</p>

The law targets companies producing 100,000 tons of carbon dioxide or more annually across industries like steel and car production, accounting for nearly 60% of domestic greenhouse gas emissions. Companies will be allotted maximum emission allowances, purchasing carbon credits for emissions exceeding that threshold from companies with surpluses.

In its updated prospectus, Circle said it would sell 9.6 million shares, while existing shareholders would sell 14.4 million shares. This is a rare occurrence in tech IPOs, with Facebook's 2012 IPO being one of the few exceptions. The heavy amount of insider sales likely reflects the need for venture capital firms to gain liquidity after a period of meager returns.</p>

          <p>Tyrese Haliburton delivered a sensational performance with 32 points, 15 assists, and 12 rebounds to lead the Indiana Pacers to a 130-121 victory over the New York Knicks, giving them a 3-1 lead in the Eastern Conference finals. Haliburton's flawless triple-double, combined with Pascal Siakam's 30 points, brought the Pacers within one win of their second NBA finals appearance. The Pacers have not lost consecutive games since March 10 and hold a strong historical advantage in playoff series where they lead 3-1. The Knicks, led by Jalen Brunson's 31 points, couldn't overcome another double-digit deficit.</p>
