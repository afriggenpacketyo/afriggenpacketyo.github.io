          <h2>Ceasefire Between Thailand and Cambodia Faces Uncertainty Amid Reports of Violations</h2>
          <div class="timestamp">2025-07-29 07:13:00 EDT</div>
        </div>
        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Thailand and Cambodia have agreed to an "immediate and unconditional" ceasefire following five days of deadly border clashes that killed at least 35 people and displaced thousands. The truce, mediated by Malaysia, was met with cautious optimism, though the Thai army reported violations by Cambodian forces shortly after it took effect. Analysts suggest the conflict served domestic political goals for leaders in both nations, potentially incentivizing them to uphold the peace. However, the lack of a third-party monitoring mechanism raises concerns about the deal's long-term viability. US pressure, including threats of trade tariffs, is also believed to have played a role in bringing the two sides to an agreement.</p>

          <p>PayPal announced second-quarter earnings and revenue that surpassed Wall Street estimates, leading the company to raise its full-year outlook for earnings per share. The digital payments giant reported a 7% increase in transaction margin dollars, a key profitability metric, and a significant beat on total payment volume. A standout performer was its Venmo platform, which saw revenue grow over 20% and its highest payment volume growth rate in three years. The positive results reflect CEO Alex Chriss's strategic focus on monetizing key assets like Venmo and Braintree, even as the company's stock has underperformed the broader market this year.</p>

          <h2>UK Mobile Carrier EE to Introduce New Phone Plans with Restricted Internet Access for Teenagers</h2>
          <div class="timestamp">2025-07-29 07:11:08 EDT</div>
        </div>
        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>UK mobile network EE is launching new SIM-only phone plans designed to provide safer internet access for teenagers by filtering web content. The plans, which will be available in August, feature three tiers of protection that vary based on the user's age, with stricter controls for pre-teens. However, these content restrictions only apply when using EE's mobile data network and will not function when a device is connected to Wi-Fi. Despite this limitation, EE states it is the first major UK network to offer such dedicated plans for under-18s, which also include protections against scam calls and aim to help parents navigate the challenges of their children's smartphone use.</p>

          <p>Stassney Brown, the ex-wife of Los Angeles Chargers lineman Rashawn Slater, publicly condemned an NFL social media aggregator for framing news of his recent contract extension around their divorce. After Slater signed a historic contract making him the highest-paid lineman in the NFL, the aggregator's post on X noted the timing relative to his recent divorce. Brown responded on the platform, calling the post "deplorable" and asking to be excluded from the narrative. She emphasized that the focus should be on Slater's professional success and that he deserves to enjoy his moment without such distractions.</p>

          <p>Boeing is scheduled to report its second-quarter earnings, with analysts expecting a smaller loss compared to the same period last year. Investors are keenly focused on CEO Kelly Ortberg's outlook for the company's path back to profitability as he marks one year in the role. While Boeing has shown signs of improvement with more stable production and increased airplane deliveries, it continues to face significant challenges. These include certification delays for its 737 Max 7 and Max 10 models and a potential strike at its defense unit. The upcoming report will be a key indicator of the aerospace giant's stability and future performance.</p>

After a high-profile transfer from Tennessee, Iamaleava is focused on mastering the team's new pro-style scheme. Another major area of concern is the offensive line, which struggled last season and is now operating under the motto "Something To Prove." The defense also faces the challenge of replacing several key players who were drafted into the NFL. Coach DeShaun Foster has boldly guaranteed that strong play will bring fans back to the Rose Bowl in large numbers this season.</p>

          <p>US soccer legend Landon Donovan believes the upcoming 2026 World Cup, co-hosted by the United States, presents a massive opportunity to grow the sport and inspire a new generation of players. Drawing on his own experience from the 1994 tournament, he emphasizes the transformative power of seeing the global game up close. However, Donovan also voiced criticism over the decision by key players like Christian Pulisic to skip this summer's Gold Cup, arguing that they should prioritize the national team's growth ahead of the World Cup. He contends that while players deserve rest, the timing of their breaks should not come at the expense of crucial team-building opportunities.</p>

The trend reflects a broader shift where the most critical jobs are in designing AI systems, rather than traditional programming, which AI itself can increasingly perform.

The visit, which also included rounds of golf at his Turnberry resort and a meeting with British Prime Minister Keir Starmer, was largely focused on promoting his family's luxury properties. During the trip, Trump and Starmer reached a framework for a major trade deal between the U.S. and the European Union, though many details are still to be finalized. The new course, designed by his son Eric, adds to the Trump Organization's portfolio and serves as another example of the president using his office to promote his personal brand.</p>

          <p>A painstakingly restored de Havilland DH106 Comet, the world's first passenger jet, is on display at the de Havilland Aircraft Museum near London. The aircraft, which first flew commercially in 1952, ushered in the jet age with unprecedented speed and comfort but was plagued by a series of catastrophic design flaws. After several fatal mid-air disasters, investigations revealed that the plane's metal skin could not withstand repeated pressurization, leading to explosive decompression. The restoration project brings the pioneering jetliner's luxurious interior back to life, offering a unique glimpse into both the glamour and the tragic lessons of early commercial jet travel.</p>

The technique, which involves quickly killing and bleeding a fish, is said to improve flavor, texture, and shelf life, but has been too labor-intensive for widespread adoption in the U.S. The company's robot, named Poseidon, uses AI to identify the fish species and precisely perform the process on fishing boats. By automating this artisanal method, Shinkei hopes to make higher-quality, more humanely handled fish widely available to American consumers and has recently secured $22 million in funding to expand its operations.</p>

According to astronomers, the waning gibbous moon will be about 92% full, and its glare will wash out many of the fainter meteors.
