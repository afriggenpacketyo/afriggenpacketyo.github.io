          <p>Atlanta Braves outfielder Ronald Acuña Jr. executed a remarkable defensive play during a game against the New York Yankees, stunning spectators and analysts. After catching a deep fly ball near the warning track, Acuña unleashed a powerful, precise throw from his back foot directly to third base. The throw, which never touched the ground, caught runner Jorbit Vivas by surprise, resulting in an inning-ending double play. The play was crucial as it prevented the tying run from advancing and kept Yankees slugger Aaron Judge from coming to the plate.</p>

          <p>Dutch rider Thymen Arensman secured his first-ever Tour de France stage victory on a difficult mountain stage, delivering a win for the Ineos Grenadiers team. The day was marked by the unexpected withdrawal of top contender Remco Evenepoel, who was third overall but had to abandon the race during the ascent of the Col du Tourmalet. Overall leader Tadej Pogačar extended his lead by finishing second on the stage, just ahead of his main rival, Jonas Vingegaard. The shake-up in the general classification moved German debutant Florian Lipowitz into the third podium position.</p>

          <p>Los Angeles Dodgers third baseman Max Muncy is reportedly recovering from a left knee bone bruise ahead of schedule, providing a potential boost for the team's struggling offense. Muncy, who was injured in early July, was initially expected to miss around six weeks but has already resumed light baseball activities like running and swinging. He expressed relief that the injury was not more severe, as doctors indicated a slightly different impact could have required surgery. The Dodgers have struggled offensively in his absence, highlighting his importance to the lineup as they await his return.</p>

          <p>Twenty-eight years after the event, the British men's 4x400m relay team from the 1997 world championships has been awarded the gold medal. The team was belatedly presented with their medals at the London Diamond League meeting. The upgrade from silver occurred after the original winners, the United States, were disqualified due to a 2008 doping confession by team member Antonio Pettigrew. The athletes received a warm reception from the crowd as they were finally honored for their performance in Athens, a moment described as recognizing their talent and the values they stood for.</p>

          <p>The S&P 500 and Nasdaq saw weekly gains, buoyed by strong corporate earnings and moderating inflation data, though concerns over potential new tariffs on the EU created some drag. The June Consumer Price Index (CPI) and Producer Price Index (PPI) both came in slightly cooler than expected, supporting the case for future Federal Reserve rate cuts. The article analyzes recent earnings reports from major companies like Wells Fargo and BlackRock, noting that initial negative market reactions sometimes overlook underlying strengths. It concludes that while the tariff impact has been manageable so far, it remains a key variable for the economy. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>Bestselling author and entrepreneur Scott Galloway criticizes the common career advice to "follow your passion," arguing it's a platitude often given by those who are already wealthy. Instead, Galloway suggests that career success comes from finding the intersection of what you are good at and what can be financially rewarding. He shares his own journey, which involved enduring rejection and pivoting from his original passions to find his strengths in entrepreneurship. The article reinforces this idea with similar advice from Mastercard's CEO, emphasizing that practical skills and market opportunities are more crucial than passion alone for building a successful career.</p>

          <p>Reports indicate that FC Barcelona has opened talks to sign Manchester United forward Marcus Rashford, a move the player has reportedly favored for some time. The proposed deal would be an initial loan with an option to buy, which would help United manage its wage bill. Rashford has been training separately from the main squad following a falling out with head coach Ruben Amorim, and he has not been assigned a squad number for the upcoming season. The transfer would see the 27-year-old England international join the Spanish champions after spending his entire career at his hometown club.</p>
