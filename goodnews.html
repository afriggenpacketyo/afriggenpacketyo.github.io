        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Former Conservative minister Michael Gove indicated that a second Scottish independence referendum could occur if there is overwhelming public support for it. Gove, who oversaw relations between the UK and Scottish governments, cautioned against complacency and emphasized the need to demonstrate the union's effectiveness. His remarks align with SNP leader John Swinney's call for "demonstrable support" for independence, similar to the backing for the 1997 Scottish parliament referendum. Gove highlighted the importance of improving public services to influence the likelihood of another independence vote, yet also said that the UK government must have the power to veto any bills from Holyrood. </p>

          <p>The Menendez brothers, convicted of murdering their parents, are experiencing a shift in public perception, potentially impacting their chances of parole. Initially portrayed as greedy and entitled, claims of sexual abuse are now being viewed with more sympathy due to increased understanding of trauma. A Los Angeles judge reduced their sentence to include the possibility of parole, influenced by new evidence and media portrayals. Kim Kardashian and others have publicly supported their release, citing societal changes in understanding abuse and criminal justice. </p>

          <p>A rare dust storm swept across northwest Indiana and north-central Illinois, causing near-zero visibility and prompting the National Weather Service to issue warnings. The storm, driven by strong winds from thunderstorms, reduced visibility to a quarter-mile at Chicago Midway International Airport. This event is uncommon for the area, with the last significant dust storm in Chicago occurring during the Dust Bowl era of the 1930s. The dry soil conditions in central Illinois contributed to the severity of the storm, highlighting the impact of drought on weather patterns. </p>

          <p>The UK and EU are preparing for their first bilateral summit since Brexit, aiming to reset relations amidst global concerns about Russia, China, and US foreign policy. Despite lingering difficulties and French hardball tactics, both sides recognize the need for closer cooperation on security, defense, and trade. Key announcements are expected, including a joint declaration on shared foreign policy priorities, an EU-UK security pact, and measures to reduce trade barriers. While the UK seeks closer economic ties, Labour's red lines and the rise of the Eurosceptic Reform Party constrain ambitions, and negotiations over fishing rights and defense contracts continue. </p>
