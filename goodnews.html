          <p>The United Kingdom is set to commemorate the 80th anniversary of VE Day with a series of events spanning four days, from May 5 to May 8. Celebrations will include commemorations at the Cenotaph, a military procession featuring over 1,300 armed forces members, and a flypast by the Red Arrows. King Charles and Queen Camilla are expected to appear on the Buckingham Palace balcony and host a tea party for war veterans. Street parties and local community get-togethers are also encouraged, with many councils waiving road closure fees. Additionally, the Tower of London will feature an art installation of 30,000 ceramic poppies, and various musical performances are scheduled across the nation.</p>

Instead of hiring movers, she organized a "bucket brigade" of volunteers, and over 300 residents showed up to form two lines and pass the books hand-to-hand to the new location.

          <p>United Airlines is reducing its schedule at Newark Liberty International Airport by 35 roundtrip flights per day, which is about 10% of its daily Newark hub schedule, due to ongoing air traffic controller staffing shortages and technology problems with the FAA. CEO Scott Kirby stated that 20% of air traffic controllers for Newark were absent after technology failures, making it impossible to handle the scheduled number of planes. The FAA has acknowledged staffing issues at Newark, and United is urging the agency to implement flight restrictions similar to those at other congested airports. Transportation Secretary Sean Duffy has called for an all-new air traffic control system.</p>

          <p>Saturday's British newspapers are dominated by two main stories: Reform UK's performance in local elections and a BBC interview with Prince Harry. The Daily Mail highlights the "Reform revolution," noting the party's significant gains in local elections. The Times also focuses on Reform UK's rise, while also covering Prince Harry's interview, in which he discusses his relationship with his father. The Daily Express leads with the Prince Harry interview, while the Financial Times focuses on the local election results and their implications for the Conservative Party. The Sun dedicates most of its front page to Prince Harry's comments, describing them as an "incendiary attack on his family."</p>

          <p>A 7.4 magnitude earthquake struck off the southern coasts of Chile and Argentina, triggering a brief tsunami warning. The quake was followed by several aftershocks, prompting Chilean authorities to issue an evacuation alert for coastal areas. People in Punta Arenas evacuated calmly as sirens sounded. The earthquake's epicenter was located under the ocean south of Ushuaia, Argentina. While the tsunami warning was later canceled, officials cautioned the public to stay away from beaches.

          <p>Singapore is holding elections amidst global challenges, similar to the previous election cycle during the coronavirus pandemic. The People's Action Party (P.A.P.), in power since 1959, is widely expected to retain control, but the election will gauge the party's popularity amidst growing discontent over the rising cost of living. Opposition parties, particularly the Workers' Party, have seen increased support, advocating for a more balanced political system. Prime Minister Lawrence Wong, who recently took office, emphasizes the need for experienced leadership to navigate trade tensions and U.S.-China relations. The P.A.P. defends its track record of stability and prosperity, but many Singaporeans feel left behind economically.</p>

          <p>President Trump stated that the U.S. economy is in a "transition period" and will perform "fantastically," while minimizing the potential impact of a short-term recession. He echoed these comments on social media, citing strong employment figures and reiterating his call for the Federal Reserve to lower interest rates. Trump has faced increasing public dissatisfaction with his economic policies, particularly regarding tariffs, which economists predict will drive up inflation and slow growth. A recent poll showed a decline in Trump's approval rating, while data indicated the first quarterly GDP decline in three years.</p>

          <p>Australians are participating in a national election, with the soaring cost of living and economic uncertainty emerging as top voter concerns. Prime Minister Anthony Albanese's Labor party is in a close race with the conservative Liberal-National coalition led by Peter Dutton. Albanese has promised modest tax cuts and cheaper healthcare, while Dutton has vowed to slash fuel tax and curb gas prices. Surveys indicate that high prices are a major concern for voters, with an acute housing shortage exacerbating public discontent. President Trump's policies and influence are also playing a role in the election, with Dutton drawing criticism for echoing Trump's messaging.</p>

          <p>The Trump administration has agreed to halt its freeze on funds to Maine schools, resolving a dispute stemming from the state's support of transgender rights. The USDA had suspended funding for a child nutrition program after Maine refused to comply with demands to bar trans girls from participating in girls' sports. Governor Janet Mills challenged the administration's actions, leading to a settlement in which the USDA agreed to restore the funds. The settlement ensures that Maine will continue to receive federal funding for its child nutrition program, which serves 172,000 children.</p>

          <p>A federal judge ruled that President Trump's executive order targeting the law firm Perkins Coie is unconstitutional, permanently blocking the administration from enforcing it. Judge Beryl Howell found that the order, which sought to punish the firm for its representation of clients disfavored by Trump, violated the First, Fifth, and Sixth Amendments. Perkins Coie represented Hillary Clinton during the 2016 election and hired a research firm that produced the "Steele Dossier." Howell stated that the order sent the message that "lawyers must stick to the party line, or else," and that it was an attempt to suppress and punish certain viewpoints.</p>

          <p>The blood of a US man who intentionally injected himself with snake venom for nearly two decades has led to the development of an "unparalleled" antivenom. Tim Friede's blood contains antibodies that protect against fatal doses from a wide range of venomous snakes. Current antivenoms are species-specific, but Friede's 18-year mission could pave the way for a universal antivenom. Researchers identified two broadly neutralizing antibodies in Friede's blood that target neurotoxins found in elapids, a family of venomous snakes. The resulting antivenom cocktail protected mice from lethal doses of 13 out of 19 snake species.</p>

          <p>Australians are voting in a national election, with President Trump's influence playing a significant role. The center-right Liberal-National Coalition, which had led in the polls, has seen its support plummet since Trump took office. Opposition leader Peter Dutton's campaign echoed Trump's messaging, focusing on the economy. Prime Minister Anthony Albanese has adopted a moderate approach to Trump, refraining from direct criticism. The election results could lead to a minority government, with a third of voters opting for independents and minor parties. Trump's unpopularity in Australia has impacted the election, with distrust in the U.S. reaching a new low.</p>
