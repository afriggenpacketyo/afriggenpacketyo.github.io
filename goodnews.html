          <p>Construction of the new $9.5 billion Terminal 1 at New York's John F. Kennedy International Airport is advancing, with the first phase scheduled to open in mid-2026. This project, part of a larger $19 billion overhaul of JFK, will create the airport's largest terminal, dedicated exclusively to international flights. The design emphasizes natural light and will feature 23 gates, over 300,000 square feet of retail and dining space, and its own resilient microgrid. The development aims to modernize aging infrastructure and accommodate growing air traffic, positioning the airport for major events like the 2026 World Cup.</p>

          <p>The UK's Financial Conduct Authority (FCA) is planning a compensation scheme that could cost up to £18 billion for drivers affected by the mis-selling of car loans. The move follows a Supreme Court ruling that, while not deeming all hidden commissions unlawful, found that excessively large commissions were unfair. The FCA will consult on the details of the payout scheme, which could see most eligible individuals receive under £950, with payments potentially starting next year. The regulator stated the court's decision provides clarity on what constitutes an unfair relationship between lenders and consumers in these agreements. (not investment advice)</p>

The statement followed reports that a temporary placard referencing Trump's two impeachments had been removed from the "American Presidency: A Glorious Burden" exhibit. The Smithsonian clarified that the removal was due to the placard not meeting museum standards for presentation and was not requested by any government official. The museum affirmed its responsibility to present complete and accurate histories and will update the impeachment section in the coming weeks.</p>

          <p>China's advanced aircraft carrier, the Fujian, appears to have conducted its first take-off drill using its electromagnetic catapult system, a significant technological milestone for the nation's navy. Footage of the apparent launch was broadcast on Chinese state television as part of a series celebrating the 98th anniversary of the People's Liberation Army. The Fujian is China's first carrier equipped with this modern launch technology, which allows for the deployment of heavier and more varied aircraft compared to the ski-jump systems on its other carriers. This development marks a key step toward the vessel's expected entry into service later this year.</p>

          <p>A new report by HR technology company Checkr has identified the top U.S. cities for employment and earning potential, with mid-sized metro areas dominating the list. Raleigh, North Carolina, secured the top spot, followed by Nashville, Tennessee, and Austin, Texas, highlighting a shift in economic opportunity away from traditional coastal megacities. The ranking was based on factors like unemployment rates, labor force growth, personal income, and the percentage of high-earning households. The study suggests that cities like Salt Lake City, Omaha, and Charlotte offer a strong combination of a robust job market and a more affordable cost of living.</p>

          <h2>Parenting Experts Suggest Calming Phrases to De-escalate Children's Tantrums</h2>
          <div class="timestamp">2025-08-03 09:57:30 EDT</div>
        </div>
        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>According to a child psychology expert, parents who effectively handle tantrums often use specific phrases that validate a child's feelings and provide reassurance rather than punishment. Instead of demanding a child stop crying, phrases like "You're having a big feeling. I'm right here with you" can help ground them and calm their nervous system. Other effective approaches include affirming "I believe you" and "Your feelings make sense" to build trust and help children process their emotions. The core principle is shifting from a mindset of control to one of connection, teaching children that they are supported even during difficult emotional moments.</p>

          <p>The UK government has confirmed it is working "at pace" to implement a plan to evacuate seriously ill or injured children from Gaza to receive medical care in the UK. While the exact number is unclear, reports suggest up to 300 children could be brought over, accompanied by a guardian, following security checks. This official government initiative follows private efforts by organizations like Project Pure Hope, which has already brought three children to the UK for treatment. The move comes after a Foreign Affairs Committee report criticized the government for previously declining to support such a medical evacuation scheme amid the ongoing conflict.</p>

          <p>A magnitude 3.0 earthquake centered in Hasbrouck Heights, New Jersey, was felt across parts of the tri-state area on Saturday night. This is the second seismic event to strike the state in less than two weeks, though no immediate damage was reported from the relatively weak quake. Officials noted the tremor was felt up to 65 miles from its epicenter and warned of the possibility of aftershocks in the coming days. While New Jersey is not a seismic hotspot, it is situated over the active Ramapo Fault line, which was responsible for a more widely felt 4.8 magnitude earthquake in April 2024.</p>

          <p>The FIRE (Financial Independence, Retire Early) movement is inspiring a growing number of people to pursue aggressive saving and investing strategies to exit the workforce decades ahead of schedule. Proponents like blogger Mr. Money Mustache and author Vicki Robin advocate for a philosophy of intentional frugality, focusing on what brings true happiness rather than material consumption. The core principle involves saving a significant portion of one's income to accumulate 25 times their annual expenses, allowing them to live off investment returns. Adherents find community and share strategies at events like Camp FI, redefining their relationship with work and money.</p>

          <p>Following a week of mixed economic signals, investors are now focusing on a new round of corporate earnings and potential trade policy updates from Washington. Key companies reporting include Disney, Eli Lilly, and DuPont, whose results will offer insights into consumer spending, the healthcare sector, and industrial demand. With a light economic calendar, the market's direction will likely be influenced by these corporate reports and any new developments regarding President Trump's tariff policies. Higher duty rates on goods from several nations went into effect, and investors will be watching for impacts on corporate outlooks and supply chains. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>NBA star Stephen Curry, one of the world's highest-paid athletes, recently stated that he does not know his exact net worth and is not focused on the figure. Instead, Curry said he prioritizes building a portfolio of investments and relationships he can be proud of, delegating the day-to-day financial tracking to his team. Financial planners commented that this mindset can be healthy, as it shifts focus from a potentially arbitrary number to more tangible goals and values. They suggest that concentrating on cash flow and aligning financial decisions with personal values can lead to a greater sense of control and fulfillment than obsessing over net worth.</p>

          <p>Despite the Trump administration's reluctance to release documents from the Jeffrey Epstein investigation, several ongoing legal cases could force crucial information into the public domain. A Freedom of Information Act lawsuit filed by Radar Online is currently on appeal, challenging the FBI's refusal to release thousands of pages from its Epstein file. Separately, a federal appeals court has ordered a lower court to review whether more documents from a settled defamation case involving an Epstein accuser can be unsealed. These legal avenues provide hope for transparency advocates and victims' lawyers who have been frustrated by the administration's stonewalling on the matter.</p>

He and co-founder Evan Wallace developed Figma into a leader in web-based collaborative design tools, directly competing with industry giant Adobe. After a planned $20 billion acquisition by Adobe was blocked by regulators, Figma pursued an IPO, marking a major success for the independent company.</p>
