          <p>TikTok is launching in-app guided meditation exercises and well-being features to address criticism and lawsuits concerning the app's negative effects on users' mental health, particularly among children. The new meditation feature, which aims to improve sleep quality, will be triggered during "sleep hours" for users under 18. This initiative follows public pressure and lawsuits alleging that TikTok is intentionally addictive and psychologically damaging to young users, causing issues like depression, anxiety, and body dysmorphia. The company is also introducing new educational feeds, online safety tools, and enhanced parental controls.</p>

          <p>Richemont, the owner of Cartier, reported better-than-expected fiscal fourth-quarter sales, indicating that wealthy consumers continue to spend despite global macroeconomic uncertainties. Revenues rose 7% year-on-year, driven by strong sales across all regions except Asia Pacific, where a decline in China offset growth in Japan. The company's performance signals resilience in the luxury sector, even as concerns about potential U.S. trade tariffs and macroeconomic instability threaten consumer confidence and discretionary spending. The article mentions Richemont had previously reported its "highest ever" quarterly sales figure in January.</p>

          <p>An international team of researchers conducted an extensive genetic analysis tracing the longest human migration from Asia to the Americas, shedding light on the prehistoric human expansion that shaped the early genetic landscape of the western hemisphere. The study found that Native Americans are descendants of Asian populations, particularly from the West Beringian region, and that early migrants to South America formed distinct, isolated groups due to environmental conditions. This work could reveal new insights about disease susceptibility and drug responses among indigenous populations.</p>

          <p>Scarlett Johansson is speaking out about the need for regulation of artificial intelligence, citing instances where companies have used her likeness and voice without permission. Johansson recounts an incident where OpenAI's chatbot "Sky" sounded eerily similar to her voice, despite her declining an offer to voice the chatbot. She emphasizes the importance of establishing boundaries to prevent the detrimental use of AI and encourages more public figures to support and advocate for AI legislation. The article includes a statement from OpenAI saying that the voice of Sky is not Scarlett Johansson's, and it was never intended to resemble hers.</p>

          <p>Japan experienced record foreign inflows into its equities and long-term bonds in April as investors moved away from U.S. markets due to President Donald Trump's trade policies. Overseas investors purchased 8.21 trillion yen ($56.6 billion) worth of equities and long-term bonds, marking the largest net inflows for a calendar month since 1996. This shift was attributed to Trump's tariff shocks, which altered global investors' outlook on the U.S. economy and asset performance. However, as the U.S. softens its trade stance, confidence in U.S. assets is being restored. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>Japanese parliament enacted a law to allow preemptive acts of cyberdefense, giving the government the ability to monitor communications data and neutralize hostile servers in the event of an attack. The "active cyberdefense" law obliges operators of key infrastructure to report cyber breaches to the government. This move aims to enhance Japan's cybersecurity capacity to levels on par with the United States and major European nations. The government will establish a new independent panel to oversee data acquisition and analysis, ensuring that surveillance is conducted properly.</p>
