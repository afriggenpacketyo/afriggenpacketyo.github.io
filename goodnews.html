          <p>Algerian Olympic gold medalist Imane Khelif will be barred from World Boxing competitions until she undergoes mandatory genetic sex testing. World Boxing announced it would introduce mandatory sex testing to determine the eligibility of male and female boxers who want to participate in their competitions. The decision came after scrutiny surrounding Khelif's gold medal win at the Paris Olympics and previous disqualifications from the IBA's world championships. Athletes will need to take a polymerase chain reaction (PCR) genetic test to determine their sex at birth, with mandatory testing procedures beginning July 1, 2025.</p>

          <p>The eastern Chinese city of Nanjing employs a fleet of drones nightly to patrol potentially problematic areas, utilizing artificial intelligence to plan patrol routes. This initiative is part of China's broader effort to scale up the use of AI in urban management to address complex challenges arising from rapid urbanization. The Chinese leadership views AI as a tool for economic transformation and governance refinement, launching the ‚Äúsmart cities‚Äù initiative and other programs over the past decade. Despite progress, China's AI governance faces challenges such as privacy protection and community involvement, issues mirrored globally as governments adopt the technology.</p>

          <p>A high school softball team in Minnesota is facing both playoff competition and legal challenges due to its dominant transgender pitcher. Champlin Park High School's trans pitcher led the team to victory in the sectional final, but three anonymous players have filed a lawsuit against the state for allowing the athlete to compete against female players. The school district defended its decision, stating that all student athletes are eligible to compete under Minnesota State High School League rules and applicable state law. Attorney General Keith Ellison is also suing President Trump and the Department of Justice to ensure transgender athletes can continue participating in girls' sports in the state.</p>

          <p>A key U.S. inflation gauge slowed in April, with consumer prices rising 2.1% year-over-year, down from 2.3% in March. The report indicates that President Trump's tariffs have yet to noticeably impact prices, though economists warn prices may rise as tariffs take effect. Americans cooled off on spending, with overall consumer spending rising only 0.2% in April, down from 0.7% in March, possibly reflecting caution due to higher goods prices. Incomes rose 0.8% in April, partly due to an increase in Social Security benefits following the Social Security Fairness Act. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>Governor Gavin Newsom's office has requested that the Trump administration remove California from its list of sanctuary jurisdictions obstructing federal immigration law. Newsom contends that federal court rulings have rejected the argument that California law limits law enforcement coordination with immigration authorities. The state strengthened its sanctuary policies under a law signed by former Governor Jerry Brown, aiming to balance preventing local law enforcement from being used for immigration enforcement without obstructing federal law. Homeland Security Secretary Kristi Noem asserts that sanctuary communities endanger Americans and law enforcement to protect violent criminal undocumented immigrants.</p>
