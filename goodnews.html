          <p>With interest rates remaining high, savers are contemplating whether to lock in current certificate of deposit (CD) yields with long-term or short-term accounts. Financial experts suggest that one-year CDs offer flexibility for those who might need funds soon, especially as the Federal Reserve is expected to cut rates within 18 months. Conversely, five-year CDs can provide guaranteed income security for individuals with longer-term goals, like retirement, who are concerned about future rate drops. The best choice ultimately depends on an individual's financial goals and liquidity needs. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>The United States men's national team was defeated 2-1 by Mexico in the Concacaf Gold Cup final, marking Mexico's second consecutive win in the tournament. Despite the loss, the U.S. team, which competed with what was effectively a B-squad missing many of its star players, is seen as having gained valuable experience and momentum. The tournament showcased the emergence of new talent and a renewed sense of intensity, providing a more optimistic outlook for the team's prospects ahead of the 2026 World Cup. Manager Mauricio Pochettino praised the group's performance and growth throughout the competition.</p>

          <p>Bishop T.D. Jakes, a prominent and influential faith leader, is stepping down as the senior pastor of The Potter's House, the Dallas megachurch he founded nearly 30 years ago. He has officially installed his daughter, Sarah Jakes Roberts, and his son-in-law, Toure Roberts, as the new co-senior pastors. The transition, which has been planned for years, follows a health incident in late 2024 where Jakes suffered a heart attack. Jakes will continue his work as chairman of the T.D. Jakes Foundation and leader of TDJ Enterprises.</p>

          <div class="timestamp">2025-07-07 10:14:03 EDT</div>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>The UK government plans to extend the right to bereavement leave to include parents who experience a miscarriage before 24 weeks of pregnancy. Currently, statutory leave is only available for pregnancy loss after 24 weeks. The proposed change, which would provide at least one week of unpaid leave, is being hailed by campaigners as a significant step in recognizing early pregnancy loss as a form of bereavement rather than an illness. The measure aims to provide parents with time to grieve without having to rely on sick leave.</p>

          <p>The umpire at the center of a significant electronic line-calling error at Wimbledon, Nico Helwerth, was not scheduled for matches the following day. During a fourth-round match, an operator error caused the ball-tracking system to deactivate for a crucial point, which Helwerth opted to replay instead of making an overrule. While the All England Club stated the umpire followed protocol and was simply on a routine rest day, the incident has fueled debate over the role of chair umpires and their authority in an era of automated line-calling technology.</p>

The firm has raised its total addressable market estimates for AI compute and networking, expecting Nvidia to capture a large share of this growth.

Using recent examples from airline CEOs, the article emphasizes that timing is critical; leaders should acknowledge a situation quickly and follow up with a thoughtful response. Apologies that seem rehearsed, lack emotion, or fail to take ownership can erode trust and damage morale. Ultimately, audiences want to hear from a human leader who demonstrates vulnerability and a commitment to fixing the problem, not just a brand delivering a scripted statement.</p>

          <p>Despite its reluctance to embrace traditional wide theatrical releases, Netflix consistently attracts elite directors like Martin Scorsese, Greta Gerwig, and Rian Johnson. The streaming giant accomplishes this by offering a powerful combination of lucrative contracts, significant creative freedom, and access to a global audience of over 300 million subscribers. For many filmmakers, Netflix has become a haven for projects that are too expensive or artistically risky for conventional studios. By prioritizing subscriber content over box-office returns, Netflix has created an appealing alternative model for some of Hollywood's biggest talents.</p>
