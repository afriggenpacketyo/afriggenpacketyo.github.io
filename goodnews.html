          <p>Indian Prime Minister Narendra Modi and Russian President Vladimir Putin reaffirmed their nations' "special and privileged" partnership during a meeting at the Shanghai Cooperation Organization summit in China. This display of strong ties comes as India faces steep U.S. tariffs, imposed in retaliation for its continued purchase of discounted Russian oil. Analysts suggest that U.S. economic pressure is pushing New Delhi closer to Moscow and Beijing. The leaders discussed regional stability and trade, with bilateral trade between India and Russia reaching a record $68.7 billion last financial year.</p>

          <p>The article investigates and debunks long-standing, unfounded rumors claiming that former first lady Melania Trump worked as an escort before meeting Donald Trump. These claims, which resurfaced on social media, originated from a 2016 tabloid article. Melania Trump successfully sued the publications for defamation, resulting in retractions and damage payments. The article also clarifies that the couple met at a party hosted by a modeling agent, not Ghislaine Maxwell, and that there is no credible evidence to support the escort allegations, which are attributed to unreliable sources spreading misinformation.</p>

          <p>Renowned Canadian author Margaret Atwood has responded to a new book ban in the province of Alberta by releasing a satirical short story. The protest comes after her classic novel, "The Handmaid's Tale," was among over 200 books removed from some school libraries under a new policy targeting "explicit sexual content." Atwood's new story sarcastically describes "very, very good children" who grow up without any biological realities, taking aim at the policy and its supporters. The incident reflects a growing trend of book challenges, similar to those seen in the United States, moving into Canada.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>A new study from the University of Montpellier reveals that human activities, particularly since the Middle Ages, have caused a significant divergence in the body size evolution of wild and domestic animals. By analyzing over 225,000 animal bones from the last 8,000 years, researchers found that wild species like deer and foxes have shrunk due to habitat loss and hunting. In contrast, domesticated species such as cattle and chickens have grown larger due to selective breeding and controlled management. This highlights the profound and lasting impact of human civilization on the natural world.</p>

          <p>The intense fan enthusiasm for the Prime Video series "The Summer I Turned Pretty" has escalated into online hostility, prompting the network to intervene. Passionate debates over which romantic interest the main character should choose have led to some fans harassing the show's actors online. In response, Prime Video launched a social media campaign urging viewers to "keep the conversation kind" and reinforcing its zero-tolerance policy for bullying. A psychiatrist weighs in, suggesting this behavior reflects a blurring of fiction and reality and may point to a broader societal need for connection.</p>
