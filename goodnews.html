          <p>Lando Norris secured his first victory since the season-opener in Australia at the Monaco Grand Prix, converting his pole position into a race win. The race was relatively straightforward for the front-runners, with Norris managing both pit-stop periods effectively. Verstappen, disadvantaged by limited tire sets, finished fourth after Red Bull's strategy didn't yield a desired safety car intervention. The Dutchman's strategy involved starting on hard tires and switching to mediums, delaying his final pit stop to back Norris into Leclerc and Piastri, but ultimately he had to stop with one lap remaining. The top three drivers, Norris, Leclerc, and Piastri, followed a similar strategy, each using medium tires initially, followed by two stints on hard tires.</p>

          <p>House Speaker Mike Johnson defended the passage of the House budget bill, calling it the "largest cut in spending in at least 30 years," while downplaying concerns about rising federal deficits. This statement contrasts with a Congressional Budget Office analysis, which suggests the tax provisions in the package could increase the deficit by $3.8 trillion over the next decade. Johnson argued that the bill will stimulate the economy by increasing wages and incentivizing business expansion and U.S. manufacturing. Republican senators have expressed reservations about the bill, citing concerns about the soaring deficits it could create.</p>

          <p>Prime Minister Mark Carney has invited King Charles III to open the 45th Canadian parliament, signaling Canada's sovereignty and independence amid perceived threats from US President Donald Trump. This event marks a rare occasion, as a British monarch has not delivered Canada's throne speech since 1977. The visit is intended to underscore Canada's unique identity and traditions, distinguishing it from the United States, and to strengthen ties with Europe. While the Canadian population remains largely indifferent to the monarchy, the visit also serves as a means for Prime Minister Carney to improve relations with Trump, who is known to admire the British monarchy.</p>

She gathers ideas from overheard conversations and keeps a "blue box" filled with handwritten notes. The author says her novels are like olives in a bottle, she just picks the one that's on top.</p>

          <p>Following former President Joe Biden's prostate cancer diagnosis, experts are questioning current screening guidelines, which recommend against routine PSA testing for men over 70. Dr. Marc Siegel argues that all men over 45 should be screened, citing advancements in treatment with fewer side effects. Dr. Shawn Dason suggests that men in their 50s and 60s should discuss the potential benefits and risks of screening with their healthcare providers, but notes that there is limited data supporting screening for men over 70 due to increased risks of over-treatment. The importance of discussing individual health situations with a medical provider is emphasized.</p>
