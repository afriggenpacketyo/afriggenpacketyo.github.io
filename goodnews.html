        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Despite facing significant tariffs, China's economy demonstrated resilience in April, with industrial output growing by 6.1% and retail sales increasing by 5.1%. These figures, released by the National Bureau of Statistics, indicate a stronger performance than economists' estimates. The Politburo has affirmed the need to bolster domestic consumption amidst global trade uncertainties. This period represents the only month where the full impact of triple-digit tariffs was evident before the recent agreement between Washington and Beijing, which provides a 90-day reprieve in the trade conflict.

          <p>Rory McIlroy concluded the PGA Championship tied for 47th, amidst speculation he avoided media due to a controversy over his driver being deemed non-conforming by the USGA, which forced him to switch equipment. Xander Schauffele implied Scottie Scheffler also had to make an equipment change, while Scheffler went on to win the PGA Championship. The PGA of America confirmed the USGA conducted club testing at their request to protect the integrity of the field. Amid the controversy, TaylorMade, the brand endorsed by both Scheffler and McIlroy, has not released a public statement. Optimism score = 70</p>

          <p>A tentative agreement has been reached, ending New Jersey's first statewide transit strike in over 40 years after three days of disruption. The Brotherhood of Locomotive Engineers and Trainmen approved the deal, but full train service will not resume until Tuesday morning due to safety inspections. Governor Murphy announced the agreement, urging commuters to work from home on Monday to ease the transition.

          <p>A Reddit post sparked discussion about whether driving a luxury car still signifies wealth, given the accessibility of financing and leasing. Many users pointed out that owning a high-end vehicle doesn't automatically mean someone is wealthy, as many people prioritize it over other financial goals. Conversely, some emphasized that wealthy individuals often avoid displaying their wealth conspicuously. The discussion highlighted differing personal values and financial priorities, with some prioritizing transportation while others prioritize investment. Optimism score = 60</p>
