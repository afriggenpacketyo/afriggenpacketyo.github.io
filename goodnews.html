          <h2>England Captain Ben Stokes Returns to Peak Bowling Form After Injuries</h2>

          <p>England's cricket captain, Ben Stokes, has made a remarkable return to his best bowling form, taking five wickets in a Test innings for the first time since 2017. This achievement comes after significant rehabilitation from knee and hamstring surgeries that had many questioning his future as a bowler. This summer, Stokes has bowled more overs and taken more wickets in a single series than at any point since his debut, with statistics showing his pace has returned to 2019 levels. His crucial wickets and marathon spells have been instrumental in England's recent performances against India, reaffirming his status as a premier all-rounder.</p>

          <p>French President Emmanuel Macron announced that France will officially recognize the State of Palestine at the United Nations General Assembly in September. The decision aligns with what Macron described as France's historical commitment to a just and lasting peace in the Middle East. This development comes as the humanitarian crisis in Gaza continues to worsen and international news agencies renew calls for Israel to allow journalists access to the region. The announcement adds to the diplomatic pressure for a two-state solution, with UK Prime Minister Keir Starmer also calling for steps toward a Palestinian state.</p>

          <p>A 24-year-old Massachusetts man has been arrested for his alleged involvement in the theft of $113,000 worth of rare Pokémon cards from a collectible shop. The break-in, which was captured on surveillance video, involved a suspect smashing the store's glass door and quickly grabbing valuable items. Police were led to the suspect after he allegedly attempted to sell a rare booster box, valued at $30,000, that matched a stolen item. A subsequent search of an apartment yielded several high-value, graded Pokémon cards also reported stolen from the shop, leading to the man's arrest on multiple charges.</p>

          <p>An Ontario judge has acquitted five former members of Canada's world junior ice hockey team of sexually assaulting a woman in a hotel room in 2018. The judge, Justice Maria Carroccia, ruled that she did not find the complainant's testimony to be credible or reliable, citing inconsistencies in her statements to investigators. The central issue of the trial was whether the woman had consented to the sexual acts. The defense argued that she had initiated the encounter, and videos were presented in which she was recorded giving consent, though the judge noted this did not legally establish it.</p>

          <p>A viral claim that the animated series "The Simpsons" predicted a recent kiss cam incident at a Coldplay concert is false. Social media posts have circulated a side-by-side image showing the real concert footage next to a cartoon scene, but the alleged screenshot from the show is not authentic. AI-detection platforms indicate the image is likely AI-generated or digitally manipulated, and a review of the cited episodes confirms no such scene exists. While the show has been coincidentally accurate about future events in the past, its creators attribute this to the sheer volume of jokes written over decades, not intentional prediction.</p>

          <p>Actress Molly Gordon, known for supporting roles in projects like "The Bear" and "Theater Camp," is stepping into her first film lead in "Oh, Hi!," a movie she also co-wrote and produced. Frustrated by a lack of opportunities for the types of complex roles she wanted to play, Gordon created her own. The film, described as a "rom-com gone wrong," features Gordon as a woman who takes her non-committal boyfriend hostage to convince him of their potential as a couple. This move places her among a cohort of young, multi-talented women who are actively shaping their own careers in Hollywood.</p>

          <p>Shares of Honeywell fell despite the company reporting second-quarter results that beat Wall Street estimates for revenue, organic sales, and earnings per share. The industrial conglomerate also raised its full-year guidance for these key metrics. However, investors were disappointed by a miss on segment margin, partly due to increased R&D spending in its aerospace division, and a lowered margin outlook for the year. The company is proceeding with its plan to split into three separate entities, with the advanced materials business spinoff expected in the fourth quarter. (not investment advice)</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>This article traces the fluctuating popularity of facial hair in American culture, from a symbol of sophistication in the 19th century to a sign of counter-culture in the 1960s. After Abraham Lincoln became the first bearded president, facial hair was common among leaders until it fell out of fashion for much of the 20th century, associated with a lack of professionalism. The 2010s saw a cringeworthy hipster revival, but today, beards and mustaches have become mainstream again, adopted by politicians seeking a more relatable image and young men as a trendy expression of masculinity. The author reflects on this revival through their own personal grooming cycle.</p>

          <p>The United Kingdom and India have formally signed a multi-billion pound free trade agreement, a deal hailed by Prime Minister Keir Starmer as the most significant since Brexit. The agreement will lower tariffs on UK exports like cars and whisky to India, and on Indian exports like textiles and jewelry to the UK, boosting the British economy by an estimated £4.8 billion annually. Indian Prime Minister Narendra Modi, who met with King Charles after the signing, called it a blueprint for shared prosperity. The deal also includes a new joint plan to combat illegal migration and enhance collaboration on defense and technology.</p>

          <p>The new film "Oh, Hi!" is a romantic comedy that twists the genre by having its protagonist, Iris (Molly Gordon), take her non-committal boyfriend, Isaac (Logan Lerman), hostage in a bid to save their relationship. The movie uses its high-concept premise to explore modern dating anxieties and the trope of the emotionally unavailable "softboy." While the plot mechanics can be hard to believe, Gordon's nimble and likable comedic performance shines. The film ultimately serves as a critique of gender tropes and the difficulty of genuine communication, making it a pleasant if perilous date night movie.</p>

          <p>A popular hiking trail in New York's Adirondack Mountains has been closed for weeks due to a large bull moose that is lingering near the summit and refusing to leave. Wildlife officials from the Department of Environmental Conservation find the behavior highly unusual, as moose typically move to lower elevations in the summer. Researchers have monitored the 900-pound animal, which appears thinner than expected but shows no obvious signs of the parasites that can affect moose. While the moose has not been aggressive, the trail remains closed as a precaution while officials continue to observe it.</p>

          <p>Wisconsin Governor Tony Evers, a Democrat, has announced he will not run for a third term in 2026, setting up the first open gubernatorial race in the key battleground state in 16 years. The 73-year-old governor, known for his mild-mannered demeanor and frequent clashes with the Republican-controlled legislature, cited a desire to focus on his family after five decades in public service. His tenure was marked by vetoes of conservative priorities and a successful push for redrawn legislative maps that are more favorable to Democrats. His decision is expected to trigger a competitive primary on both sides.</p>
