        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>President Trump's budget package moved forward in the House after negotiations addressed concerns from conservative Republicans who initially stalled the bill, feeling it did not contain steep enough spending cuts. Four conservative representatives voted 'present' instead of against the legislation, allowing it to advance to a floor vote before the Memorial Day deadline. House Speaker Mike Johnson indicated that minor modifications would be made to the legislation. The bill aims to enact Trump's policies on tax cuts, immigration, energy, defense, and raising the debt limit through budget reconciliation. </p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Former President Joseph R. Biden's recent diagnosis of prostate cancer that has spread to his bones is considered serious, but advancements in treatment and diagnosis have dramatically improved survival rates for men with advanced prostate cancer. Experts say that life expectancy is now measured in years rather than months due to research sponsored by the National Institutes of Health and the Defense Department. Treatment typically involves cutting off testosterone, the hormone that feeds prostate cancer, using drugs and potentially chemotherapy or radiation. Improved diagnostic tools, like the PSMA PET scan, allow doctors to spot the cancer earlier, leading to better prognoses. </p>

          <p>China's retail sales growth slowed to 5.1% in April, missing analysts' expectations, signaling that consumption remains a concern for the world's second-largest economy.

Fixed-asset investment expanded 4.0%, slightly lower than expectations, with a worsening drag from real estate.

The lack of X-ray emissions predicted by evolutionary models of Type Ia supernovae is a puzzling aspect of the discovery. </p>

          <p>Scottie Scheffler won the US PGA Championship by five strokes after holding off a challenge from Jon Rahm.

DeChambeau finished in the top five, while English secured his best finish at a major with a low round on Sunday. </p>
