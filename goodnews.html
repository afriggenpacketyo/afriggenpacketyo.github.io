          <p>President Trump underwent a "routine yearly checkup" at Walter Reed National Military Medical Center, six months after his annual physical. His physician, Capt. Sean Barbabella, reported that the president completed "advanced imaging, laboratory testing, and preventive health assessments," which yielded "exceptional" results. Barbabella affirmed Trump's "excellent overall health," noting his cardiac age was approximately 14 years younger than his chronological age. The president also received his annual flu and an updated COVID-19 booster vaccination during the visit.</p>

          <p>A detailed timeline reveals the months-long diplomatic efforts behind President Trump's 20-point peace plan between Israel and Hamas, culminating in a ceasefire. Key moments included Hamas's acceptance of a ceasefire proposal in August 2025, followed by intensive 'wordsmithing' by U.S. envoys Steve Witkoff and Jared Kushner with Qatari officials. A crucial apology from Israeli Prime Minister Netanyahu to Qatar for an airstrike in Doha helped build trust. The plan, divided into two phases, aims for hostage release and a 'permanent ceasefire,' with discussions evolving through numerous meetings in New York and Sharm El Sheikh, Egypt.</p>

          <p>Maria Corina Machado, leader of Venezuela's pro-democracy movement, expressed profound gratitude upon receiving the Nobel Peace Prize, viewing it as a global affirmation for her country's struggle. Machado, who has faced threats and forced hiding under the Maduro regime, emphasized that the award signifies to Venezuelans that "we are not alone" in their "epic fight." The Norwegian Nobel Committee recognized her for keeping "the flame of democracy burning amidst a growing darkness." She also reportedly spoke with President Trump, thanking him for his support.</p>

          <p>President Trump announced a deal with AstraZeneca, making it the second major drug company to agree to lower prescription drug prices for Medicaid patients. Under the agreement, AstraZeneca will offer drugs at "most-favored-nation" prices, matching the lowest rates offered in other high-income countries, and list primary care medications on the new 'TrumpRx' website. The company also committed to investing in U.S. manufacturing. While Trump hailed the deal as a significant step towards affordability, experts remain skeptical about its broad impact on consumers, noting Medicaid already receives substantial discounts and 'TrumpRx' primarily serves uninsured patients.</p>

          <p>An Oklahoma high school girls' basketball team, the Academy of Classical Christian Studies, made an extraordinary act of sportsmanship by returning their division championship trophy. Head coach Brendan King reviewed the game tape after a buzzer-beater win and discovered a scorekeeping error, revealing his team had actually lost 43-42. Despite league rules preventing score changes, the team unanimously decided to appeal their own victory and award the title to Apache High. This gesture was deeply appreciated by Apache's coach and players, who lauded it as a powerful demonstration of integrity and good character.</p>

          <p>Quaker, a 15-year-old Household Cavalry Mounted Regiment horse, has retired to a sanctuary after sustaining injuries during a bolting incident in central London last year. Startled by construction work, Quaker was one of five horses that ran loose, causing chaos and injuries, including a small break for Quaker and a broken back for his rider. While four other horses returned to duty, Quaker's welfare necessitated his retirement, where he will enjoy a life of rest and freedom. The Horse Trust, which provides respite and retirement for military horses, will care for him.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Israel's Shin Bet successfully negotiated a prisoner release ratio with Hamas that is the lowest in decades, securing the return of 48 hostages (20 still alive) for 1,700 Gaza detainees. The agreement limits the release of Hamas operatives and excludes the 25 most senior prisoners, including Yahya Sinwar and Muhammad Sinwar. The Shin Bet's veto list also prevented the release of child murderers and other high-profile terrorists, a significant departure from previous deals like the Shalit exchange. This strategic victory reflects intense negotiations aimed at minimizing the release of dangerous individuals.</p>

          <p>Apple is reportedly in late-stage talks to acquire the talent and technology from computer vision startup Prompt AI. Prompt AI, founded in 2023, informed its 11 employees of the pending transaction, stating that those not joining Apple would receive a reduced salary and be encouraged to apply for other roles. The startup's flagship app, Seemour, enhanced home security cameras with advanced detection capabilities, but its business model proved unsustainable. This 'acqui-hire' aligns with Apple's strategy of acquiring smaller teams to bolster its AI research and development, particularly in its HomeKit smart home division.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>The hit BBC show 'The Traitors' captivates audiences by exploring themes of lying and deception, offering a microcosm of everyday human treachery. Psychology experts suggest the show resonates because deception is deeply ingrained in human nature, often serving to maintain societal bonds while also being used exploitatively. The celebrity edition adds another layer, as viewers project pre-existing beliefs onto stars, making it harder to discern genuine behavior from performance. The show's appeal lies in exposing the fragility of loyalty under pressure, mirroring how self-interest can surface when incentives change.</p>

          <p>President Trump's unique diplomatic approach, leveraging strong ties with Israel and Arab Gulf nations, is credited for a breakthrough in the Israel-Hamas peace deal. The agreement, which includes an IDF pullback and hostage-for-prisoner swap, emerged after intense negotiations led by Jared Kushner and Steve Witkoff. Trump's volatility and willingness to pressure both sides, including an apology from Netanyahu to Qatar, reportedly swayed the parties. While challenges remain, including Hamas's rejection of post-war governance plans and the formation of an International Stabilization Force, officials note an "exhaustion factor" on both sides contributed to the deal's advancement.</p>
