          <p>Strategy Chairman Michael Saylor notes the growing trend of companies adopting bitcoin treasury strategies, with Trump Media and GameStop following suit.

Unable to access the spinal tumor through traditional methods, Dr. Mohammed Labib developed a unique surgical plan to remove it through her eye. The procedure, called the "third nostril" approach, involved cutting through the membrane protecting the eye and removing part of her eye socket. After a 20-hour surgery, the tumor was successfully removed, and Flores is now cancer-free.</p>

The series was defined by its lack of definition beyond Tom Cruise as Ethan Hunt, with each installment feeling made by a director with a specific take on the material. Later films have taken a different approach, relying on continuity and stricter canon, which streamlines the earlier stories and overlooks their true appeal.

          <p>An exceptionally rare, gold lobster was saved from being cooked at a Rhode Island restaurant. A cook noticed the lobster, named Calvin, had a genetic mutation that occurs in about one in 30 million lobsters. The restaurant donated Calvin to the Biomes Marine Biology Center, where it will be displayed. The center director emphasized the huge numbers of lobsters that are caught, which made it a matter of time before one of these came up.</p>

          <p>Manchester United defender Matthijs de Ligt has praised Ruben Amorim's blunt approach, believing it will benefit the club. Amorim has made withering statements about United, but de Ligt feels that, because of his nationality and the Dutch reputation for blunt speaking, Amorim's words are positive. De Ligt said that he's from Holland so he likes it.</p>
