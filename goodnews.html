          <p>A major power outage impacted southeastern France, causing traffic disruptions and briefly halting activities at the Cannes Film Festival as the event prepared for its closing ceremony. Approximately 160,000 households in the Alpes-Maritimes department lost electricity due to a fallen high-voltage line, which occurred hours after a fire at an electrical substation near Cannes had already weakened the power grid. The festival organizers confirmed that the Palais des Festivals switched to an independent power supply, ensuring all scheduled events proceeded as planned, though screenings at a satellite venue were temporarily suspended. Traffic lights in Cannes and Antibes stopped working, causing traffic jams, and most shops along the Croisette remained closed.</p>

          <p>President Donald Trump is scheduled to speak at the U.S. Military Academy's commencement ceremony, following the administration's crackdown on diversity, equity, and inclusion (DEI) programs. Since assuming office, Trump and Defense Secretary Pete Hegseth have advocated for significant changes to military academies, leading to the disbanding of several student clubs, including the National Society of Black Engineers and the Society of Women Engineers. These changes align with recent Presidential Executive Orders and Department of Defense guidance. Additionally, hundreds of books addressing diversity, race, and gender issues were removed from U.S. Naval Academy libraries, although most have since been returned.</p>

          <p>Audio has been released of a 911 call detailing a medical emergency involving Gregg Popovich at a San Antonio restaurant last month, where he reportedly fainted. The caller indicated that Popovich was initially "not responding" but later "barely responding" after passing out briefly. Popovich, who had been recovering from a stroke earlier in the season, reportedly did not suffer any life-threatening injuries and was alert by the time he entered the ambulance. Shortly after the incident, Popovich stepped down as head coach, transitioning to president of basketball operations after a nearly three-decade run that included five NBA Championships.</p>

Early data for 2025 suggest a continuation of this trend, potentially leading to the lowest murder rate in US history.

          <p>Labour MPs are increasingly challenging Chancellor Rachel Reeves' fiscal policies, particularly her plans to cut welfare payments. Despite Reeves' insistence that there is no alternative, MPs across the political spectrum are suggesting alternative revenue-raising measures, such as a wealth tax and a restoration of the 50p top tax rate. The unease within Labour's ranks is growing as the party's poll ratings decrease, leading to calls for a wider economic reset and a reconsideration of manifesto pledges not to increase income tax or employee national insurance.</p>
