          <p>The Los Angeles Dodgers secured a 2-1 victory over the Milwaukee Brewers in Game 1 of the National League Championship Series, highlighting how their substantial payroll contributed to the win. Despite defensive blunders and stranded runners, high-value players like Freddie Freeman, with a $162-million contract, hit a go-ahead home run. Pitcher Blake Snell, a $182-million signing, delivered eight scoreless innings, demonstrating how significant financial investment can overcome in-game challenges.
