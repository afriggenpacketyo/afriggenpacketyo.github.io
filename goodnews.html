        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Chevron has successfully completed its $53 billion acquisition of Hess Corporation, a move that grants it significant access to vast offshore oil reserves in Guyana. The deal proceeded after an international arbitration panel ruled against Exxon Mobil, which had claimed a right of first refusal over Hess's assets in the region. Chevron's CEO expressed satisfaction with the ruling, stating it affirms that such rights do not apply to corporate-level mergers. The acquisition is expected to involve some headcount reductions as the two companies integrate their operations.</p>

          <p>American Express reports that its affluent customer base continues to spend robustly, with total card spending increasing by 7% in the second quarter. This trend has largely shielded the company from concerns about a broader economic slowdown. However, a notable exception is in travel, where spending on airline tickets has stalled, specifically in the category of domestic economy airfare. Despite beating profit and revenue expectations, investor concerns over the high cost of rewards programs and increased competition have caused the company's stock to dip.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Despite shares of Texas Roadhouse falling recently due to accelerating beef inflation, some analysts maintain a positive long-term outlook for the company. Beef prices, a major expense for the steakhouse chain, rose approximately 15% year-over-year in the second quarter, creating margin pressures. However, Bank of America raised its price target, citing the company's strong traffic trends and continued market share gains in the full-service steak category. The analysis suggests the company's fundamental strengths can weather the current commodity price challenges. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>The last of four inmates who escaped from a privately-run ICE detention center in New Jersey last month has been apprehended by the FBI in Los Angeles. Andres Felipe Pineda-Mogollon was arrested during a traffic stop, concluding a nationwide manhunt. The four men, described by DHS as public safety threats, broke out of the Delaney Hall facility in Newark on June 12 following a disturbance. Pineda-Mogollon, a Colombian national, had prior arrests for larceny and burglary, and his capture was praised by law enforcement officials.</p>

          <h2>Author Claims to Have Solved 500-Year-Old Mystery of the 'Princes in the Tower'</h2>

          <p>Author Philippa Langley, known for helping discover the remains of King Richard III, now claims that the two young princes allegedly murdered in the Tower of London over five centuries ago actually survived. The conventional narrative holds that their uncle, Richard III, had them killed to secure the throne. Langley's decade-long "Missing Princes Project" treated the case as a missing persons investigation and reportedly found documentary evidence suggesting both boys lived. While some historians remain skeptical, Langley argues the burden of proof now lies with those who claim the princes were murdered.</p>

          <p>The price of ether climbed significantly as the U.S. Congress passed the GENIUS Act, a major piece of stablecoin legislation, sending it to the president's desk to be signed into law.

Ether's value has surged, outperforming bitcoin for the week, and its associated ETFs have seen record inflows. Analysts suggest this could signal a potential trend reversal, with ether taking a leadership role in the crypto market. (not investment advice)</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>The European Union has approved a new, stringent package of sanctions against Russia aimed at crippling its ability to finance the war in Ukraine. The measures include a dynamic price cap on Russian oil, a ban on future transactions via Nord Stream pipelines, and an import ban on refined petroleum products made from Russian crude in third countries. Additionally, the EU has sanctioned more Russian banks and numerous non-EU shipping vessels in Russia's "shadow fleet." While experts believe the sanctions will weaken Russia's economy long-term, they note that enforcement challenges remain.</p>

          <p>The annual royal tradition of "swan upping" on the River Thames has revealed a positive turn for the swan population, with numbers beginning to recover after a significant decline. The five-day census found 115 young swans, a notable increase from 86 last year, suggesting a reversal of a 45% drop over the past two years. The decline was attributed to avian flu and acts of human cruelty. While the tradition once served to count royal property, it now focuses on conservation, education, and monitoring the health of the iconic birds.</p>

          <p>A key survey from the University of Michigan indicates that consumers' expectations for inflation have fallen to their lowest levels since before the latest round of tariffs was announced. The one-year inflation forecast dropped to 4.4% in July from 5% in June, while the five-year outlook also declined. This suggests that while consumers still perceive future inflation risks, their immediate fears have receded. The overall consumer sentiment index also saw a slight increase, aligning with estimates and reaching its highest point since February, providing an encouraging sign for the Federal Reserve.

          <p>Despite leading the National League in wins, the Los Angeles Dodgers face significant challenges as they begin the second half of the season. Key questions revolve around the health and stability of their pitching staff, particularly the recovery of starters Yoshinobu Yamamoto, Blake Snell, and Tyler Glasnow. Another major focus is the workload and role of Shohei Ohtani as he returns to pitching, and whether his two-way demands will affect his performance. The team also needs its star hitters, Mookie Betts and Freddie Freeman, to rebound from slumps to ensure the offense performs at its full potential.</p>

          <p>For retirees on a fixed Social Security income, managing credit card debt can be particularly challenging, but relief options are available. This article explains that while being on Social Security doesn't disqualify individuals from debt relief, the best strategies may differ from those for wage earners. Programs like debt management plans, which consolidate payments and lower interest rates, can be effective. Other options include negotiating directly with creditors through hardship programs or, in severe cases, debt settlement. The key is finding a solution that aligns with a fixed income without requiring new loans. (not investment advice)</p>

The Siegels have become prominent advocates for the remaining captives, using their freedom to remind the world of those still held and to push for a diplomatic solution to bring them home.</p>

          <p>Delta Air Lines and United Airlines are increasingly separating themselves from the rest of the U.S. airline industry, accounting for over 86% of the profits among the seven largest carriers last year. Analysts suggest their success stems from strong global networks and a strategic focus on premium travel, which provides a buffer against challenges like falling domestic airfares. While both airlines have trimmed their 2025 outlooks, their emphasis on high-margin premium cabins and lucrative loyalty programs positions them to better navigate a difficult year compared to their more price-sensitive competitors.</p>

          <p>A "no tax on tips" provision included in President Trump's recent legislation is creating uncertainty for tipped workers and tax preparers. The new law provides a tax deduction of up to $25,000 for reported tip income, but it does not eliminate taxes entirely, as payroll and state taxes still apply. The IRS has yet to issue clear guidance on which specific occupations qualify for the break, leaving many to speculate. Furthermore, changes to reporting thresholds for forms like the 1099-K and 1099-NEC could create eligibility questions for gig economy and contract workers.</p>
