          <p>President Trump is actively seeking a nuclear deal with Iran, despite resistance from U.S. conservatives who demand the dismantling of Iran's nuclear program. Trump aims to secure a deal to enhance regional safety, aligning with Gulf Arab states' desires for a negotiated settlement. However, significant disagreements remain regarding uranium enrichment, with Iran insisting on its right to civilian enrichment under the Nuclear Nonproliferation Treaty. Steve Witkoff is leading the American negotiating efforts, exploring creative solutions to bridge the gaps between both sides' demands. The article highlights potential compromises, such as phased sanctions relief and long-term enrichment freezes, to achieve a mutually acceptable agreement.</p>

          <p>The United Arab Emirates (UAE) is increasing its economic and strategic presence in Africa as the United States and China reduce their investments. Emirati corporations are investing heavily in ports, renewable energy, and critical minerals across the continent. This strategy is part of the UAE's broader plan to diversify its economy and exert greater influence over global supply chains. While the U.S. is considered a reliable ally to the UAE, the Emirates' investments in Africa rely on Chinese technology, minerals, and goods, highlighting a complex relationship between the three countries.</p>

          <p>Crystal Palace goalkeeper Dean Henderson was at the center of attention during the FA Cup final against Manchester City after handling the ball outside the box. While Henderson made crucial saves, including a penalty stop, the incident raised questions about whether he should have been sent off. VAR reviewed the play but allowed it to continue, citing that Haaland did not have an obvious goal-scoring opportunity. Former Manchester United striker Wayne Rooney criticized the decision, calling it a "100% a red card."</p>
