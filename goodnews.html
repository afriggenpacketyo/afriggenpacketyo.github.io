          <h2>Agatha Christie's Likeness Used in AI-Assisted Writing Course Sparks Ethical Debate</h2>

          <p>Agatha Christie, the renowned mystery novelist who died in 1976, has been digitally reanimated using AI to "teach" an online writing course for BBC Maestro. While Christie's family estate approved the project, stipulating that only her words be used, the course raises ethical questions about using AI to represent deceased individuals. Some experts argue that even with consent, the representation is a 'deepfake' that could blur the lines between fact and fiction, while others believe it's a harmless way to educate and entertain fans, as the technology used only creates her likeness and does not create or alter her views.</p>

          <p>President Trump is expected to announce a trade agreement with Britain, signaling a potential win for both nations seeking closer economic ties. The deal, teased by Trump on social media, would be the first announced since the U.S. imposed tariffs on numerous trading partners. While details remain unclear, discussions have included lowering British tariffs on U.S. cars and farm goods, and removing taxes on U.S. technology companies. For the UK Prime Minister, Keir Starmer, this trade deal would offer vindication for his assiduous cultivation of Mr. Trump.</p>

          <p>Nintendo projects to sell 15 million units of its new Switch 2 console in the fiscal year ending March 2026, marking the first sales forecast since announcing the successor to the popular Switch. Despite a drop in fourth-quarter revenue and profit, largely anticipated due to consumers awaiting the new console, investors remain optimistic, with shares up 33% this year. The Switch 2, starting at $449.99, is expected to launch in June with improved features; however, pre-orders in the U.S. were delayed due to President Trump's tariffs on countries where Nintendo consoles are manufactured.</p>

          <p>Sotheby's has postponed its auction of sacred jewels linked to the Buddha's remains in Hong Kong following a threat of legal action by the Indian government. The sale of the Piprahwa Gems, described as a significant archaeological find, had drawn criticism from Buddhist academics and monastic leaders, with India asserting that it offended the global Buddhist community. The auction house has agreed to suspend the sale to allow for discussions between the parties involved. The relics were unearthed in northern India nearly 130 years ago.</p>
