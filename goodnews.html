The relocation is part of the European Endangered Species Program, a conservation effort aimed at maintaining healthy populations of threatened species in captivity. Toni has become a local and online star, significantly boosting the zoo's social media presence and helping raise awareness for pygmy hippos, which are endangered with fewer than 2,500 remaining in the wild.

          <p>Nigel Farage, leader of Reform UK, has formally requested that Prime Minister Keir Starmer appoint members of his party to the House of Lords. In a letter, Farage argued that the current composition of the upper chamber is democratically imbalanced, as parties with fewer votes and MPs have representation while Reform UK, with four MPs and significant popular support, has none. He highlighted the disparity with parties like the Liberal Democrats, Greens, and Plaid Cymru, urging for the appointment of Reform peers to reflect the recent shifts in British politics.</p>

The event commemorates the end of World War II and is seen as a demonstration of China's increasing influence in the region. According to sources, the presence of high-level delegations from countries like Cambodia, Laos, and Myanmar signifies a strengthening of diplomatic ties. This gathering in Tiananmen Square follows a similar parade held a decade ago, with many countries expected to send more senior officials this time.</p>

          <p>A recent podcast episode delves into the scientific and philosophical challenges of defining "life." Featuring developmental biologist Crystal Rogers, the discussion examines the standard criteria used to classify living things, such as growth, reproduction, and response to stimuli. The conversation highlights the difficulty of applying these rules to ambiguous cases like viruses, which exist on the border between living and non-living. The episode also extends the debate to hypothetical future scenarios, such as determining the living status of advanced androids, using examples from popular culture like Star Trek.</p>

          <p>A federal judge in Maryland has struck down two directives from the Trump administration that targeted diversity, equity, and inclusion (DEI) programs in schools and universities. The ruling found that the Department of Education acted unlawfully when it threatened to withhold federal funding from institutions that continued their DEI initiatives. The judge stated the guidance initiated a "sea change" in regulation without following proper procedures, causing educators to fear punishment for lawful speech. This decision is a significant victory for educational and civil rights groups that had challenged the policy as an overreach of government authority.</p>

          <p>A playground in Wooler, Northumberland, has reopened after the removal of 177 World War Two-era practice bombs that were buried beneath it. The discovery was made in January by a worker installing new equipment, leading to a specialist ordnance disposal operation. The bombs, which were not live but contained a charge, were found carefully stacked in rows, suggesting they were deliberately buried after the war. The site was historically used as a military ordnance depot, and the incident highlights the lingering legacy of wartime activities and the less stringent disposal practices of the past.</p>
