          <p>ESPN has finalized a five-year agreement to become the exclusive U.S. home for WWE's premium live events, including WrestleMania and Royal Rumble, starting in 2026. The deal is reportedly valued at an average of $325 million per year, a significant increase from the previous agreement with NBCUniversal's Peacock. These events will stream on ESPN's new direct-to-consumer platform, with some also being simulcast on linear networks. The partnership aims to expand WWE's audience and help ESPN attract a younger, more diverse, and more female viewership to its services.</p>

          <p>A human foot found inside a hiking shoe on the shore of Fishlake, Utah, has been identified as belonging to David White, a man who went missing 28 years ago.

DNA testing on the remains and a sample from White's daughter confirmed the match with 99.9994% certainty.

          <p>Four rare Barbary lion cubs have made their public debut at a Czech safari park, representing a hopeful step in a plan to reintroduce the species to the wild. The breed, which once roamed North Africa's Atlas Mountains, went extinct in the wild in the 1960s due to human activity. These cubs are part of an international endangered species program that coordinates breeding to maintain genetic diversity among the fewer than 200 individuals living in captivity. While officials say a reintroduction is still a distant future goal, it offers a long-term vision for the species' survival.</p>

          <p>In Altadena, California, a community devastated by the Eaton fire, resident Laurie Scott has started a free plant stand to help her neighbors reclaim a sense of hope and home. After the fire destroyed homes and lush landscapes, Scott found solace in a small houseplant and was inspired to share that feeling. Her "Regrow Altadena" stand distributes plants, seeds, and soil, providing a small piece of life and a vision for the future to residents, many of whom are displaced. The initiative has grown with community support, offering a tangible way for people to reconnect and begin rebuilding their gardens and lives.</p>

          <p>The Italian government has given its final approval for a €13.5 billion project to construct the world's longest suspension bridge, connecting mainland Italy to the island of Sicily. The 3.3-kilometer bridge over the Messina Strait is designed to withstand major earthquakes, a key concern for the seismically active region. Proponents, including Transport Minister Matteo Salvini, claim it will create 120,000 jobs and boost the economies of Sicily and Calabria, two of Italy's poorest regions. However, the project faces strong opposition over costs, environmental impact, and fears of mafia involvement.</p>

        </div>
        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>When planning for retirement, both certificates of deposit (CDs) and annuities offer safety, but they serve different purposes. CDs are simple, FDIC-insured products ideal for short-term savings and preserving principal, though their returns may not outpace inflation. Annuities are more complex insurance contracts designed to provide a guaranteed income stream for life, addressing the risk of outliving one's savings. The best choice depends on individual needs: CDs offer liquidity and simplicity, while annuities provide longevity insurance. For many, a combination of both products can create a balanced retirement strategy. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>Facing pressure from the Trump administration, Apple has pledged to increase its investment in the United States by an additional $100 billion. This raises its total commitment to $600 billion over four years, with the new funds intended to bolster domestic manufacturing and reshore the production of critical components. The announcement comes as Apple seeks to avoid a new wave of tariffs on its products, many of which are manufactured in China. While a significant shift in its supply chain would take time, the pledge may help the company receive more favorable treatment from the White House. (not investment advice)</p>
