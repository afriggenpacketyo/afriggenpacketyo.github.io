          <p>An advice column addresses a user's belief that their AI chatbot has become sentient, a concern shared by a growing number of people. Most AI experts assert that current large language models (LLMs) are not conscious but are sophisticated mimics, acting out roles based on vast training data that includes science fiction. These systems are designed to be engaging and can create persistent personas by remembering past chats, an illusion of consciousness that plays on human instincts to attribute intent to responsive entities. The article advises users to remain grounded, consult experts, and channel their empathy towards confirmed conscious beings experiencing real suffering.</p>

          <p>England defeated New Zealand by 65 runs in their second T20 international, taking a 1-0 series lead. Phil Salt and captain Harry Brook led the charge with a powerful batting display, contributing 85 and 78 runs respectively, to help England post a formidable total of 236-4. This score marked the highest ever in a T20 international at Christchurch's Hagley Oval. New Zealand's chase faltered despite a solid start, as they were bowled out for 171, with England's Adil Rashid taking four wickets. The decisive performance gives England the opportunity to clinch the series in the final match in Auckland.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>In the ancient Lycian city of Olympus, Turkey, archaeologists have unearthed a large and elaborate bathhouse attached to a bishop's residence, dating back to the 5th or 6th century A.D. The 2,150-square-foot complex is a rare find due to its size and features, including an advanced heating system. During this period, Byzantine bishops served as both spiritual and civic leaders, managing city wealth and public services. While connected to the bishop's home, the bathhouse was not exclusively private; it was opened to the public on certain days as a service for community health and cleanliness.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Premier League club Nottingham Forest is reportedly in advanced talks to hire Sean Dyche as their new manager, following the recent dismissal of Ange Postecoglou. Postecoglou was sacked just 17 minutes after a 3-0 loss to Chelsea, leaving the club in 18th place with only one win in eight league games. Dyche has emerged as the leading candidate, with the club hoping to finalize an agreement soon. A former youth player at Forest, Dyche has extensive managerial experience, notably a near-decade-long tenure at Burnley and a two-year spell with Everton. Other potential candidates have been considered but face contractual or financial hurdles.</p>

          <p>New research indicates that updated medical guidance recommending the early introduction of peanut products to infants has successfully prevented an estimated 60,000 cases of peanut allergies. The advice, which reversed decades of previous practice, was based on a landmark 2015 study showing that early exposure could reduce allergy risk by over 80%. A recent analysis of pediatric health records confirmed a significant real-world impact, with peanut allergy diagnoses in young children declining by more than 40% after the guidelines were widely adopted in 2017. This public health effort is seen as a major success in combating the rise of food allergies.</p>

          <p>Germany's Defense Minister, Boris Pistorius, is reportedly planning to order an additional 15 F-35 fighter jets from the American manufacturer Lockheed Martin. This purchase would be on top of the 35 jets already requested, as Germany continues to increase its military spending in response to regional security threats. The advanced aircraft are intended to replace Germany's aging Tornado fleet and are capable of carrying U.S. nuclear weapons stored in the country. The supplemental order is expected to cost approximately €2.5 billion, reflecting Germany's significant expansion of its defense budget amid a changing European security landscape.</p>

          <p>The UK government has unveiled plans to introduce new vocational qualifications called "V-levels" for students aged 16 and over. These courses are intended to replace Level 3 BTECs and other technical qualifications, aiming to simplify what ministers describe as a "confusing landscape" of post-16 education. The proposal is part of a broader effort to elevate vocational training alongside traditional A-levels and newer T-levels. Additionally, the government plans to introduce a new "stepping stone" qualification to reduce the number of students who are required to repeatedly resit their maths and English GCSE exams after failing to achieve a passing grade.</p>

          <p>Los Angeles Rams head coach Sean McVay demonstrated remarkable strategic adaptability in a 35-7 victory over the Jacksonville Jaguars, despite being without star receiver Puka Nacua. Known for favoring formations with three wide receivers, McVay completely altered his game plan, heavily utilizing a three-tight-end formation (13 personnel) that the team had barely used all season. This tactical shift proved highly effective, as quarterback Matthew Stafford threw for five touchdowns on just 182 yards. The performance highlighted McVay's ability to tailor his offense to available personnel, cementing his reputation as one of the league's most innovative coaches.</p>

Lee's nephew, Dr. Edwin Conner, mentioned a manuscript titled 'The Long Goodbye,' which was written before her famous novel, but its fate remains unknown. Another mystery involves 'The Reverend,' a non-fiction book Lee researched in the 1970s about a series of murders in Alabama, which some claim was completed but has never been found.

Such an installation could enhance aerial surveillance over key shipping lanes that have been targeted by Houthi attacks. The United Arab Emirates, which has funded similar airstrips in the region, has not commented.

This achievement helps resolve a half-century-long debate in neuroscience about the precise mechanics of this fundamental process. The technology, developed by researchers from the University of Science and Technology of China and the Shenzhen Institutes of Advanced Technology, allows for imaging at a nanometre resolution and on a millisecond timescale, overcoming previous technical limitations.</p>
