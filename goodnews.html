          <p>Spanish banking giant Santander is set to acquire British high street bank TSB from its current owner, Sabadell, in a deal valued at up to ¬£2.9 billion. This marks the second time in a decade that TSB, a bank with roots stretching back over 200 years, has been sold. The future of the TSB brand remains uncertain, as Santander has not commented on whether it will be retained. The acquisition comes as Santander continues to streamline its UK operations by closing branches in response to the growing trend of digital banking. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>A new analysis by SmartAsset has identified the best job markets in the United States, ranking 348 cities on metrics including unemployment, income growth, and work-life balance. Bend, Oregon, claimed the top spot due to its low unemployment rate and a significant 44% growth in median income from 2020 to 2023. The city also scored high on work-life balance, with short commute times and a large remote workforce. Other top-ranking cities included Richmond, Virginia, and Seattle, Washington, while the study also highlighted cities excelling in specific areas like employer-sponsored healthcare and remote work friendliness.</p>

          <p>A beachgoer in Walton County, Florida, discovered 25 kilos of cocaine, with an estimated street value of nearly half a million dollars, washed ashore on Sunday. The drugs were distinctively wrapped in packaging featuring the cartoon character Yosemite Sam. The local sheriff's office confiscated the narcotics and warned the public not to touch any suspicious packages found on the beach, as their contents could be dangerous.

As the host nation's highest-ranked male player, Draper began his tournament with a confident and commanding performance, demonstrating a powerful serve.

          <p>A federal judge has issued a preliminary injunction, blocking the Department of Health and Human Services (HHS) from proceeding with mass layoffs and a major restructuring plan. The ruling came in response to a lawsuit from 19 Democratic attorneys general who argued the plan would have devastating consequences for public health services nationwide. The judge found "no rational basis" for the administration's plan, which was initiated by HHS Secretary Robert F. Kennedy Jr. and involved laying off 10,000 employees. The court determined the executive branch likely exceeded its authority in ordering such wholesale changes to congressionally created agencies.</p>

          <p>Waffle House has officially removed the 50-cent surcharge it had added to egg orders, signaling a normalization of egg prices after a period of record highs. The restaurant chain, which serves hundreds of millions of eggs annually, implemented the temporary charge in February due to soaring wholesale costs caused by a major avian flu outbreak. The removal of the surcharge reflects a broader trend of falling egg prices, which Agriculture Secretary Brooke Rollins noted is providing relief to families. Overall food prices have continued to climb, but the stabilization of this breakfast staple marks a welcome change for consumers.</p>
