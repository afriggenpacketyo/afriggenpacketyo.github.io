          <p>The U.S. Supreme Court has commenced its new term, with a docket featuring significant cases on topics such as "conversion therapy" bans, racial redistricting, gun rights, and transgender athlete participation. A major theme of the term will be legal challenges to President Trump's policies, including his use of reciprocal tariffs and his authority to fire officials at independent agencies. The court's decisions in these cases could have far-reaching implications for both social policy and the balance of power within the executive branch. The outcomes will be closely watched given the court's 6-3 conservative majority.</p>

This figure surpasses the first-week sales of her previous two albums and marks the largest opening since Ed Sheeran's "Divide" in 2017. In the U.S., the album sold 2.7 million copies on its first day alone, setting a new personal record for Swift and smashing the record for single-week vinyl sales. The massive commercial success underscores Swift's continued dominance in a music industry where overall album sales have been in decline.</p>

          <p>OpenAI has entered into a significant, multi-year agreement to purchase AI chips from Advanced Micro Devices (AMD), a move seen as a major challenge to market leader Nvidia. The deal, which AMD expects to generate tens of billions in revenue, caused AMD's stock to surge while Nvidia's dipped. OpenAI plans to use AMD's chips for inference, the day-to-day running of AI models, complementing its existing relationship with Nvidia, which is a stronghold in AI training. This development highlights the massive and growing demand for AI computing power, suggesting the market is large enough to support multiple major players. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>Treasury Secretary Scott Bessent has appointed Frank Bisignano, the current Commissioner of the Social Security Administration (SSA), to the newly created position of CEO of the Internal Revenue Service (IRS). Bisignano, a former Wall Street executive, will hold both roles simultaneously, overseeing daily operations at the IRS while continuing to lead the SSA. The Treasury Department stated that the two agencies share similar technological and customer service objectives, making Bisignano a "natural choice." This appointment follows recent leadership instability at the IRS and places a business executive in a key operational role.</p>

          <p>South Africa's women's cricket team secured a decisive six-wicket victory over New Zealand at the World Cup, making a strong recovery from their previous heavy defeat against England. Batter Tazmin Brits scored a remarkable 101 runs, her fourth century in five one-day international innings, leading the successful chase of New Zealand's 231-run total. New Zealand struggled with both their batting and bowling, collapsing from a strong position and failing to contain the South African batters. The win puts South Africa in a much stronger position in the tournament, while New Zealand faces increased pressure.</p>

          <p>The Trump administration has reportedly resumed processing student loan forgiveness for some borrowers enrolled in the Income-Based Repayment (IBR) plan, according to a student loan industry trade group. Discharges under the program, which cancels remaining debt after 20-25 years of payments, had been paused since July while the Department of Education assessed the impact of court decisions blocking the SAVE plan. While some borrowers are now receiving notices of forgiveness, consumer advocates note that many others, including those eligible for Public Service Loan Forgiveness, are still facing significant backlogs and delays.</p>

          <p>Japan's ruling Liberal Democratic Party has chosen Sanae Takaichi, a hardline conservative, as its new leader, positioning her to become the country's first female prime minister. Takaichi, a staunch supporter of former Prime Minister Shinzo Abe's vision, faces immediate challenges, including addressing inflation and navigating complex diplomatic relations. Her conservative stances, such as visits to the controversial Yasukuni Shrine, have already strained her party's long-standing coalition with the centrist Komeito party. Her leadership will be tested as she works to regain public support and stabilize her party's political standing.</p>

          <p>A recent drop in mortgage rates, influenced by the Federal Reserve's first rate cut of 2025, has made homeownership more affordable. For a $550,000 mortgage, the current average 30-year fixed rate of 6.34% results in a monthly principal and interest payment of about $3,419. This is over $200 less per month compared to the rates seen at the beginning of the year. The article explains that while this provides relief for new buyers, existing homeowners with higher-rate mortgages may also benefit by refinancing, though they must consider closing costs.

        </div>
        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>The superstructure, or "island," on an aircraft carrier is almost always located on the starboard (right) side of the flight deck, a design choice rooted in early aviation physics. Pilots on the first carriers requested a visual reference on the right side to help judge landings. This placement was reinforced by the natural left-turning tendency of early propeller-driven aircraft, caused by aerodynamic forces like P-factor and spiraling slipstream from clockwise-rotating propellers. Placing the island on the right gave pilots more room to correct their aircraft's natural veer to the left during critical takeoff and landing phases.</p>
