Swift expressed immense joy and relief at regaining control of her music, emphasizing the importance of artists owning their work. She also provided an update on the rerecording of her "Reputation" album, noting that it has been challenging to recreate due to its specific connection to a particular period in her life, though unreleased vault tracks may be released in the future.

          <p>The UK Treasury has completed the sale of its remaining shares in NatWest Group, marking the end of government ownership nearly two decades after the bank's bailout during the 2008 financial crisis. This event signifies a symbolic closure to a tumultuous period in British banking history, with the government having spent ¬£45 billion to acquire an 84% stake in the Royal Bank of Scotland (RBS), now part of NatWest Group. While the government's investment resulted in a loss of approximately ¬£10 billion, officials emphasize that the bailout was crucial to saving the UK economy from collapse. The sale raises questions about the current vulnerability of UK banks to emerging risks, such as cyber attacks, and whether taxpayers would need to intervene again in a future financial crisis. </p>

          <p>Oscar Piastri topped the second practice session at the Spanish Grand Prix, with McLaren setting a strong pace in Barcelona. The FIA introduced a new front-wing flexibility test aimed at limiting teams' ability to use flexing wings to control aerodynamic performance. Red Bull and Ferrari hope the stricter regulations will enhance their competitiveness, while McLaren believes the changes will have minimal impact on their performance. Teams have historically used front-wing flexibility to improve speed on straights while maintaining downforce in corners, tuning car performance between high- and low-speed cornering. </p>

          <h2>Strategies to Manage Finances as Fed Maintains Higher Interest Rates</h2>
          <div class="timestamp">2025-05-30 12:03:20 EDT</div>
        </div>
        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>With the Federal Reserve signaling that interest rate cuts are unlikely in the near future, experts suggest several strategies for consumers to manage their finances. These include paying down high-interest credit card debt, locking in high-yield savings rates, and improving credit scores. Lowering interest rates through balance transfers or personal loans can significantly reduce debt costs. Locking in high-yield savings rates before the Fed eventually lowers rates can provide better returns. Improving credit scores can lead to lower interest rates and better access to credit.
