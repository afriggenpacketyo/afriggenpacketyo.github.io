          <p>SpaceX has successfully completed the eleventh test flight of its massive Starship rocket, which launched from a site in South Texas. The Super Heavy booster performed a controlled entry into the Gulf of Mexico, while the Starship upper stage continued to the edge of space before splashing down in the Indian Ocean. This flight marks another significant step in the development of the vehicle, which is crucial for NASA's Artemis program aiming to land astronauts on the Moon. The mission was the final test before SpaceX introduces an upgraded prototype designed for long-duration missions to the Moon and Mars.</p>

          <p>Following a highly successful initial public offering, the market capitalization of LG Electronics India has surpassed that of its South Korean parent company. The subsidiary's shares surged by over 45% on their market debut, driven by the strongest demand for an Indian IPO since 2008, which attracted bids worth nearly $50 billion. This event highlights the robust health and depth of India's domestic capital markets and signals strong investor confidence in the country's growing consumer electronics sector. The successful listing reflects a broader trend of international companies tapping into India's vibrant economic landscape. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>A 16-year-old from Scotland, Cameron McGerr, is advocating for mandatory CPR training in schools after tragically losing both of his parents to separate heart conditions. He believes that had he been trained in CPR, he might have been able to help save his father, as he lost critical time panicking while on the phone with emergency services. His campaign, named "Pulse of Life," has successfully introduced the life-saving training at his own school and has captured the attention of Scottish government officials, including the Education Secretary. His story highlights the potential for widespread CPR education to save lives.</p>

          <p>Former British Prime Minister Rishi Sunak has intensified his call for the creation of a targeted screening program for prostate cancer in the United Kingdom. Acting as an ambassador for Prostate Cancer Research, Sunak argues that a focused initiative for high-risk groups, such as men with a family history of the disease and Black men, would be both affordable and effective in saving lives. His advocacy comes at a time when the UK's National Screening Committee is re-evaluating its current position, which does not recommend routine screening, amid ongoing debate among medical experts.</p>

          <p>A team of researchers at Peking University in China has successfully used artificial intelligence to restore a revered 1,600-year-old work of Chinese calligraphy. The masterpiece, known as "Rhapsody on the Luo River Goddess," was originally created by the calligrapher Wang Xianzhi, but only about a quarter of it had survived over the centuries. By training an AI model on the stylistic features of the remaining 250 characters, the team was able to generate a complete version of the 919-character scroll, showcasing an innovative application of AI in the preservation of cultural heritage.</p>

          <p>In an effort to increase the number of blood donors, particularly among young people, the UK's National Health Service (NHS) has partnered with the Driver and Vehicle Licensing Agency (DVLA). The new initiative will include a prompt in communications to driving licence applicants, encouraging them to register as blood donors. This strategy aims to leverage the millions of license applications processed annually to address a persistent blood shortage. Officials hope the campaign will be as successful as a similar long-standing program that has effectively recruited organ donors through the same channel.</p>

          <p>In the Major League Baseball playoffs, the Seattle Mariners have established a strong 2-0 series lead over the Toronto Blue Jays in the American League Championship Series after a decisive 10-3 victory. The Blue Jays' offense has been notably quiet, with star player Vladimir Guerrero Jr. remaining hitless through the first two games. In the National League, the Los Angeles Dodgers began their Championship Series with a 2-1 win against the Milwaukee Brewers. This victory gives the Dodgers an early but crucial advantage as they seek to advance to the World Series.</p>

          <p>The Los Angeles Dodgers secured a 2-1 victory over the Milwaukee Brewers in the first game of the National League Championship Series, largely thanks to a stellar performance by pitcher Blake Snell. He pitched eight scoreless innings, allowing only a single hit while striking out ten batters. The Dodgers overcame a chaotic and unusual inning-ending double play that nullified a potential grand slam. The decisive run came from a sixth-inning solo home run by Freddie Freeman, highlighting the team's ability to win crucial games through the strength of its star players.</p>

          <p>A woman named Tina, who suffered a traumatic brain injury after a fall that left her in a coma and with impaired speech, has found a new way to communicate by learning British Sign Language (BSL). Before her accident, she had a distinguished career as an RAF navigator and later as a lawyer. Through a BBC program that introduced BSL to residents of her retirement village, she has regained confidence and discovered that signing helps her access words she struggles to speak. Her journey illustrates the transformative power of sign language as a communication tool beyond the deaf community.</p>

          <p>Singapore's economy demonstrated resilient growth in the third quarter, expanding by 2.9% year-on-year, which was higher than economists had predicted. However, this rate marks a slowdown from the 4.5% growth recorded in the previous quarter, with the manufacturing sector's output flattening. In response to the data, the Monetary Authority of Singapore has maintained its current policy settings but issued a cautious outlook, forecasting that GDP growth will likely moderate to a near-trend pace in 2026 as global trade conditions normalize and external demand shifts.
