          <p>Two years after a devastating, season-ending Achilles injury just four plays into his New York Jets debut, quarterback Aaron Rodgers is set to return to the same field. Now 41, Rodgers will be playing for the Pittsburgh Steelers in a season opener against the very team that recently released him. The article recounts the immense hype and subsequent heartbreak of his short-lived Jets tenure, which failed to end the team's long-standing playoff drought. The game is framed as a highly anticipated matchup, offering a chance for closure for Rodgers, the Jets, and their respective fanbases as both teams move forward with new quarterbacks.</p>

          <p>Daniel Andreas San Diego, a suspected double bomber linked to animal rights extremism, is facing an extradition hearing in London after being a fugitive for 21 years. He was on the FBI's most wanted terrorist list with a $250,000 bounty for his alleged role in two 2003 bombings in the San Francisco Bay Area. After vanishing following a high-speed chase, he was discovered living under an alias in a cottage in north Wales in 2024. Former FBI agents involved in the original case recall 'missed opportunities' to arrest him, stating they later found a 'bomb-making lab' in his abandoned car, highlighting the long and frustrating path to his eventual capture.</p>

          <p>Sky-watchers in the United Kingdom will have the opportunity to witness a total lunar eclipse, which will cause the full Moon to take on a reddish hue, an event commonly known as a 'Blood Moon.' The phenomenon occurs when the Earth passes directly between the Sun and the Moon, casting its shadow onto the lunar surface. Visibility in the UK will be best in eastern regions as the Moon rises, with the total eclipse phase lasting from 18:30 to 19:52 BST. Experts advise finding a clear view of the horizon to observe the event, which showcases the mechanics of the solar system in real-time and requires no special eye protection.</p>

          <p>The second-largest Powerball jackpot in U.S. lottery history, valued at nearly $1.8 billion, has been won by two ticket holders in Missouri and Texas. The winners matched all six numbers drawn on Saturday night, ending a streak of 41 consecutive drawings without a jackpot winner. Each ticketholder will now choose between their share of an estimated $410.3 million lump sum cash payment or an annuity option worth $893.5 million paid out over 30 years. The massive prize drew widespread participation, with the odds of winning the jackpot standing at approximately 1 in 292.2 million.</p>

          <p>Charles Robinson, a 24-year-old university dropout, founded the water filtration company Water2, which has rapidly grown into an eight-figure business within two years. After initial struggles, Robinson found success by using authentic social media videos to explain the science behind his product and the issues with UK tap water. The brand's purpose-driven message attracted adventurer Bear Grylls, who first became a customer and has since invested to become a co-owner of the company. Water2's self-installable filters are now in over 180,000 homes, with Robinson attributing the brand's focused success to saying 'no' to early offers from large retailers and venture capitalists.</p>

          <p>Shaun Cassidy, a prominent teen idol from the 1970s, is returning to the stage for his first major arena tour in 45 years. Now 66, Cassidy has spent recent decades as a successful television writer and producer but is now relearning his own hit songs on guitar for the 50-city tour. He revealed that because he hasn't performed them in so long, the songs feel new again, and he believes his voice is stronger after a long rest. An introvert by nature, Cassidy stepped away from the spotlight as he was never comfortable with fame, making his return a surprising new chapter in his decades-long career in entertainment.</p>

          <p>Senator Bernie Sanders joined New York City Democratic mayoral nominee Zohran Mamdani at a town hall in Brooklyn, framing the campaign as a crucial fight against the growing influence of oligarchy in American politics. Before a crowd of 1,700, both politicians condemned billionaire donors and corporate power, with Sanders calling Mamdani's grassroots movement a 'test case' for democracy. The 33-year-old Democratic socialist has gained significant progressive support for his platform, which includes rent freezes and higher taxes for the wealthy. The event highlighted the campaign's focus on mobilizing working-class voters against what they describe as a corrupt political establishment.</p>

          <p>The USC Trojans secured a decisive 59-20 victory against Georgia Southern, led by former USC coach Clay Helton. USC's offense was formidable for the second consecutive week, accumulating an impressive 755 total yards, the most for the program in two decades. Quarterback Jayden Maiava threw for a career-high 412 yards and four touchdowns before backups took over in the fourth quarter. The rushing attack was equally effective, gaining 309 yards on the ground. While the defense showed some vulnerabilities, the offensive firepower was more than enough to control the game and move the Trojans to a 2-0 record.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>A team of researchers from the U.S. and China has developed an innovative method for launching millimeter-scale robots by harnessing the energy released from collapsing vapor bubbles. The process, known as cavitation, is triggered by using a laser to rapidly heat a light-absorbing material, causing nearby water droplets to boil and form bubbles. When these bubbles collapse, they generate a powerful force capable of launching tiny jumpers up to 1.5 meters in the air. This technique offers a new, efficient launching mechanism that could have future applications in robotics and micro-scale engineering, with the potential for controlled movement on wet surfaces.</p>

          <p>As numerous states implement classroom cellphone bans, school districts across the U.S. are turning to Yondr pouches as a solution. These magnetic pouches lock a student's phone, which they carry throughout the day, and can only be opened at designated unlocking stations at the school's entrance. The goal is to reduce distractions and improve student engagement, a change many educators say is already noticeable with more conversation and less screen time. While some students have expressed frustration or tried to bypass the system, proponents argue the pouches help create a culture change and a more focused learning environment for millions of students.</p>

          <p>The recent Shanghai Cooperation Organisation (SCO) summit in Tianjin served as a platform for China to project its vision for a multipolar global order. Led by President Xi Jinping, the event was a significant diplomatic display, positioning China as a stable alternative to the perceived volatility of the United States under President Donald Trump. The summit emphasized combating terrorism and integrating economic initiatives like the Belt and Road Initiative. Notably, the friendly interactions between Xi, Russia's Vladimir Putin, and India's Narendra Modi were seen as a powerful symbol of an emerging Eurasian bloc challenging the traditional U.S.-led international system.</p>
