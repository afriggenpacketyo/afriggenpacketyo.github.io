        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>India is looking to tap into its rare earth reserves as China's restrictions on rare earth exports are impacting various industries. Experts believe that India could become an alternative to China for countries like the U.S. if it invests more in the sector. China currently dominates the rare earth elements market, producing about 60% of the world's supply and processing nearly 90%. India's Union Minister of Commerce and Industry Piyush Goyal called China's pause in exports of rare earth elements a "wake-up call" for the world and an opportunity for India to provide an alternative.

          <p>According to the World Gold Council, cryptocurrencies like Bitcoin do not pose a threat to gold's role as a safe-haven investment. The researcher, John Reade, points out that cryptocurrencies tend to move with equities, unlike gold, which acts as a hedge during market volatility. Reade believes that digital assets have different characteristics and should not be marketed as "gold 2.0". His comments come amidst growing market interest in stablecoins and other digital currencies, as well as a fresh rally in gold prices due to Middle East tensions. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>The average age of mothers giving birth in the U.S. has risen to nearly 30 years old in 2023, according to a CDC report. This increase is attributed to factors like changing social expectations, advancements in fertility technology, and the rising cost of raising children. The report also indicates a continuing decline in teen pregnancies. Experts suggest this decline could be due to adolescents delaying sexual activity or changes in contraceptive practices.</p>

          <p>Dan Wang describes China as an "engineering state" due to its rapid development and extensive construction of infrastructure, from subway stations to high-speed rail. He contrasts this with the United States, which he calls the "lawyerly state." China's focus on STEM education and the prevalence of engineers in top government positions highlight the country's emphasis on technological advancement and large-scale public works. This approach has allowed China to compress the time needed to build its infrastructure compared to other nations.</p>
