        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>The Labor Department reported that the annual inflation rate in April was 2.3%, slightly below expectations, with the consumer price index rising 0.2% for the month. Core CPI, excluding food and energy, also increased by 0.2% monthly and 2.8% year-over-year. This data reflects the initial impact of President Trump's tariffs on a slowing U.S. economy. The slightly lower inflation rate defies concerns about a surge in prices following the implementation of tariffs, though analysts anticipate a potential rekindling of inflation as retailers restock inventory with goods imported after the tariffs took effect.

        </div>
        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>This New York Times article discusses President Trump's decision to reduce tariffs on Chinese goods from 145% to 30% for a temporary period, while China will reciprocate by lowering its retaliatory levies. The move comes after Trump's initial claims that China needed America more, but the administration's actions suggest that America relies on trade with other countries as well. The article notes that Trump's tariffs led to price hikes and potential shortages, weakening his negotiating position, and China's patient approach ultimately led to the tariff reduction. Despite the temporary easing, tariffs remain higher than before Trump's second term, potentially leading to increased prices for consumers.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>This article reports that consumer prices rose 2.3% in April compared to the previous year, slightly cooling from the previous month, even after President Trump's "Liberation Day" tariffs. The reading matched economists' expectations and defied fears of an inflation surge. Trump paused a large swath of so-called "reciprocal tariffs" within days of the announcement, and temporarily slashed tariffs on China from 145% to 30%. The rollback of levies on Chinese goods is expected to reduce the average cost of tariffs per household this year from $4,900 to $2,800.</p>
