          <p>In response to the U.S. President halting trade talks, Canada has rescinded its planned digital services tax on major technology firms just before it was set to take effect. The tax would have applied a 3% levy on revenue from Canadian users for companies like Google and Amazon. This reversal is intended to restart crucial negotiations for a comprehensive economic and security agreement between the two nations, de-escalating a significant trade dispute.</p>

          <p>As electric vehicles (EVs) become more common, a growing number of passengers report experiencing motion sickness while riding in them. Scientific studies suggest that the unique acceleration and deceleration patterns of EVs, particularly the low-frequency movements from regenerative braking systems, are more likely to induce nausea and discomfort. Researchers are now exploring solutions to mitigate this effect and improve the passenger experience in these vehicles.</p>
