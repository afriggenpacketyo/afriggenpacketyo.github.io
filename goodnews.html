          <p>The Coca-Cola Company announced third-quarter financial results that exceeded Wall Street's expectations for both earnings and revenue. Despite facing weaker consumer demand in key markets like the U.S., the beverage giant has maintained a more bullish outlook from analysts compared to its rival, PepsiCo. The company affirmed its full-year forecast, projecting a 3% rise in comparable earnings per share and organic revenue growth between 5% and 6%. Reports also suggest that Coca-Cola is considering the sale of its Costa Coffee chain, which it acquired in 2019 but has not delivered the expected growth in its ready-to-drink and at-home coffee segments.

          <p>General Motors reported strong third-quarter earnings that surpassed Wall Street estimates, leading the company to raise its financial outlook for 2025. The automaker posted adjusted earnings of $2.80 per share on $48.59 billion in revenue, exceeding analyst expectations. Consequently, GM increased its full-year guidance for adjusted earnings and free cash flow, signaling confidence in its performance for the remainder of the year. The company also lowered its projected financial impact from tariffs. These positive results come despite GM reporting significant special charges related to its pullback from all-electric vehicle production, which impacted its net income. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>Scientists report that the population of the critically endangered North Atlantic right whale has increased for the fourth year in a row, reaching an estimated 384 individuals. This marks an increase of eight whales from the previous year, offering a sign of hope for a species that had seen its numbers decline by 25% between 2010 and 2020. Researchers credit conservation measures, particularly in Canada, for the positive trend. While threats from ship collisions and fishing gear entanglement persist, there are also encouraging signs of improved reproduction, with four new mothers giving birth this year, which is crucial for the species' long-term recovery.</p>

          <h2>Southern California Faces Slight Chance of Rain and Thunderstorms Mid-Week</h2>
          <div class="timestamp">2025-10-21 06:00:00 EDT</div>
        </div>
        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>The Los Angeles region may experience light rain and a slight chance of thunderstorms this week, primarily affecting interior valleys and mountain areas. According to the National Weather Service, the chance of precipitation is low and will not resemble the intense storm that soaked the area last week. Meteorologists noted a small risk of dry lightning in mountain regions, which occurs when rain evaporates before reaching the ground, potentially increasing fire risk. However, this threat is considered low, especially since last week's significant rainfall has temporarily reduced the overall fire danger across Southern California, despite the ongoing La Niña pattern that typically brings drier conditions.</p>

          <p>Staff at the Sequoia Park Zoo in Eureka, California, were surprised to find a wild American black bear on a tour trail before the zoo opened. The bear was observed leaning on a gate, seemingly interacting with the zoo's three captive black bears through their habitat's fencing. The wild bear, believed to have come from the adjacent Sequoia Park, did not act aggressively and was described by the zoo as a "very polite visitor." Officials from the Eureka Police Department and the California Department of Fish and Wildlife safely guided the animal back into the woods without incident, leaving the mystery of how it entered the secure facility unsolved.</p>

          <p>A new exhibition titled "Monuments," co-presented by the Museum of Contemporary Art in Los Angeles, features nearly a dozen Confederate statues that were removed from public spaces across the country. The exhibition juxtaposes these controversial monuments, some still bearing the paint and graffiti from protests, with contemporary artworks that provide critical context and emotionally charged responses. Curators aim to foster a poetic and associative dialogue about civil rights, history, and the legacy of slavery. The show's opening is particularly timely, as the Trump administration has begun efforts to reinstall some of these same monuments, intensifying the national debate over their place in American society.</p>

          <p>In southwest Madagascar, a nation facing extreme poverty and political instability, a novel conservation project is attempting to restore collapsing coral reefs and fisheries by focusing on human needs. Instead of restricting fishing, which is a primary source of food and income, a small nonprofit is building artificial reefs to create new fishing grounds. This approach aims to alleviate pressure on natural reefs, which have been decimated by overfishing and climate change. The project represents a shift away from traditional conservation models that have often failed in Madagascar by not addressing the root causes of environmental exploitation, namely the desperate poverty that forces local populations to depend on natural resources.</p>

The company WindBorne Systems stated its belief that one of its long-duration weather balloons struck the aircraft, causing the damage. The flight, carrying 134 passengers and six crew members, landed safely, and passengers were transferred to another plane. The National Transportation Safety Board is investigating the incident and will examine the damaged, multi-layered windshield in its lab to determine the exact cause of the crack.

          <p>Following a second cruciate ligament tear in 15 months for German soccer star Lena Oberdorf, this article provides an overview of the common and severe knee injury. It explains that the anterior cruciate ligament (ACL) stabilizes the knee and typically tears from non-contact movements like abrupt stops or changes in direction. Treatment can be surgical, replacing the ligament with a graft, or conservative, focusing on strengthening surrounding muscles. The article notes that female athletes face a higher risk due to anatomical, genetic, and hormonal factors. Recovery is lengthy, often taking six to nine months before a return to competitive sports is possible.</p>

Her path to leadership was secured through a last-minute coalition deal with an opposition party.

The operation is part of a broader crackdown on online fraud rings that have become notorious for luring foreign workers under false pretenses and forcing them into criminal scamming activities. During the raid, authorities also seized dozens of unlicensed Starlink satellite internet terminals used by the operation. The military government accused the Karen National Union, an armed ethnic group opposed to its rule, of being involved in the scam projects, a claim the group denies.
