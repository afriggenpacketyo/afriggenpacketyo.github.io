          <p>Columbia University activist Mahmoud Khalil was released from an Immigration and Customs Enforcement detention facility in Louisiana after a federal judge ordered his release while his immigration proceedings continue. Khalil, who was detained for months due to "foreign policy" concerns under the Trump administration, addressed reporters, stating that the administration chose the wrong person to target. The judge determined that Khalil is not a threat to the community or a flight risk, restricting his travel to specific states. Khalil, a green card holder, was initially detained in March, separating him from his pregnant wife, and immigration officials had previously denied his request to attend his son's birth. His release marks a significant moment in his legal battle against deportation.</p>

          <p>A federal judge has blocked the Trump administration from revoking Harvard University's ability to enroll international students, preventing the government from cutting off the school's access to a federal database that tracks student visa applications. President Trump hinted at a potential "deal" with Harvard, stating that the school has acted appropriately during negotiations and appears committed to doing what is right. The Department of Homeland Security had previously accused Harvard of failing to address campus antisemitism, leading to the initial attempt to revoke its student visa system certification. Harvard has defended its rights and the rights of its students and scholars, emphasizing the importance of international students to the university's community.</p>

          <p>Visits by foreign tourists to locations related to manga and anime in Japan have significantly boosted local economies, according to a study.

Purchases of anime and manga-related goods totaled 54.3 billion yen last year, a 53 percent increase from 2016. This phenomenon, known as "seichi junrei," involves fans visiting real-life settings that inspired popular works. While beneficial, local governments need to address overtourism issues and develop multilingual support systems to accommodate the growing number of tourists.</p>

          <p>Due to surging rice prices, Japanese restaurants and food companies are increasingly switching to noodles as a cost-effective alternative. Antworks Co., which operates pork rice bowl eateries, has opened its first ramen noodle restaurant and plans to open three more. Yoshinoya Holdings Co. is also strengthening its ramen noodle business, citing the saturated beef bowl market. Rice prices have doubled from the previous year, prompting consumers to seek alternatives in supermarkets, leading to increased sales of frozen udon noodles and yogurt products.
