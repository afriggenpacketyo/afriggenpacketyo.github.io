        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Exxon Mobil reported first-quarter earnings that surpassed Wall Street's expectations, although profits declined compared to the previous year due to falling crude oil prices. Volume growth in the Permian Basin and Guyana, along with cost-cutting measures, helped offset the impact of weaker oil prices. The company's global production business saw a 19% increase in earnings, driven by growth in the Permian and Guyana regions. Exxon returned $9.1 billion to shareholders through dividends and share repurchases. Optimism Score: 65 (not investment advice)</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>As discussions intensify regarding President Trump's policy agenda, potential changes to the state and local tax (SALT) deduction limit could impact higher earners. The $10,000 SALT cap, enacted in 2017, is set to expire after 2025 unless Congress takes action. While Trump initially enacted the cap, he has since expressed support for reform, leading to discussions about potential updates, including a complete repeal or a higher deduction limit. The outcome will depend on broader budget considerations and competing priorities. Optimism Score: 60 (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>Nigel Farage's Reform U.K. party secured a significant victory in a parliamentary special election in Runcorn and Helsby, narrowly defeating the Labour Party. The win, driven by anti-incumbent sentiment and concerns over immigration, marks a potential shift towards a more polarized, multiparty system in Britain. Reform's candidate, Sarah Pochin, won by just six votes, highlighting the tight race and the party's ability to capitalize on voter frustration. This victory, coupled with potential gains in local council elections, could establish Reform as a genuine rival to the major parties. Optimism Score: 60</p>

          <p>Chevron's stock price fell following the release of its first-quarter earnings report, which revealed a decline in profit due to lower oil prices. The oil major said it plans to repurchase less of its own stock in the second quarter, reflecting the impact of weaker oil prices. U.S. crude oil prices have fallen due to concerns that President Trump's tariffs will weigh on demand, while OPEC+ plans to increase supply. Chevron's U.S. production business posted a profit decline, while its refining business saw a profit increase but a year-over-year decline due to lower margins.
