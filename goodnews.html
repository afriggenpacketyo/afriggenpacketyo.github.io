          <p>European stock markets saw gains, led by a nearly 7% surge in shares of Zara's parent company, Inditex, following a positive sales report for its new collections. The company's performance provided reassurance to investors, with analysts noting a significant acceleration in trading momentum. The market report also noted a rise in Novo Nordisk shares after the pharmaceutical company announced job cuts. Broader market focus remains on global inflation data and geopolitical trade tensions, including reports of U.S. pressure on the EU regarding tariffs. (not investment advice)</p>

The deal, which includes a firm order for 20 jets with an option for 20 more, marks a significant step for China's ambitions in the global aviation market. The C909, formerly known as the ARJ21, is a short-haul aircraft designed to compete with similar models from other established manufacturers.

In social media posts, both leaders referred to their positive relationship and suggested talks would continue in the coming weeks to resolve ongoing friction over tariffs. This apparent de-escalation comes after months of tension, during which the U.S. imposed additional tariffs on Indian imports due to New Delhi's continued purchases of Russian oil. Key hurdles, such as U.S. access to India's agricultural markets, still remain unresolved.</p>

          <p>The Plattenbau, the prefabricated concrete slab apartment blocks that defined much of East Germany's urban landscape, is the subject of a new exhibition in Potsdam. The show explores the complex cultural legacy of these buildings, viewing them not just as architectural heritage but as symbols of socialist utopias, community, and subsequent societal upheaval. Once promoted as a modern solution to post-war housing shortages, these complexes became associated with economic decline and social problems after German reunification. The exhibition fosters a nuanced discussion about these divisive structures.</p>

          <p>The universities of Kent and Greenwich have announced plans to merge, creating what is being described as the UK's first "super-university" that will operate across the South East region. The new institution, to be known as the London and South East University Group, will be formally established by the 2026 academic year. Officials state the merger will create a stronger financial foundation to navigate economic challenges facing the higher education sector, where many universities are reportedly in deficit. The move is seen as an innovative model for collaboration and financial stability.</p>

          <p>Zohran Mamdani, the New York City mayoral candidate, has faced scrutiny in the U.S. over his multi-hyphenated identity, but in his birthplace of Kampala, Uganda, his African heritage is seen as straightforward. The article explores how Ugandans, including those of Indian descent like Mamdani's family, view him as "their own son," highlighting the complex history of the Indian diaspora in East Africa. This perspective contrasts with U.S. debates over racial categories, which were sparked by his identification as both "Asian" and "Black or African American" on a college application.</p>

          <p>Former champion Andre Ward analyzes the upcoming super-fight between Saul "Canelo" Álvarez and Terence Crawford, framing it as a legacy-defining matchup for both boxers. He notes that while Álvarez is the bigger name and the natural super-middleweight, Crawford is an undefeated, all-time great moving up two weight classes for the challenge. Ward highlights the significant risks for both fighters, stating that a loss at this stage of their careers would be a major blemish on their records. He suggests that while size will be a factor, Crawford's technical skill makes it difficult to bet against him.</p>

          <p>The Australian government has announced a US$1.1 billion investment to build a fleet of domestically developed "Ghost Shark" autonomous underwater attack drones. Defense Minister Richard Marles described the technology as the most advanced of its kind, stating that "dozens" of the long-range, stealthy vehicles will be delivered to the Australian Navy over the next five years. This strategic move aims to significantly enhance Australia's underwater defense capabilities and serve as a deterrent amid China's growing military presence in the Pacific region.

          <p>Despite a poor run of results, statistical analysis suggests Manchester United's underlying performance has been strong. The team has taken the most shots in the league over its last 10 games while conceding the second-fewest, indicating dominance in chance creation and prevention. However, the club has severely underperformed in both scoring goals and preventing them, with players converting chances at a much lower rate than expected. This discrepancy suggests the team's struggles may be due to poor finishing and individual errors rather than flawed tactics.</p>

          <p>A federal judge has issued a preliminary injunction preventing President Donald Trump from firing Federal Reserve Governor Lisa Cook, dealing a setback to the administration's efforts to influence the central bank.

This decision allows Cook to continue her duties while her lawsuit proceeds, representing an unprecedented challenge to the Federal Reserve's independence from political interference.</p>

Developed over a decade by university scientists, the single-dose vaccine has been shown in trials to significantly reduce symptoms and mortality from the infection, which can cause blindness, infertility, and death. With approval secured, researchers are now seeking major funding to roll out the vaccine to wildlife hospitals and at-risk wild koala populations.

          <p>A new laboratory at Alaska Pacific University has been established to investigate the surprising prevalence of microplastics in even the most remote areas of Alaska, from urban streams to the summit of Denali. Launched with a $5 million NASA grant, the lab will use advanced technology to trace the sources and pathways of these pollutants in the state's waterways. The research is critical for understanding the potential health risks to humans and wildlife, particularly in rural communities that rely on untreated water sources. The facility will be Alaska's first accredited lab dedicated to analyzing microplastic contamination.</p>
