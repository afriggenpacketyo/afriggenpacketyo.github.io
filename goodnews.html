          <p>Palantir's stock experienced a decline of approximately 9% in after-hours trading, even though the company's first-quarter earnings aligned with analysts' forecasts and revenue guidance was raised. The defense technology company reported adjusted earnings per share of 13 cents and revenue of $884 million, surpassing the expected $863 million. CEO Alex Karp emphasized the company's pivotal role in providing the operating system for modern enterprises in the era of AI, noting a surge in adoption of Palantir's software, especially within the U.S. defense sector, and the company's commercial revenue saw a 71% increase, while government sales rose by 45%.</p>

          <p>China's state broadcaster, CCTV, has released footage of the electromagnetic catapult system in action on the country's most advanced aircraft carrier, the Fujian, offering a glimpse of its cutting-edge jet launch technology. The report also suggested that the Fujian would require longer sea trials than China‚Äôs other carriers due to the complexity of the launch system, dampening speculation of it being ready for service this year. The footage showed an air traffic control officer giving take-off clearance to an aircraft, and commentator Cao Weidong noted that the electromagnetic catapult system allows carrier-based aircraft to take off with full fuel and ordnance, potentially enabling the deployment of fixed-wing early warning aircraft and drones.</p>

The dress code for the gala was ‚ÄúTailored For You,‚Äù and many guests interpreted this as suiting, showcasing a variety of suits from pastel to pinstripe, alongside creative accessories like hats and musical instruments, as Jon Batiste brought a saxophone and Andr√© 3000 carried a piano. Diana Ross was noted for her sweeping feathered coat embroidered with the names of her children and grandchildren, while other celebrities like Colman Domingo, Zendaya, and Jennie also made memorable fashion statements. The article highlights 15 of the most unforgettable looks from the event, emphasizing the blend of fashion, fundraising, and cultural celebration.</p>

          <p>Defense Secretary Pete Hegseth has mandated a minimum 20% reduction in the number of four-star generals and admirals across the military, along with cuts to general officers in the National Guard and flag officers. In a memo posted on the Defense Department's website, Hegseth stated that the military must be unencumbered by unnecessary bureaucratic layers to drive innovation and operational excellence, and he announced the memo in a video on X, vowing to shift resources from bloated headquarters elements to warfighters. Hegseth has previously questioned the number of top military officers, noting that the U.S. had significantly fewer during World War II.</p>

          <p>Generations of deep-diving among women on a South Korean island may have changed their genetic evolution. The Haenyeo, or "sea women," of Jeju Island, have developed adaptations that allow them to dive for longer periods than other people, and genomic analysis has revealed they have evolved genetically to have lower blood pressure and enhanced cold-water tolerance. Researchers believe this evolution protects pregnant women while diving, and the findings could help science develop new medical treatments in the future. The Haenyeo's unique genetic mutations may offer insights into treating stroke and other conditions.</p>
