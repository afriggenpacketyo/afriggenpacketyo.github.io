          <p>Green Tea Group experienced a weak start in its Hong Kong stock market debut, with shares initially unchanged before declining by 7%. The company raised HK$847 million (US$108.5 million) through its IPO, but traders are more focused on the upcoming debut of Contemporary Amperex Technology (CATL), the world's largest electric vehicle battery pack maker. CATL's US$5.3 billion IPO is highly anticipated, overshadowing smaller stock sales like Green Tea Group's. Fifteen companies raised HK$17.7 billion in Hong Kong in the first quarter of this year, positioning the city as a prominent IPO destination. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>Former FBI Director James Comey is under investigation by the Secret Service after posting and then deleting an Instagram photo of seashells arranged to spell "8647," which Republicans interpreted as a threat to President Donald Trump. The number 86 is slang for 'reject' or 'get rid of', and Trump is the 47th president. Comey initially captioned the photo "Cool shell formation on my beach walk," but later removed the post after allegations of incitement to violence. Comey stated he opposes violence of any kind, and did not realize the numbers were associated with violence.</p>

          <p>Northern California's commercial crab season is facing challenges due to migrating humpback whales becoming entangled in crab fishing ropes. Since 2007, over 900 humpback whales have been injured or killed by these ropes. Some fishermen are using experimental pop-up technology, developed by the U.S. military, which uses remote-controlled devices to bring crab cages to the surface, reducing rope usage and whale entanglements. The California Department of Fish and Wildlife shortened the crab season to mitigate the risk to whales, though fishermen using the pop-up gear can continue fishing.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>A new study reveals that ancient horses repeatedly migrated between North America and Eurasia during the late Pleistocene epoch, approximately 50,000 years ago. This migration occurred when lower sea levels created a land bridge connecting the two continents, allowing for genetic exchanges between horse populations. Among the fossils studied were Dalianensis horses from northeastern China, which showed mixed ancestry from both Eurasian and American populations. The findings were published in the journal Science, highlighting the dynamic movement of species across continents in prehistoric times.</p>

          <p>U.S. Supreme Court justices have expressed reservations regarding Donald Trump's attempt to circumvent the Constitution by restricting birthright citizenship. The cases before the court stem from Trump's executive order denying U.S. citizenship to babies born on American soil if their parents are not citizens or permanent residents. The plan contradicts the 14th Amendment, which grants citizenship to all persons born or naturalized in the United States. The court is also considering the Justice Department's argument against nationwide injunctions issued by federal judges, which they claim unfairly limit the president's authority.</p>
