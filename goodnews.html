          <p>China employs a proactive, long-term economic planning strategy through its National Development and Reform Commission, with five-year plans guiding growth and reforms. This approach involves extensive consultation with academics and industry leaders, beginning work on the next plan as soon as one is approved. In stark contrast, the United States relies on market forces and faces significant challenges in economic guidance due to political polarization. The article highlights China's consistent focus on boosting prosperity and overhauling state-owned enterprises through its structured planning process.</p>

          <p>Tensions in the South China Sea were downplayed as Manila warmly bid farewell to Beijing's envoy, Huang Xilian. Philippine President Marcos and Ambassador Huang agreed that maritime disputes should not define the broader relationship between the two nations. Both sides expressed hope for continued deepening of trade, people-to-people interactions, and cultural exchanges. The article notes that these remarks echo language used during Marcos's visit to China in January 2023, underscoring a shared desire to keep the relationship on track despite ongoing differences.</p>

          <p>British energy giant BP has seen its shares climb over 32% since April, leading to a quiet exit from the takeover spotlight. This improved sentiment is attributed to a strategic reset, a leadership shake-up, cost-cutting progress, and recent oil discoveries. Earlier in the year, BP was subject to intense speculation regarding potential acquisitions by rivals like Shell and Exxon Mobil. CEO Murray Auchincloss emphasizes the company's focus on growth, which is driving up shareholder value and attracting positive analyst upgrades, signaling a period of greater stability.</p>

          <p>Pop Mart, the Chinese company behind the viral Labubu toy, welcomes the recent drop in its secondary market resale prices, which had previously soared over 2,000% above retail. The company stated that products are for art appreciation, not solely profit, and that an unhealthy resale market alienates real customers. Pop Mart has significantly increased production to meet demand and deter scalpers, aiming for a steadier, more sustainable business model. The article suggests this pivot is crucial for the company to avoid being a 'one-hit wonder' and foster long-term customer loyalty.</p>

          <p>Dr. Mehmet Oz, leading the Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services, clarified the Trump administration's stance on Tylenol use during pregnancy, advising caution but not avoidance if medically necessary. This follows President Trump's comments and an FDA letter suggesting a possible, though unproven, link between acetaminophen and autism. Oz emphasized that doctors would likely recommend acetaminophen for high fevers due to its safety profile compared to other medications. He stressed transparency and consulting physicians, stating that while research continues, prudent use under medical guidance is key.</p>
