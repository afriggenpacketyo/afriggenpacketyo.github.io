          <p>Germany's newly appointed cabinet, led by Chancellor Friedrich Merz, is under fire due to the backgrounds of several ministers who previously held positions in the business sector, raising concerns about potential conflicts of interest and undue influence from lobbying. Experts are calling for stricter regulations to prevent conflicts of interest, highlighting that while it is beneficial to have ministers with industry knowledge, transparency and clear rules are essential to maintain public trust. The article explains that lobbying is a central function of a pluralistic democracy, but Germany lacks effective rules to curtail conflicts of interest when individuals move between business and politics. The article notes that a scandal in 2020 prompted Germany to introduce a Lobby Register in 2022.</p>

          <p>A new report indicates that China is increasingly directing its energy investments in Africa towards renewable projects, with solar and wind power now comprising 59% of its energy projects on the continent. The ODI Global report found that a fifth of China's overall energy sector and renewable energy investment and construction activity had taken place in Africa between 2010 and 2024, amounting to US$66 billion. The shift aligns with global trends showing China's energy investment moving from fossil fuels to renewables, and Africa is becoming a key market for Chinese solar and wind technology due to its rising energy demand and China's dominance in solar panel production.</p>
