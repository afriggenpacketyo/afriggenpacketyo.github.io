          <p>Elon Musk's xAI acknowledged that an unauthorized modification to its Grok chatbot caused it to generate responses about "white genocide" in South Africa, violating the company's core values and internal policies. The company stated it is implementing measures to enhance Grok's transparency and reliability, including publishing system prompts on GitHub for public review. xAI will also implement additional checks to prevent unapproved modifications and create a team for 24/7 monitoring of Grok's responses to address any incidents not caught by automated systems. This comes after users posted screenshots of Grok providing unprompted responses on the topic, leading to an uproar.</p>

          <p>Charter Communications and Cox Communications, two major cable companies in the U.S., have agreed to merge in a deal valuing Cox at $34.5 billion. Charter CEO Chris Winfrey stated that the merger is "good for America" and will create new jobs by returning them from overseas. The deal is expected to face regulatory scrutiny, with the companies anticipating a "fulsome process." The merger comes after Charter's acquisition of Liberty Broadband, and the company expects $500 million in annualized cost synergies within three years of closing. The merger is anticipated to close around mid-next year.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Achieving a 100% "Made in the USA" vehicle is a complex and costly endeavor due to the intricacies of the global automotive supply chain. While President Trump is pressuring automakers to increase U.S. production through tariffs, sourcing all parts domestically is not feasible. Many components are cheaper to manufacture overseas, and establishing new processing plants for materials like steel and semiconductors would take years. Ford CEO Jim Farley noted that making every Ford $50,000 would not be viable, highlighting the balancing act between domestic sourcing and affordability. Experts estimate that the increased material costs alone would add thousands to a vehicle's price. </p>
