          <p>Novo Nordisk announced a cut to its 2025 sales growth guidance due to increased competition from drug copycats affecting Wegovy sales, although the company still reported a better-than-expected first-quarter net profit. The Danish pharmaceutical giant's net profit reached 29.03 billion Danish kroner, surpassing analyst forecasts, but Wegovy sales fell slightly short of expectations at 17.36 billion Danish kroner. Consequently, the company adjusted its sales growth forecast for 2025 to 13-21%, down from the previously projected 16-24%. The pharmaceutical company still produces diabetes and rare disease treatments.</p>

Huang stated that it would be a significant loss for American companies to be unable to participate in this market, as sales to China would contribute to U.S. revenue, taxes, and job creation. Nvidia has been navigating the impact of U.S. export controls, which have been expanded to include its China-tailored H20 AI chips, and seeks to maintain its presence in the country, which accounted for approximately 14% of its revenue last financial year.</p>

One sex worker's information led to the arrest of a man abusing his daughter, while another reported child abuse photos, leading to the offender's trial.

He proposes that reducing the fiscal deficit would be a more straightforward fix, although it would require politically challenging congressional action. Rogoff also points out that the strength of the American economy is a key factor behind the current account deficit, making U.S. businesses attractive to investors.</p>

          <p>Newark Liberty International Airport is experiencing ongoing delays and cancellations, primarily due to an air traffic controller shortage and recent weather conditions. The union representing air traffic controllers reports that multiple members are on trauma leave following an equipment failure that caused a temporary loss of communication with pilots. U.S. Transportation Secretary Sean Duffy is expected to announce plans to overhaul the nation's air traffic control system. The FAA says Newark's airspace is safe and that they are slowing the rate of arrivals to address staffing and equipment issues.</p>

          <h2>Criminals Who Skip Sentencing Could Face Additional Jail Time</h2>
          <div class="timestamp">2025-05-06 23:35:06 EDT</div>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Criminals who refuse to attend sentencing in England and Wales could face an additional two years in prison, under a new bill to be introduced to Parliament. The Victims and Courts Bill aims to prevent offenders from "opting out" of justice, offering victims' families a moment of recognition and reparation. The legislation, initiated by the previous Conservative government, follows campaigns by families whose loved ones' killers did not attend their sentencing hearings. The new measures could apply to any case in the Crown Court, including those who are removed from court for disruptive behavior.</p>
