          <h2>NOAA to Discontinue "Billion-Dollar Disasters" Database Amid Criticism and Budget Cuts</h2>
          <div class="timestamp">2025-05-08 15:38:07 EDT</div>
        </div>
        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>The National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration (NOAA) is decommissioning its database that tracks billion-dollar weather and climate disasters, citing evolving priorities and staffing changes. This decision comes amid criticism regarding the database's methodology and concerns over its potential to mislead regarding climate change justifications. Critics like Roger Pielke Jr. argue that economists should oversee the data to address quality-control issues, while NOAA's Rick Spinrad suggests a collaboration between economists and NOAA scientists. The database has been a popular tool for government, the insurance industry, and media, so its discontinuation raises concerns about the future availability of comprehensive data on the economic costs of extreme weather events.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Here's Looking at You, a celebrated Koreatown restaurant known for its eclectic cuisine, will close on June 13, following the closure of its sister restaurant, All Day Baby. Restaurateur Lien Ta cites the death of chef Jonathan Whitener as a primary reason, as the restaurant was created in collaboration with him. Other factors included a loss of business post-pandemic and industry-wide strikes. The restaurant garnered national praise and became an L.A. fixture, but Ta ultimately decided to close, prioritizing rest and recovery after years of professional and emotional challenges.</p>

          <p>Bitcoin has climbed above $100,000 for the first time since February, driven by optimism surrounding a potential trade deal between the U.S. and the United Kingdom. The price of the cryptocurrency rose nearly 5% to $100,881.90, according to Coin Metrics, after President Donald Trump teased the announcement. Antoni Trenchev, co-founder of crypto exchange Nexo, notes that Bitcoin has reaffirmed its status as a resilient asset amid brightening prospects for U.S. trade deals. Bitcoin's safe-haven status is further supported by a pro-crypto Trump administration and strong buying activity from spot-ETF investors.</p>

          <p>Bill Gates announced that the Gates Foundation will close its doors on December 31, 2045, after 20 more years of generous aid. Gates cited the Trump administration's cuts to foreign aid and the post-pandemic setbacks as reasons to accelerate the foundation's spending. He expressed concern that these cuts could lead to millions of additional childhood deaths. Despite the challenges, Gates remains optimistic about achieving significant improvements in global health and development, driven by biomedical tools, lifesaving innovations, and A.I. He emphasized the importance of science and innovation in addressing global issues.</p>

          <p>California drivers who filed claims in a $50-million settlement related to gas price gouging are beginning to receive payments. The settlement stems from allegations that three gasoline trading firms colluded to manipulate gas prices in 2015, following an explosion at an Exxon Mobile refinery in Torrance. The payments, averaging $21.65, are being distributed via check, direct deposit, or Venmo. The settlement, which involves Vitol, SK Energy Americas, and SK Trading International, does not include an admission of fault from the trading companies.</p>

          <p>President Trump has withdrawn his nomination of Ed Martin for U.S. Attorney for Washington, D.C., following unified opposition from Senate Democrats and pushback from some Republicans. Martin, a longtime Republican activist with no prior prosecutorial experience, faced criticism for his views on the January 6th Capitol attack and his past praise for an alleged "Nazi sympathizer." As interim U.S. Attorney, Martin directed the firing of prosecutors who had worked on January 6th cases, launched an internal investigation into their conduct, and ordered the dismissal of ongoing Capitol riot probes.</p>

          <p>President Donald Trump unveiled a "major" trade deal with the United Kingdom, though many details of the agreement remain to be discussed. While leaders from both countries lauded the deal, analysts noted that it did not appear to meaningfully alter the terms of trade as they stood before Trump's tariff policies. The announcement was notable for Trump reversing course on his "extreme tariff policies", increasing expectations for further trade deals with other countries. Negotiations could hit thorny issues such as UK restrictions on US agricultural and meat exports, as well as Trump‚Äôs recently announced tariffs on foreign film shoots.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Home equity lines of credit (HELOCs) can be a cost-effective borrowing option for homeowners, but they often come with minimum draw requirements that can impact their affordability. Lenders may require an upfront draw, ongoing minimum usage during the draw period, and minimum balance requirements. These rules can affect interest costs and repayment plans, potentially leading to higher expenses if borrowers are forced to draw more funds than they need. It is important for borrowers to understand these requirements before taking out a HELOC and to compare options to ensure the terms align with their borrowing needs.</p>
