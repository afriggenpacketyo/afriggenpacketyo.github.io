          <p>Tesla's stock rebounded after a recent feud between Elon Musk and President Trump caused a significant drop in market capitalization. The stock rose following Musk's announcement that Tesla is testing driverless vehicles in Austin, Texas, without human safety supervisors. Tesla is listed as "testing" on Austin's official website for autonomous vehicle companies, signaling progress in the robotaxi market after previous delays. Tesla plans to launch a pilot program for a driverless ride-hailing service in Austin, starting with a limited number of Model Y vehicles and remote monitoring. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>The Nintendo Switch 2, priced at $449.99, is presented as a worthy successor to the original, focusing on refinement rather than reinvention. The new console boasts a bigger, stronger build, higher resolution, and a couple of new features, while maintaining the hybrid design that made the original Switch popular. The Joy-Cons now connect magnetically and can function as a mouse, which is useful in strategy games like "Civilization VII." The Switch 2 also includes enhanced chat features with an optional camera, and a 1080p screen with 4K TV support, enhancing the visual experience of older games, however battery life may be a challenge.</p>

          <p>General Motors (GM) plans to invest $4 billion in three American assembly plants, shifting production of the Chevrolet Blazer and Equinox from Mexico to the U.S. This decision follows President Trump's implementation of tariffs on imported vehicles and auto parts, which took effect in April and May. The investment will enable GM to assemble over two million vehicles annually in the U.S., and is viewed as a win for Trump's trade policies. CEO Mary Barra stated the investment demonstrates GM's commitment to American innovation and manufacturing expertise, providing customers with a broad range of vehicles.</p>

          <p>Google has offered buyouts to employees across several divisions, including its knowledge and information (K&I) unit, which houses search, ads, and commerce, as well as central engineering, marketing, research, and communications teams.

The "voluntary exit program" applies to U.S.-based employees, with some teams mandating office returns for remote workers near offices.

Taste is defined as judgment with style, combining form and function to elevate utility with elegance. AI can generate countless variations of content, but it lacks the human discretion and cultural intuition to discern what is truly meaningful or resonant. The author suggests that leaders and individuals should cultivate their taste through exposure, curation, and reflection, emphasizing that good taste also has an ethical dimension.</p>
