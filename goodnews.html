          <p>Australian Prime Minister Anthony Albanese has won a second consecutive three-year term, marking the first time in 21 years an Australian leader has achieved this milestone. Opposition leader Peter Dutton conceded defeat, acknowledging his party's underperformance during the campaign. Energy policy and inflation were central issues, with both parties addressing the rising cost of living. Albanese's Labor Party also highlighted improved relations with China, leading to the removal of trade barriers that had previously impacted Australian exporters. Both parties also focused on housing affordability for first-time buyers, but ultimately the Prime Minister has won the general approval of the Australian people.</p>

          <p>Inspired by NBA legend Kareem Abdul-Jabbar's public service announcement about atrial fibrillation, Warren Donaldson sought medical attention for his symptoms and doctors discovered an orange-sized mass inside his heart. Donaldson had been experiencing shortness of breath and heart palpitations, but dismissed them until seeing Abdul-Jabbar's message urging people to get checked. Doctors at Newark Beth Israel Medical Center found a rare pericardiac cyst embedded in his heart muscle, compressing his right ventricular outflow tract. Following open-heart surgery to remove the cyst and reconstruct his RVOT, Donaldson is now recovering and grateful for Abdul-Jabbar's PSA.</p>

          <p>Steep tariffs on imports from China are raising costs for wedding dresses and threatening the small shops that sell them, according to industry experts. Bridal shops and wedding dress designers are facing increased expenses due to the tariffs, with some brands adding a tariff surcharge. An estimated 90% of wedding dresses are made in China, making the industry particularly vulnerable to the tariffs. David's Bridal is speeding up efforts to move production out of China to avoid the tariffs, but smaller businesses are struggling to manage the higher costs without raising prices for brides.</p>

          <p>A new training program is teaching aides in care facilities to avoid using "elderspeak," which is communication that sounds like baby talk when addressing older adults. Elderspeak includes inappropriate endearments, plural pronouns, and exaggerated vocal qualities, stemming from ageist assumptions. Studies show that elderspeak can lead to resistance to care among residents with dementia. The CHAT training program has demonstrated success in reducing elderspeak and resistant behaviors, as well as potentially lowering the use of antipsychotic drugs.</p>

          <p>Researchers have found that captive-bred axolotls can survive and thrive in their native Mexican wetlands. A study tracked 18 axolotls released into restored and artificial wetlands, finding that they gained weight and avoided predators. This success is significant because it demonstrates that captive-bred animals can adapt to the wild, potentially aiding in the conservation of the critically endangered species. The axolotl, also known as the Mexican walking fish, is native to the lakes of Mexico's capital.</p>
