          <p>Donald Trump's state visit to the United Kingdom offers Prime Minister Keir Starmer a brief respite from a challenging political period. The government has recently faced intense scrutiny over a controversial appointment and questions about the Prime Minister's judgment. The pageantry of the state visit, with its royalty, military displays, and banquets, is designed to appeal to President Trump and shift media focus. While the visit highlights the "unbreakable friendship" and potential economic deals, underlying policy disagreements and the unpredictability of the President remain significant challenges for the UK government.</p>

          <p>Chinese technology firm Baidu experienced a nearly 16% surge in its Hong Kong-listed shares, driven by its expanding artificial intelligence initiatives. The company recently announced a significant AI partnership with state-owned China Merchants Group, focusing on large language models and "digital employees." To further fuel its AI ambitions and reduce reliance on foreign chips, Baidu also disclosed a $56.2 million offshore bond sale. This move is part of an "all-in AI pivot" as the company navigates a competitive market and seeks new growth avenues beyond its struggling core advertising business. (not investment advice)</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>The massive Yiwu wholesale market in China, known as the "world's supermarket," exemplifies a broader national trend of pivoting trade away from the United States. Exports from Yiwu to the U.S. have declined, while shipments to the Middle East, Southeast Asia, and Africa are growing, a shift mirrored in national trade data. This change is driven by ongoing U.S.-China trade tensions and high tariffs, which make emerging markets a more stable, albeit less profitable, alternative for Chinese suppliers. While this pivot helps mitigate risks, businesses face the challenge of needing multiple smaller customers to replace one large U.S. buyer.</p>

The announcements coincide with President Donald Trump's state visit and are part of a new "Tech Prosperity Deal" between the UK and US. Microsoft's $30 billion commitment will help build the UK's largest supercomputer, while Nvidia plans its largest-ever European deployment of advanced GPU chips.

          <p>Chinese private aerospace company Space Pioneer has successfully conducted a crucial ground trial for its large reusable rocket, the Tianlong-3. The test involved the simultaneous firing of nine Tianhuo-12 engines, generating nearly 1,000 tonnes of thrust in what the company described as a "major exam." This successful trial is a significant milestone that moves the rocket closer to its inaugural launch, which is targeted for the end of the year. Following the launch, Space Pioneer aims to begin routine commercial operations, with an ambitious goal of conducting over 30 missions annually.</p>

          <p>Federal prosecutors have arrested five individuals allegedly involved in a sophisticated drug trafficking operation that used private shipping companies to transport 22 tons of cocaine from Los Angeles to New York City. The organization, allegedly led by two men arrested last year, used a downtown L.A. jewelry store as a front. From there, they are accused of shipping cocaine to New York's Diamond District and transporting hundreds of millions of dollars in proceeds back to the West Coast. The multi-year investigation has so far led to the seizure of over $2.8 million in cash and 1,600 pounds of cocaine.</p>

          <p>Democrat Xp Lee has won a special election in Minnesota for the House seat previously held by the late Rep. Melissa Hortman, who was assassinated in June.

The election took place amid heightened concerns about political violence, following both Hortman's killing and the recent assassination of Charlie Kirk. Lee's win prevents Republicans from gaining outright control of the chamber and maintains the bipartisan legislative balance for the remainder of the session.</p>

          <p>Amazon CEO Andy Jassy is leading an initiative to reduce internal bureaucracy in an effort to make the massive company operate more like an agile startup. Speaking at a conference, Jassy described bureaucracy as "anathema" to innovation and detailed efforts to flatten the company's organizational structure. As part of this cultural reset, Amazon has increased its worker-to-manager ratio and created a dedicated email alias for employees to flag inefficient processes. This push for scrappiness comes as the company continues to cut costs and lay off employees while simultaneously investing heavily in artificial intelligence to maintain its competitive edge.</p>

          <p>Japan's exports contracted for the fourth consecutive month in August, but the decline was less severe than economists had anticipated. Shipments fell by only 0.1% year-on-year, a significant improvement from the 2.6% drop in July, largely due to a rebound in exports to other Asian countries. However, outbound shipments to the United States continued to fall sharply, particularly in the automotive sector, highlighting the persistent impact of trade frictions. The data provides a mixed view of the health of Japan's export-driven economy ahead of the Bank of Japan's upcoming interest rate decision. (not investment advice)</p>

She stated that Russia's war economy is sustained by fossil fuel revenues and that the Commission will soon propose its 19th package of sanctions. The announcement followed a call with U.S. President Donald Trump, who has linked further U.S. sanctions on Russia to Europe's actions on Russian energy and Chinese imports. The EU's current timeline aims to stop Russian gas imports by 2028 and oil by 2027, but the new proposal seeks to quicken this transition.</p>

          <p>This opinion article proposes that Hong Kong should be a contender to co-host China's planned World Artificial Intelligence Cooperation Organisation, challenging the current front-runner, Shanghai. The author suggests that while Shanghai offers robust AI infrastructure, Hong Kong's unique "one country, two systems" framework and independent judiciary could help reassure international partners and mitigate Western skepticism. Establishing the center in Hong Kong could be a strategic move by Beijing to navigate global tech tensions and position the city as a key player in shaping international AI standards and governance.</p>

          <p>A man from Norfolk, England, has successfully brought his attacker to justice 20 years after the crime occurred. Dan Cooper, who waived his anonymity, was inspired to re-report the 2004 sexual assault after serving on a jury in 2018. His attacker was recently sentenced to eight years in prison after being convicted on multiple counts of sexual assault. Cooper described how the trauma led to a diagnosis of complex PTSD and regular thoughts of suicide, but he felt compelled to pursue the case. He now shares his story on social media to help other survivors.</p>

The short-term continuing resolution also includes an additional $30 million for lawmaker security in the wake of Charlie Kirk's assassination.

The company, which was reacquired by its co-founder in 2020, is set to begin trading on the New York Stock Exchange under the ticker "STUB." The IPO comes amid a recent rebound in the market for public listings after a prolonged period of high inflation and rising interest rates. (not investment advice)</p>
