          <h2>Irish Museum Exhibit Reveals 1,300-Year-Old Monk Doodles with Everyday Complaints</h2>

          <p>A new exhibit at the National Museum of Ireland is showcasing 1,300-year-old manuscripts from the Abbey Library of St. Gall, featuring surprising doodles and notes from medieval monks. Scribed in Old Irish in the margins of a Latin grammar book, the annotations reveal the monks' very human frustrations, including complaints about hangovers, cold weather, and poor-quality ink. These rare scribbles offer a humorous and personal glimpse into the daily lives and personalities of monastic individuals in the 9th century, contrasting with the typically solemn image of their existence.</p>

          <p>Pharmaceutical giant AstraZeneca has announced a plan to invest $50 billion in its U.S. manufacturing and research and development capabilities by 2030. This move follows similar commitments from other major pharma companies as they navigate the Trump administration's threats of steep tariffs on the industry. A cornerstone of the investment will be a new facility in Virginia to produce its weight management portfolio, including a new oral GLP-1 obesity pill. The company aims to generate half of its projected $80 billion in annual revenue from the U.S. market. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>The UK government is set to enact a new sanctions regime targeting people-smuggling networks involved in facilitating illegal Channel crossings. The measures, which include asset freezes and travel bans, will be aimed at gang leaders, companies supplying small boats, and financial middlemen. Foreign Secretary David Lammy described it as the first sanctions regime against irregular migration in the world. The move is part of Prime Minister Keir Starmer's pledge to disrupt the business model of these criminal gangs amid a significant increase in small boat arrivals.</p>

          <p>A massive deposit of rare earth elements, the largest in Europe, has been identified beneath the village of Ulefoss in southern Norway. These metals are critical for modern technologies, and the discovery could reduce the EU's heavy reliance on China for its supply. The mining company, Rare Earths Norway (REN), plans to create an "invisible mine" by tunneling diagonally from outside the town to extract the minerals without displacing the community. If successful, the project, slated for full operation by 2030, could be a game-changer for Europe's strategic autonomy.</p>

          <p>The new Kimi K2 artificial intelligence model, developed by the Alibaba-backed Chinese startup Moonshot AI, has seen a surge in popularity since its launch. The large language model (LLM) is notable for its mixture-of-experts (MOE) architecture, which experts praise as a more cost-efficient approach to AI development compared to the massive computational resources used by firms like OpenAI. By dividing tasks among specialized sub-networks, the model achieves powerful performance at a fraction of the typical training cost, highlighting a potential strategic shift in the AI industry.</p>

          <p>The race to develop and commercialize solid-state batteries for electric vehicles is gaining new momentum, with major automakers like Volkswagen, Toyota, and Nissan targeting mass production before 2030. These batteries promise higher energy density, improved safety, and faster charging compared to current lithium-ion technology, and are often called the "holy grail" for EVs. While some companies are focusing on semi-solid-state batteries as a practical bridge technology, the industry faces challenges with production costs and durability. Recent breakthroughs in conventional battery technology from firms like CATL are also increasing the competitive pressure.</p>

Cabinet Office minister Nick Thomas-Symonds stated the government aims to restore trust after thousands were infected with HIV or hepatitis from contaminated NHS blood products. Key changes include allowing compensation to be passed to a victim's estate if they die before their claim is settled.
