          <p>Japan celebrated a poignant return to global sporting events by securing its first medal at the World Athletics Championships in Tokyo, with Hayato Katsuki earning a bronze in the 35km race walk. Athletes battled grueling conditions, as temperatures reached 30C with over 90% humidity, causing several competitors, including another Japanese athlete, to collapse after finishing. This championship provides a crucial opportunity for Japan to engage with the public, contrasting with the spectator-less 2020 Olympics. Organizers have proactively adjusted race start times for events like marathons due to an anticipated heatwave, prioritizing athlete safety. The strong local support and sold-out sessions underscore the nation's enthusiasm for the competition.</p>

Instructors note a significant shift in perceptions, with routines expanding beyond traditional country music to include various genres. This renewed popularity is also driven by its appeal as a low-impact exercise and a vibrant community builder, offering an accessible way to make friends and stay active.</p>

          <p>Pre-order sales for Apple’s new iPhone 17 series have shattered previous records in China, demonstrating robust demand despite reported delays for the iPhone Air model. On JD.com, one of China's largest online retailers, first-minute sales surpassed the entire first-day volume of last year’s iPhone 16 series, with the standard 256GB iPhone 17 being the most popular. Overwhelming demand led to difficulties accessing Apple's website and rapid booking of in-store pickup slots in major cities. Customers in some regions now face waiting periods extending to mid-October, highlighting the immense consumer interest in the new devices.</p>

          <p>Bavaria's state minister, Hubert Aiwanger, affirmed the German state's openness to Chinese investment, despite ongoing economic tensions between the European Union and China. Aiwanger emphasized that while Europe needs to build economic resilience, protectionism is not the solution, advocating for continued close relations with major economies like China, the USA, and Japan. His comments reflect a distinct stance from some EU-level concerns regarding China's economic influence. This position highlights Bavaria's historical and ongoing economic ties with China, which date back decades, and its desire to maintain a welcoming environment for Chinese companies.</p>

Companies like Xpeng and GAC are setting ambitious sales targets and planning to introduce more affordable EVs, aiming to capitalize on what they perceive as a lag in EV development by traditional European automakers. Despite facing potential EU tariffs, Chinese brands are differentiating themselves with advanced tech features and competitive pricing. European legacy brands are responding with new EV releases and tech, but analysts suggest they need to accelerate their innovation and production scale to keep pace with the rapidly advancing Chinese competition.</p>

          <p>Michele Kang, owner of London City Lionesses, is making a significant impact on women's football through her hands-on, multi-club ownership model, which also includes Washington Spirit and Lyon. Kang's philosophy focuses on setting a vision and creating an environment for success, investing heavily in infrastructure, staffing, and female-specific research. She views the multi-club approach as a necessity for scaling resources and investment in women's football, which lacks the commercial revenue of the men's game. Despite some criticism of multi-club ownership, Kang aims to build a compelling product and increase fan engagement, pushing for the Lionesses to become a top-tier WSL team.</p>

          <p>A powerful 7.4 magnitude earthquake struck early Saturday near the east coast of Russia’s Kamchatka region. The U.S. Geological Survey reported the quake's epicenter 111.7 kilometers east of Petropavlovsk-Kamchatsky, at a depth of 39 kilometers. Crucially, there were no immediate reports of injuries or significant damages. The Pacific Tsunami Warning System initially issued a threat of a possible tsunami but quickly revised it to no tsunami threat or warning, alleviating immediate fears. This event follows a series of five powerful quakes that hit the same peninsula in July 2025.</p>

          <p>As astronomical autumn begins on September 22nd, the darkening nights will offer several celestial spectacles for stargazers. Highlights include Saturn reaching 'opposition' on September 21st, making it appear at its brightest and largest, visible to the naked eye as a non-twinkling star in Pisces, though a telescope is needed to see its rings. Additionally, the Orionid meteor shower, originating from Halley's Comet, will be active from October 2nd to November 7th, peaking around October 22nd. Ideal viewing conditions are expected for the Orionids due to the new moon, promising fast-moving meteors with long streaks of light.</p>

          <p>Three elderly Austrian nuns, aged 82 to 88, have defiantly returned to their former Kloster Goldenstein convent in the Alps after being placed in a Catholic care home against their will. Sisters Bernadette, Regina, and Rita, the last remaining nuns, regained access with the help of former students and a locksmith. Church authorities, who dissolved their community and deemed the convent rooms unusable for proper care, have expressed displeasure, calling their return 'completely incomprehensible.' Despite initial lack of electricity and water, supporters are assisting the nuns, who are determined to live out their lives in their beloved home.</p>
