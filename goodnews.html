          <p>Xpeng, a Chinese electric vehicle maker, experienced a significant surge in its Hong Kong shares after reporting upbeat earnings and a stronger-than-expected revenue forecast for the second quarter. The company's first-quarter revenue more than doubled, driven by robust sales, which helped narrow its net loss and improve its gross margin. Xpeng is aiming to begin mass production of vehicles equipped with Level 3 autonomous driving features by the end of the year. The optimistic forecast boosted investor sentiment, leading to a rally in both Hong Kong and U.S.-listed shares. (not investment advice)</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>The Japanese government has initiated a new gasoline subsidy aimed at reducing prices by 10 yen per liter to alleviate cost-of-living pressures on consumers. This revamped scheme replaces a previous one by providing a fixed sum regardless of price fluctuations, with the goal of reducing wholesale gasoline prices by a targeted amount each week. The subsidy program, allocated around 1 trillion yen, could potentially last until the end of March 2026, with the timing coinciding with the upcoming House of Councillors election.</p>

          <p>Japanese Finance Minister Katsunobu Kato and U.S. Treasury Secretary Scott Bessent discussed currency issues related to ongoing bilateral tariff negotiations, agreeing that the current dollar-yen exchange rate mirrors economic fundamentals. This acknowledgement suggests that the yen's recent weakness against the dollar is no longer a point of contention in trade talks. Kato expressed concerns about the impact of the Trump administration's tariffs on the global economy, while Japan considers potentially lowering U.S. tariff rates to reach a quick deal.</p>

          <p>Sea temperatures around the UK and Ireland have surged, with some areas reaching 4C warmer than normal, due to an exceptionally warm spring and climate change. This marine heatwave, which started in winter and intensified in March, could impact marine life, potentially disrupting breeding patterns and causing jellyfish blooms. Scientists are surprised by the heatwave's persistence, as marine heatwaves typically last around two weeks. The higher sea temperatures could also push up land temperatures, as sea breezes carry the heat off the ocean.</p>
