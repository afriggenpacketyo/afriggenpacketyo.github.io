          <p>Singapore's economy expanded by 2.9% year-on-year in the third quarter, surpassing economists' expectations, though this represented a moderation from the previous quarter's growth. The Ministry of Trade and Industry indicated that manufacturing, particularly in biomedical and general sectors, and construction were the main drags on overall growth. Despite the robust third-quarter performance, the Monetary Authority of Singapore has issued a warning that GDP growth is projected to slow in 2026 as trade-related sectors normalize. However, global investment in artificial intelligence, along with ongoing infrastructure spending and favorable financial conditions, is expected to provide support to Singapore's manufacturing and financial services sectors.

This 403-foot vehicle, the largest and most powerful ever built, is central to Elon Musk's ambitions for sending humans to Mars and NASA's plans for lunar landings. The flight saw the booster execute a controlled entry into the Gulf of Mexico as planned, with the spacecraft proceeding to skim space before its descent towards the Indian Ocean. This test incorporated enhanced maneuvering for the spacecraft, building upon the successes of prior flights and marking continued progress in the development of this reusable space transport system.</p>

The "Trump Declaration for Enduring Peace and Prosperity" outlined commitments for diplomatic resolution and peace, though its text appeared largely symbolic. Notably absent was Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu, citing a Jewish holiday. Trump, who earlier praised Netanyahu in the Knesset, declared a "new dawn in the Middle East" and asserted the war was over, even as complexities regarding lasting peace and Gaza's future governance remain.</p>

          <p>Missouri has implemented a new hands-free driving law, imposing fines for cellphone use while driving, a practice state trooper Brock Teague describes as as dangerous as drunk driving. The legislation was championed by Adrienne Siddens, whose husband, Randall, was killed by a distracted driver in 2019. The state's Department of Transportation is now using telematics data from smartphones and vehicles to identify distracted driving hot spots, revealing that such incidents are likely three times more common than previously reported. This data will help target educational programs and law enforcement visibility in high-risk areas.</p>

          <p>Governor Gavin Newsom has signed Assembly Bill 247, legislation that will significantly increase the wages for California's incarcerated firefighters, raising them from approximately $1 an hour to the federal minimum wage of $7.25 per hour. These fire crews are a vital component of the state's wildfire suppression efforts, performing dangerous tasks like clearing brush and digging containment lines. The new law, which takes effect immediately and is supported by a $10 million budget allocation, addresses a long-standing social justice concern regarding their extremely low pay. This measure builds upon previous legislation from 2020 that allows nonviolent incarcerated individuals who worked on fire crews to have their records expunged, recognizing their critical contributions.</p>

          <p>The Gaza peace plan, brokered by President Trump, advanced significantly with Hamas releasing all 20 living Israeli hostages in exchange for hundreds of Palestinian prisoners and increased aid to Gaza. These steps follow a ceasefire and partial Israeli troop pullback, but the situation remains fragile. Future negotiations face major hurdles, including Israel's demand for Hamas's disarmament and Palestinian demands for statehood, both currently rejected by the opposing sides. Reconstruction efforts, estimated at $53 billion, and the formation of a new Palestinian security force are also critical next phases.</p>

        </div>
        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Governor Gavin Newsom signed Assembly Bill 749, establishing a commission to study inequalities in youth sports access based on factors including race, sex, sexual orientation, and gender identity. This legislation has drawn criticism from Republicans, who interpret the inclusion of "gender identity" as an indirect measure to support transgender athletes, a stance Newsom has previously acknowledged as politically challenging for Democrats. The bill's author, Assemblymember Tina S. McKinnor, emphasized its focus on racial disparities and systemic barriers to sports participation. The commission will assess the need for a new state board or department to improve access.</p>

          <p>Despite a ceasefire in Gaza and a hostage-prisoner exchange, student-led protests on California university campuses show no signs of abating. Pro-Palestinian activists view the ceasefire as a partial victory but vow to continue demanding university divestment from weapons companies and other policy changes. UCLA professor David N. Myers suggests student activism has influenced American public opinion on Palestinians. Conversely, Jewish students express relief over the hostage releases, hoping for lasting peace, while acknowledging the ongoing campus divisions and increased reports of antisemitic and anti-Muslim incidents.</p>

Drawing from her background in rancheras and drag scenes, San Cha synthesizes diverse influences to create a visually striking and thought-provoking piece. The opera subverts classic telenovela structures by infusing them with queer themes and religious aspects, exploring sin and guilt through a unique artistic vision.</p>

          <p>A newlywed couple, who solicited wedding donations specifically for a house down payment, is now debating the ethics of using the $8,000 received to pay off high-interest credit card and personal loan debt instead. While some Reddit users argue that money is fungible and debt repayment accelerates homeownership goals, others caution against appearing to have used false pretenses. The couple, having already paid off $8,000 of the husband's debt, recognizes that eliminating the wife's $9,000 debt would free up cash and reduce financial strain. The consensus leans towards financial prudence, with advice to keep thank-you notes vague. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>California Governor Gavin Newsom signed Senate Bill 495, significantly easing the process for fire victims to claim personal property losses. The new law allows policyholders whose residences were totally destroyed to receive 60% of their personal property coverage, up to $350,000, without providing an itemized list. It also extends the claim filing period to at least 100 days. This legislation addresses previous inefficiencies that delayed financial support for survivors. Newsom also signed SB 429, which funds the nation's first public wildfire catastrophe model, aiming to create a transparent benchmark for insurance rate-setting in a climate-changed environment.</p>
