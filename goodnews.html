          <p>Digital physical therapy startup Hinge Health reported a 50% revenue increase in the first quarter, reaching $123.8 million, and notched its first profitable quarter with a net income of $17.1 million. The company filed to go public in March but has not yet shared a price range, signaling to investors that the company is planning to forge ahead. This financial update comes during a period of economic uncertainty and market volatility, which has caused other companies like Klarna and StubHub to delay their IPOs. Hinge's updated prospectus indicates its intent to proceed with its public offering despite the challenging economic climate.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>The Social Security Administration plans to make Social Security cards available digitally, a move that experts view with cautious optimism, citing potential benefits for accessibility and convenience. Richard Fiesta from the Alliance for Retired Americans notes that while this could be a positive step, it's crucial to ensure the system is secure and user-friendly, particularly for older or disabled individuals who may not be tech-savvy. Eva Velasquez, CEO of the Identity Theft Resource Center, highlights the need for robust security measures to protect both Social Security numbers and the devices used to access them, given the high likelihood of prior data breaches.</p>

          <div class="timestamp">2025-05-05 17:51:48 EDT</div>
        </div>
        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Medicare in 2025 will not cover key healthcare costs such as dental care, vision care, hearing aids, overseas medical care, and long-term custodial care, leaving retirees vulnerable to significant out-of-pocket expenses. The average cost of a private room in a nursing home exceeds $120,000 per year, making long-term care a particularly critical gap. Seniors are encouraged to consider supplemental insurance like Medigap to cover expenses Medicare doesn't fully cover, including copayments, coinsurance, and deductibles. Purchasing Medigap coverage early, during the open enrollment window, is advisable to avoid potential denial or higher costs based on health status.</p>

          <p>President Donald Trump signed an executive order to incentivize prescription drug manufacturing in the U.S., streamlining the FDA approval process for domestic pharmaceutical production sites. The order aims to reduce reliance on foreign drug suppliers, citing national security concerns and directs the FDA to increase inspection fees for foreign plants and improve enforcement of active-ingredient source reporting. The move precedes planned tariffs on imported pharmaceuticals, which have already prompted some drugmakers to increase domestic manufacturing investments. Some pharmaceutical companies are starting to push back on Trump's plans.</p>

          <p>Palantir increased its revenue guidance as the artificial intelligence software company experienced a surge in commercial and government revenue. Commercial revenues grew 71% year-over-year to $255 million, while government segment sales jumped 45% to $373 million. CEO Alex Karp attributed the company's growth to a "tectonic shift in the adoption" of its software, particularly in the U.S. defense sector. Palantir is forecasting U.S. commercial revenues to exceed $1.178 billion this year, driven by strong demand for large language models and supporting software.</p>
