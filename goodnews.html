          <p>William Goodge, a British ultra-endurance athlete, asserts he has broken the record for the fastest run across Australia, completing the 3,800km journey in 35 days. The run, from Cottesloe Beach in Perth to Bondi Beach, aimed to raise money for cancer charities, inspired by his mother's death from cancer. Along the way, Goodge faced dust storms, injuries, and hallucinations, running approximately 100km daily, but some have questioned the accuracy of his tracking data. He dedicated the run to his mother, stating her battle with cancer motivated him to overcome his own suffering during the grueling challenge.</p>

          <p>Japan's animation industry is increasingly embracing AI due to permissive copyright laws and a labor shortage, despite concerns from artists about copyright infringement and job security. The first AI-powered anime, "Twins Hinahima," has already been launched, and studios are using AI to assist with coloring, background generation, and turning photos into anime, significantly reducing production time. While some artists worry about job losses, others view AI as a supporting tool that can enhance efficiency and creativity. The cultural acceptance of technology in Japan, rooted in Shinto beliefs, may also contribute to the industry's willingness to integrate AI.</p>

          <p>Israel has acquired a trove of documents and personal effects from Syria that belonged to Eli Cohen, a renowned Israeli spy executed in Syria in 1965, in a joint operation with an allied foreign government. The collection includes documents, photographs, and handwritten letters from Cohen's time undercover, offering insights into his activities and final moments. Cohen's intelligence gathering in Syria during the early 1960s significantly aided Israel's victory in the Six-Day War, particularly in seizing the Golan Heights. The recovery of these items is seen as a unifying moment in Israel, underscoring the country's commitment to honoring its heroes.</p>

          <p>The Japanese government is initiating offshore "blue carbon" research to capture carbon dioxide using cultivated sea plants and store it in the deep sea, aiming to accelerate decarbonization efforts. This initiative seeks to leverage the high CO2 solubility in water and the absorption capabilities of marine vegetation like mangroves and kelp. The Environment Ministry will collaborate with various organizations to study seaweed behavior at significant depths and assess the environmental impact of these projects, with the goal of capturing 1 million tons of CO2 by fiscal 2035.</p>
