          <h2>Scientists Deploy Sharks with Sensors to Improve Hurricane Forecasting</h2>
          <div class="timestamp">2025-07-25 23:20:21 EDT</div>
        </div>
        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Researchers are exploring an innovative method for hurricane forecasting by attaching sensors to sharks in the Atlantic Ocean. Led by the University of Delaware, the project aims to gather crucial data on ocean temperature and conductivity, which are key factors in hurricane formation and intensity. This approach could provide more efficient and continuous data collection than current methods like satellites or robotic gliders. The research turns these apex predators into living ocean sensors, potentially revolutionizing how scientists predict the behavior of powerful storms.</p>

          <p>The Los Angeles Dodgers secured a 5-2 win against the Boston Red Sox, showcasing a resurgent offense that has struggled for much of July. Teoscar Hernández played a crucial role, drawing a bases-loaded walk and later hitting a two-run homer to provide insurance runs. Andy Pages also contributed significantly with a double, a sacrifice fly, and a single, continuing his recent upward trend at the plate. The victory, achieved without shortstop Mookie Betts, marks the team's third win in four games and provides a positive sign ahead of the upcoming trade deadline.</p>

          <p>China's quantitative hedge funds are successfully recruiting top-tier scientific and engineering talent from the United States, partly due to stricter US visa policies and university funding cuts. Firms like Shanghai-based Mingshi are offering competitive salaries to attract PhD candidates who face uncertainty in the US academic system. This influx of brainpower is fueling the expansion of China's rapidly growing quant sector, which is now the world's second-largest yuan-denominated market. The trend highlights a strategic shift in global talent acquisition within the high-tech finance industry. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>Inter Miami's owner, Jorge Mas, has publicly criticized Major League Soccer for its decision to suspend star player Lionel Messi and teammate Jordi Alba for one game. The suspension was enforced because both players, who were voted into the All-Star game, opted not to participate, citing the need for rest. Mas described the league's mandatory participation rule and subsequent punishment as "draconian" and unfair to the players. The incident has prompted MLS Commissioner Don Garber to state that the league will reevaluate the long-standing policy in consultation with players.</p>

          <p>A salon owner from Leicester is facing a critical hearing in her ongoing trademark dispute with the global cosmetics giant L'Oréal. Rebecca Dowdeswell, owner of the 'nkd' salon, had her trademark renewal opposed by L'Oréal, which claims it would cause consumer confusion with its 'Naked' line of beauty products. Dowdeswell, who has spent over £30,000 on legal fees, argues there has been no evidence of confusion in her 15 years of business. After a delay, a hearing with the UK's Intellectual Property Office has been set, with Dowdeswell ready to continue her fight.</p>

          <p>The United Kingdom's warmest and sunniest spring on record has resulted in a significant increase in the populations of certain insects, including ladybirds, butterflies, and wasps. The warm, dry conditions led to a boom in aphids, a key food source, which in turn has supported a surge in their predators like ladybirds. Butterfly Conservation also reported an "extraordinary" year for early sightings of numerous species, a stark contrast to the record low numbers seen in 2024. However, experts caution that the lack of rain could negatively impact insect numbers next year.</p>

          <p>An Illinois judge has dismissed a lawsuit filed by the Trump administration that challenged Chicago's sanctuary city policies. The lawsuit argued that the city's ordinance limiting cooperation between local police and federal immigration agents unlawfully thwarts federal enforcement efforts. In her ruling, Judge Lindsay Jenkins granted the city's motion to dismiss the case. Chicago's mayor and Illinois' governor both praised the decision, stating that it affirms the legality of the city's "welcoming city ordinance" and supports public safety by allowing local police to focus on community needs.</p>

          <p>A new exhibit at the New York Historical Society examines the history and impact of the Hollywood blacklist, which began in 1947 with the House Un-American Activities Committee's investigation into alleged Communist influence in the film industry. The exhibit tells the story of the "Hollywood Ten," a group of writers and directors who were imprisoned and blacklisted for refusing to answer the committee's questions. It explores how the anti-Communist fervor ruined careers, compelled individuals to name names, and raised enduring questions about free speech and political affiliation.</p>

The piece notes his fierce competitiveness and ownership of numerous high-profile courses, which serve as a backdrop for both personal passion and transactional diplomacy.

          <p>In response to a devastating disease that wiped out about 50% of the state's bighorn sheep, wildlife biologists in Texas are conducting a critical rescue and relocation mission. The disease spread from non-native animals brought into the region, threatening the native sheep population. Last fall, biologists captured dozens of healthy sheep from the last disease-free herd and airlifted them over 200 miles to an isolated, safe mountain range. A recent check confirmed the relocated herd is not only surviving but growing, offering hope for the species' recovery.</p>

          <p>A feature article explores whether strict adherence to popular health guidelines, such as drinking eight glasses of water or walking 10,000 steps a day, is truly necessary. While experts confirm the vital importance of getting seven to nine hours of sleep, there is more flexibility with other targets. A kidney specialist suggests drinking when thirsty is sufficient for most people, while a nutritionist notes hydration targets can help address symptoms like fatigue. The consensus is that while these benchmarks are useful guides, it is more important to incorporate a healthy outlook into daily life.</p>

The impact of the menstrual cycle on performance and injury risk is also a major area of investigation, moving beyond the outdated approach of treating female athletes as "mini-men." This new focus on female-specific science is improving performance, helping to prevent injuries, and fostering a more inclusive environment.</p>

          <p>Twenty-five years after 'Big Brother' first aired, some psychologists and social experts are arguing that reality television may have a more positive societal impact than previously thought. While often criticized, the genre has historically featured more demographic diversity than other media, potentially fostering greater social understanding and empathy. By showcasing raw emotions and difficult conversations on topics like mental health and disability, these shows can destigmatize issues and spark important national discussions. Some studies even link shows to tangible positive social outcomes, like a reduction in teen birth rates.</p>
