          <p>In his new book, "The Royal Insider," Princess Diana's former butler, Paul Burrell, describes Buckingham Palace as a "gin palace" due to the extensive alcohol consumption by both staff and royals. The article details the preferred drinks of various Royal Family members, from the Queen Mother's daily gin and Dubonnet to Princess Margaret's fondness for whiskey. It also notes that while many royals enjoy a regular tipple, Prince William has a notably low alcohol tolerance, earning him the nickname 'One Pint Willy.' The book provides an inside look at the social customs and personal preferences within the palace walls over the years.</p>

Having calmed controversies inherited from his predecessors, his strategy now appears to be centered on delivering improvements in public services to regain public trust. Despite challenges like long NHS waits and budget pressures, the SNP currently holds a lead in opinion polls over a slumping Labour Party. A key debate at the conference will be the strategy for achieving Scottish independence, with Swinney advocating that winning a majority at the next Holyrood election is the only viable path to another referendum.</p>

          <p>Northern Ireland faces a significant challenge in their upcoming World Cup qualifier against Germany, as they will be without their talismanic player, Conor Bradley. The Liverpool defender, who was praised as the best player on the pitch in their recent 2-0 victory over Slovakia, received a yellow card that triggers a suspension. Bradley has been a pivotal figure for the team, known for his energetic, front-foot style of play both in attack and defense. His absence creates a considerable void for manager Michael O'Neill to fill as the team prepares to face the group favorites at Windsor Park.</p>

          <div class="timestamp">2025-10-11 03:00:17 EDT</div>
        </div>
        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>FIFA is actively redrafting its regulations concerning domestic league games being staged in foreign countries and is seeking legal advice on whether a complete ban is feasible. The move comes as leagues like Spain's La Liga and Italy's Serie A have scheduled matches in the United States and Australia, a practice that has caused controversy. The current rules, written in 2014, require approval from multiple confederations and associations but do not give FIFA direct power to block such games. FIFA President Gianni Infantino has warned of the "big risk" of allowing a global free-for-all, signaling the governing body's desire for more robust control over the matter.</p>

          <p>Chinese companies are increasing their investment in Africa's pharmaceutical sector as part of the "Health Silk Road" initiative, aiming to address the continent's heavy reliance on imported medicines. A new project will see the production of Chinese-made insulin in Nigeria, while a major facility in the Ivory Coast is set to manufacture antimalarial and antibacterial drugs. Africa currently imports approximately 70 percent of its essential medicines despite bearing a quarter of the world's disease burden. These projects are designed to fill critical manufacturing gaps and meet the high demand for generic medications and treatments for chronic illnesses across the continent.</p>

          <p>Manchester City's Erling Haaland is the clear frontrunner for the Premier League's Golden Boot award after scoring nine goals in his first seven games of the season. His impressive start, which notably includes no penalty kicks, puts him three goals ahead of his nearest competitors. Statistical analysis shows that Haaland is not only scoring frequently but is also receiving a significantly higher number and quality of chances compared to any other player in the league. This combination of prolific finishing and superior opportunities, coupled with a slower start from his usual rivals, positions him as the overwhelming favorite to win the award.</p>

          <p>In his first public interview since being released from an Egyptian prison, British-Egyptian activist Alaa Abdel Fattah described the process of "learning how to get back into life." After more than a decade behind bars, he is focusing on reconnecting with his family and enjoying simple freedoms, which he calls a "sensory overwhelm." Abdel Fattah, who was Egypt's most prominent political prisoner, recounted the despair of his incarceration, including a near-fatal hunger strike. Now in recovery, he hopes to travel to the UK soon but remains committed to fighting for a better world, though he is unsure what form his future activism will take.</p>
