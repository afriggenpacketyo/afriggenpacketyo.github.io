          <p>Tesla stock experienced a rebound, climbing over 3% following a significant drop triggered by a public dispute between CEO Elon Musk and President Donald Trump. Analysts suggest that the investor base of Tesla remains largely unfazed by external controversies, with Wedbush Securities noting that the shares were oversold due to the news. The conflict arose after Musk criticized Trump's tax and spending bill, leading to a war of words between the two figures. Despite a Politico report suggesting a potential truce brokered by Trump, a White House official stated that Trump is not interested in a call with Musk. This article reflects the market's reaction to the high-profile disagreement and its potential impact on Tesla's valuation. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>President Trump has signed an executive order aimed at reducing national security and public safety threats posed by drones in the United States. The order establishes a task force to improve drone detection and identification and crack down on unlawful uses, such as spying and drug smuggling. This initiative is prioritized due to upcoming large-scale events like the FIFA World Cup in 2026 and the Los Angeles Olympics in 2028. The order also seeks to boost U.S. drone development and commercial use for deliveries and other purposes, while also encouraging the development of supersonic jets and electric vertical take-off and landing aircraft.</p>

          <p>Amazon is experimenting with delivery robots as part of a larger plan to automate $200 billion in logistics costs, according to a Morgan Stanley analysis. The company is reportedly testing AI-powered humanoid robots at a San Francisco "humanoid park" to deliver packages directly from Rivian electric vans to customers' doors. This move is expected to reduce delivery times and labor costs, potentially leading to $2 billion to $3 billion in annual savings by 2030. Analysts view humanoid delivery robots as a key driver of market share gains in Amazon's logistics network, projecting significant financial returns from physical AI robots in the next 3-5 years.
