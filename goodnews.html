The FAA confirmed this during a Senate Commerce Committee hearing, stating they were unaware of the outage until after a deadly collision between an Army Black Hawk helicopter and a commercial jet in January. The FAA is insisting on the line being fixed before resuming operations out of the Pentagon. The outage is due to the construction of a new tower at the Pentagon.</p>

He declared the United States was done "giving you lectures on how to live," urging the people of the region to chart "your own destinies in your own way." While some praised his remarks as a rejection of American overreach, others expressed concern about the potential consequences of reduced U.S. pressure on human rights violations.
