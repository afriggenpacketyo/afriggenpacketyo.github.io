          <p>Eight people were dramatically rescued from a 20-foot boat that ran low on fuel and began taking on water in rough seas off Miami-Dade County. The U.S. Coast Guard and Miami-Dade Fire Rescue deployed a fireboat approximately 10 miles offshore, successfully bringing all passengers to safety with no reported injuries. This incident serves as a crucial reminder for boaters to always check weather and sea conditions, file a float plan, and ensure they have a VHF radio tuned to channel 16 for emergencies, as recreational boating incidents resulted in 564 deaths in 2023.</p>

This mission includes crew provisions, significant science gear, and an innovative add-on thruster kit designed to help maintain the orbiting lab's altitude, supplementing current Russian re-boost operations. Among the cargo are over 1,500 tortillas, preferred for their minimal crumbs in microgravity. This launch underscores the ongoing importance of the ISS, which will mark 25 years of continuous human presence in November, facilitating over 4,000 scientific experiments.</p>

The estimated cash value for the upcoming drawing is $338.6 million. Although the top prize was not claimed, tickets sold in Maine, Massachusetts, and South Dakota matched five white balls, with the South Dakota winner doubling their $1 million prize to $2 million using the Power Play option. This marks the 36th consecutive drawing without a jackpot winner, fueling anticipation for the next round. (not investment advice)</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>The article posits that US allies are largely resisting China's trade "charm offensive" due to an unwavering prioritization of foundational security and deeply rooted historical and strategic ties with Washington. Despite substantial economic engagement, such as the US$1 trillion EU-China trade, these nations instinctively safeguard their intelligence-sharing pacts and defense commitments with the United States. This resistance reflects a clear preference for security integration and cultural allegiance over fleeting economic opportunism. The analysis concludes that this unyielding commitment to Washington's strategic architecture prevents China from achieving meaningful political alignment, highlighting an unbridgeable gap between Beijing's global ambitions and current geopolitical realities.</p>

          <p>Rhode Island has made history by becoming the first US state to legally mandate workplace accommodations for menopause symptoms, such as temperature control, flexible breaks, and private spaces for symptom management. The article underscores the historical lack of recognition for menopause in professional settings and the profound validation this new law offers women who have silently managed their symptoms. The author, a professor, emphasizes that inclusive policy design, involving those directly affected, is crucial for creating effective solutions. This progressive approach contrasts sharply with policies developed without stakeholder input, which often lead to chaos and failure.</p>
