          <p>Miami-Dade County Public Schools, the third-largest district in the U.S., is integrating AI chatbots into its curriculum, reversing an earlier ban driven by concerns about cheating and misinformation. The district has trained over 1,000 educators on AI tools and is deploying Google chatbots for more than 105,000 high schoolers. This shift aims to equip students with critical thinking skills to assess AI tools responsibly, reflecting a broader national trend encouraged by President Trump and Silicon Valley leaders. While some experts caution against over-reliance on chatbots, Miami school leaders emphasize using AI ethically and with proper guardrails to enhance learning and prepare students for future careers. </p>

          <p>Annual energy bills in the UK are predicted to fall by ¬£129 in July, marking the first decrease in Ofgem's price cap in a year, according to analysts at Cornwall Insight. This nearly 7% drop will reduce the typical annual bill to ¬£1,720 for a dual-fuel customer paying by direct debit. While this provides some relief, energy prices remain significantly higher than at the start of the decade, raising concerns about affordability for many households. Experts emphasize the need for government action to upgrade homes and reduce energy bills sustainably, with millions of people still struggling with energy debt. </p>

          <p>The United Kingdom and the European Union have finalized a significant agreement focusing on fishing rights and defense cooperation, marking a new phase in their relationship post-Brexit. British Cabinet Office minister Nick Thomas-Symonds announced the deal after a summit in London, highlighting its potential benefits for jobs, borders, and the economy. While the specifics include extending European fishing boats' access to UK waters until 2038 and easing trade barriers on food products, some critics view the agreement as a surrender of British sovereignty. The agreement also aims to strengthen security ties and facilitate youth mobility, reflecting a renewed urgency for cooperation amid global uncertainties. </p>

This directive follows previous guidelines and circulars aimed at increasing EV adoption within the public sector and reducing costs, reflecting Beijing's commitment to promoting EVs and curbing emissions. </p>

It references the Renaissance era when male friendships were celebrated, contrasting this with the modern era where male friendships are often portrayed as superficial. The author suggests that society needs to reexamine its emotional rules to foster more meaningful connections.

British Prime Minister Keir Starmer is hosting the leadership of the European Union (EU) at a summit in London, and has inked agreements calling for deepening defense and trade ties. Since the UK formally left the EU in 2020 after the Brexit referendum in 2016, ties have mostly been governed under a "Trade and Cooperation Agreement" (TCA) negotiated by former conservative PM Boris Johnson and signed in December 2020. Since Brexit, common challenges facing the UK and EU include Russia's ongoing war in Ukraine and a more isolationist and tariff-ready US policy under President Donald Trump. </p>

          <p>The U.K. government is introducing new regulations to govern the rapidly growing buy now, pay later (BNPL) sector, addressing concerns about affordability and potential debt traps. These rules will require BNPL firms to conduct upfront checks to ensure consumers can repay what they borrow and simplify the process for customers to access refunds. Consumers will also have the ability to file complaints with the Financial Ombudsman, providing a mechanism for resolving disputes with financial services firms. </p>

          <p>China has introduced revised regulations to tighten government spending, targeting "white elephant" projects, lavish meals, and extravagant meeting venues to curb waste among party and government bodies. These rules emphasize diligence and thrift, urging officials to save and oppose extravagance, reflecting growing concerns over mounting debts and inefficient spending at various government levels. Observers note that these measures are among the most detailed and stringent since the austerity campaign began 12 years ago, aiming to ensure fiscal responsibility and reduce snowballing debt. </p>
