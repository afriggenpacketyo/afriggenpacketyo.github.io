        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>The Trump administration has announced a major trade agreement with Japan, establishing a 15% tariff on Japanese imports, a reduction from a previously threatened 25%. As part of the deal, President Trump stated that Japan will invest $550 billion in the U.S. and open its markets to American products, including cars and agricultural goods. Japanese Prime Minister Shigeru Ishiba confirmed the agreement, noting the auto tariff reduction specifically. This development is part of a broader push by the administration to finalize numerous trade deals, with similar agreements recently announced for Indonesia and the Philippines.</p>

          <p>The International Court of Justice is set to deliver a historic advisory opinion on the legal obligations of countries regarding climate change. This decision, prompted by a UN General Assembly request lobbied by vulnerable island nations like Vanuatu, will clarify what nations must do under international law to protect the environment from greenhouse gas emissions. While the opinion is non-binding, it is expected to establish a significant legal benchmark and could serve as a foundation for future domestic and international climate-related lawsuits. The ruling addresses both future climate action and the historical responsibilities of nations for their environmental impact.</p>

          <h2>Singapore's Inflation Rate Holds at Four-Year Low Ahead of Monetary Policy Meeting</h2>
          <div class="timestamp">2025-07-23 02:00:14 EDT</div>
        </div>
        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Singapore's headline inflation rate remained steady at a four-year low of 0.8% in June, slightly below economists' expectations and clearing the path for potential monetary policy easing. The core inflation rate, which excludes volatile transport and accommodation costs, also held firm at 0.6%. The Monetary Authority of Singapore (MAS) has noted that inflation has been lower than anticipated, projecting an average of 0.5%–1.5% for the year. This economic climate, combined with concerns over a subdued global growth outlook, may prompt the MAS to adjust its policy to support the nation's export-dependent economy.

          <p>Laurent Mekies, the new team principal for Red Bull Racing, has outlined his initial strategy as he takes over from the dismissed Christian Horner. Mekies intends to adopt a 'soft-touch' approach, focusing on listening and understanding the team's dynamics before implementing changes. His primary task is to reverse the competitive decline the team has experienced over the last 18 months, a key factor in Horner's departure. Mekies, who has extensive experience in Formula 1, aims to unlock the "magic" of the team that produced historically dominant seasons and return it to the top without its former key figures.</p>

          <p>The article profiles RELX, a London-based company that has quietly become the seventh-largest in the FTSE-100, with a market capitalization of nearly £72 billion. Evolving from its origins as a print publisher, RELX is now a global provider of information-based analytics and decision tools across risk, scientific, legal, and exhibitions sectors. The company's success is attributed to consistent growth, strong cash generation, and an early adoption of artificial intelligence, which is now embedded in many of its products. Despite its traditional classification as a publisher, RELX is considered a major UK tech company and a prime example of a "quality compounder" for investors. (not investment advice)</p>

While facing pressures from inflation and rising business costs, the niche appeal and high-margin nature of collectibles have helped the business survive.

        </div>
        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Major international luxury and retail brands are increasingly incorporating cafes and dining spaces into their flagship stores across China to enhance customer experience and attract foot traffic. Companies like LVMH, Celine, Zara, and Giorgio Armani have recently opened in-store coffee shops in major cities such as Shanghai, Nanjing, and Beijing. This strategy, known as 'retail-tainment,' leverages the high profit margins on beverages and relatively low operating costs of cafes compared to other marketing efforts. Analysts note this is a cost-efficient way for brands to market themselves and build community in a time of cautious consumer spending in the country.</p>

          <p>Shares of major Japanese automakers, including Toyota, Honda, and Nissan, experienced a significant surge following an announcement of reduced U.S. tariffs on imported vehicles. The new tariff rate will be 15%, a substantial decrease from the 25% previously in effect, providing relief to Japan's auto industry, a cornerstone of its economy. This market rally came after U.S. President Trump confirmed a new trade framework with Japan, which he claimed would also open Japanese markets to more American goods. The development is seen as providing manageable short-term conditions for the automakers. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>Scientists have discovered evidence of a 13-million-year-old confrontation between two apex predators after analyzing teeth marks on the fossilized leg bone of a 'terror bird'. These formidable, human-sized flightless birds were top predators, but the bite marks on a fossil found in Colombia match those of an extinct, five-meter-long caiman-like reptile called Purussaurus neivensis. Researchers used 3D digital scans to reconstruct what they believe was a fatal battle. The lack of healing on the bone suggests the terror bird either died in the attack or was scavenged, providing a rare glimpse into the interactions within an ancient ecosystem.</p>

          <p>England's women's national football team, the Lionesses, have advanced to the Euro 2025 final after a dramatic 2-1 extra-time victory over Italy.

In the semi-final, they were trailing Italy until a stoppage-time equalizer by Michelle Agyemang forced extra time, where Chloe Kelly scored a late winner.
