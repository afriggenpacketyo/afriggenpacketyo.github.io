        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>A study indicates that the intensifying supply chain competition between the United States and China is poised to benefit eight developing countries over the next five years. Malaysia, Vietnam, Mexico, Turkey, Thailand, Indonesia, India, and Brazil are identified as potential beneficiaries due to lower labor costs and strong trade ties with Western markets. The shift is driven by Washington's 'friendshoring' efforts and the 'China+1' strategy, prompting companies to diversify production. Chinese firms are also exploring lower-cost regions, especially within the Belt and Road Initiative, creating new global supply chain dynamics.</p>
