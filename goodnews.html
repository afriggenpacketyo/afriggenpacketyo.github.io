        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Meta's Chief Product Officer, Chris Cox, has declared that smart glasses represent the future of computing, envisioning a shift towards more natural interfaces involving voice and gestures. This statement follows the reveal of the new Meta Ray-Ban Display glasses, which feature an in-lens display controlled by a neural wristband, allowing users to see messages and record video. Unlike previous audio-only models, this new generation aims to provide visual information more fluidly. The company is betting heavily on this technology as it faces growing competition from rivals like Google, Snap, and Apple, who are also developing their own smart glasses.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Following the recent Federal Reserve interest rate cut, the monthly cost of a home equity loan has slightly decreased, making it a more affordable borrowing option for homeowners with record-high equity. A new $50,000 home equity loan with a 15-year term now costs approximately $487 per month, down a few dollars from costs at the start of the year. While the change is not dramatic, the fixed-rate nature of these loans means even small reductions can lead to significant savings over the life of the loan. The article provides a breakdown of potential monthly payments based on current average rates. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>While traveling in the United Kingdom, President Donald Trump and the first lady were forced to transfer helicopters after Marine One experienced a minor hydraulic issue. The presidential helicopter made an unscheduled landing at a local airfield as a precautionary measure before reaching its destination at Stansted Airport. According to the White House, the pilots landed safely out of an abundance of caution, and the presidential party boarded a support helicopter to continue their journey. The incident caused a brief delay during the president's second state visit to the U.K., where he is being hosted by King Charles III.</p>

          <p>Hyundai Motor has reaffirmed aggressive growth plans through 2030, with a particular focus on expanding its U.S. operations, which CEO José Muñoz called the company's "engine of growth." The automaker aims to have over 80% of its U.S. vehicles produced locally by the end of the decade, up from about 40% currently. These plans, which include a potential new pickup truck and rugged SUV, proceed despite the company lowering its annual profit margin forecast due to tariffs. The announcement came as the company addresses the recent immigration raid at a jointly-owned battery plant in Georgia.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>The Federal Trade Commission, along with several state attorneys general, has filed a lawsuit against Live Nation and its subsidiary Ticketmaster for allegedly facilitating illegal ticket scalping. The suit accuses the companies of allowing brokers to acquire large quantities of tickets and resell them at inflated prices, costing consumers billions. The complaint also alleges that Ticketmaster privately benefits from these brokers while publicly claiming to oppose them, and engages in "bait-and-switch" pricing tactics. This legal action follows a separate Department of Justice lawsuit filed in May that accused the companies of operating an illegal monopoly in the live entertainment industry.</p>

          <p>Health and Human Services Secretary Robert F. Kennedy Jr. announced actions to reform the U.S. organ transplant system, including a move to decertify the Life Alliance Organ Recovery Agency in Miami. Kennedy cited a "long record of deficiencies directly tied to patient harm" and years of documented safety failures as the reason for the decision, which he said serves as a warning to other organizations. The action is part of a broader HHS initiative to restore trust in the organ donation process, following federal investigations that revealed disturbing practices, including initiating organ procurement from patients who still showed signs of life.</p>

          <p>Southern California is experiencing its first significant rainfall in months as moisture from a former tropical storm moves through the region, prompting flood watches in several areas. While the rain is a welcome sight for a region under severe drought conditions, officials caution that it will not be enough to eliminate the threat of a dangerous wildfire season. Fire authorities typically require several inches of sustained rainfall to consider the fire risk diminished, and this storm is expected to deliver less than an inch in most populated areas. However, the precipitation may temporarily slow the start of the peak fire season.</p>

The payments, ranging from $150 to $400, are designed to provide financial relief from the higher sales taxes paid by consumers due to inflation, which in turn generated a revenue surplus for the state. Eligibility is based on income thresholds and filing status from the 2023 tax year, and qualified individuals do not need to apply to receive the payment.

          <p>Nvidia has announced a significant partnership with rival chipmaker Intel, involving a $5 billion investment and a collaboration to co-develop chips for data centers and personal computers. The deal will see the companies create AI systems combining Intel's x86 processors with Nvidia's GPUs and networking technology. Nvidia CEO Jensen Huang stated the collaboration, which follows nearly a year of discussions, will make Nvidia a major customer of Intel's CPUs. The move highlights a major shift in the semiconductor industry, driven by the AI boom that has propelled Nvidia's market value far beyond that of the historically dominant Intel.</p>

          <p>A federal judge has blocked the U.S. government from deporting a group of unaccompanied Guatemalan children, stating the administration's justification for the action "crumbled like a house of cards." The ruling came after an emergency lawsuit was filed to stop the surprise removal of over 70 minors on Labor Day weekend. Judge Timothy Kelly, a Trump appointee, found no evidence that the children's parents had requested their return, citing a Guatemalan government report that contradicted the administration's claims. The decision upholds legal protections for unaccompanied minors who arrive in the U.S. without their parents.</p>

          <p>The average rate for a 30-year mortgage has fallen to 6.13%, its lowest point in three years, offering potential relief for homebuyers. This decline occurred just before the Federal Reserve announced another quarter-point cut to its benchmark interest rate. Market analysts suggest that rates could continue to fall, with upcoming economic reports on unemployment and inflation being key factors to watch. A weaker job market or cooling inflation could encourage the Federal Reserve to implement further cuts at its next meeting in late October, which would likely push mortgage rates even lower for prospective buyers.
