        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>A new dietary trend, clear protein, is gaining significant popularity among consumers seeking lighter, juice-like alternatives to traditional creamy protein shakes. Made from whey protein isolate, this form is often lower in fat, carbohydrates, and lactose, appealing to those with digestive sensitivities. While searches for the product are surging, dietitians note that it is not inherently healthier than standard whey concentrate, as both typically offer similar protein content per serving. Experts also caution that clear protein products may contain more artificial flavorings and sweeteners to compensate for the lack of fats and sugars.</p>

          <p>In her new album, "Man’s Best Friend," pop star Sabrina Carpenter satirically details her continued struggles with unsatisfactory romantic partners despite her recent career success. The album follows her hit record "Short n’ Sweet" and maintains a sound that blends '70s pop, country, and dance music, crafted with producer Jack Antonoff. The article describes the album as a sharp and witty critique of the modern dating scene, lampooning incompetent and emotionally unavailable men. While not every track is considered as strong as her previous work, the album is praised for its clever lyricism and Carpenter's versatile vocal performance.</p>

Fly-half Helena Rowland also set a new individual record by scoring 27 points in a single World Cup game.

          <div class="timestamp">2025-08-30 15:10:00 EDT</div>
        </div>
        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Despite a lack of uniform international rules, a consensus among child development experts suggests that limiting screen time is crucial for children, especially in their early years. Pediatricians and psychologists recommend a "screen-free until age three" approach to allow for essential sensory and motor skill development. For older children, the focus shifts from total time to the quality of content and supervised use, with recommendations scaling up from 30 minutes for preschoolers to about two hours for older teenagers. Experts emphasize that excessive screen time can displace vital activities like social interaction and imaginative play, potentially leading to poorer language and social skills.</p>

          <h2>Massive Hydrothermal Vent Field Discovered in Pacific Ocean</h2>
          <div class="timestamp">2025-08-30 15:00:28 EDT</div>
        </div>
        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Researchers have discovered a colossal hydrothermal vent field in the Pacific Ocean, named the Kunlun field, which is over a hundred times larger than the famous 'Lost City' in the Atlantic. This deep-sea 'metropolis' features a system of large craters and dolomite walls, releasing hydrogen-rich fluids at temperatures cooler than typical 'black smokers.' Scientists believe this environment, which supports a diverse ecosystem of deep-sea life, could offer crucial insights into how life may have first originated on Earth. The discovery also challenges previous assumptions about where such large-scale hydrogen generation can occur on the seafloor.</p>

          <p>Jack Grealish is experiencing a career resurgence since joining Everton on a season-long loan from Manchester City, where he had limited playing time. In his first few games, he has become a key playmaker, registering multiple assists and earning man-of-the-match honors. Everton manager David Moyes praised Grealish's impact, suggesting the player is motivated to prove his capabilities after being left out of the recent England squad. Grealish's revitalized form has sparked discussion about whether he can still earn a place in England's plans for the upcoming World Cup.</p>

The win sets up a highly anticipated fourth-round match against two-time US Open champion Naomi Osaka. Gauff expressed that she felt lighter on the court and is building confidence as the tournament progresses.</p>

          <p>Former President Donald Trump was seen publicly for the first time since unfounded rumors of his death circulated widely on social media. He was photographed on a family golf trip, which helped to quell the online speculation that had caused "Trump Is Dead" to trend on X. The concerns were partly fueled by recent comments from J.D. Vance about being prepared to assume presidential duties in the event of a tragedy. The article also notes that previous concerns about Trump's health were addressed by the White House physician, who attributed bruising on his hand to frequent handshaking.</p>

        </div>
        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Health officials in New York City have declared that the Legionnaires' disease outbreak in central Harlem is over, as no new cases have been reported since August 9. The outbreak resulted in 114 cases, 90 hospitalizations, and seven deaths. The source of the Legionella bacteria was traced to cooling towers at Harlem Hospital and a nearby construction site, both of which have since been cleaned and disinfected. In response, the mayor's administration has proposed new measures to enhance the detection and prevention of future clusters, including more frequent testing of cooling towers.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>A new study suggests that stethoscopes enhanced with artificial intelligence can detect three common heart conditions—heart failure, valve disease, and abnormal rhythms—in seconds. Researchers from Imperial College London found that the device, which analyzes heartbeat sounds undetectable by the human ear and records an ECG, significantly improved detection rates in a study involving over 200 GP surgeries. The technology sends data to the cloud for AI analysis, providing almost instant results. Experts believe this innovation could be a "real game-changer" for early diagnosis and treatment, with plans for a wider rollout across the UK.</p>

          <p>Macon Blair's remake of the 1984 cult film "The Toxic Avenger" stars Peter Dinklage as a janitor who transforms into a mutant antihero after being exposed to chemical waste. This updated version is described as a well-made and diverting homage that, unlike the Troma original, features appealing stars like Kevin Bacon and Elijah Wood and a more polished production. While it retains the gratuitous gore and goofy parody of the original, its environmental message is more overt, with a villainous pharmaceutical company serving as the primary antagonist. The review suggests it's an enjoyable, if less transgressive, take on the source material.</p>
