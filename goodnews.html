          <p>Los Angeles Dodgers star Shohei Ohtani demonstrated his continued recovery on the mound by pitching two scoreless innings against the Kansas City Royals. During the outing, he threw the fastest pitch of his major league career, a four-seam fastball clocked at 101.7 miles per hour. Despite his strong pitching performance, Ohtani went hitless in four at-bats, and the Dodgers' five-game winning streak was snapped in a 9-5 loss. Ohtani expressed satisfaction with his ability to attack the strike zone aggressively in his third start since returning from elbow surgery.</p>

          <p>France has enacted a new smoking ban that covers public beaches, parks, and areas near schools and libraries, aiming to protect children from passive smoking and move towards a 'tobacco-free generation' by 2032. The rules, which went into effect Sunday, impose fines for violations but do not apply to e-cigarettes or the terraces of bars and restaurants. Health officials state that passive smoking kills thousands annually and that over 30% of French adults still smoke. This measure is the latest in a series of anti-smoking efforts, including high taxes on cigarettes.</p>

          <p>Major cities across the United States, including New York and San Francisco, are holding large-scale Pride parades, marking the culmination of a month of celebrations with a notably more defiant and political tone. Organizers and participants are responding to recent political efforts to roll back LGBTQ+ rights, particularly those targeting transgender individuals, and a pullback in corporate sponsorships. This year's themes, such as 'Rise Up: Pride in Protest' in New York, reflect a shift from pure celebration to a renewed emphasis on resistance. The events commemorate the 1969 Stonewall uprising, the catalyst for the modern LGBTQ+ rights movement.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Collagen supplements are gaining popularity for their purported benefits to joint health, but scientific evidence supporting these claims remains limited. While Type II collagen is a crucial component of joint cartilage, which deteriorates with age, research has not definitively proven that supplements can effectively rebuild it. Orthopedic surgeon Dr. Sean Peden notes that while there is theoretical promise, more robust studies are needed before doctors can confidently recommend them. The article emphasizes that proven methods for supporting joint health include maintaining a healthy weight, regular exercise, and consuming a protein-rich diet.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>The UK government has announced a new partnership with major supermarkets and food manufacturers to encourage healthier eating and combat rising obesity rates. Under the plan, retailers will voluntarily take steps such as offering promotions on healthy items, adjusting loyalty point systems, or reformulating products to be healthier. While the government will not impose specific targets, companies will report on their healthy food sales to increase accountability. The initiative is part of a broader health strategy aimed at reducing pressure on the NHS, as obesity-related illnesses continue to rise, particularly in deprived areas. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>Following a lackluster performance at the Paris Olympics, Japan's national swimming team is implementing a new strategy to prepare for the 2028 Los Angeles Games. Athletes are living together in a 'virtual athletes' village' during competitions to simulate the unfamiliar and challenging environments of an Olympic Games. The initiative aims to build resilience and team unity by having swimmers face logistical challenges, like bus travel and shared living quarters, without it affecting their performance. Officials and athletes reported the initial trial was a success, fostering a stronger sense of motivation and teamwork ahead of upcoming world championships.</p>

          <p>A new pilot program in Kent primary schools is teaching children as young as five about sun safety to help reduce future cases of melanoma, the most serious form of skin cancer. The lessons, which cover topics like reading UV indexes and applying sunscreen, are planned for a nationwide rollout in 2026. Experts emphasize that sunburn in childhood significantly increases adult skin cancer risk, and with melanoma diagnoses projected to rise, preventative education is crucial. The initiative, led by the Melanoma Fund charity, aims to instill lifelong healthy habits and empower children to take responsibility for their own skin protection.</p>

The rocket, which lifted off from Tanegashima Island, deployed a government satellite designed to monitor greenhouse gases and climate change. Developed by Mitsubishi Heavy Industries and JAXA, the H2A series has had a 98 percent success rate and has been instrumental in Japan's space exploration efforts. The program is now succeeded by the lower-cost H3 rocket, which is intended to make Japan more competitive in the global satellite-launch market.</p>

          <p>An estimated 100,000 to 200,000 people participated in the Budapest Pride march, turning the event into a major demonstration of support for human rights in defiance of Prime Minister Viktor Orban's government. The government had attempted to ban the march, citing a controversial 'child protection' law that equates homosexuality with pedophilia. However, Budapest's mayor, Gergely Karacsony, facilitated the event, which drew a significantly larger crowd than in previous years. Many participants stated they were motivated to attend specifically because of the government's opposition, transforming the march into a broad protest against Orban's increasingly authoritarian rule.</p>
