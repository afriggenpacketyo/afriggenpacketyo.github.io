          <p>Tom Aspinall of Manchester has been upgraded to the undisputed heavyweight champion after Jon Jones officially announced his retirement from UFC. Dana White confirmed the decision after a UFC Fight Night in Azerbaijan, ending seven months of uncertainty in the heavyweight division. Aspinall is now the third Briton to become a UFC champion, having spent 19 months as the interim champion. Jones, considered one of the best mixed martial artists, had previously claimed the heavyweight title in March 2023 but chose not to accept the UFC's offer to fight Aspinall. Aspinall expressed excitement about the heavyweight division's future and is expected to defend his title this summer or early autumn, likely against Ciryl Gane.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>The number of Turkish citizens obtaining German passports has doubled in 2024, making Turkey second only to Syria in the number of citizens naturalizing in Germany. This increase is attributed to Germany's growing attractiveness for Turks seeking opportunities for life, work, and study. Citizenship offers practical advantages, such as avoiding bureaucratic hurdles and gaining political influence. The 2024 citizenship reforms, allowing dual citizenship, have further incentivized Turkish migrants to seek German passports while retaining their Turkish identity and ties. Political repression and economic challenges in Turkey have also contributed to this trend, as individuals seek greater freedoms and economic stability in Germany.</p>

Through Operation Recognition, an Iowa Department of Veterans Affairs program, these veterans were able to finally close that chapter. Snyder shared that he dedicated this honor to his high school friends who did not return from the war, highlighting the significance of this recognition for veterans across the country.</p>

          <p>A Japanese startup, Craif Inc., has developed a urine-based cancer risk screening kit that shows promise in detecting cancer at its earliest stages. The non-invasive "miSignal" test kit can simultaneously assess the risk of up to seven types of cancer by detecting microRNA, a biomarker linked to early cancer biology. Trials in Hokkaido, Japan, successfully identified tumors and precancerous cells among residents, leading to early treatment. The test kit is particularly vital in areas with sparse medical resources, offering a convenient and effective means of early cancer detection.</p>

          <p>Chinese researchers have utilized mathematical analysis to decode the metabolic cycle of yeast, revealing parallels with the ancient Chinese philosophy of yin and yang. Led by Professor Li Lei, the study redefines yeast metabolism into four interconnected phases, mirroring the concept of mutual promotion and restraint in traditional Chinese medicine. The four phases, named 1A, 1B, 2A, and 2B, each reflect a unique metabolic state, similar to the "four symbols" theory in traditional Chinese medicine. This model highlights the balance between passive and active forces, offering new insights into molecular life mechanisms.</p>

          <p>Voting is currently taking place in the Tokyo metropolitan assembly election, which is viewed as a prelude to this summer's House of Councillors race. Prime Minister Shigeru Ishiba's Liberal Democratic Party is striving to maintain its seats despite low approval ratings. Major parties, including Komeito and Tomin First no Kai, are actively using social media and delivering street speeches to appeal to voters. Key issues include support for households facing inflation, political funding scandals, child-rearing policies, and measures to prevent heatstroke.
