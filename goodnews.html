          <p>The UK government is proposing an extension of the ban on bottom trawling, a destructive fishing practice, across English waters to protect marine life. The proposal aims to expand the prohibition from 18,000km2 to 30,000km2 of the UK's offshore protected areas. Environment Secretary Steve Reed emphasized the need for urgent action to prevent irreversible damage to oceans. The announcement comes as a UN Ocean Conference begins in France, with Sir David Attenborough warning against the destructive impact of bottom trawling.</p>
