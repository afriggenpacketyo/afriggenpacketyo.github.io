          <h2>Understanding the Impact of Medical Debt on Credit Scores and Available Solutions</h2>
          <div class="timestamp">2025-06-06 14:21:44 EDT</div>
        </div>
        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>This article explains how medical debt affects credit scores and what individuals can do to manage it. Recent changes in credit reporting rules have eased the burden, with paid medical collections no longer appearing on credit reports and a one-year waiting period before unpaid bills are added. Smaller debts under $500 are excluded entirely. Strategies for managing medical debt include reviewing and negotiating bills, applying for financial assistance from nonprofit hospitals, and considering debt relief programs. Monitoring credit reports regularly for errors is also crucial, as is acting quickly and proactively.</p>
