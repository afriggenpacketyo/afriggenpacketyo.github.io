          <p>A spokesperson for former President Joe Biden has confirmed he is undergoing radiation and hormone therapy as part of his treatment for prostate cancer. The diagnosis was announced in May, with his office noting that although it was an aggressive form, it appeared to be manageable. The 82-year-old former president previously stated the treatment involved taking specific pills for six weeks. He has expressed optimism about his prognosis, stating that he feels good and that the treatment is progressing well.</p>

The firm has been actively increasing its stakes, with holdings in companies like Mitsui and Mitsubishi now exceeding 10%. Buffett has expressed long-term commitment to these investments, which were initially attractive due to what he considered a 'ridiculous price.'

          <p>Plaid Cymru, a political party in Wales, has announced a plan to offer trainee teachers up to £30,000 if the party wins the next Senedd election. The incentive aims to retain teaching staff within Wales, particularly for Welsh-medium instruction and high-demand subjects like math and science. The policy is designed to match similar incentives offered in England by 2030 and would require recipients to work in Wales for five years. The party estimates the plan will cost £6-£7 million, sourced from funds already designated for curriculum support.</p>

          <p>Academy Award-winning actress Julia Roberts recently shared that she struggled with a lack of confidence and cruel criticism early in her career. In an interview, she recalled how being embarrassed or harshly judged could be crippling in her early 20s. However, she chose to view these negative experiences as a challenge to define the person she wanted to become and build endurance. A career coach quoted in the article advises young professionals to distance themselves from harsh feedback, remember their own value, and seek the 'kernel of truth' that might be useful for growth.</p>

          <p>Despite ongoing hunger, true famines have become increasingly rare, a significant achievement of the modern era driven by agricultural advancements. The world is projected to grow more grain this year than ever before, with global production of cereal crops far exceeding current use. This abundance is the result of a 'green revolution' involving better seeds, synthetic fertilizers, and widespread irrigation. While modern famines, like those in Gaza and Sudan, are now primarily caused by political failures and conflict, the overall progress in food production marks a historic success.</p>
