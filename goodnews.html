          <p>The government of the Democratic Republic of Congo and the M23 rebel group have signed a provisional ceasefire agreement, mediated in Qatar. This agreement commits both parties to finalizing a permanent truce and comprehensive peace deal by mid-August. The deal aims to address the long-running conflict in the mineral-rich eastern DRC, which has displaced over seven million people. The terms include refraining from hate propaganda and halting attempts to seize new territory, marking a significant step toward stability in the region.</p>

          <h2>Study Suggests Vegetarians Are More Ambitious, Sparking Debate Over Dietary Stereotypes</h2>
          <div class="timestamp">2025-07-19 07:00:21 EDT</div>
        </div>
        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>A new meta-analysis from a Polish university suggests that vegetarians tend to value power and achievement more than their meat-eating counterparts, who may prioritize security and tradition. The study, which analyzed data from over 3,700 people in the U.S. and Poland, challenges common stereotypes of vegetarians as being solely driven by pro-social values. While some in the vegetarian community found the results affirming, critics argue that such studies oversimplify complex human motivations and that labeling people by their diet is unhelpful. The research concluded that adopting a minority diet may require a strong, non-conformist character.</p>

          <h2>The "Gen Z Stare" Sparks Intergenerational Debate on Social Norms and Communication</h2>
          <div class="timestamp">2025-07-19 07:00:00 EDT</div>
        </div>
        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>A viral TikTok trend describing a "Gen Z stare"—a blank, unresponsive look from younger people in conversation—has ignited a debate across generations. While older generations interpret it as rudeness or a lack of social skills, some experts and Zoomers suggest it may be an unconscious behavior shaped by a life lived online and through the social isolation of the pandemic. Psychologists note that while every generation has faced criticism from its elders, the stare might feel particularly jarring to those accustomed to different social cues. This article explores whether this is a genuine generational shift or just the latest example of older adults complaining about youth.</p>

          <p>The England women's football team is "very optimistic" that captain Leah Williamson will be available for their Euro 2025 semi-final match against Italy. Williamson sustained an ankle injury during the quarter-final victory over Sweden, leaving the pitch in extra time. She was later seen on crutches and wearing a protective boot, which is believed to have been a precautionary measure. Teammate Esme Morgan stated that Williamson was in high spirits, and the team is preparing for all possibilities ahead of the crucial game.</p>

          <p>Two leading UK end-of-life charities, Marie Curie and Hospice UK, are calling for local councils to exempt terminally ill individuals from paying council tax. The campaign follows Manchester City Council's recent decision to become the first authority to implement such a policy, which waives the tax for residents with a prognosis of less than twelve months to live. Advocates argue that this measure provides crucial financial and mental relief for people facing a terminal diagnosis, who often experience a significant loss of income alongside increased costs for care.</p>

          <p>Conservationists have successfully used artificial intelligence to confirm the breeding of the California red-legged frog in Southern California for the first time in 25 years. After a multi-year effort to reintroduce the threatened species using eggs from Mexico, scientists were unsure if the frogs were reproducing. A custom AI model analyzed thousands of hours of audio recordings from the habitat, identifying the distinct mating calls of male frogs. This technological breakthrough provides a crucial sign of success for the complex, international conservation project and a new tool for wildlife biologists.</p>

          <h2>Experts Advise Caution on "High-Protein" Snack Claims Amid Marketing Hype</h2>
          <div class="timestamp">2025-07-19 06:00:00 EDT</div>
        </div>
        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Nutrition experts are urging consumers to be skeptical of the "high-protein" labels found on many snack foods, from chips to candy bars. While protein is an essential nutrient, these marketing claims can be misleading and often mask high sugar content or heavy processing. To assess a snack's true protein value, experts suggest a simple calculation: multiply the grams of protein by four, then divide by the total calories to find the percentage of calories from protein. They recommend aiming for snacks where protein accounts for 30% or more of the calories, and prioritizing whole foods like Greek yogurt or nuts.</p>

The first collection of these new recordings, titled "20 Years of Five Finger Death Punch — Best of Volume 1," has just been released.

          <p>Coffee giant Nescafé is strategically targeting Gen Z by expanding its presence in the cold coffee market, which now accounts for a third of out-of-home coffee consumption. Recognizing that younger consumers often prefer iced drinks, the Nestlé-owned brand is launching products like Espresso Concentrate, designed for customizable, at-home cold coffee creations. This move is part of a broader strategy to reposition Nescafé for all-day consumption and appeal to a generation that is also reportedly drinking less alcohol. The company sees this as a major growth opportunity to bring a new generation into the brand.</p>
