          <p>University of North Carolina football players have dismissed suggestions that head coach Bill Belichick's high-profile romance with Jordon Hudson is a distraction for the team. Players noted that Hudson is rarely seen at the team's facilities and that any "noise" is confined to social media, not impacting their focus on the upcoming season. Belichick himself described the media attention on his personal life as something he is accustomed to from his time with the Patriots.</p>

          <p>Desmond Watson, an undrafted rookie defensive tackle for the Tampa Bay Buccaneers noted for being the heaviest player in the NFL, has been placed on the non-football injury list. Coach Todd Bowles stated the decision was related to Watson's weight and the team's desire to help him become a healthier player. The 6-foot-6 player is reportedly working with a team nutritionist, but the team has not set a specific target weight or a timetable for his return to the field.</p>

          <p>President Trump has signed an executive order aimed at creating new federal rules for name, image, and likeness (NIL) deals and revenue sharing in college sports. The order seeks to ban "pay-for-play" payments while preserving brand endorsements and directing that revenue-sharing arrangements protect non-revenue and women's sports. It also directs the National Labor Relations Board to clarify the employment status of student-athletes, addressing a system the White House called "out-of-control." The NCAA responded by stating it appreciates the administration's focus on the issue.</p>

          <p>The Roman Catholic Archdiocese of Los Angeles has initiated a Family Assistance Program to deliver food, groceries, and medicine to immigrant families fearful of ongoing ICE enforcement raids. The program builds on existing parish networks to support community members who are afraid to leave their homes for work or essential errands. Archbishop José Gomez stated the effort aims to help "good, hard-working" people, with local businesses and leaders already contributing significant donations to the fund.</p>

          <p>Several prominent Democrats, including Rahm Emanuel, Pete Buttigieg, and Gavin Newsom, are increasing their public visibility with appearances on a diverse range of podcasts and media outlets. This activity is being interpreted as the unofficial start of the 2028 presidential primary campaign, signaling a strategic shift to reach a broader audience beyond traditional liberal platforms. Analysts note these potential candidates are also adjusting their rhetoric, sometimes taking more centrist or critical stances on their own party's past messaging.</p>

          <p>CNBC's Jim Cramer suggests that major technology firms like Meta, Amazon, and Alphabet are not overspending but are actually underspending on artificial intelligence development. He posits that the AI sector is a "winner-take-all" market where significant investment is crucial for securing a dominant position, similar to Google's rise in search. Citing Alphabet's recent strong earnings and increased capital expenditures for AI infrastructure, Cramer argues that the spending is justified and necessary to create the most accurate and profitable AI systems.

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>An analytical article examines the reasons why the full Jeffrey Epstein investigation files were not released during the Biden presidency, despite their potential political implications for Donald Trump. The piece explains that legal barriers, particularly the secrecy of grand jury testimony, would have made a unilateral release nearly impossible without court approval. Furthermore, appearing in the files does not inherently imply wrongdoing, and releasing vast amounts of unverified information falls outside of normal government protocol, making it a legally and ethically complex challenge for any administration.</p>

Adamolekun stated that the company actively reads online comments and reacts quickly, such as adding spicier flavor options within a week of seeing customer requests, to better align its offerings with consumer desires.</p>
