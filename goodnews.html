          <p>This article explores how learning new languages physically alters the brain and enhances cognitive abilities. Neuroscientists explain that language learning reshapes neural pathways, improving memory, attention, and cognitive control. A German study on Syrian refugees found that brain activity changed as they became proficient in German. While multilingualism improves cognitive skills, it's unclear if it equates to higher intelligence. The article emphasizes that learning languages opens new cultural experiences, regardless of cognitive skill enhancements.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Scientists have developed a potentially universal antivenom using antibodies from the blood of Tim Friede, who has been intentionally bitten by numerous species of deadly snakes over 18 years. Researchers isolated antibodies from Friede’s blood that reacted with neurotoxins found in 19 of the world’s deadliest snakes. The resulting antivenom, tested on mice, was protective against venom from black mambas, king cobras, and other dangerous snakes. This research could lead to a more broadly effective antivenom that can be administered in rural settings.</p>
